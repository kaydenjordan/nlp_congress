 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from New York  (Mr. Zeldin), for his important leadership and his voice on this very  critical issue and for being a stalwart defender of the rock-solid  alliance between the American people and the State of Israel, and the  important relationship that represents; Israel, of course, being an  island of moderation in a very dark and dangerous part of the world.   When the United States is asked to make foreign policy decisions, it  is my view and it is Congressman Zeldin's view that we should stand  with our allies. We should stand with Israel. We should not stand with  our enemies. We should not stand with the mullahs in Tehran. But,  instead, we should stand with our ally who always opposed this  dangerous Iran nuclear deal.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of President Trump's decision to  withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, also known as the Joint  Comprehensive Plan of Action, and I agree with the President's  assessment that the Iran deal gave too many benefits to Iran for too  little in return.   I also want to thank my colleague and friend French Hill, who also  serves with Congressman Zeldin and myself on the House Financial  Services Committee, where the three of us have an important  responsibility to the American people, our constituents, and our  allies, and that is oversight of the Department of the Treasury's  implementation and enforcement of sanctions.   More than 4 years ago, the Obama administration reached this flawed  nuclear deal with Iran. Since then, the destabilizing role that this  rogue regime has played in the Middle East has not waned, but, instead,  it has grown. Despite all the concessions to Iran, the Iranian  leadership continues to lead mobs of supporters chanting ``death to  America'' and ``death to Israel,'' and promises to wipe Israel off the  face of the planet.   The leadership in Tehran continues to pose a range of threats to the  national security of the United States and the security of our allies  in the region and beyond. As many observers have noted, the regime in  Tehran does not see itself as leading a country focused on security and  prosperity within its borders, but, instead, leading a revolution that  it seeks to expand at the expense of its neighbors and the United  States and it is allies.   Iran continues to represent the number one state sponsor of terrorism  in the world. Iran has received significant sanctions relief under the  Obama administration's flawed nuclear deal. The regime is selling oil  on the international market. It has received access to tens of billions  of dollars in funds held abroad, and it has signed deals worth more  than $100 billion in foreign investments.   This includes, as the gentleman from Arkansas pointed out, $1.8  billion in cash that the Obama administration gave to Iran up front  under the previous administration's false narrative that this agreement  would help make the Middle East more stable and a safer place.   Yet, Iran continues to destabilize the Middle East and undermine U.S.  foreign policy. The regime's Revolutionary Guard Corps and its  terrorist proxy, Hezbollah, continue to prop up the murderous Assad  regime in Syria and fuel tension across the region. Hezbollah has  stockpiled tens of thousands of advanced rockets in Lebanon, allowing  it to strike targets throughout Israel, and this is after the  consummation of the Iran nuclear deal.   At home, the regime continues to deny the Iranian people basic human  rights, while detaining several Americans. Iran's so-called moderate  president, Hassan Rouhani, gave the order to ``expedite'' the  production of intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of striking  the United States while presiding over the most executions in 25 years.   There is, according to the defenders of the JCPOA, a false narrative  that they perpetuate, and the media is complicit. The false narrative  being that Iran is in compliance with the deal, and this is despite  reports that Iran continues trying to illicitly procure nuclear  equipment from Germany after the deal was reached. The Obama  administration subsidized Iran's nuclear program by purchasing heavy  water, a chemical used to make weapons-grade plutonium.    Furthermore, we know that this deal, by its own architecture, was not  designed to ensure compliance, because there is no effective  verification procedure embedded in the deal.   Under the current JCPOA, the United Nations International Atomic  Energy Agency inspectors are not even allowed to check Iranian military  sites, the sites that are most likely to be the places where Iran  houses and conducts its nuclear testing. A comprehensive, no-notice  inspection regime must be put into place in any future agreement, which  President Trump has ensured would be part of his better alternative.   Ballistic missiles: In addition, Iran continues to develop and test  ballistic missiles that threaten Israel and the United States.  According to joint intelligence reports, Iran has launched well over 23  ballistic missiles since the signing of the JCPOA. Far from lessening  the threat, the Iran nuclear deal emboldened Iran to continue to  violate U.N. Security Council resolutions, specifically, a blatant  disregard of U.N. Security Council Resolution 2231 that formally  approved the Iran nuclear deal.                                time  2000    Specifically, that resolution called on Iran to not undertake any  activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of  delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic  missile technology.   Ballistic missiles, Mr. Speaker, are the most reliable way to deliver  nuclear warheads, and no country has maintained an expensive missile  program without also aspiring to possess nuclear weapons.   The leadership in Iran in negotiating this agreement professed a  commitment to civilian nuclear power.   Why then continue to develop ballistic missiles, Mr. Speaker, if you  are committed to only peaceful nuclear power?   As former Secretary of Defense Ash Carter testified to Congress in  2016, President Obama's own Defense Secretary: The I in ICBM stands for  intercontinental, which means having the capability to fly from Iran to  the United States.   Intercontinental ballistic missiles, as our friend, Prime Minister  Netanyahu, pointed out, are not designed for Tel Aviv. Those missiles  are designed for Los Angeles, New York, Atlanta, and Chicago.   Support for Hezbollah hasn't waned since the Iran nuclear deal was  consummated, since it was signed. Iran is and continues to be the  largest state sponsor of terrorism, and current estimates indicate that  Iran provides Hezbollah approximately $800 million annually. According  to the State Department, Iran provides the majority of financial  support for Hezbollah and Lebanon and has trained thousands of  terrorist group fighters at camps in Iran.   Regrettably, this deal that provided billions of dollars in sanctions  relief and billions of dollars in hard currency to the rogue regime in  Tehran is fueling Iranian support for Hezbollah.   In addition to fighters, Hezbollah is believed to possess over  100,000 missiles. It has been reported that Iran has built weapons  factories for Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, providing the ability to  produce destructive munitions on its own near Israel. It has sent  fighters to Syria on behalf of the Assad regime and helped train and  develop Shiite militias furthering Iranian interests in Iraq and Yemen.  [[Page H6035]]    This combat experience in Syria and Iraq is particularly alarming as  Hezbollah now has thousands of experienced fighters at its disposal who  can be redeployed to other conflicts in the future. The Iran nuclear  deal has fueled this export of terrorism.   Finally, reports indicate that Iran civilian airlines also  participate in the conflict by flying arms and fighters to Syria from  Iran and other locations in the Middle East. We have heard directly  testimony in our committee as the House Financial Services Committee  has conducted searching oversight over the implementation of the Iran  nuclear deal that, in fact, this agreement has facilitated and fueled  civilian airlines being used to send arms and fighters to support the  murderous Assad regime.   Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, I joined my colleagues here tonight not  opposed to diplomacy and not opposed to any Iran nuclear deal. In fact,  all of us would like to see a peaceful denuclearization of Iran. We  would like democracy and freedom for the people of Iran. We stand with  the people in Iran. We are not against any agreement.   We simply stand against a bad nuclear deal that is not verifiable,  that doesn't prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, but instead  paves the way for Iran to have a nuclear arsenal. We stand opposed to a  bad nuclear deal that threatens our allies, that threatens Israel, and  that threatens the American people.   We believe that the President can and will negotiate a better deal  for America, and it is incumbent upon Congress to help this  administration access the leverage it needs to achieve that objective  and to support his vision to help hold Iran accountable to the United  States and our allies.   What would this agreement entail?   Why would a new agreement be better than the current JCPOA?   It would remove all of the flawed sunset provisions; it would require  Iran to suspend any support of terrorist proxies; it would require Iran  to permanently and irreversibly end its ballistic missile program; and  it would include much better verification that would allow  international inspectors access to all sites, including sites that are  most likely to contain illicit nuclear activity.   Mr. Speaker, once again, I am proud to stand with the ally of the  United States, Israel, and stand against our enemy, the mullahs in  Tehran.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Zeldin) again  for his outstanding leadership and his passionate voice in defense of  American national security and in defense of Israel and our other  allies.
