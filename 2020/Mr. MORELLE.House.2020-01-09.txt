 Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished chair and my  colleague from the Rules Committee, Mr. McGovern, for yielding me this  minute.   We begin the new year in turbulent and uncertain times, particularly  with regard to Iran and the Middle East. Protecting our national  interests and securing the safety and security of the American people  must be the highest priorities of our government. I am gravely  concerned the recent actions of the Trump administration have  destabilized the region and undermined those priorities.   Article I of the United States Constitution vests in the House and  Senate the responsibility to declare war, to appropriate money for the  national defense, and, in doing so, to ensure no President employs  military action without careful consultation of and authorization by  Congress.   That is why it is so important that we take action to reaffirm these  responsibilities by passing the resolution before us, which I am proud  to cosponsor.   The use of United States Armed Forces to engage in hostilities  against Iran must come only after thoughtful deliberation and approval  by Congress. As we move forward, we must all seek to achieve a peaceful  resolution that protects American interests at home and abroad.   I join with all Americans in praying for the safety of our courageous  servicemembers and urge my colleagues to support this rule and the  underlying resolution.
