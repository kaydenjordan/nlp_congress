 Mr. Speaker, eight lives were lost in Georgia this week when  a gunman targeted three Asian-owned businesses. Six of these victims  were Asian-American women.   I am heartbroken for all these lost souls, and I am heartbroken  because this is just one of the latest in a string of attacks that have  created fear throughout the Asian-American community.   Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, there have been over  3,800 reported anti-Asian hate crimes and incidents. What started off  as dirty looks and verbal assault has escalated into physical attacks  that have become increasingly deadly.   There was Vicha Ratanapakdee, an 84-year old man who died after being  assaulted outside of his home, and Noel Quintana, whose face was  slashed from ear to ear on a New York subway.   These attacks have been almost a daily tragedy, and they must stop.  We must stand united against xenophobia and slurs like ``China virus''  and ``Kung flu,'' which we know put lives at risk, and we must work  together to stop Asian hate.                            ____________________
