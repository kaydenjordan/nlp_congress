 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, first, let me welcome you and all of my  colleagues back from another productive State work period. I traveled a  good deal around my State, spoke at a bunch of graduations, and found  it fun and productive. I learned a lot. I am glad to be back but glad  we were out in our States.
