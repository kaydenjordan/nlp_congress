 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 717, line 24, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(increased by $1)(decreased by $1)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Foster) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment highlights the need to think  about our future workforce and how it will change because of technology  and to encourage the Bureau of Labor Statistics to accept a wider and  more forward-looking range of inputs into its range of projections for  its workforce of the future.   I co-chair the New Democrat Coalition Future of Work Task Force with  my colleagues, Congressman Seth Moulton and Congressman Jared Polis.  Congressman Jim Himes, the chair of the New Dem Coalition, has been  active in the task force work and joins me in cosponsoring this  amendment today.   Over the course of several months, the task force has held a series  of forums to hear from experts on various areas that will require this  body's attention in the coming years and decades. We have heard from  historians, economists, and policy experts about how technological  revolutions of the past have impacted social and political institutions  and how lessons from those experiences and from current conditions can  help us prepare for the future.   We have also heard from labor and business leaders who are pioneering  the way they attract talent, retain their services, and develop skills  for the increasingly rapidly change economy. It is nearly unanimous  among our experts that the economy will change significantly and change  faster, but it is less clear just how quickly the workforce will need  to adapt.   For decades, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has been doing excellent  and invaluable work to track our labor trends, and its projections have  been proven very reliable and useful--to business and to our  educators--in times of slower and relatively predictable technological  development.   However, they are based on historical data and historical trends, and  some of the anticipated changes in technology--such as robotics, self- driving vehicles, and artificial intelligence--could fundamentally  change our economy in ways that haven't been seen before. So, in its  current form, the way the Bureau calculates and estimates future  development of the workforce may not be able to capture the dramatic  changes that our future holds.   One panel convened by the task force suggested that it would be  impossible to do projections in any single way to predict the  workforce, but that, with additional resources, the Bureau of Labor  Statistics could model for a variety of scenarios of different rates of  technological change in different areas.   My amendment increases the BLS account by a dollar and decreases it  by a dollar, and I intend it to mean that the BLS should submit to  Congress an estimate of the resources it would need to make a range of  forward-looking estimates, including consultation with those industries  that are driving this rapid technological change and those that will be  affected by that change to account for the increasing rate of  technological job displacement.   It is hard to estimate by backward-looking extrapolations how the  changes from self-driving cars and vehicles or artificial intelligence  will affect the real jobs of the future.   Technological changes in the workforce are not new. The industrial  revolution and the automation of agriculture transformed the way work  was performed in our country and significantly improved, on the whole,  our standard of living over time.                                time  1745    The results have not been uniform for all communities and all  populations. Those transformations typically played out over  generations, so our social and political institutions had ample time to  respond. But today, development and deployment of technology is far  more rapid, and Congress, business, and our educational system need the  best possible data to evaluate policy proposals and to produce the  workforce training needed for future employees and to develop  educational curricula to ensure that our economy works for everyone.   Like in the industrial revolution, technological development presents  the opportunity for a greatly improved standard of living, but it will  also bring challenges to our workforce. Businesses, communities, and  the government must work together.   Additional considerations in the projections made by the BLS will  help Congress to anticipate these changes and to weigh proposed  solutions. Objective projections based on empirical evidence are  crucial to a debate that will be based on our different views of the  role of government and its relationship with market forces. Those are  the differences that should shape our ideas for helping Americans enjoy  prosperous and full lives in the future.   I urge my colleagues to join me and vote ``yes'' on my amendment to  begin to establish a range of scenarios for the Bureau of Labor  Statistics and the future world that we will inhabit.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Foster).   The amendment was agreed to.                    Amendment No. 141 Offered by Ms. Meng    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 141  printed in House Report 115-297.
