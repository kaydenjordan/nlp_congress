 Mr. Speaker, like all of us, I watched with horror as our  Capitol was overrun on January 6 by those seeking to overturn a free  and fair election.   As a 20-year Navy veteran, I swore an oath multiple times throughout  my career to support and defend our Constitution against all enemies,  foreign and domestic. As Members of Congress, we swear the same oath,  and we swear this oath, not as a member of a political party, but as  Americans. There is no carve-out for political expediency.   I implore every Member of this body to uphold their oath and vote in  support of this bipartisan commission. The American people deserve to  understand exactly what happened that day in January.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues not to turn this into a partisan  litmus test, not to pit Republican against Democrat, and not to  perpetuate the big lie. Finding the truth should not be controversial  or a question of partisanship.   This is about our shared future, the future of this Congress, and the  future of democracy. We must do this together, and I urge an ``aye''  vote.
