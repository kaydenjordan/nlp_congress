 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Larry N. Olinger, Vice  Chairman of the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians, a dedicated,  inspiring leader who passed away July 15, 2019, at the age of 80.   Vice Chairman Olinger grew up in Palm Springs and, later, in Orange  County, where he spent many years breeding and racing horses.   From a young age, Vice Chairman Olinger was drawn to enacting  positive change in his community through public service.   Vice Chairman Olinger was first elected to Tribal Council in 1961,  where he began his 60-year career. He went on to serve in every  position on Tribal Council, including secretary, treasurer, chairman,  and eventually vice chairman in 2012.   As the first chairman of the Agua Caliente Development Authority,  Olinger championed gaming as a Tribal business enterprise, stimulating  economic growth and strengthening Tribal sovereignty.   His leadership also spanned from the Native American Rights Fund to  the State of California and the Coachella Valley Mountains Conservancy,  where he advocated for the protection of our communities' natural and  cultural resources.   Our communities have lost a great man and generational leader in Vice  Chairman Olinger's passing. His passion, class, and concern for the  well-being of others, including his Tribe and our surrounding  communities, was admirable.   I have always admired Chairman Olinger's strong character and  lifelong commitment to learning; and I will deeply miss his caring  nature and dry sense of humor.   Vice Chairman Olinger often called his ``proudest achievement'' his  marriage to his wife, Susan.   Susan, my heart goes out to you and the entire Olinger family.   I also send my heartfelt condolences to the Agua Caliente Band of  Cahuilla Indians.   We will miss Vice Chairman Olinger deeply; but we can honor his  legacy by loving our neighbors, caring for the Earth, and protecting  and respecting the rich culture and sovereignty of Tribal communities.                                time  1030                         Honoring Jesus Rivera Osuna     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Jesus Rivera Osuna, a  soft-spoken, true family man, who passed away on June 28, 2019, at the  age of 74.   Mr. Osuna is the father of my childhood best friend, Oscar Osuna. I  spent so much time at the Osuna home that they became my second family,  and Mr. Osuna always made me feel welcome and part of the family.   I remember his patience, humility, and loving and calming nature. He  was also a kind, stable, and secure male role model in our rough-and- tumble impoverished community.   Mr. Osuna was a hardworking man and ran his own business for 50  years, toiling in the hot desert Sun to repair air-conditioning units  in the Coachella Valley community.   He was also a great guitar player. I would listen in amazement to Mr.  Osuna play classical guitar alone in his room after a long day at work.  He was always so humble. He would stop playing if he noticed anybody  nearby, so I would quietly listen from Oscar's room in awe of his  talent.   Mr. Osuna married his high school sweetheart, Mary Lou, at 24 years  old, and together they raised four children, my second family brothers  and sisters--Elvia, Sergio, Oscar, and Lila--three nephews, and  supported Mr. Osuna's mother. Mr. and Mrs. Osuna's family has grown to  include four grandchildren.   Even in his final days, Mr. Osuna refused to be a burden to his  family as he battled the illness that ultimately took his life.   To the Osuna family, I love you, and your dad's story is engraved in  my heart and now recorded in our Nation's history.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule for H.R. 3239,  the Humanitarian Standards for Individuals in CBP Custody Act, my  legislation to ensure CBP upholds basic standards to meet the  humanitarian needs of children, women, and families.   My bill is an American-values-based, basic public health approach to  prevent the deaths of children under CBP's custody and responsibility,  and to develop a professional, humane response to the humanitarian  challenges at our border.   Why are these humanitarian standards needed, you might ask?   Because when I visited the border, I saw open toilets in crowded  cells without privacy, and babies who were dirty and didn't have  diapers sleeping on cold cement floors; because these inhumane and  unsanitary conditions threaten the mental and physical health of CBP  agents; and because six children have now died in the custody and  responsibility of CBP.   To address this crisis, we need to do more than send money to an  administration that has urged, in court, that children in CBP custody  do not need soap and toothbrushes for basic hygiene needs.    Passing this rule is the first step to ensure CBP  facilities have basic necessities like humane sleeping conditions,  private and clean bathrooms, sufficient water and nutrition, and  showers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my fellow representatives to support my bill, the  Humanitarian Standards for Individuals in CBP Custody Act, to protect  the health of our agents, prevent the deaths of children, and restore  humanity to our treatment of children and families seeking asylum.    Mr. Chair, I thank Chair Lofgren for her leadership on  addressing the humanitarian crisis at our border.   I rise in support of H.R. 3239, the Humanitarian Standards for  Individuals in Customs and Border Protection Custody Act.   My legislation is meant to prevent children from dying at the border,  and promote a professional, humane way to treat children and families  under the custody, and therefore, the responsibility of CBP. But before  I explain my bill's American-values-based, humanitarian, public health  approach, I want to refute a few myths.   First, the myth that this bill costs too much.   My bill will not raise the deficit one penny and does not require any  increase in mandatory spending. Instead, it provides the blueprint for  how CBP should us its current budget and the $4.6 billion in emergency  funding we recently passed to address the humanitarian crisis.    Second, the myth that my bill will make it more difficult for CBP to  prevent human trafficking.   My bill specifically allows for CBP to separate a child from an adult  if `` . . . such an arrangement poses safety or security concerns . . .  '', such as in instances of suspected human trafficking.   Furthermore, my bill requires CBP personnel to receive training on  indicators of child sexual exploitation and abuse.   Third, the myth that my bill requires medical specialists onsite at  all times.   That is simply not true. It is simply false.   My bill only requires a licensed health provider like a nurse, a  physician assistant, an EMT, or paramedic to conduct health screenings,  and it empowers CBP to call an emergency care provider to help with  emergency triage decisions. That is it. And those emergency care  providers can include those specialists, but it doesn't require them,  all of them, to be on call at all times or to be onsite.   Finally, the myth that my bill is too cumbersome for CBP and will  distract agents from safety and security concerns.   One, CBP agents want the assistance in my bill because it provides  them with humanitarian and health assistance to free up their time to  focus on safety and security issues; therefore, my bill will make our  country safer.   And, two--look, I was an early responder after the Haiti earthquake  and medical director for the largest internally-displaced camp in  Haiti.   If nonprofits can meet the humanitarian standards in this bill in the  worst circumstances in the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere,  then we can meet them in the greatest country known to man.   So here is what my bill actually does. It creates a simple health  triage system and basic humanitarian public health standards.   It ensures that every individual in CBP custody receives a health  screening to triage for acute conditions and high-risk vulnerability,  something that is easy to do. And, no, you don't need a full physical  exam. You are just triaging. You need vital signs and a cursory  physical exam. In fact, for most people, it would take less than 5  minutes to perform.   It ensures that every individual in CBP custody receives a health  screening to triage for acute conditions and high-risk vulnerabilities  so people don't die under the responsibility of CBP.   It ensures that an emergency care provider is on call to pick up the  phone and help make triage decisions for life-threatening medical  emergencies. That is it. That is all we are asking for.  [[Page H7338]]    My bill also prioritizes high-risk populations, the most vulnerable  to severe illnesses and dying, to receive a health screening within 6  hours, including children, pregnant women, and the elderly.   My bill requires very basic and necessary things like toothbrushes  and diapers.   It includes nutrition standards to make sure that infants have  formula and babies have baby food. How hard is that?   In terms of shelter, my bill will ensure that people are no longer  packed and piled on top of each other; that the temperature is not too  cold, weakening a child's immune system; and that toddlers don't have  to sleep on a cold concrete floor.   Finally, my bill addresses the challenges of surge capacity, adds  training, and requires reporting.   The straightforward reforms in my bill are essential to protecting  the health and safety of agents and the children and families in their  custody.   Let me repeat myself. Let me reiterate. This is not just for asylum- seeking children and families. This bill will help CBP agents.    Mr. Chair, it will empower CBP to meet the basic provisions  for human dignity.   Mr. Chair, I sincerely urge my fellow representatives to listen to  their better angels, do the right thing, and vote for H.R. 3239, the  Humanitarian Standards for Individuals in CBP Custody Act, to prevent  another child from dying in the custody of CBP and to promote a  professional, humane approach to addressing the humanitarian challenges  at our border and create the basic conditions for human dignity.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the MTR.    Mr. Speaker, my bill, the Humanitarian Standards for  Individuals in CBP Custody Act, honors CBP agents by giving them the  assistance they have requested and so desperately need.   This bill gives them the tools to help protect kids and families.   You see, Mr. Speaker, this bill isn't about political trickery. It is  not about partisan gotcha politics.   This bill is about the goodness of the American people. This bill is  a call to our better angels. This bill, and I say this wholeheartedly,  is inspired through prayer and by God's loving grace.   You see, it asks us to remember and heed the words of Jesus in the  good news book of Matthew: ``For I was hungry, and you gave me  something to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave me something to drink. I  was a stranger, and you welcomed me in'', and, ``Truly I tell you,  whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of  mine, you did for me.''   This bill asks us to fulfill the Golden Rule: ``Do unto others as you  would have them do unto you.''   These principles, you see, are fundamental to our American values.  They are shared by the CBP agents and doctors I spoke with at the  border.   This bill protects children, women, and families by setting  humanitarian standards that require basic health screenings and triage,  formula for infants, diapers for toddlers, and simple necessities like  toothbrushes and soap.   This bill also protects the health of our agents, proud Americans who  work tirelessly in dangerous and inhumane conditions, who are also  parents and suffer lifelong trauma when someone else's child dies under  their responsibilities.   Today, I stand before you not only as a public health professional  and an emergency medicine physician trained in humanitarian aid, I  stand before you as a parent of two young daughters. I stand before you  as a patriot, whose faith in our American values, in the power of basic  human decency, has never been stronger.   Tonight's vote isn't about politics, it isn't about party, it isn't  even about immigration policy.   This vote is about the beauty and power of grace. This vote is about  loving and protecting children, because in the United States of  America, we recognize the inherent dignity of every human being,  because in the United States of America, every child is worth saving,  because in the United States of America, when children die on our  watch, we take action.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the MTR, then  vote ``yes'' for Humanitarian Standards for Individuals Under CBP  Custody.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
