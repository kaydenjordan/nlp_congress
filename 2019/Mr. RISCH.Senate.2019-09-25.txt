 Reserving the right to object.    Mr. President, first of all, let me say I concur with the  good Senator from New Jersey that we should follow regular order.   He, like myself, has spent decades of service in a legislative body,  and we both know this system works when the committee system works.   Every legislative body is set up with a committee system. Now, why is  that? One of the reasons is because people develop an expertise in a  certain lane, and they can use that expertise on the committee.   Most importantly, the issues regarding a bill--whether it is good or  bad or whether it should be amended or whatever should happen to it--is  best handled in the committee system, where people have an expertise in  the area that the bill goes to.   This bill goes to the Foreign Relations Committee, which I chair-- which my good friend from New Jersey previously chaired--and it will be  handled in the regular order by that committee, but it is a bad way to  do a piece of legislation to draw it, drop it, and then come to the  floor and try to pass it unanimously.   This piece of legislation was brought to the committee yesterday, and  it is a piece of legislation that certainly deserves consideration but  not this way.   I have not had a chance to even read it, let alone study it, and that  is true of virtually every Member of the majority party. I frankly  don't know whether the other members of the committee who serve in the  minority party have had an opportunity to read it or to study it or,  for that matter, to prepare amendments to it to make it better and to  move it along.   So given that, the committee system is really important here. I don't  want  [[Page S5690]]  to really go into the merits of all this. A lot of it is being debated  out in the hallway right now with the national media and that sort of  thing.   Look, what has happened over the last few days here is really a  poster child for what has happened to the entire Trump Presidency. A  fair amount--not all but a fair amount--of the national media and a  fair amount of the minority party here have done everything they can to  delegitimize this President, not the least of which is taking anything  that comes along and attaching to it some nefarious idea, some  nefarious purpose.   Let me give you an example. My good friend said: What happened to  standing up to Russia? This administration has imposed more sanctions  on Russia than the entire 8 years of the previous administration. So  what has happened to standing up to Russia? We continue to stand up to  Russia.   I think my friend from New Jersey and I would be able to agree on the  many sins Russia has committed starting way back, but if you go with  fairly recent history, their invasion of Georgia and then their promise  to back off and to get out of Georgia--they still occupy two of the  regions in Georgia.   Of course, the invasion and takeover of the Crimea, their cause of  problems on the eastern border of Ukraine, their interference in  Ukraine, their interference in our elections, their interference in all  kinds of European elections, and it goes on and on, poisoning people in  London--I mean, that is about as far out as you can possibly get.   So we all need to stand together. We all need to stand up to Russia,  and this administration has been doing it. They are going to continue  to do it. I think virtually everybody here is urging them to do it, and  we are going to continue to do it.   Look, the argument that there was some significant delay in moving  funds to Ukraine is simply not well-taken, and the reasons for it, with  all due respect to my friend, I think, are well known.   In fact, if you read the transcript of this telephone conversation,  the President himself raises the important issue that he has raised  with all of us from time to time, and that is that any time he sees the  United States getting on the short end of the stick with whatever you  talk to him about, it raises an alarm with him.   In this particular case, he has been very distressed by the fact that  we have been carrying the bulk of the dollars and cents for helping  Ukraine. We want to help Ukraine.   Senator Menendez, I think, very clearly laid out many of the problems  that have to do with Ukraine. The country has serious problems, not the  least of which is corruption, but the first reason he had issues with  the spending was the fact that Europe just simply is not doing what  they should be doing in helping to fund this, and that is clearly laid  out in this transcript.   The second thing is the corruption itself. When money goes into  Ukraine, it is a well-known fact that there is tremendous corruption  and graft within the country and a lot of the money disappears.   The most notorious institution within the country is the gas  company--interestingly enough, the gas company board on which Vice  President Biden's son sat and was appointed to and has received $50,000  a month to sit on after the Vice President was tasked by President  Obama to look into the corruption and do something about the corruption  in Ukraine.   In any event, corruption is a big problem and funds get diverted.   I am just going to close by saying, look, every American that is  interested in this talking that is going on back and forth about this  call that the President had with President Zelensky should look at that  transcript and read it. It will take just a few minutes to read it, and  it will not take long to figure out that the mischaracterization of  this is off the wall.   It is absolutely amazing to me that people would take this  conversation, which was a standard, ordinary, regular conversation that  a head of state has with another head of state, and characterize it the  way it is being characterized.   It was a congratulatory call. There was a lot of banter in it. My  good friend knows--he has met with a lot of heads of state, as I have.  Sometimes we even meet together with heads of state. It is common to  have bipartisan meetings with heads of state.   I don't know whether people think these things are scripted and that  they are focused directly on issues, but there is always a lot of  banter. The banter can be in the form of having conversations about  family. It can be talking about sports. Frequently, if one of the teams  has done well or poorly, one party or the other will raise it and talk  about it. These things are very informal, as this phone conversation  was.   In my experience, one of the frequent issues that is discussed in  these conversations is local politics--what is happening in your  country, what is happening in my country--and then also a discussion of  mutual issues with friendly countries or, for that matter, countries  that are not friendly.   This call that the transcript was released on is very, very rare. If  you are looking for a window to see what actually happens in these  calls, this transcript is a really good characterization of what  happens in these calls.   It is not a good thing to be releasing these calls. I think heads of  state should be able to have these conversations--all of us should be  able to have conversations with our counterparts, with a head of state,  with Ministers in the other countries without having to be thinking  about every word we say is going to wind up being analyzed and pulled  apart and taken by your political enemies and badly misrepresented.   Look, don't take my word for it. Don't take Senator Menendez's word  for it. The transcript is all over the internet right now. It is going  to be published in every newspaper probably in America tomorrow. It  takes just a few minutes to read it. Read it and take away for yourself  the feelings you have about it.   The President of the United States is tasked with being the frontline  of foreign policy. Yes, foreign policy is shared by both the first and  second branch. It is one of those things the Founding Fathers did not  resolve 100 percent for one branch or the other, such as appointments  for the second branch or such as appropriating for the first branch.   There is sufficient authority given to each branch of government, but  the head of state, in this case, the President of the United States, is  tasked with carrying on these relationships with other countries.   This phone conversation that he had is clearly, clearly, part of  that. Don't take my word for it. Everybody make up your own mind on  this. It isn't rocket science. As you can see, the English is very  straightforward. It can be understood. I think everybody will come away  with their own belief.   If people hate Trump, they are going to look at that and say that  this is terrible, as a lot of people in this town have done. I think  most ordinary, good, straight-thinking Americans are going to look at  this and say: What is the big deal? It was a conversation between two  people talking about various issues they were interested in, and it  isn't a problem.   In any event, in order to preserve the regular order, in order to  preserve the jurisdiction and the hard work of the Foreign Relations  Committee, Mr. President, I object.    Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.      Hon. James E. Risch,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations, U.S. Senate,           Washington, DC.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION    Qatar--Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures (LAIRCM) System for                           Head-of-State Aircraft         The Government of Qatar has requested to buy two AN/AAQ-      24(V)N Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures (LAIRCM)       systems to protect two (2) 747-800 Head-of-State aircraft.       This proposed sale will include: twelve (12) Guardian Laser       Turret Assemblies (GLTA) (6 installed, 6 spares); seven (7)       LAIRCM System Processor Replacements (LSPR) (2 installed 5       spares); twenty-three (23) Missile Warning Sensors (MWS) (10       installed, 13 spares); Control Indicator Unit Replacements       (CIURs); Smart Card Assemblies (SCAs); High Capacity Cards       (HCCs); User Data Memory (UDM) cards; initial spares;       consumables; repair and return support; support equipment;       engineering design; integration; hardware integration; flight       test and certifications; selective availability anti-spoofing       modules (SAASM); publications and technical documentation;       training and training equipment; field service       representatives; U.S. Government and contractor engineering,       technical, and logistics support; and other related elements       of logistics and program support. The estimated cost is $86       million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security of the United States by helping to improve       the security of a friendly country that continues to be an       important force for political and economic progress in the       Middle East. Qatar is host to the U.S. Central Command forces       and serves as a critical forward-deployed location in the       region.        The proposed sale will improve Qatar's capability to deter       regional threats. The self-protection suite will facilitate a       more robust capability into areas of increased missile       threats. Qatar will have no difficulty absorbing this       equipment and capability into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The prime contractor will be Northrop Grumman, Rolling       Meadows, IL. There are no known offset agreements proposed in       connection with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale may require the       assignment of a U.S. Government and/or contractor       representatives to Qatar to provide the field service support       as requested.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.  [[Page S5702]]                                 Transmittal No. 19-47       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The AN/AAQ-24(V)N LAIRCM is a self-contained, directed       energy countermeasures system designed to protect aircraft       from infrared-guided surface-to-air missiles. The system       features digital technology and micro-miniature solid-state       electronics. The system operates in all conditions, detecting       incoming missiles and jamming infrared-seeker equipped       missiles with aimed bursts of laser energy. The LAIRCM system       consists of multiple Missile Warning Sensors, Guardian Laser       Turret Assembly (GLTA), LAIRCM System Processor Replacement       (LSPR), Control Indicator Unit Replacement (CIUR), and a       classified User Data Memory (UDM) card containing the laser       jam codes. The UDM card is loaded into the LSPR prior to       flight; when not in use, the UDM card is removed from the       LSRP and put in secure storage. The Missile Warning Sensors       (MWS) for AN/AAQ-24(V)N are mounted on the aircraft exterior       to provide omni-directional protection. The MWS detects the       rocket plume of missiles and sends appropriate data signals       to the LSPR for processing. The LSPR analyzes the data from       each sensor and automatically deploys the appropriate       countermeasure via the GLTA. The CIUR displays the incoming       threat for the pilot to take appropriate action. The LSPR       also contains Built-in-Test (BIT) circuitry. LAIRCM hardware       is CLASSIFIED only when a classified UDM card is inserted       into the system and it is powered up. LAIRCM system software,       including Operational Flight Program and jam codes, are       classified SECRET. Technical data and documentation to be       provided is UNCLASSIFIED.        2. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        3. A determination has been made that Qatar can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        4. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal are authorized for release and export to the       Government of Qatar.                            ____________________     Mr. President, for the Committee on Foreign Relations I  report favorably the following nomination list which was printed in the  Record on the date indicated, and ask unanimous consent, to save the  expense of reprinting on the Executive Calendar that this nomination  lie at the Secretary's desk for the information of Senators.
