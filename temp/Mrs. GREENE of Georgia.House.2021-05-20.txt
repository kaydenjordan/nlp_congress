 Mr. Speaker, I would like to address the two- track justice system here in the United States.   If you are part of the Democrat-sponsored and Democrat terrorist  organizations BLM and Antifa, then you can burn down American cities  for an entire year, get bailed out of jail, and face no investigation  or commission from Congress.   Meanwhile, Mr. Speaker, if you are a Trump supporter who happened to  be at the Capitol on January 6, then you face exorbitant bail, solitary  confinement, abuse of jail guards, and no due process.   This is an outrage. Just today, just this week, Congress told all of  the American citizens that Congress cares more about Congress than the  American people. After all, we have witnessed American cities all over  our country be victims to violent riots by domestic terrorists all over  this country.   The people have endured this. Businesses have been destroyed.  Violence has happened. Police officers, night after night, have been  abused and have had to endure these violent riots and attacks, on and  on.   Yet this institution has been focused on itself and focused on  investigating January 6, even though there are many investigations  already happening here through the Senate and the House committees.  There have already been over 445 people arrested from January 6. There  are also more than 100 to be arrested soon. There is justice happening  for the riot here at the Capitol on January 6.   Republicans and Democrats, together, are against the violence and the  riot that happened here in the Capitol on January 6, but the problem  lies with this: Republicans and Democrats are not together on the  violence that has happened to the people all over this country  throughout the past year.   That is why Congress is only concerned with itself and not about the  American people.                                time  1415    Rioters did a horrific and jaw-dropping amount of damage to cities  across America. During 2020, there was up to $2 billion in damage due  to the riots that swept the Nation, the most expensive in insurance  history.   By the way, that is not a $2 billion bailout fund coming from the  government. That is not a taxpayer-funded check. That is private money.  That is private money that insurance companies are having to pay  because domestic terrorists rioted.   The damage done to Federal buildings has been incredibly costly. BLM  rioters in Nashville set a Federal courthouse on fire. The destruction  is estimated to have cost $1.2 million in damages. This is a  courthouse. Why were those involved attacking and setting fire to this  courthouse not called insurrectionists? It is a question that needs to  be asked.   Rioters in Portland destroyed barriers and attempted to burn down  government buildings, costing $1.6 million in damage to the Federal  courthouse downtown. Why is this not called an insurrection? And,  again, why is Congress not concerned with creating a commission for  this type of damage and the people who caused this attack?   In Guilford County, North Carolina, a courthouse was broken into and  set on fire, resulting in roughly $200,000 in damages. Again, it is a  courthouse. Why is that not called an insurrection? And there is not a  government bailout and a commission in place to investigate these  things.   Los Angeles, Oakland, Louisville, and Dakota City also had damage to  Federal buildings. These cities are not  [[Page H2644]]  being named. Members of Congress are not demanding a commission to  investigate the damages happening to the Federal buildings in these  cities. No one is being called insurrectionists for the damage that is  done to these Federal buildings.   As a matter of fact, most of the time, if you watch the news, they  are called peaceful protesters. These are not peaceful protests. These  are violent domestic acts of terror, and this is exactly how they  should be viewed, and this is how they should be handled.   The looting, burning, and destruction across America have cost cities  millions and millions of dollars. Riots caused an estimated $55 million  in damages in Minneapolis alone. Minneapolis city officials estimate  700 buildings were damaged, burned or destroyed, including, in one  estimation, 360 local businesses. But I have an article right here that  contains a list of 1,500 businesses that were damaged or destroyed-- 1,500 businesses.   Mr. Speaker, it is these businesses and these business owners that  pay the taxes that fund everything that we do here. These people should  matter. Their businesses should matter. Why is there not a commission  investigating this? Why doesn't Congress care about these people and  their businesses?   Rioters in Portland set up an autonomous zone that ultimately cost  the city $2.3 million in damages--an autonomous zone. What is an  autonomous zone, and how can people take over part of a city, an  American city, and say that it is theirs, and that they control it, and  that no government authority can come in and enforce the law, enforce  law and order in this part of the city?   Yet, this is what happened with peaceful protesters in Portland. They  created an autonomous zone, costing the taxpayers of Portland $2.3  million in damages. Again, that was not a bailout fund. Those are  people's actual dollars, private citizens' dollars.   Riots in New York are estimated to have cost the city $115 million.  One Friday night alone cost the city $100,000 and resulted in the  arrest of 150 rioters. That was just in one night, the arrest of 150  rioters. It is unbelievable.   Riots in Salt Lake City cost at least $100,000 in damages.   Riots in Wichita, Kansas, cost the police department nearly $1.5  million in overtime because they had to work. They had to show up for  another shift when they were exhausted from working the shift before.  So, they had to be paid overtime because they were overrun with  rioters.   Riots in Denver cost the city at least $5.5 million in damages and  overtime.   This is unbelievable, when there are antifa, BLM rioters, domestic  terrorists causing so much violence and damage in a city that these  cities and police departments are having to call their police officers  back in after working their shifts, their long hours: No, I am sorry.  You can't go home to your family. I am sorry, you can't go home and do  things that you need to do in your regular life. We need you to come  in. We need you to come back and work overtime because our city is  overrun with violence.   Yet, here the United States Congress, the 117th Congress, has no  interest in launching a commission to investigate, to stop these  incredibly organized and well-funded organizations of terror across  American cities and the country that are causing private citizens,  businesses, insurance companies, cities, counties, and States so much  money that all comes from American citizens and taxpayers.   Money is not created right here in Congress. This is not a facility.  This is not an institution that creates revenue. The only revenue that  Congress operates on is the American people's tax dollars that they  have to pay right here to the Federal Government. Congress needs to  learn to put the people first and not itself.   Riots in Baltimore cost the city an estimated $26 million--again,  taxpayer dollars, privacy citizens' dollars.   Riots in Kansas City resulted in $2.1 million in damages, most over  the course of just one weekend. That is some kind of party, isn't it,  where antifa and BLM terrorists can go out and just riot in violence  and rage in one weekend, costing a city $2.1 million?   Rioters in Kenosha, Wisconsin, injured police officers and set at  least two city trucks on fire. Altogether, the destruction cost the  city $50 million. Does anyone understand what $50 million is? That is  an exorbitant amount of money in damages for people who were angry and  think that it is okay to riot and destroy other people's property,  other people's businesses, and tear down a community. There is no  excuse for that.    Here we have California, where they closed down all of its State  buildings in downtown areas, saying staff should not report to work for  any reason. That sounds like some kind of Third World country where you  have California closing down all of its State buildings in downtown  areas saying that your staff should not report to work for any reason.  Why? Because it is too dangerous for you.   Yet, this Congress is so concerned with spending an unknown amount of  money on a January 6 commission when there are already multiple  investigations underway. There have already been 445 arrests made, 100  more to take place. Yet, this Congress is not concerned about all the  violence and the organizations that caused all of this to the point  where California has to say: Don't come to work. It is dangerous.   Look at this. It is unreal. This is our country. The police officers  who defend Americans paid a great price as well, just like the Capitol  Police officers here in the Capitol did. The police officers all over  the country in American cities, it didn't just happen to them on one  day for part of the day. It happened to them night after night, day  after day, continuously.   In some cities, for a short time, weeks, but in some cities, it was  months and months, and it still continues. The Major Cities Chiefs  Association found that between May 25 and July 31, there were 8,700  protests nationwide. How many was there on January 6? One.   Nearly 600 of those protests were declared riots with violence and  criminal acts, and 2,385 looting incidents were reported. Six hundred  of them were declared violent riots, 2,385 looting incidents. Again,  how many times did that happen here at the Capitol? We will go with one  riot.   But this Congress is more interested in spending an unknown amount of  money to investigate one riot here because this Congress seems to only  care about itself and not the American people.   Three-quarters of law enforcement agencies reported officers harmed  during the protests--three-quarters of law enforcement agencies. Why  don't we hear about them over and over on the news? Does no one care  about those police officers' lives? Apparently not. This Congress  obviously doesn't.   More than 624 arsons were reported, and at least 97 police vehicles  were burned. That cost a lot of money. Again, do you know whose money  that is? It is the taxpayers' dollars. The taxpayers did nothing wrong  to deserve these riots in their cities, and the police officers that  did a good job and do a good job every day don't deserve it either-- just because of the actions of a few bad apples.   The MCCA reported that over 2,000 law enforcement officers were  injured in these 9 weeks alone. That is why I introduced H.R. 2446 to  award police all over the country who defended American cities. They  deserve medals because no one is acknowledging what they have gone  through, night after night, day after day, with what CNN calls peaceful  protests. I don't think so.   Meanwhile, BLM and antifa domestic terrorists are bailed out and  supported by our now-Vice President Kamala Harris. George Floyd died on  May 25 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. As you see here, on June 1, we have  then-Senator Kamala Harris and then-Vice Presidential candidate for the  United States sharing, tweeting, a link to the Minnesota Freedom Fund  encouraging people, if you are able, chip in now. Chip in now. Send  some more money to the Minnesota Freedom Fund to help post bail for  those protesting on the ground in Minnesota.   But we know what was going on. These were not protests. These were  violent riots. I am sorry, you can't stand in front of a city on fire  and people fighting and say it is a protest. It is a riot, and it is  not peaceful.  [[Page H2645]]    In fact, Kamala Harris, and unfortunately, my own colleague from  Minneapolis, Ilhan Omar, have shared links to the Minnesota Freedom  Fund with their millions of Twitter followers. And it raised a lot of  money for the Minnesota Freedom Fund. In August, the Minnesota Freedom  Fund reported that it had raised $35 million in donations.   Yes, when the Democratic candidate for the Vice President of the  United States says donate to the Minnesota Freedom Fund, people  donated. When the Congresswoman from Minneapolis, Minnesota, shared on  her Twitter to millions of followers and pointed down, meaning follow  suit, donate, guess what? They raised $35 million.                                time  1430    And guess what happened from that. As a result of all the money  raised by then-Senator Kamala Harris and then the Democrat Vice  Presidential candidate of the United States, now our current Vice  President, and current Congresswoman from Minneapolis, Minnesota, 184  domestic terrorist criminals that rioted were bailed out from the  Minnesota Freedom Fund.   The criminals they helped bail out include a woman who shot at the  SWAT team; another woman, who was accused of killing her own friend;  and a convicted rapist. That is just a few of the people that were  bailed out with the money raised directly for the Minnesota Freedom  Fund by then-Senator Kamala Harris and Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, shared  on their own Twitter pages.   Can you imagine if a Republican Congresswoman or Congressman or a  Republican Senator or a Republican President shared a bail bond link  and said: ``Bail out the protestors from January 6''? Can you imagine  the result of that? It would be unreal.   There has been no backlash, there has been no consequences, there has  been no action taken from this irresponsibility, supporting domestic  terrorists who are responsible for violence, crime, and costing the  innocent American people an exorbitant amount of money, stress, ruining  communities, ruining people's livelihoods, and tearing apart our  country. No accountability whatsoever.   These Democrat lawmakers have also voted for defunding police  departments across the country. So while they also raised money for  domestic terrorists, who committed crimes, to be bailed out of jail, at  the same time they legislate and vote to defund police.   H.R. 1280, that they voted for and passed, removed qualified  immunity. That means police officers can be sued if someone is upset  with them for their actions on the job.   Police officers don't make a lot of money. They can't afford big  attorney bills. It will ruin them, just because someone may get their  feelings hurt because they got arrested.   H.R. 1280 also will allow police officers to be put on a list. That  means whether it is proven or unproven, someone can accuse a police  officer of doing some sort of wrong, and their name and information  gets put on a public list that the Department of Justice will manage on  a website that is open to anyone that wants to look it up. Founded or  unfounded, their actions, no matter if it is true or not, their name  goes on this list and what they are being accused of. This is what  these people voted for to do to police officers and remove a lot of  their funding.   After the LAPD was defunded by $150 million, Vice President Harris  said: ``I applaud Eric Garcetti for doing what he has done.''   As a result of the funding cuts, the LAPD dissolved its sexual  assault unit. Defunding the LAPD where they have to get rid of the  sexual assault unit? That is unbelievable. That means women, children,  any victim of sexual assault--I am sorry, there is not a unit there  anymore to help them, because they have been defunded.   As a result of this defunding, Vice President Harris applauds Eric  Garcetti for doing what he has done, there has been a 73 percent spike  in shootings in LA. When you defund the police, ladies and gentlemen,  there are direct consequences. That means crime goes up.   There has also been a 200 percent higher murder rate than last year  at the same time. If you don't fund law enforcement, you are funding  criminals. Clearly, we can see this is what some of these Democrat  lawmakers have done; they have clearly funded criminals and defunded  the police.   Back to Minneapolis and the riots there.   Notice that this date, 11/4/20, that is not too long ago, encouraging  donations. There is no excuse for that. November 4, 2020, by that date,  we had seen plenty of violence and damage all over the streets. There  was no way to call those riots peaceful protests. We know exactly what  they are: domestic acts of terror.   In Congresswoman Ilhan Omar's district, 700 buildings were damaged,  burned, or destroyed. Who owns those buildings? Mostly private  citizens.   1,500 businesses. Here is the list. It is reported from the Star  Tribune from Minneapolis, for the Twin Cities. 1,500 privately owned  businesses heavily damaged, two destroyed, mostly completely destroyed.   The problem with Congress is, Congress does not get up early every  single day, go into its business and have to earn the money that keeps  it going. Congress does not have to work so hard, lose sleep at night,  to figure out how to earn the money to keep the doors open to their  business. Congress does not have to lose sleep at night when things get  rough, like when the Government shuts down the economy because of a  Chinese virus and tells businesses that they cannot keep their doors  open and sell their goods and services, that they cannot earn a living.  You see, Congress doesn't understand how hard it is to figure out how  to keep paying your employees when that happens to you.   Congress doesn't understand or seem to care about doing a commission  for the people that pay the taxes to keep the lights on in this  building, to care about them and why they were violently attacked. No,  Congress only cares about itself and why it was attacked on January 6,  even though there are multiple investigations going on, even though  there has been 445 people arrested and 100 people more arrested.   And justice should be served for those that committed violence here  at the Capitol on January 6, but Congress doesn't care about the  American people who have suffered this entire year, and it is  despicable.   The human cost of a year of riots and violence is 25 American lives  lost. That has been estimated. Twenty-five Americans are dead as a  direct result of BLM and antifa terrorism that has swept our Nation.   I will go ahead and tell you about one.   This little girl's name is Secoriea Turner. Secoriea Turner was  killed at a Wendy's in Atlanta, because there were riots going on.  Secoriea Turner's mother was pulling in the Wendy's, turning around,  trying to go the right way, when gunshots were fired that took Secoriea  Turner's life. She was 8 years old. This little girl was 8 years old  and was murdered during a riot.    There is not a commission being launched in here for her life. There  is also not a commission being launched for the life of David Dorn, a  great man, a retired police officer who was murdered during domestic  terrorists, BLM, riots. Why does Congress not care about David Dorn?  Why does Congress not care about Secoriea Turner?   Despite all of this damage, there is no investigation into domestic  terrorism from Congress. We have no commission launched to investigate  the funding of antifa. There is no investigation into the funding of  BLM. There is no commission set forward for the past year of violent  riots. But all they care about is a commission for the one riot here on  January 6.   The accused on January 6 have been abused behind bars; they have been  denied due process rights; they are still being held in jail. Michael  Sherwin, an attorney for D.C., bragged that they had rounded up 400  people who participated in the breach of the Capitol on January 6. He  said he wanted to charge as many people as possible.   What kind of justice system do we have if officials are eager to  charge as many people as possible, but they don't care about antifa  domestic terrorists and they don't care about the people in those  riots?   The Biden administration has taken investigators who typically work  on cases involving drug trafficking and  [[Page H2646]]  child pornography and assigned them to calling relatives, even ex- girlfriends, of the January 6 accused in an attempt to find them  guilty.   Please put them back on drug trafficking and child pornography. These  departments are being defunded anyway.   One person accused faces 7 years in prison for walking through the  open doors of the Capitol, taking photos in the hallway, and leaving  without doing any harm.   Even the mainstream media outlets have reported on D.C. jail guards  cruelly beating Trump supporters. One man was beaten so badly he has a  skull fracture and is now blind in one eye. You don't hardly hear  anything about that on the news.   Months after January 6, men and women are still being held in jail,  and they haven't seen their day in court. Justice should be served for  January 6, but this Congress needs to care about the people of the  United States who have not seen justice for the riots of the past year.  This Congress is failing the American people.   Not only are we a Nation nearly in $30 trillion in debt, but we have  a Congress that could care less about law and order in the United  States   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
