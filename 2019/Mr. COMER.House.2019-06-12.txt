 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment and its  circumventing of the administration's ability to conduct the rulemaking  process. This amendment would deny OSHA the ability to finalize its  proposed rule which is aimed at correcting the previous  administration's failure to produce a targeted final rule that  reflected input from stakeholders.   OSHA's current proposed rule is necessary to aid in clarifying  standards for the shipyard and construction industries. Further delay  would unnecessarily burden these businesses and create continued  significant compliance costs that we cannot know the full scope of  today because proper analysis was never conducted during the rulemaking  process of the previous administration.   In order for a tailored, adequately prescriptive rule to emerge, OSHA  must be able to deliver an updated standard that responds to the input  of the hardworking individuals in these sectors.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this  amendment.
