 Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague, the senior  Senator from Vermont, in introducing the Runaway and Homeless Youth and  Trafficking Prevention Act of 2022. This bill would update and  reauthorize the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act programs, which have  provided lifesaving services and housing for America's homeless youth  for nearly half a century.   Homelessness is affecting youth in truly staggering numbers.  According to the National Network for Youth, an estimated 4.2 million  young people experience homelessness at some point each year. Some of  these youth may be away from home for a few nights, while others have  been living on the streets for years. No area of this country is immune  from the scourge of homelessness, as it impacts rural and urban  communities alike.   Tragically, runaway and homeless youth are at high risk of  victimization, abuse, criminal activity, and even death. This  population is at greater risk of suicide, unintended pregnancy, and  substance abuse. Many are unable to continue with school and are more  likely to enter our juvenile criminal justice system. The reality is  that available data likely underestimate the scale and consequences of  this problem.   I have met with teachers, social workers, and others from Maine who  work directly with young people experiencing homelessness. We talked  about the pressure that student homelessness places on teachers, school  administrators, and their already strapped resources, and--most  important--the homeless students themselves. I have also visited New  Beginnings in Lewiston, where I saw firsthand how Runaway and Homeless  Youth Act resources are providing essential safety nets for young  people in need. The staff at New Beginnings helps young people with  case management, provides referrals to State and local agencies,  assists with housing needs and access to shelter, and connects  individuals to local educational and employment programs.   Several years ago, as the chair of the Senate Transportation and  Housing Appropriations Subcommittee, I held a hearing that featured  testimony from Brittany Dixon, a former homeless youth from Auburn, ME,  who gave powerful testimony on her personal experience with  homelessness. After becoming homeless, Brittany was connected with New  Beginnings. In her testimony, she said, ``New Beginnings provided many  resources I could use to succeed, including assistance with college  applications and financial aid. . . . New Beginnings has helped me to  develop critical life skills and to become self-sufficient.''  ``Programs that support homeless youth are important to  [[Page S4915]]  so many young people like me,'' she added. ``It gives young people the  chance to have a safe place to stay while they get their footing and  figure out what they want to do in their lives.''   Runaway and Homeless Youth Act programs helped make Brittany's  success story possible. Sadly, however, there are still many homeless  youth who do not have the support they need. We must build on our past  efforts because homeless youth should have the same opportunities to  succeed as their peers.   The three existing Runaway and Homeless Youth Act programs--the Basic  Center Program, the Street Outreach Program, and the Transitional  Living Program--help community-based organizations reach young people  when they need support the most. These programs help runaway and  homeless youth avoid the juvenile justice system, and early  intervention can help them escape victimization and trafficking.   The Runaway and Homeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act would  reauthorize and strengthen these programs that help homeless youth meet  their immediate needs, and it would help secure long-term residential  services for those who cannot be safely reunited with their families.  Our legislation would also create a new program--the Prevention  Services Program--designed to help prevent youth from running away and  becoming homeless in the first place. Moreover, our bill supports  wraparound services for victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation.   Mr. President, the Runaway and Homeless Youth and Trafficking  Prevention Act will support those young people who run away, are forced  out of their homes, or are disconnected from their families. A caring  and safe place to sleep, eat, grow, study, and develop is critical for  all young people. The programs reauthorized and modernized through this  legislation help extend those basic services to the most vulnerable  youth in our communities.   I thank Senator Leahy for his leadership on this bill and urge my  colleagues to support it.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague, the senior  Senator from Vermont, in introducing the Runaway and Homeless Youth and  Trafficking Prevention Act of 2022.
