 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for hosting  this Special Order hour tonight.   Mr. Speaker, when I ran for Congress, I ran on gun violence  prevention. That was 10 years ago, and I am running just as hard today.   I always ask just who or how many have to be killed before we really  do something about this public health crisis.   According to a recent study by professors from Harvard and Cambridge,  by the age of 40, half of Chicago residents have seen someone shot.  Just seeing someone shot is known to cause trauma and PTSD that impacts  your ability to lead a happy, healthy life. Our communities deserve  better.   Mr. Speaker, 56 percent of Black and Hispanic residents under 40  witnessed a shooting, compared to 25 percent of White residents under  40. Black Chicago residents are more than three times more likely to be  shot than White residents. Mr. Speaker, 176 victims have been killed in  Chicago in 2023.    Just this weekend alone, 4 people were killed and 22 were wounded  because of gun violence in Chicago. This past weekend, a 27-year-old  man was shot while putting groceries in his car.   Hours later, a Chicago police officer was fatally shot as she arrived  home from work early Saturday. She was 24. Instead of graduating with  her master's next week, it will be her funeral.   The next day, a 25-year-old man was killed in a drive-by shooting.   Among the 22 wounded in the past weekend was a 15-year-old boy who  was shot in the leg and rushed to the hospital.   In the last month around the country, a young lady was shot and  killed while turning into a driveway, something we have all done. A boy  was shot because he knocked on the wrong door while looking for his  siblings. We have  [[Page H2165]]  all knocked on the wrong door from time to time. A dad and a little  girl were shot because the basketball they were playing with rolled  into a neighbor's yard.   Mr. Speaker, two cheerleaders were shot because they went to the  wrong car--something I know I have done before--and the guy jumped out  and shot the cheerleaders.   Is this the kind of country we want to survive in? I will tell you,  this is not living.                                time  2110    We have got to do more. My colleagues have named the various things  that we can do, and I work in a very bipartisan way. But I tell you,  Mr. Speaker, Republicans have blood on their hands. It is just amazing  to me that in these 10 years they have turned a blind eye. They talk  about the Second Amendment. Many of us have told them we believe in the  Second Amendment, but we also believe that people have the right to go  to the park, to go to the store, to go to school, to ride the city bus,  to come out of band practice, and to come out of choir practice.   What about those rights for those people?   Think about it.   Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Kelly  for her remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Allred).
