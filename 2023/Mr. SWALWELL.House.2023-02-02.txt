 Madam Speaker, when I heard that we are going to remove  a Member of this House from their committee for anti-Semitism, I raced  down here because I thought, finally--finally--in this Chamber there is  going to be some accountability, some accountability from this  Conference that continues to allow its members to root for rioters, to  show sympathy for the insurrection, a Conference that harbors a wanted  international criminal and has members who choose violence over voting  every single day. Finally.   I thought that if we were going to hold someone accountable for anti- Semitism, surely it is the author of this tweet: ``Kanye. Elon.  Trump.'' October 6, written by Chairman   Jim Jordan.   October 8, what does Kanye say? That he is going to declare ``death  con 3'' on the Jews.   So, surely, this tweet came down, that it was deleted? No. Two more  months it was kept up.   Don't come here looking at us for anti-Semitism. Look in your own  damn mirror before you ever come over here.
