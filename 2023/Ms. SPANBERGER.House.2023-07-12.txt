 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  legacy of Dr. George M. Hampton.   Dr. Hampton passed away late last month at the age of 95, and I was  honored to have met this stalwart Virginia leader.   In the days since his passing, I have heard directly from many in the  Prince William County community about his outsized role in standing up  for fair political representation. I have heard about his service as a  mentor to the next generation of leaders, and the community has  celebrated what a dedicated man he was in his professional and personal  life to the service of others in his community.   Dr. Hampton truly lived his values, one of which was education. He  received his bachelor of science degree from North Carolina A&T  University, a master of science degree from Virginia State University,  and a doctorate of arts in education from the University of Central  Arizona.   Dr. Hampton then dedicated himself to educating the next generation  as an adjunct professor of psychology at the Far East Division of the  University of Maryland, as well as an adjunct professor of human  relations at Pepperdine University.   Dr. Hampton also valued service to country. He served for more than  two decades in the United States Army, fulfilling various command and  staff assignments and spending 4 years as an assistant professor of  military science at Virginia State University. He was awarded the  Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star, and the Army Commendation Medal  during his military service. He retired from the Army in 1971 as a  lieutenant colonel.   Following his retirement from the military, Dr. Hampton held many  positions that allowed him to have a hand in shaping future leaders,  both within and outside of military service. One such role was as  codirector of the Marine Corps Leadership and Human Relations Institute  in San Diego, California, where he helped train leadership instructors  for the formal schools at Quantico, in Virginia's Seventh District, and  other major installations.   Throughout decades of service to the Commonwealth of Virginia, Dr.  Hampton was appointed by both Democrats and Republicans to hold various  notable positions. In 1982, Governor Charles Robb appointed him to the  Virginia Parole Board. Reappointed by Governor Gerald Baliles, he  served on this board until 1990. In 1995, Governor George Allen  appointed him to a 4-year term on the State Board of Elections, where  he served as vice chairman until January 1999.   In July 2003, then-Governor Mark Warner appointed him as a member of  the Board of Visitors at Virginia State University, where he served  until July 2007. He was also a member of the Virginia State University  Foundation.   Dr. Hampton was appointed to serve on the Juvenile and Domestic  Relations Court Citizens Advisory Council, as well as the Prince  William County representative to the Board of Directors of Northern  Virginia Community College.   As a 47-year resident of Prince William County, Dr. Hampton played an  active role in his community. He was a proud founding member of the Pi  Lambda Lambda Chapter of the Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc. For 7  years, from 1975 to 1982, Dr. Hampton served as the political adviser  to the Prince William County branch of the NAACP.   Dr. Hampton was a member of the Disabled American Veterans  organization, Veterans of Foreign Wars, The American Legion, Military  Officers Association of America, and the Fellowship Club of Prince  William County.    The impact Dr. Hampton had on his community is clear, leading him to  become the namesake of the George M. Hampton Foundation. Sponsored by  the Pi Lambda Lambda Chapter, Inc., and founded on the idea of helping  those in need throughout Prince William County and surrounding  communities, the foundation provides thousands of dollars in  scholarships to local high school students each year.   On top of decades of committed service of his own, one of his  greatest attributes was his desire to recognize the service of others.  He was one of the originators of the Prince William County Walk of  Fame, the permanent granite plaques recognizing the accomplishments of  high-profile community servants across the county.   I have been proud to join in celebrating his legacy as a pioneer of  remembering Black history and culture in Prince William County and  across the Commonwealth.   For years, long before we recognized Juneteenth as a Federal holiday,  Dr. Hampton celebrated the holiday in his own backyard, and I was  overjoyed to have the opportunity to celebrate Juneteenth with him last  year.   Perhaps one of his proudest accomplishments was that he served as a  living inspiration and role model to Virginia students attending the  school in Dale City named in his honor.   Dr. Hampton met with students of George M. Hampton Middle School  regularly. He shared his stories, his memories, and historic moments of  his life in Virginia. He offered them encouragement, in addition to  raising funds for the school.   Madam Speaker, please join me in remembering Dr. Hampton.                            ____________________
