 Madam Speaker, 1 week ago, the President incited an  insurrection against Congress to prevent the peaceful transition of  power. It was the most dangerous moment for our democracy in a century.   Today, we invoke the remedy the Founders provided for just such a  lawless President: impeachment.   More important, today, we begin the long road to restoration. America  has been through a civil war, world wars, a Great Depression,  pandemics, McCarthyism, and now a Trumpist and white nationalist  insurrection. And yet our democracy endures. It endures because, at  every juncture, every pivotal moment when evil threatened to overtake  good, patriotic Americans stepped forward to say, ``Enough.''   This is one of those moments. To preserve this sacred place, this  citadel of democracy, for ourselves and for posterity, let us say,  ``Enough.'' Enough.
