 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, over the past several days, the American  people have had a chance to participate in the Supreme Court nomination  process by watching Judge Neil Gorsuch, judge of the Tenth Circuit  Court of Appeals, based in Denver, take questions from the Judiciary  Committee. For several days now, there have been hearings, with the  Judiciary Committee's meeting 12 hours yesterday or so and, the day  before, there being a number of speeches from every member of the  Judiciary Committee. I and Senator Bennet, my colleague from Colorado,  had the great privilege of introducing Judge Gorsuch on Monday to the  Senate Judiciary Committee.   I think what people across the country are seeing in this  confirmation process is a judge who has a keen grasp of the law, a  judge who understands the limits of power that are placed on the  judicial branch, understands the role of the executive branch,  understands the role of the legislative branch, and how he as a judge  is supposed to rule when it comes to checking that balance of power.   We also see, of course, after 12 hours of questioning--everything  from the kind of temperament he has to the kinds of decisions he would  make--that he is an even-tempered individual who would serve this  country well. So I come to the floor again to talk about my support for  Judge Gorsuch.   Eleven years ago, this Chamber unanimously confirmed Judge Gorsuch  through a voice vote for his position in 2006 on the Tenth Circuit  Court. Judge Gorsuch has been described as a ``brilliant legal mind''  by the Denver Post and both liberal and conservative attorneys in  Denver. He is a mainstream jurist who has the right temperament and the  right view of judging in order to be on the Supreme Court, according to  the Denver Post.   Moreover, Judge Gorsuch is a faithful and ardent defender of our  Constitution, a judge who has, time and again, shown a fidelity to the  separation of powers and the limited role of government that was  envisioned and prescribed by our Founders.   It is no wonder that Judge Gorsuch has always enjoyed overwhelming  bipartisan support. In fact, 12 of our current Senate colleagues,  including minority leader Senator Schumer and  [[Page S1906]]  Senators Leahy, Feinstein, and Durbin, all of whom are on the Judiciary  Committee, were in office in 2006 when Judge Gorsuch was unanimously  confirmed to the Tenth Circuit. None of them opposed his confirmation-- none of them.   Perhaps the best question for them today would be: Do you regret that  decision 11 years ago? Did you not do enough work to know the nominee  then?   When Senator Graham held his committee hearing 11 years ago--the  confirmation process--no one else showed up. It was an empty dais. If  you tuned in to watch C-SPAN on Monday or Tuesday, you saw a different  level of participation from the Judiciary Committee. What a difference  a court makes. So I hope this process is one that will be shown to be  fair to the American people--this process of getting to know Judge  Gorsuch's temperament and his legal philosophy, but not 1 of the 12  Democratic Members who are here today and who were here in 2006 voted  against him in 2006.    The approval of Judge Gorsuch was also in addition to a few other  colleagues who have since left. We were joined at that time--Judge  Gorsuch was supported at that time by then-Senator Barack Obama, by  then-Senator Joe Biden, by then-Senator Hillary Clinton, and, at that  point, by Senator John Kerry, all of whom participated in the  confirmation process of Judge Gorsuch 11 years ago and all of whom did  not oppose his nomination on the floor of the U.S. Senate. It shouldn't  come as a surprise, if you have been paying attention to the  confirmation process, to watch a mainstream consensus pick for the  Supreme Court answer questions. From when the hearings began--of  course, just a couple days ago--I think, since then, we have seen  overwhelming bipartisan support emerge publicly in the Senate, once  again, and we will see that emerge over the next several weeks.   Several of our colleagues from across the aisle have already  indicated they believe Judge Gorsuch deserves an up-or-down vote, and I  hope that will continue. A fair shake in this process is what we are  asking for. I wholeheartedly agree with my colleagues from across the  aisle that he deserves a fair shake and an up-or-down vote. Let's give  him that fair shake. Let's give him that up-or-down vote. Let's make  sure the process remains fair, and let's give it in a timely fashion.   Let's also give the American people a fair shake. Let's not forget  that Judge Gorsuch is their choice for the Supreme Court. The American  people rejected the previous administration's nominee and instead chose  Judge Gorsuch. We should respect the will of the American people.   Today, I would also like to speak about Judge Gorsuch's jurisprudence  on the separation of powers and the administrative state. Under the  previous administration, I, like many Coloradans and many of my  distinguished Senate colleagues, grew worried as we watched continued  administrative overreach. We watched 8 years of continued  administrative overreach, agency overreach, and a judiciary that was  ill-suited, or not inclined, to push back on the executive branch's  unconstitutional overreach.   As James Madison warned us in Federalist No. 47, ``The accumulation  of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same  hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self- appointed or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of  tyranny.''   It is, therefore, James Madison concluded, that the separation of  powers must be a ``sacred maxim of free government.''   That is what we are seeing in this debate over the confirmation of  Judge Gorsuch. Through his writing, Judge Gorsuch undoubtedly  recognizes this sacred maxim of free government. The questions he is  receiving and the answers he is giving talk about that sacred maxim of  free government.   His body of work indicates, one, an understanding that there are  clear constitutional limits to administrative agency power; two, it  also demonstrates and illustrates a willingness to ensure agencies do  not exceed their statutory authority; three, a genuine concern for the  due process of regulated parties, which rightly requires these parties  to receive clear notice on the scope of the regulations they must  follow; and, four, a recognition that there are constitutional limits  on the lawmaking responsibilities that Congress can delegate to the  executive branch.   Remember, going back to the founding of our country and the arguments  that took place over the type of government we should have, this Nation  started first with the Articles of Confederation and this loose  collection of States--States that were able to print their own money,  States that were able to raise their own militia because they feared  the power of tyranny; they feared the power of centralized government  that the British monarch represented, but that loose Confederation  wasn't working so our Founders realized they had to go back to the  drawing board to come up with something different.   So in the late 1700s--1787, 1788--we saw this great debate break out  published across the pages of papers in New York and throughout the  country as the anti-Federalists and the Federalists began debating what  kind of a government we should have. We had to recognize that too much  government was a bad thing, but we also recognized that when we were  too loose with that government, then it wouldn't function either.   So James Madison and others who had gotten together recognized that  we should put forward a different type of government, and they did so  in the Constitution, but they did it amongst guidance by people like  James Madison and Federalist No. 47. They did so understanding that one  branch of our government wouldn't gain an unfair advantage over another  branch of the government.   As the years since that debate in 1789 took place, we have seen that  there has been a mission creep, so to speak; that there has been a  branch overreach, as the executive branch has grown in power at the  expense of the legislative branch. I wish I could say that was all the  fault of the executive branch, but it certainly hasn't been. At times,  the legislative branch has yielded too much power and too much  authority. Instead of doing its job, the legislative branch has given  that authority to the executive branch. Of course, the executive branch  hasn't just pushed it away, saying: No, don't do that. They have taken  it. Both Republicans and Democrats, over the past several years, have  done exactly that, but it has hurt our balance of powers, and it has  hurt that very idea enshrined in Federalist No. 47; that we have to  make sure the same hands don't hold all the power of government,  leading to that maxim of free government.   So a judge who understands and who will rule that there are clear  constitutional limits to administrative agency power is an important  philosophy. It is an important approach that a judge would have. A  judge who is showing a willingness to ensure that agencies don't exceed  their statutory authority--we need that in our Nation's Court. We need  that on our Nation's High Court to restore the balance of power. We  need someone with a genuine concern for due process, someone who  recognizes that there are constitutional limits on lawmaking  responsibilities that Congress can delegate to the executive branch.  That is why it is important we talk about the views of Judge Gorsuch  and the questions he is being asked because his views are rooted in the  Constitution--very mainstream rules that are rooted in the  Constitution, mainstream views that should ease any concerns our  colleagues on the other side of the aisle may have about Judge Gorsuch.   As Judge Gorsuch explained in his famous concurring opinion on the  deference given to administrative agencies interpretations, the so- called Chevron doctrine, he said:         We managed to live with the administrative state before       Chevron. We could do it again. Put simply, it seems to me       that in a world without Chevron very little would change--      except perhaps the most important things.    That maxim of free government, that balance of power, the separation  of powers, the limits on the administrative agency powers, it is  something that I think we have to focus more time on, to restore the  role we are supposed to play. We need to restore the role we are not  just supposed to play but the role we are mandated by the Constitution  to fulfill.  [[Page S1907]]    For these reasons, and many others I have shared on the floor, I look  forward to working with my distinguished Democratic colleagues to make  sure Judge Gorsuch gets that fair shake and that timely up-or-down vote  and I certainly hope the bipartisan support he deserves.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
