 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3985,  the ALLIES Act.   For almost two decades, American troops have fought the war on terror  in Afghanistan. Over the course of the war, thousands of native Afghans  put their lives on the line to support our American servicemembers.  They served as translators, guides, contractors, and more. Their  support was critical to the safety of our servicemembers and the  success of our operations.   They showed true bravery and risked their lives in pursuit of an end  to the Taliban's regime and a free nation. Now, their decision to help  Americans is seen as traitorous by the Taliban, and many of these  Afghans and their families have been marked for death.   This danger has only been compounded by the Biden administration's  hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan. No plans were originally put in  place to help these individuals evacuate, and now, many face dire  consequences.   We have a moral imperative to support those who served alongside our  men and women in uniform and cannot leave them behind. While the  administration has announced plans to evacuate some of our Afghan  allies, they should not have been an afterthought.   I call on the administration to expeditiously process SIV applicants  and expand their efforts to get these individuals and their families  out of harm's way immediately.   In addition to those efforts, I am pleased the House is considering  this critical legislation today. It expands and amends the Special  Immigrant Visa program to better support our Afghan allies and their  families. These combined actions are the least we can do to help them  for their service to us.   Anyone who puts their life on the line to stand alongside American  servicemembers deserves not only our gratitude, but they deserve our  protection. That is why I am proud to vote in favor of the ALLIES Act  of 2021, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.     Mr. Speaker, the Biden administration  announced that it would once again extend the U.S.-Canada border  closure for nonessential travel until August 21.   This is yet another example of the President's failure on this issue.  His second day in office, he signed an executive order calling for a  plan. That never happened.   We have sent multiple letters from my office calling for answers.  They have gone unanswered.   Reporters have asked for clarity. The White House has dodged.   Families and small businesses have pleaded for action so they can  reunite and recoup lost revenue. They have been ignored.   Canada has announced that they will allow fully vaccinated Americans  in the country starting in August. This is long overdue but still light  years ahead of our President.   This extension is unacceptable, ignores the science, and extends the  suffering of families and small businesses in my region.   Reopening the border for nonessential travel can be done safely. The  time for stalling and silence has long passed. The Biden administration  needs to act immediately and reopen our shared border.                            ____________________
