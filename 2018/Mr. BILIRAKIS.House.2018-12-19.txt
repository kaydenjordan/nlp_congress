 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me  time. I appreciate all his help on this particular bill, and the  committee's help as well. It has been a priority of ours.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1222, the Congenital  Heart Futures Reauthorization Act as amended by the Senate, which will  ensure continued investment in surveillance research to evaluate the  lifelong needs of individuals with congenital heart defects, or CHD.   These surveillance efforts will help improve our understanding of CHD  across the lifespan, from birth to adulthood. This research will help  us learn more about demographic factors such as age, race, gender, and/ or ethnicity.   In addition, the legislation emphasizes a need for continued  biomedical research at the National Institutes of Health on the  diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of CHD.   NIH will further research into the causes of congenital heart  defects, including genetic causes, and study long-term outcomes in  individuals with CHD of all ages.   NIH may study data to identify effective treatments and outcomes, and  identify barriers to lifelong care for individuals with congenital  heart defects.   CHD is the most common birth defect and the leading cause of birth  defect-related infant mortality.   For the Down syndrome community, about half of the children born with  Down syndrome have CHD.   The road ahead may be scary and uncertain for any parent with a  newborn who has CHD, but this bill gives hope to those coping with the  diagnosis.   Nearly 1 in 100 babies, Mr. Speaker, are born with CHD and more than  5 percent will not live to see their first birthday. We have to fix  that.   Despite its prevalence and significance, there are still gaps in  research and standards of care for CHD patients, but for the sake of  the estimated 40,000 babies who will be born in the next year with CHD;  there is more work to be done.   Mr. Speaker, I began on this journey almost 10 years ago with my good  friend, then-Congressman Zack Space. So what we did is we first  introduced the Congenital Heart Futures Act back in 2009.   Last Congress, Congressman Schiff and I introduced the  reauthorization of the original law. During this time, I met with a lot  of patients with congenital heart defects, and I have been touched by  their stories: people like Trey and Nicole Flynn, a young Florida  couple who lost their son Holden while waiting for a heart transplant.  He was 2 years old.   This bill supports the essential research necessary to make sure  another family doesn't have to leave the hospital without their child  in their arms.   Lucas Iguina is a young man born with a complex congenital heart  defect that essentially left him with half a heart. Despite having  three open heart surgeries and countless doctor visits and medical  procedures, Lucas has hopes and dreams. This bill ensures that the  medical research will keep pace with his generation as they grow to be  adults with this complex illness.   Jackson Radandt, born with half a heart, has hypoplastic left heart  syndrome, which means the left side of his heart was underdeveloped. He  depended on lifesaving research to help his failing heart survive until  his heart transplant at the age of 11. He is about 16 years old now,  Mr. Speaker, and he will live his life with a heightened sensitivity  for his new heart.   Nicholas B. was born with a complex heart disease and wasn't getting  blood to the lower part of his body, requiring heart surgery when he  was just 2 days old. He now is in the top of his class. This bill will  ensure that his future remains bright as he navigates this chronic  illness through adulthood. Who knows? Nicholas may be a congressman one  day.                                time  1515    Abigail Adams, a very familiar name, a young Florida advocate with  Down syndrome. Roughly half of the babies born with Down syndrome have  a congenital heart defect. Abigail continues to advocate for  individuals with Down syndrome.   Then there is my friend, Dave. Dave was born with pulmonary stenosis,  a condition where a heart valve will not open properly. He had  emergency open-heart surgery when he was 2 days old, another surgery at  the age of 10, and many hospital visits and procedures in the meantime.  Today, he is a husband and a father of two, but he lives with atrial  flutter.   This bill will continue the surveillance program so we can collect  data on children and adults with congenital heart problems.   And Carolyn H., born with tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia,  had  [[Page H10280]]  open-heart surgery when she was 10 years old to repair her heart, but  she will need periodic surgical updates to replace the cadaver artery.   This bill continues the NIH research into why these defects occur.   These are just some of the patients that I have met over the years,  Mr. Speaker. There are many, many, many, many more.   Lastly, I want to thank some of the advocates who have worked with me  on getting this legislation passed. I want to thank: Dave Peluso, David  Kasnic, Amy Basken, Dr. Brad Marino, and Jessica Chenevert from the  Pediatric Congenital Heart Association. Mark Roeder and Daniel Hile  from the Adult Congenital Heart Association. Vince Randazzo, Sara Weir,  and Nicole Patton from the National Down Syndrome Society; and, most  importantly, our chairman for getting this through.   Mr. Speaker, I urge swift passage of this lifesaving bill. Let's get  it to the President as soon as possible.

Additionally, I want to recognize Vince Randazzo, Sara Weir, and  Nicole Patton, from the National Down Syndrome Society and all their  support.    I also want to thank many of the people that worked quietly behind  the scenes, whose names are seldom mentioned, and who never get the  recognition they deserve. People like Megan Perez, Kristin Seum, Shayne  Woods, Katie Novaria, Adrianna Simonelli, Kristen Shatynski, Paul  Edattel, Josh Trent, James Paluskiewicz, Peter Kielty, Karen Christian,  Ryan Long, Mike Bloomquist, Ed Kim, Nolan Ahern, Ian Martorana, Macey  Sevcik, and Elena Hernandez. This bill is a true team effort.    I urge swift House passage of this life-saving bill.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me the  time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 2076. I thank my good  friend, Brett Guthrie from the great State of Kentucky, and also Mr.  Tonko for sponsoring the House bill. This is so very important. The  Building Our Largest Dementia Infrastructure for Alzheimer's Act, or  the BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer's Act, is so very important. This  bill will create Alzheimer's disease centers of excellence, which are  badly needed.   Through these centers and public health departments, we can  strengthen our efforts at increasing early detection and diagnosis. It  will also allow for the voluntary collection of data so researchers can  analyze cognitive decline, caregiving, and health disparities in a  timely manner. I know that is going to help so much in finding a cure  for this disease.   I am a cosponsor of the House version of the bill.   In the Tampa area, we have the Byrd Alzheimer's Center and Research  Institute, which is one of the largest freestanding Alzheimer's  research centers in the United States.    Mr. Speaker, this bill will help them in their efforts  of Alzheimer's awareness and research. Please support this bill. We  need it badly for our constituents. I appreciate all the help from all  the volunteers and the advocates.   Again, I urge strong support for this bill.
