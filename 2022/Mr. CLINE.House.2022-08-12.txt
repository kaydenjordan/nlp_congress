 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, we know the real story. We know what happened a year and  a half ago when the so-called American Rescue Plan was passed--40-year  high inflation rates resulted. We see now what the result is from the  Build Back Better plan that had no chance of passage in the Senate.  This is the offspring of Build Back Better.   Even Bernie Sanders, a socialist who can come up with a million  flawed excuses to spend your tax dollars, says he can't find a way to  even say this would reduce inflation one iota.   We know that instead of fostering American energy independence,  increasing purchasing power for the American family, and reducing  inflation, this bill includes:   $16.5 billion in higher taxes for those making less than $200,000 a  year;   $38 billion in new taxes on American oil and gas producers, which  will be passed along to consumers in the form of even higher costs for  heating homes and gas prices, and;   $480 billion in tax hikes that will hit workers through slashed  wages.   Half the bill is Green New Deal climate change special interest  funding, including taxpayer-funded subsidies on electric vehicle  purchases, and;   $80 billion to double the size of the IRS, creating an army of new  enforcement agents.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this horrible legislation.
