 Madam Speaker, today, I rise in honor of National Spina  Bifida Awareness Month.   Spina bifida is a rare condition that develops in the womb. It stems  from a hole in the spinal cord, a condition known as a neural tube  defect. As the spinal column fails to close properly, nearly every  major organ system is impacted.   Children born with spina bifida typically undergo dozens of surgeries  at a young age. For those who survive to adulthood, they live with  complex physical, mental, and other health challenges.   There are precious few resources available for the 166,000  individuals living with spina bifida in the United States, including my  sister and my niece. I have another sister who was born with spina  bifida as well and passed away shortly after birth.   I am very familiar with the challenges faced by those who suffer from  spina bifida. It has been a part of my life since childhood.   The medical community has taken many steps forward since my sisters  were diagnosed with spina bifida several decades ago. Whereas spina  bifida used to be a childhood death sentence, many individuals with  spina bifida are living well into adulthood, a tremendous milestone.  But there is more we can do.   Funding for spina bifida is low. There is only one entity in the  Federal Government studying spina bifida. It is the Spina Bifida  Program at the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental  Disabilities at the CDC.   Americans living with spina bifida deserve the same respect and  dignity in life as everyone else. Spina bifida research needs dedicated  funding to ensure a better future for Americans with spina bifida.                           Remembering Pat Campbell     Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the life of Pat Campbell, a  friend not only to me but to many Oklahomans who listened to him on the  radio every morning.   Pat passed away yesterday morning after a long fight with brain  cancer. Everyone who knew Pat knows he was a fighter.   Pat got his start on radio largely on accident, because he would call  in and debate a liberal radio host. The station was so impressed with  his calls that they gave him his own show.   After that, he became a regular guest of Tucker Carlson's on MSNBC  and would go on to be a guest commentator on shows like ``The O'Reilly  Factor'' and ``Fox and Friends.''   Pat had an extraordinary impact on radio, not only in Tulsa but  around the Nation. He was a passionate voice for conservative values  and a truly great friend.  [[Page H5730]]    I will greatly miss Pat, and I offer my heartfelt condolences to his  family and all those who loved him.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, the co-chair of the  Border Security Caucus for holding this Special Order tonight.   Just when we thought we had seen the worst of the Democrats'  socialist wish list with this $5 trillion reconciliation plan, they  manage to squeeze in yet another radical, dangerous, unnecessary  provision. This time, it is effectively creating an open U.S. border.   So first, let's set the scene.   This summer and fall, we have seen record numbers of illegal border  crossings, reaching over 200,000 apprehensions in July and August each.   Earlier this week, U.S. authorities confirmed 1.7 million  apprehensions in the fiscal year, the most ever recorded.   More than 16,000 migrants tested positive for coronavirus and were  released into the United States without vaccination requirements and  without any trace of where they are traveling, who they were coming in  contact with. This 16,000 was on top of the tens of thousands of  migrants released into the interior of the country by Joe Biden.   We no longer have detention centers at our borders, we have border  distribution centers where we are sending people all over this country.   We now know that the Biden administration was covertly flying migrant  children around the country. They didn't want anyone to know.   So my question for Joe Biden is this: How many children were flown  out from the border and who is paying for it? The American people want  to know. If the taxpayers are on the hook for these flights, we have  the right to know.   This is not normal. What we have on our hands is equivalent to an  invasion of our southern border. For 9 months, the Biden administration  has ignored the crisis, meanwhile it grows exponentially worse. Biden  stripped away all the policies that President Trump put in place to  limit illegal crossings and to keep our borders safe, and now our  Border Patrol has all but surrendered to the cartels.   While all this is happening, Democrats decided to exacerbate the  crisis with these so-called reforms they are sneaking into the build  back broke reconciliation package at the last minute. Free college for  illegal immigrants; enhanced child tax credits for illegal immigrants;  amnesty for 10 million illegal immigrants to the tune of $100 billion  at taxpayers' expense; incentivizing illegal entry by waiving  provisions for inadmissibility, meaning that illegal immigrants will  practically be guaranteed amnesty; they are removing convictions for  illegal immigrants to increase their chance for amnesty. Let me say  that again: The Federal Government is going to drop charges against  drug traffickers and others who break our laws just so they don't have  to deport them. Insane.   These policies and many more are being written behind closed doors  without the knowledge or input of the American people.  [[Page H5778]]    Democrats who hold the majority in both the House and the Senate and  thereby have a stranglehold on power in the United States, must take  immediate action to secure our border and protect our American people.  Instead of putting Americans first, they are ensuring that illegal  immigrants are protected and prioritized above the American people,  which is an absolute abandonment of their sworn duty as a Member of  Congress.
