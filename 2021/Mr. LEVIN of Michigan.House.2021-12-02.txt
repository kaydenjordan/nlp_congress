 Madam Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart  to honor the four students murdered and the teacher and six students  injured in the Oxford High School shooting in my home county.  [[Page H6894]]    My own daughter was not in school today and will not be tomorrow due  to threats of copycat violence. Many school districts across metro  Detroit have closed altogether.   This is a terrifying time to be a parent, a school professional, a  law enforcement officer, and, Lord knows, a child.   This was the deadliest school shooting since 2018, the year our  children rose up and asked us to take action. The House has passed  several bills to curb gun violence, yet Congress as a whole has not  enacted a single new law for our kids.   This father urges our colleagues in the Senate to act, no more  thoughts and prayers, but to act at long last.   I send my deepest condolences to the families and friends of Hana,  Tate, Madisyn, and Justin. When we say never again, let's mean it this  time.                            ____________________
