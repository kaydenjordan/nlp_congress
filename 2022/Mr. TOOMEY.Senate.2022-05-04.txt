 Madam President, I call up my motion to instruct, which  is at the desk.    Madam President, my motion would simply instruct the  Senate conferees to USICA to keep a provision of the Wyden-Crapo trade  amendment that passed the Senate 91 to 4. Specifically, it is the  provision that requires the administration reestablish an exclusion  process for current and future section 301 actions.   This does not repeal 301 tariffs. It doesn't preclude new 301  tariffs. But, remember, when the Trump administration imposed 301  tariffs, they created an exclusion process for the simple reason that  it was important to exclude from tariffs those circumstances in which  it would do more harm to an American manufacturer and worker than those  targeted by the tariffs. But the exclusion process has expired. It has  not been fully restarted. So many U.S. manufacturers are not able to  get the relief they need.   The USICA language that passed the Senate would reestablish this  exclusion process. The language grants considerable flexibility to the  U.S. Trade Rep, even to the point where the exclusion process could be  waived altogether if the Trade Rep concludes that, otherwise, it would  diminish American leverage.   The bipartisan language simply helps ensure that American  manufacturers remain competitive. Nearly every one of us submitted  letters of request from constituent companies asking for exclusions.    There is no exclusion if there is no exclusion process.
