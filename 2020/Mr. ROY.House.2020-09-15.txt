 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas for yielding.   I would note, my friend, I think we have got another little bit of  time reserved on the back end that I will take and see my time, and I  am happy to let others use that time as well, if we go over and blend  that time together, and I would be happy to turn it over to my  colleagues, as well.   I just want to thank you for doing this.   Again, this institution, we ought to be meeting here together with  435  [[Page H4422]]  Members present. It is our obligation and our solemn duty to do so, but  instead, we continue to play political games, political theater. And we  are seeing the carnage on our streets in terms of businesses and in  terms of real lives, in terms of law enforcement.   Two deputies in Los Angeles shot point blank just this last week, and  people egging it on, cheering it on and encouraging them to die. What  kind of cultural rot do we have in our communities while this body sits  here empty, putting on a show because that is what this body has  become, putting on a show?   So I would say to the Speaker of the House: Where are you? Why is the  Speaker not here right now? Why is the majority leader not right here  right now?   We come back in to finally meet in September. We have had 19 days so  far of voting on the floor of this body over the last 6 months. Think  about that. It is absolutely irresponsible.   I say: Where is the Speaker? Why aren't we here doing the hard work  for the American people so that we can get our small businesses working  again, get our economy back again?   And why aren't we right here standing up unified, saying that we  stand alongside the law enforcement community of the United States? Why  aren't we standing up with the cops: Federal, State, and local? Why  aren't we saying we stand with them, this body, the people's House?   And that is what this is about, American greatness and standing up  and protecting our communities, protecting those values, securing the  blessings of liberty as articulated in the Constitution of the United  States which reflects the Declaration of Independence which articulated  the rights of mankind for the first time in human history.   That is what this Nation is about, and I am glad to stand up, and I  will join you in a little bit more.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Arrington) for organizing this Special Order to talk about such an  important topic.   Mr. Speaker, I have some things that I am going to talk about as  well, but I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Baird).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Arrington).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.  Johnson).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.  Johnson) for his heartfelt remarks about something that is such an  important topic. I thank him for his steadfast commitment to the  Constitution.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Arrington) for  arranging this earlier gathering where we could all join together in  this important moment to talk about this.   Mr. Speaker, I would like for those sitting at home to focus in on  this number 43. This number 43, you want to know what this number  represents? This number represents the number of law enforcement  officers who have been killed thus far in 2020--43 law enforcement  officers who have been killed thus far in 2020, over 40 percent more  than in the same period in 2019.   Eight were categorized as premeditated murder. Two were a victim of  unprovoked attacks. Eight fatal shots were fired at pointblank range,  zero to 5 feet from the officer; eight shot in the front of the head,  two from the back of the head, six in the neck, nine in the chest.   These are 43 law enforcement officers who have lost their lives in  2020.   Where is the NBA? Where is the NBA?   Where is the Speaker of the House? That is what I want to know. Where  is the Speaker of the House? Condemning 43 law enforcement officers who  have been murdered.   Are their names on the back of any jerseys, or is that just for  preening and posturing by the true privileged who play sports for a  living?   These are real people.   David Dorn died June 2 at 2:30 a.m. in the middle of the street after  he was shot in the torso while attempting to protect a friend's  pawnshop from suspected looters. Mr. Dorn had served 38 years in the  St. Louis Police Department before retiring.   David Patrick Underwood died from gunshot wounds after he was shot  from a vehicle on May 29 in Oakland, California. He was working as a  contract security officer for Federal Protective Services.   According to authorities, the man charged in the murder of Mr.  Underwood had specifically traveled to Oakland with the intent to kill  police. He thought he could get away with it due to the large protest  gatherings.   Sergeant Damon Gutzwiller was investigating a suspect vehicle linked  to this case when he, too, was killed after being ambushed with  explosive devices and an assault rifle. He had served the Santa Cruz  County community since 2006.   Shay Mikalonis, a Las Vegas Metropolitan Police officer, was  seriously injured after being shot in the head while attempting to  disperse protesters in June.   This week--we have already alluded to it--two L.A. County sheriff's  deputies were sitting in their vehicle when they were ambushed and  shot, ambushed and shot in the streets of Los Angeles. The deputies, a  31-year-old mother and a 24-year-old man, were transported to a local  hospital. While fighting for their lives, a group of protestors arrived  at the hospital and shouted: ``We hope they die.''   This is what is happening on the streets of America right now, and it  is being fomented by our so-called national leaders.   Again, I would like to say, where is the people's House? Going out  for a fundraiser? Having a nice dinner here in Washington, D.C., right  now? Getting a steak dinner with somebody, patting each other on the  back? Where are they?   Mr. Speaker, do you hear the echo of my voice? It is echoing for a  reason. This Chamber is empty, with the exception of one or two  colleagues.   Where is the Speaker? It is almost like that book, ``Where's Waldo?''  Where is the Speaker? Let's walk around Washington, D.C. Let's go try  to find the Speaker because she sure as heck is not here right now on  the floor of the House of Representatives leading this body. We are  sure not having any votes right now. We are not having amendments. We  are not having any debate.   Forty-three. Forty-three dead law enforcement officers.                                time  1900    You know what else we are not focusing on? The businesses destroyed  by riots and the businesses ravaged by  [[Page H4425]]  government shutdown in the face of a virus.   As we talked about all these riots, I read with interest the story of  93 percent peaceful, leaving 7 percent unpeaceful. All the headlines  said 93 percent peaceful.   Well, how about that 7 percent, including roughly 550 violent  demonstrations across the county since June?   Minneapolis Star Tribune: More than 360 businesses across Twin Cities  vandalized, looted; 66 destroyed completely by fire. Property damage to  more than 1,500 locations. Set fire to nearly 150 buildings.   Insurance experts estimate the cost to be $500 million.   Portland: $20 million in damage.   How about some of these headlines? ``Riots, Arson Leave Minnesota  Communities of Color Devastated.''   Philadelphia, ``Philadelphia Black-Owned Businesses Damaged and  Looted.''   New York Times said: `` . . . businesses, already ailing from an  outbreak of the coronavirus that has been particularly devastating to  small and minority-owned business, may not recover.''   FOX Milwaukee: ``Many Milwaukee businesses damaged by vandals during  violent protests are minority owned.''   Between May 25 and June 8, in the heat of a lot of these protests, at  least 17 people were killed.   What is the carnage in the Black community? I read a stat recently  that upwards of 45 percent of Black-owned businesses have closed down  since the beginning of the pandemic as we know it and during this time  of civil unrest.   Is the NBA wearing anybody's names who lost a business on their  jersey? Are they painting any of their names on the floor while they  make $20 million to play basketball, or $50 million? No, I don't see  that.   Why aren't we having a resolution here with 435 Members saying we  stand up for law enforcement? That is not to say we can't have a  vigorous debate about court-created qualified immunity.   I am a conservative. I don't like courts creating law. I don't like  that the court created qualified immunity and that is not as perfect as  we could make it. But I believe there should be some level of immunity,  so let's have that conversation. Let's debate it. Let's discuss it.   Or I can just sit here and speak to an empty Chamber and have a  speech that is on C-SPAN and then tweet it out, and then there will be  some speeches and people will go out and then there will be an election  in November.   Let's be honest. We know that is what all this is about: posturing  for a November election.   Well, you know what? I could be out doing one of these dinners. We  could be doing something. We are all in races. Or we could be right  here doing our darn job, because that is what we should be doing. We  should actually be having a debate in this Chamber. We never do that.   We haven't had a vote on an open amendment on the floor of the House  since May of 2016. That is both parties in control of this Chamber, by  the way. That is absurd. It is facially absurd.   We are a nation governed by a Rules Committee that throws bills on  the floor and then says: Hey, you are going to vote on this with a gun  to your head, and we are going to put whatever we can in there to make  it a tough vote so that we can then run ads against you and then have a  campaign in November.   That is no way for a representative government to work.   We make policy based on Twitter. We don't have legitimate hearings  where we go through all of the information and make tough additions,  roll our sleeves up. That is the way this body is supposed to work. It  hasn't worked that way in a long time--either party in control, by the  way.   One day we might aspire for this body's approval rating to jump above  20 percent. Wouldn't that be something? But why would you approve of  this body? What do we ever do?   Rhetorical question.   I would actually like to ask the question: What do we actually do?   We sure as heck don't pass appropriations bills that have any chance  of being reasonable or financially prudent. $27 trillion of debt later,  we are barreling toward $30 trillion. Everybody knows it. Our dollar is  going to be devalued. Our economy is going to be weaker. Our kids are  inheriting $30 trillion-plus of debt.   What are we doing?   The Speaker, leader in the Senate, Treasury Secretary, they are all  meeting in rooms--I don't ever see any of this stuff till I read about  it in the press--figuring out which number they are going to put in  front of trillion for some deal.   Why don't we start with a bill on the floor of this Chamber? For  example, why don't we just start with a PPP extension bill? Why not?   We managed to pass a bill in June, Dean Phillips, freshman Democrat  from Minnesota, and myself, seven pages, because we ignored the normal  process. And we went out and we got a bunch of support for it and we,  basically, forced the issue. We got a vote and it extended the PPP,  granting true reprieve and help to small businesses in Texas and  throughout this country.   The PPP is at 5.2 million loans and $525 billion since the spring. In  Texas, over 400,000 loans of $41 billion. Eighty-six percent of the  total count were less than $150,000. The average loan is $101,000.   We have $130 billion left. Why don't we extend it? Why don't we add  to it? Why don't we make this work for small businesses that, I am  told, in Texas are going to run out of money in September, run out of  money in October: live music venues closing, small restaurants closing,  family-owned establishments that have been there for decades closing.   Now we are playing Russian roulette with other people's lives. You  have got local politicians and Governors who have shut down people's  livelihoods: wineries, breweries, distilleries, live music venues,  restaurants unable to stay in business in significant part because of  government action, in part because of the virus and people's concerns.    Why aren't we doing something right now?   What is more important at 7 tonight than us, this body, meeting and  coming up with solutions? A dinner? A fundraiser? An interview on  MSNBC, CNN, or FOX? Some meeting with some higher-ups and the Speaker  and the leader and some folks in the administration telling us what to  do when we are every bit as duly elected as they are? But that is what  is happening, because there sure as heck isn't anybody on the floor of  the House Chamber here at 7.   Over the last 180 days, since mid-March when we all left, around  spring break time for a lot of our kids, over this 6 months, 180 days,  we have met and voted, I think, 19 of those days. Today might be the  20th. That is absurd. And none of those votes, by the way, were us  actually sitting down here and debating.   My friend agrees. He knows.   Have we been down here debating? Have there been any grand debates  here on the floor of the people's House? There have not.   I can't tell you how many Members on the other side of the aisle and  this side of the aisle I talk to about wanting to restore regular  order. It is the fundamental problem we have among our so-called  leaders in this town is we don't do that.   Right now, we have H.R. 7894 that I did with my friends Congressman  Curtis, Congressmen Wild, Meuser, Van Drew, a number of folks,  bipartisan, that would extend the PPP.   You know what? I don't care. Don't use that bill. There is the  RESTART Act. There are others. But why don't we just pull up a bill,  debate it, and vote on it? It is a novel idea.   Or no, why don't we just wait for the powers that be to put together  a $3 trillion bill that has virtually no chance of getting any kind of  unified support because it has got 50 different moving parts and then  wonder why the American people look at us and say: What is wrong with  you?   Just put a bill on the floor and let's debate it and vote on it. What  are we afraid of? I am happy to vote, and my constituents can choose  what to do in November. But let's debate and vote.   That bill I just mentioned, it has 35 significant organizations and  entities that support it: National Restaurant Association, a bunch of  the business community that supports it.   Fine. Again, I don't care, that bill, another bill. Let's just have a  bill and  [[Page H4426]]  a vote on a bill that will help our small business community.   But again, where is the Speaker? Why are we playing politics with  small businesses? I don't get it.   Where is the Speaker? Where is this body on 43, 43 dead law  enforcement officers, up a significant amount, almost 50 percent since  last year?   I would say, as I said before, that bill that we got passed in June  on a bipartisan basis, the PPP bill we passed in the spring, this is  just my district alone, the district I represent, Texas 21: businesses  supported, 18,400; nonprofits supported, 511; total jobs supported,  90,900; funding distributed, over $600 million. That is one  congressional district.   Let's do our job. Let's pass an extension of that.   Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I would like to use the time that I have  remaining not lamenting some of my frustrations about the floor of the  House but talking about why it matters. I would like to talk about this  magnificent young lady, Rebekah Wendt.   I rise here tonight to remember Rebekah, who loved her country, a  martyr who lost her life striving to do what we all came here to do: to  make America better.   Rebekah is the granddaughter of Chuck and Judy Wendt, daughter of Tim  and Erika Wendt, and sister of two of my staffers, one current and one  former, Jonah and Manfred Haden Wendt.   On July 10, a little bit before midnight, I received a phone call  from my aide, Jonah. He informed me that his sister, Rebekah, had just  passed away in a car accident while working on a campaign in west Texas  for a candidate she believed in to make a little extra money to buy  textbooks for school.   Rebekah Susanna Wendt was born on May 12, 2000, to Tim and Erika  Wendt. She was baptized on August 13 of 2000 and confirmed on May 17 of  2015 at St. Paul Lutheran in Fort Worth, Texas. She was a rising  sophomore at Trinity University, which I am proud to represent.   On July 10, 2020, she was embraced at the pearly gates of heaven by  our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. She was greeted by those who had gone  before her: Oma, Opa, Anita, Willard, and Jeff.   Rebekah's story is nothing of inspirational.   As a child, Rebekah struggled with language. Speaking, reading, and  writing--putting her thoughts into written language--were difficult for  Rebekah. Many thought she would never be able to read, but she overcame  and flourished.   As a child, she was able to do what most adults today cannot even do:  ask for help.   Rebekah had a wonderful gift for the fine arts. She danced and sang  choir with poise and self-confidence. Rebekah learned to work through  her difficulties and blossomed into an aspiring architect and  historian. She would eventually follow her big brothers to Trinity  University.   Rebekah was a student of history and a lover of architecture. She  loved to read about World War II, particularly the Battle of the Bulge.   I thank my friend, a veteran, for coming in and holding this for me  just as I am talking about the sacrifices of our wonderful World War II  generation.   As a self-described architecture geek, she worked hand in hand with  her father to design their new home.   Having just finished her freshman year at Trinity University, Rebekah  was just beginning to come into her own.   Her classmates at Trinity University remember her as a devoted  Christian who lived out her faith every day: warm and enthusiastic,  charmingly silly and unsure of herself, but brave and willing to ask  for help. They will also remember her as a keenly aware friend.   Her family will forever remember her as the introvert who just needed  a stage to perform on; the sister who was already planning out who  would host Christmas, Easter, and Thanksgiving; an apologetic history  buff who would blurt out a fact only to excuse herself for being a  self-described nerd; an old soul who found comfort in ``MASH,''  ``Golden Girls,'' and anything vintage; a fighter who overcame the odds  and never gave up on her dreams, with a smile that lit up rooms and a  roaring laugh that the whole neighborhood knew.   Her mother, Erika, will fondly recall her daughter as her best  friend, kitchen partner, an ally in all things gluten-free, and  caretaker of her two brothers. They need some caretaking.   Her father, Tim, will never forget designing the family's new house  with his beloved daughter. While Rebekah may have gone to Heaven, the  family house will remain here on Earth as a testament to her love and  devotion for her family.   Following Rebekah's service, a friend of the Wendt family noted that  the funeral had reminded her of Matthew 25:21: ``Well done, my good and  faithful servant.''   Well done, Rebekah. You have run the race. You have kept the faith.   Rebekah's story has touched the lives of many people who she didn't  even know.   She passed away doing what I pledged to do when running for Congress:  preserve the promise of America for our children and our grandchildren.   She didn't have to be out on a campaign knocking on doors during a  virus and all the chaos of 2020, but she did. In fact, Rebekah was not  particularly political, but she loved her country, and she was proud of  our history and all who had come before her in the name of life,  liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.                                time  1915    She loved America; she loved her God; she loved Jesus Christ; and she  loved her German Lutheran heritage. She will be remembered as a very  good German who loved her God, her family, and her country.   She served as an inspiration to me and someone that I have honored,  am honoring now, and will continue to honor as I serve not just in the  United States Congress but the rest of my life.   Thank you, Rebekah. While your time on Earth has come to an end  sooner than we all would have liked, your legacy will remain long  after. You are an inspiration for many and will not soon be forgotten.   I thank my friend for his assistance. I thank Rebekah for her  service. I thank her family for their love and support that they are  offering to each other and everybody in the community.   I will just say this in closing. We all have these stories. We all  have people we lose. I went through a battle with cancer. We are here  to make this country better. We are here to represent the people of the  United States. I would just ask that we come together and let's solve  those problems. Let's roll up our sleeves and do our job. That is what  we were elected to do. And let's stand up for America together.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
