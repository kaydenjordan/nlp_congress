 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill.   Here it is in a nutshell: Chairman Frelinghuysen saw to it that we  passed all 12 of the appropriations bills and sent them to the Senate,  where not a single one has been allowed to come to the floor because of  Democratic Senators who profess they want to keep the government going  but vote ``no.''   And because the Democrats in the Senate have barred the consideration  of any of these bills, here we are. We have no choice but to vote for  this bill if we want to keep the government open. It is the only game  in town.   And those on the other side who profess they want to keep the  government going today will vote ``no.'' I don't understand that logic.   Mr. Speaker, this is the only chance we have to keep the government  operating to be sure that the American taxpayers' money is being spent  properly and adequately, but for the purpose of keeping our government  open.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill, and let's move on.
