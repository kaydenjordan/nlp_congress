 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to  this rule.   For 4 months, Republicans have demanded to know the President's plan  to evacuate Americans and Afghan allies and conduct counterterrorism  operations in Afghanistan. For 4 months, they have told us: ``We are  working on it.''   Well, now it is clear they never had a plan. The President's abject  failure to plan is endangering the lives of thousands of American  civilians and our allies in Afghanistan.   Reports have been rolling in for over a week of Americans being  assaulted or having to hide from Taliban thugs while they wait for a  rescue. Afghan allies are being brutalized and killed by these  terrorists as they desperately try to get inside the gates of the Kabul  airport.   And that is just those lucky enough to be in Kabul. Thousands of  Americans and Afghan allies are still stranded hundreds of miles away  from Kabul with little hope of rescue.   Now comes an ultimatum from the terrorists that if our forces don't  withdraw by next Tuesday, they will start shooting.   What is the response from the majority? Well, Speaker Pelosi brought  us back to Washington, but not to deal with this dire situation in  Afghanistan. No, we are here today to vote on a partisan, $4 trillion  giveaway to the radical left; a bill that doesn't include a single  dollar to rescue Americans or our allies from Afghanistan or even a  single penny on national security.   I have to wonder what the majority is thinking. Instead of this  partisan exercise, I urge the majority to work with us to hold the  President accountable and save Americans and allies still in  Afghanistan.
