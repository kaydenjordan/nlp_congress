 Mr. President, 10 years ago today, March 14, Bear Stearns  was on the verge of collapse. Despite its 85-year history, despite its  relationship with nearly every bank on Wall Street, the bank suddenly  found itself on the brink. On this very day, March 14, Bear Stearns  lost $3.5 billion in market value. The bank was in the midst of a free  fall. In the course of one week, Bear Stearns went from trading for $65  per share to being bought for $2 a share in a sweetheart deal  orchestrated by the Fed over the course of a weekend. Nearly overnight,  one of Wall Street's most prestigious, almost 100-year-old banks fell  apart.   Across the country, families sat at their kitchen tables and started  to wonder: Will one of us lose our job? Will we have to move? Will we  be able to retire? Will we lose our house? Will we be able to send our  kids to college? On this day 10 years ago--March 14, 2008--a headline  from CNN read: ``Job Losses: The Worst in Five Years.'' The story  talked about how the economy was hemorrhaging jobs. The article warned  that the crisis was building, quoting one analyst who said the real  estate and credit crunch ``was whipping its way through the U.S.  economy like a Midwestern tornado.''   In hindsight, we know that things would get a lot worse before they  got better.  [[Page S1724]]    Some people say nobody could have possibly seen this coming. Some  people say the 2008 financial crisis was like the weather--like that  Midwestern tornado--something out of control that we wouldn't have  seen, but we know better.   Advocates in communities--the people who are actually dealing with  the consequences of this crisis--were sounding the alarm. For years  before the crisis, they predicted what would happen if Washington  didn't rein in Wall Street, and clearly they were right.   A few people in Washington, like Ned Gramlich, saw the problem for  what it was; that Washington didn't stop the crisis, after it began,  after it intensified--Congress at least responded. We passed a law that  created important protections for the financial system, for taxpayers,  for homeowners to hold banks and watchdogs accountable to prevent  another crisis, but Wall Street wasn't even close to being ready to  quit. There was no contrition. Nobody went to jail. In fact, on the day  that President Obama signed Wall Street reform--what we know as Dodd- Frank--on the day that bill was signed into law, the top financial  service lobbyists in this town said: Now it is half time.   Now, what would that mean: Now it is half time? It meant they lost  the first half. They lost the battle where people in this Congress  actually had the guts and the backbone and sloughed off their campaign  contributions and were unwilling to listen to bank lobbyists tell them  what to do. They stood up to the bank lobbyists and stood up to Wall  Street and they did the right thing, but this lobbyist said it was half  time. So the lobbyists lost the first half, but they were back at it,  going to the regulators, trying to convince the regulators to weaken  the rules and not implement the bill.   Not long ago, another bank lobbyist told us their game plan: ``We  don't want a seat at the table, we want the whole table.'' This bill  gives them that. The same group that warned us about the last crisis-- this is what I ask my colleagues to listen to. The same group that  warned us about the last crisis or that were the regulators who tried  to fix the last crisis--those same people are opposed to the bill the  Senate is considering today. That doesn't seem to matter to about 65 of  my colleagues.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  the list of the range of civil rights, labor, and consumer advocacy  groups that oppose S. 2155.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:   List of Current and Former Regulatory Officials and Experts Opposed to                                  S. 2155         Former Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee       Chairman Christopher Dodd,        Former Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker,        Former Federal Reserve Governor Daniel Tarullo,        Former Federal Reserve Governor and Deputy Secretary of the       Department of the Treasury Sarah Bloom Raskin,        Former FDIC Chair Sheila Bair,        Former Department of the Treasury Assistant Secretary for       Financial Institutions Michael Barr,        Former Special Advisor for Regulatory Policy to the       Department of the Treasury Under Secretary for Domestic       Finance Saule Omarova,        Former Counselor to Secretary of the Department of the       Treasury Antonio Weiss,        Former Deputy Governor of the Bank of England Paul Tucker       on behalf of the Systemic Risk Council,        FDIC Vice Chair Thomas Hoenig,        Former Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Gary       Gensler,        Former Chairman of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission       Phil Angelides.    List of Labor, Consumer, and Civil Rights Organizations Opposed to S.                                    2155         AFL-CIO;        AFSCME;        Americans for Financial Reform;        Better Markets, Part I and Part II;        Center for American Progress;        Center for Popular Democracy;        Center for Responsible Lending;        Consumer Federation of America;        Consumers Union;   CWA;        Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights;        Mortgage Coalition (Center for Responsible Lending,       National Community Reinvestment Coalition, National Consumer       Law Center);        NAACP;        National Association of Consumer Advocates;        National Community Reinvestment Coalition;        Prosperity Now;        Public Citizen;        UAW;        Unidos;        Urban League;        US PIRG.     People who cleaned up the last crisis are warning us not  to pass this bill. Experts from both parties are warning us, the  authors of Wall Street reform. Barney Frank said he would vote no if he  were in the Senate. Chris Dodd, in an op-ed today, writes that the  bill's changes amount to ``chipping away at the ability to conduct  comprehensive and effective oversight.''   Now, people are saying this isn't a major scale-back of Dodd-Frank,  but Senator Dodd and Congressman Frank both say they would vote no  because they recognize it as damaging to the work we all did.   Experts like Paul Volcker, head of the Federal Reserve; Sheila Bair,  head of FDIC, Republican appointment by President Bush, used to be  chief of staff for Senator Bob Dole; Dan Tarullo, who was effectively  the head of supervision of regulation for the Federal Reserve, wants us  to vote no. Sarah Bloom Raskin, who was at the Federal Reserve and then  Deputy Secretary of the Treasury; Gary Gensler, who is head of the  Commodities Future Trading Commission; Tom Hoenig, a Republican who is  at FDIC and earlier was the Fed president; Antonia Weiss at the  Treasury Department; Paul Tucker, international banker from England-- international regulator; Phil Angelides, a former California State  Treasurer who ran the Commission that examined what happened in the  bank crisis--they all wrote to the Senate. They all outlined a combined  28 pages' worth of concerns about this bill, and my colleagues just  say: Oh, this is just helping the small community banks and some of the  regional banks a little bit.   Well, not exactly. That is what happens here. We start off wanting to  help the small banks; we start off helping some of the midsized  regional banks that generally do a good job--banks like Huntington and  Fifth Third and Key Bank--but then Wall Street gets involved, and Wall  Street drives a bigger and bigger hole in this bill and gets more and  more help and more and more breaks and look where we are.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  letters from two of these financial experts.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                               The Volcker Alliance,                                Working for Effective Government,                                                  February 21, 2018.        Dear Senator Brown: I appreciate your letter seeking my       views on the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer       Protection Act, S. 2155. I am pleased that the Senate Banking       Committee has forged ahead with meaningful, bipartisan       financial reform to ease the unnecessary regulatory strain on       small banks, helping them flourish as an engine of economic       prosperity. I appreciate your leadership and dedication, and       that of Senator Crapo, to this bill over the last two years       and congratulate the bipartisan coalition of senators on the       Committee who have worked diligently to advance this       legislation.        Your letter sought my views on three sections of the bill.       Specifically: (1) Section 401, which would exempt some       important banks from stringent prudential standards, such as       those for capital, leverage, stress testing, and resolution       planning; (2) Section 402, which would relax leverage       limitations on custodial banks; and (3) Section 203, which       would exempt small banks from the Volcker Rule ban on       proprietary trading. I offer the following observations and       possible alternatives for your consideration.        First, section 401 would raise from $50 billion to $250       billion the asset threshold at which banks begin to face       increasingly tougher prudential standards. Eight years       following the passage of Dodd-Frank, it is appropriate to       reexamine whether the $50 billion asset threshold is set too       low. Indeed, there may be an opportunity to raise it without       endangering financial stability. However, an increase to $250       billion would go too far. It would have the effect of       substantially reducing the regulation of 25 of the 38 largest       banks to which these standards now apply, notably including       the operating subsidiaries of several large foreign banks.        Clearly the distress or failure of some of these banks       could trigger reactions spreading broadly to the financial       system. To take specific examples, Countrywide, National       City, and GMAC, standing well below the $250 billion mark, in       fact, required billions of dollars in official capital       assistance and debt guarantees either for themselves or their       acquiring institutions. Failure of the large U.S. operating       subsidiaries of foreign banks could pose similar risk. I urge       consideration  [[Page S1725]]       of raising the threshold to, say, $100 billion but building       in additional flexibility for regulators to implement the       standards below that.        Second, section 402 is a highly technical provision that       relates to so-called custodial banks, institutions that       specialize in safeguarding assets of their clients, including       mutual funds, pension funds, asset managers, and other       institutions. Given their size and importance to the       financial system, some such banks, of which the sizable BNY       Mellon and State Street stand out, are required to maintain a       minimum supplementary leverage ratio (``SLR''), a measure of       equity capital to total exposure.        Section 402 would mandate bank regulators to amend their       regulations to allow ``custodial banks'' to exclude deposits       they hold at the Federal Reserve and certain other central       banks when calculating their SLR. While there may be reasons       to adjust the SLR calculation for custodial banks, including       during a crisis to facilitate the banks' ability to serve as       a safe-haven for deposits, regulators already have broad       authority to make those adjustments. They also are best       positioned to decide how and when to exercise that       discretion.        Section 402 does so preemptively, reducing leverage capital       requirements for at least two of the most systemically       important custodial banks by as much as 30 percent at a time       when they should be building their capital cushion. It also       would put Congress under pressure to expand the exclusion.       Claims will be sure to arise that other banks in competition       with the big custodial banks should have similar capital       relief: that temptation should be resisted.        Finally, section 203 would exempt from the Volcker Rule       banks with assets of less than $10 billion and whose trading       assets and liabilities are no more than five percent of total       assets. I'm in strong agreement with the aim of reducing       unnecessary regulatory burdens on traditional community       banks, not just from the Volcker Rule, but also more broadly.       Community banks play a vital role in serving the needs of       small businesses and do not require the full panoply of       regulation or frequent full-scale examination.        An alternative to section 203 would be to simply relieve       small banks from demonstrating compliance with the rule,       while, at the same time tasking the bank regulators in their       normal supervisory roles to detect persistent violations and       demand remediation. This would have the advantage of       preventing a small bank or a group of small banks protected       by the Federal bank ``safety net'' from benefitting from       risky proprietary trading activity. I know from my long       experience in banking and savings and loan regulation that       plausibly small loopholes can be ``gamed'' and exploited with       unfortunate consequences.        I thank you for the opportunity to comment on this       important piece of legislation and look forward to its swift       passage.            Sincerely,      Paul A. Volcker.                                   ____                                               Harvard Law School,                                       Cambridge, MA, March 5, 2018.      Hon. Michael Crapo,      Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs,           U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Sherrod Brown,      Ranking Member, Committee on Banking, Housing & Urban           Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Crapo and Senator Brown: As we approach the       tenth anniversary of the height of the financial crisis, it       is critical that we not lose sight of the core concerns that       rightly motivated members of both parties to seek regulatory       mechanisms to guard against systemic risk and to promote       financial stability. With the pending consideration of S.       2155 by the full Senate, I wanted to take this opportunity to       reiterate some of the points about the regulatory structure       we have discussed in the past, especially as they apply to       this bill.        While S. 2155 begins from the sound premise that some       refinements are desirable in the way various statutory       requirements have been tailored, I have a number of       disagreements with specifics of the bill. Rather than       rehearse all of those, I want to focus on the three features       that raise particular concerns about financial stability, in       hopes that they could be omitted or at least clarified. As I       will explain in more detail below, I would urge the following       changes:        1. Clarification that banking organizations with assets       between $100 and $250 billion will continue to be subject to       the annual stress test and CCAR process of the Federal       Reserve;        2. Clarification that the higher section 165 threshold       established by the bill applies to the worldwide assets of       foreign banking organizations; and        3. Deletion of Section 402 of the bill, which would make       certain changes to leverage ratio requirements.        With respect to the first two of these changes, while there       is widespread--though by no means universal--agreement that       the $50 billion level is too low a threshold for many of the       section 165 requirements, there is considerable disagreement       over how much it should be raised. There is a case to be made       for the $250 billion level chosen in S. 2155, though       personally I think that is too high. In considering how to       raise the threshold, the most important consideration is to       align enhanced prudential standards with the risks to safety       and soundness and financial stability actually associated       with various groups of banks.        As you know, I have for several years advocated a limited       number of changes to the statutory thresholds established in       the Dodd-Frank Act for certain additional regulatory       requirements. My reason for suggesting these changes was my       conclusion, both from my own analysis and from discussions       with supervisory staff when I was still a member of the Board       of Governors of the Federal Reserve, that the benefits of       some of the important prudential requirements added by Dodd-      Frank were considerably less significant for the smaller       banks within the range established by the different       thresholds. In these instances, it seems better policy to       allocate more of the risk management and compliance resources       of banks, and of the supervisory resources of the banking       agencies, to the important risks actually faced by banks of a       certain size and activity mix. For instance, the expense       incurred by small banks with minimal trading assets and       liabilities just to ensure that they are complying with       Volcker Rule regulatory exemptions seems quite       disproportionate to any safety and soundness benefits.        When it comes to the threshold for the more stringent       prudential standards mandated by Section 165 of Dodd-Frank,       this same calculation should apply. That is, which of these       requirements deliver significant safety and soundness       benefits for particular sizes of banks? The answer, I       concluded after several years of experience, is that the 165       requirements deliver relatively small benefits for the safety       and soundness of banks that currently have between $50 and       $100 billion in assets, and many deliver only moderate       benefits for banks somewhat above that size. For example,       special liquidity requirements (on top of normal supervisory       assessments of liquidity management) seemed of limited       prudential utility for medium-sized commercial banks engaged       in the conventional business of taking deposits and making       loans.        But S. 2155 calls into question the post-crisis prudential       measure that is essential for the safety and soundness of       these banks, and for the stability of the financial system in       the face of major asset shocks. Section 401(e) of the bill as       reported out of Committee instructs the Federal Reserve to       conduct supervisory stress tests of banks with between $100       and $250 billion ``on a periodic basis.'' This provision is       obviously meant to indicate that these banks are not exempted       from the stress testing requirements created by Section 165.       Yet the provision is quite vague, with little indication of       what kind of test is contemplated for these banks. This       language might be interpreted benignly, simply to indicate       that this set of banks will remain in the stress testing       program even though they will have been removed from other       section 165 requirements. Of more concern is an       interpretation that these banks not be in the stress test       every year, though the results of the test--whenever it is       conducted--could still be used as the analytic basis for the       general authority of federal banking agencies to set capital       requirements on a bank specific basis. And then there is a       very troublesome interpretation that these banks not be in       the current Federal Reserve stress testing process, including       the Comprehensive Capital Annual Review (CCAR). Instead, they       would be in some different, ill-defined kind of stress       testing program.        Although liquidity and concentration limits beyond those       applicable under pre-existing statutory requirements for       insured depository institutions are only obliquely related to       the risks faced by banks currently in this size range,       capital shortfalls are a risk. Loans gone bad, with the       resulting impairment of capital positions, are the principal       risk associated with the traditional lending that dominates       the activities of most of these banks.        A number of banks of this size received TARP funds in late       2008 in order to buttress their capital positions. While       other, smaller banks also received TARP funds, the difference       is precisely in the aggregate size of this group of banks.       Together, just the domestically owned firms falling in this       range hold $1.5 trillion in assets (compared to less than       $300 billion in assets for those between $50 and $100       billion). There is good reason to believe that these regional       lending institutions share the risks associated with shocks       to commercial real estate prices, residential real estate       prices, and the financial situation of consumers. Thus there       could also be systemic implications of stress among this       group of banks. The current CCAR program of the Federal       Reserve helps build the resiliency of banks to these serious       problems, thereby decreasing the chances of systemic stress       or the unavailability of lending to even creditworthy       businesses and households that results when the capital       positions of banks are compromised.        To remove this protective measure would be to undermine a       key achievement of the post-crisis period. Accordingly, as       the first feature of the bill that should be changed, I urge       the Senate, should it proceed with this legislation, to       remove any ambiguity as to whether these banks will remain in       the quantitative side of the CCAR program on an annual basis.       The Federal Reserve has already exempted these banks from the       qualitative part of the CCAR and has taken steps to simplify       some of the procedural and reporting requirements associated       with it. I suspect the Board of Governors would be amenable       to doing more along these lines. But we should not risk the       improvement in  [[Page S1726]]       the resiliency of the U.S. financial system that the stress       testing program has brought about by ensuring that regulatory       capital requirements take into account the changing economic       and financial risks faced by sizeable banks that together       provide credit to large proportions of American households       and businesses.        The second feature of the bill that raises concerns of a       systemic nature is also related to the $250 billion       threshold, as it applies to foreign banking organizations       operating in the United States. As you know, since the       financial crisis the Board of Governors has required certain       foreign banking organizations with more than $50 billion in       assets other than branch assets to establish intermediate       holding companies in the United States. (Some foreign banking       organizations already had such holding companies.) In raising       the $50 billion threshold to $250 billion, the bill may raise       the question as to whether foreign banking organizations with       less than $250 billion must now be excluded from the       application of section 165 requirements.        I should say first that I do not think this is the best       reading of the wording of S. 2155. That is, I think the best       reading is that worldwide assets of large foreign banks are       be the basis for determining if they are covered by section       165, with the Board of Governors having continuing authority       to determine what level of U.S. assets of these large global       banks is the appropriate threshold for section 165 regulatory       measures promulgated in its regulations. I understand that       Chairman Powell indicated something along these lines in his       Senate testimony last week. However, it does appear that       there are other interpretations being advanced, including by       Secretary Mnuchin, whose testimony before the Senate Banking       Committee in January seemed to suggest that foreign banking       organizations with between $50 and $250 billion in assets in       the United States would be exempted from Section 165       prudential measures by S. 2155.        This result would be a grave regulatory mistake, one that       is almost incomprehensible in light of experience during the       financial crisis and the profile of many large foreign       banking organizations in the United States today. As I       explained above, many of the special section 165 requirements       are not especially relevant to nearly all the U.S. banks       currently holding less than $250 billion in assets. But that       is precisely because they are traditional commercial banks,       taking deposits and making loans. The U.S. operations of many       foreign banking organizations, on the other hand, contain       substantial proportions of assets in broker dealers and other       non-traditional-banking operations, where funding runs,       cross-activity counterparty exposures, and resolution       challenges are very significant risks. Indeed, the broker-      dealer operations of many of these banks are more significant       in the United States than in their home countries. They are       also susceptible to having their parents seek dollars from       them in order to meet obligations of parts of the foreign       banking organizations outside the United States.        Moreover, in sheer dollar terms, the group of foreign       banking organizations with between $100 and $250 billion is a       very important part of the U.S. financial system, holding       about $1.4 trillion in assets. Some of the foreign banking       organizations falling in this category are among those that       were most affected by the financial crisis; some have       encountered significant problems since then. U.S. regulators       do not have a window into the global liquidity positions, or       authority over the global risk management practices, of these       firms.        Again, like Chairman Powell I believe the best reading of       S. 2155 is that it does not affect the authority of the       Federal Reserve to apply section 165 standards, as       appropriate, on foreign banking organizations with over $250       billion in worldwide assets--the change from current law       being that it would not be required to do so for foreign       banking organizations with between $50 and $250 billion in       worldwide assets. But, given the enormous gap in the       regulation of systemically important foreign banking       operations in the United States that would result from a       different interpretation by a regulator or court in the       future, it is very important that this ambiguity be       clarified. In an environment in which judicial deference to       the interpretation of a possibly ambiguous statute by the       administering agency is no longer so predictable, it is       incumbent on Congress to eliminate such ambiguity wherever       possible.        The third feature of the bill that raises potentially       systemic concerns is section 402, which contains an oddly       and, I think, inappropriately targeted change in the leverage       ratio applied by the banking agencies. Removing funds       deposited with central banks from the denominator of the       leverage ratio only for banks ``predominantly engaged'' in       the custody business is troublesome for at least two reasons.        First, removing any assets from the denominator risks       sliding down the slippery slope of removing others. While       central bankers may argue their interests in not having       monetary policy affected at all, treasuries and finance       ministries may then argue their interests in not having       sovereign debt included. And, as we have already seen in the       Treasury Department's report in June 2017, some will go even       further, such as by arguing that margins posted in central       clearing facilities should be excluded, presumably to       encourage more central clearing. While these proposed       exclusions may be justified on the ground that the assets in       question are utterly risk-free (a clearly incorrect       proposition for central clearing margin), that argument       misconstrues the rationale of a leverage ratio, which is       precisely to serve as a backup mode of capital regulation by       measuring and controlling total leverage, not riskiness.       Going down this path of excluding assets from the denominator       would, in addition to being ill-advised legislative policy,       threaten the post-crisis improvement in the leverage of major       U.S. banks.        Second, it is hard to see the rationale for excluding a       particular type of asset from the denominator of the leverage       ratio only by reference to a bank's dominant form of activity       in ``custody, safekeeping, and asset servicing.'' Banks other       than custody banks engage in this activity. Taking this kind       of approach is very much out of keeping with the       traditional--and wise--practice of Congress in avoiding       legislating the details of capital requirements. It will       invite lobbying efforts for changing other details and,       thereby, risk both the coherence and the integrity of       regulatory capital requirements.        As I think you know, I am sympathetic to the situation of       State Street and Bank of New York. But, as I have suggested       previously, there is a much sounder way to address that       situation. Their difficulties stem from the fact that the 2%       enhanced supplemental leverage ratio add-on is applicable to       all eight systemically important U.S. banks, whereas the       risk-weighted capital surcharge varies based on the systemic       importance of each bank. Thus State Street and Bank of New       York have, in effect, higher leverage ratio ``surcharges''       than they do risk-weighted surcharges. This reverses what       should be, and has been, the traditional role of the leverage       ratio as a back-up to guard against excessive leverage build       up in good economic times that can come to grief in bad ones       (though the crisis revealed the pre-crisis leverage ratio       requirement, like risk-weighted capital requirements, to be       insufficiently robust). Modifying the enhanced supplemental       leverage ratio requirement by stipulating that it would not       exceed the risk-weighted surcharge, or by making it       proportional to that surcharge would be a much more       defensible policy approach.        My understanding, based on public statements from Federal       Reserve officials, is that the banking agencies are planning       to make changes to the leverage ratio. I anticipate that       those changes will relieve the State Street and Bank of New       York situations, though I hope without going so far as to       erode the value of the leverage ratio more generally by       encouraging the untrammeled growth of repo and other short-      term, runnable funding back closer to pre-crisis levels. In       any case, this anticipated action by the regulatory agencies       should address the situation of the clearings banks without       the damage to the framework for capital regulation which that       Section 402 would entail.        To recapitulate: In the interests of protecting financial       stability and guarding against systemic risk, I would urge       the Senate to:        1. Make clear that banks with between $100 and $250 billion       in assets will continue to subject to CCAR stress testing and       resulting capital distribution constraints;        2. Make clear that foreign banking organizations with $250       billion or more in worldwide assets are subject to more       stringent prudential restraints within the discretion of the       Board of Governors; and        3. Remove Section 402.        Thank you for your consideration of these admittedly       lengthy comments on S. 2155. As always, please let me know if       I can be of any further assistance.            Sincerely,                                              Daniel K. K. Tarullo.     So the question is, Why do we ignore these pleas? Let's  recap the problems with this legislation.   First, the bill puts American taxpayers at risk of another bank  bailout. It weakens stress tests for all large banks. In spite of what  my colleagues say, everybody that has commented on this bill--so many  experts that have commented on this bill understand that this is not  just about community banks; it is not just about the regional midsized  that go up to $250 billion. We can stress test for all large banks;  JPMorgan Chase, $2.5 trillion in assets; Bank of America, $2.3  trillion; Wells Fargo, $1.9 trillion. As if they haven't had enough-- done enough, made enough mistakes, violated the public trust enough  times. Citigroup, $1.9 trillion. These four banks--JPMorgan, Bank of  America, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup--hold 51 percent, more than half of  all industry assets, $8.6 trillion.   These banks have had a really good run since the crisis, since the  bailout. Remember, people didn't go to jail even though people in my  ZIP Code, in my community, in my State and in Pennsylvania and all over  the country--people lost savings, their homes, and their jobs. These  banks, which are more profitable than they have ever been in the last  couple of years, got a huge tax break just last December, and now we  are doing them a favor by weakening the stress test. All the country's  biggest banks took about  [[Page S1727]]  $239 billion in taxpayer bailouts. Without rigorous annual stress  tests, taxpayers can once again be on the hook if too-big-to-fail banks  collapse and we don't have the right tools in place to see it coming.   Second, this bill opens the door to weaker oversight of foreign  megabanks operating in the United States, the same banks that  repeatedly violated U.S. law. These are banks like Deutsche Bank in  Germany, the Trump business organization's personal bank; Santander in  Spain, Barclays in Britain, Credit Suisse, and UBS in Switzerland.  These are banks that violated Iran sanctions. They are banks that  repossessed cars from American service men and women who were serving  overseas. These are banks that were fined by the Federal Government,  and we are doing these foreign banks a favor in this bill.   Third, with the change of just one word, this bill forces the Fed to  weaken the rules even for the largest banks with more than $250 billion  in assets. Former CFTC Chair Gary Gensler wrote to the Senate this  month and said this change ``may subject the government to additional  lobbying and possible litigation from individual banks seeking  specially tailored rules.''   We know all of these regulators put in place by the Trump  administration--most of them with ties to Wall Street, and we know the  White House now looks like an executive retreat for Wall Street  executives--we know these regulators are going to bend over backward  for the big banks, and if they don't, they are going to be sued by the  foreign banks and by other big banks to open up those loopholes even  more.   Senator Dodd, one of the authors of the original bill, identified  this $250 billion threshold as the No. 1 reason he can't support the  bill. He said: ``It raises the danger of a cascading economic effect.''   Fourth, this bill makes another change to allow big banks to borrow  more money than they can afford, which, once again, puts taxpayers and  our economy at risk. The New York Times described this provision as  weakening rules ``aimed at keeping banks from being able to take big  risks without properly preparing for disaster.''   The Washington Post reported that JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup may  get a combined $30 billion windfall--$30 billion windfall--if this  provision passes. I am not making this up. This is what analysts are  saying this bill will do.   Fifth, this bill chips away at key mortgage rules put in place after  the last crisis. It includes provisions that weaken transparency,  inclusiveness, and fairness in mortgage lending. The bill makes it  easier for lenders to mislead families into mortgages they can't  afford, and takes away those families' right to take the bank to court.  It strips away key data used to monitor trends in mortgage lending and  spot discrimination against communities of color.   There was an amendment to fix that from Senator Cortez Masto that the  Republicans will not allow us to offer.   We know that in too many places across the country, people of color  are far more likely to be turned down for a loan for no good reason.  Without this data, we will not know when that redlining is happening.   Sixth--and this may be the most awful of all. For reasons I can't  even pretend to understand, this bill helps Equifax. It is the same  Equifax that let hackers steal 148 million Americans' personal data.  More than half the adults in this country had their personal data  breached because of Equifax--their birth dates, Social Security  numbers, and addresses--the same Equifax whose former executive was  just today charged with insider trading for dumping his stocks just  before the company announced its data breach failure.   In exchange for a small provision helping servicemembers watch their  credit, this bill forces them to give up their right to take Equifax to  court the next time the company's recklessness exposes sensitive  financial data.   If that weren't bad enough, the bill also gives Equifax a big new  business opportunity. This will give a company that put half the  American population at risk of identify theft the power to decide who  can get a mortgage.   What do the American people get in exchange for these goodies to big  banks and to Equifax? They get to pick up the check. The Congressional  Budget Office confirmed that this bill would increase the probability  of a big bank failure and a financial crisis adding to the deficit.  Even after the addition of language offsetting some of the costs of  this bill, the legislation would increase the deficit by $455 million.  Let me repeat that. The bipartisan Congressional Budget Office found  that this bill will increase the probability of a big bank failure and  a financial crisis. So don't tell me this bill doesn't roll back Dodd- Frank for the biggest banks.   In this town, no one seems to be able to find a single dollar when we  need to solve our pension crisis or invest in infrastructure or remove  toxic lead from kids' homes, but when the Big Bank lobbyists come  calling, the Senate waives its budget rules to do Wall Street's  bidding.   Let me also remind my colleagues how hard it was to enact the reforms  we passed after the last crisis.   Do you remember that lobbyist said that it was only halftime after  one of the few times in this body's recent history that Wall Street  actually lost, when we did the right thing 10 years ago?   In the move up to that bill, the Senate considered 14 separate  Republican amendments, where there were votes taken, to Dodd-Frank and  another 12 from Democrats. Of those 26 amendments, 5 of them were  adopted, 5 Republican amendments, 10 Democratic amendments. They were  voted on in a Senate where the Democrats were in the majority and gave  both parties the opportunity to amend the bill.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5  minutes.    During the conference committee, televised live on C-SPAN  for 48 hours, 17 Senate Republican amendments were accepted and 22  amendments from Senate Democrats. Contrast that with today: No  subsequent amendments were adopted. I credit Chairman Crapo for at  least allowing amendments, but that is as far as it went. On the Senate  floor, it has been worse. Democrats and Republicans alike were  completely shut down, not able to offer a single amendment.   We know how this place has worked the last year. All decisions are  made down the hall in the majority leader's office. The tax bill was  written there. The healthcare bill was written there. This bill was  written in a way that there are no amendments allowed on the floor, no  debate, no deliberation, no changes.   Lastly, fundamentally, the problem with this bill is that we are  entrusting the profiteers from the last crisis, the deniers of the last  crisis, with implementing big-bank giveaways. I am not willing to put  blind trust in the people who failed us before. Regulators Quarles,  Mulvaney, Otting, and Mnuchin are the people we are expecting to  regulate and save us from another bailout, save us from another  financial crisis, and save us from another implosion in our economy.  These are the people who failed us so spectacularly in the past, with  such grave consequences, and we are expecting them to protect us the  next time. Nothing in their public record has earned them this trust.   This is the collective amnesia crowd--the crowd who forgets what I  talked about at the beginning of the speech about what happened 10  years ago--but Ohio families haven't forgotten. People across this  country still struggle. People who have lost savings haven't been able  to entirely rebuild them. People who lost jobs are often in lower  paying jobs as a result. People who lost their homes--in my part of  Cleveland, I still see the devastation caused by this financial crisis,  the tens of thousands of homes in Greater Cleveland that were  foreclosed on. These are the people we are sent here to serve. What  this bill does for them and the issues facing their lives is impossible  to see.   I urge my colleagues to reject this bill. I urge my colleagues to  fundamentally ask themselves whose side they  [[Page S1728]]  are on. Are you going to vote yes on this and side with special  interests and Wall Street, or are you going to vote no and side with  taxpayers and homeowners and students and workers?   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
