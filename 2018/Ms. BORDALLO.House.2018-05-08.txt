 Mr. Speaker, today I introduce the bipartisan Wildlife  Conservation and Anti-Trafficking Act of 2018.   I want to first recognize my good friend and Republican colead on  this important legislation, Congressman  Don Young from Alaska, dean of  the House and a longtime conservation leader. I want to thank him for  his support as the original cosponsor.   I also want to thank the leading wildlife and marine conservation,  whistleblower, and animal welfare groups that have endorsed the bill to  date. The Wildlife Conservation and Anti-Trafficking Act will  strengthen enforcement against poachers, traffickers, and the global  trade in illegal wildlife and seafood products.   Wildlife trafficking; poaching; and illegal, unreported, and  unregulated fishing rank among the top global crimes, generating  billions in illicit profits each year for transnational criminal  organizations and extremist groups. In tackling the global wildlife  trafficking trade as our bill does, Congress can help to conserve  iconic wildlife and cut off illicit financing for groups responsible  for human rights abuses, political corruption, and even terrorism  worldwide.   Our bipartisan bill includes enforcement provisions passed by the  House in November of 2015, by voice vote, which will empower Federal  prosecutors and law enforcement to combat the global wildlife  trafficking trade. Importantly, the bill also recognizes the critical  role that whistleblowers can play in providing the actionable  intelligence needed to prosecute wildlife poachers and take down  trafficking rings.   By incentivizing whistleblowers on wildlife trafficking and related  crimes to come forward, Congress can increase enforcement and leverage  existing Federal agency resources and our legal system at no cost to  the taxpayers. Our bill also includes several provisions that will  support wildlife conservation worldwide by authorizing a comprehensive  international wildlife conservation program within the U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Service; also, stationing law enforcement and agency personnel  in wildlife trafficking-focused countries identified by the State  Department; and providing dedicated funding for wildlife, marine  mammal, sea turtle, and shark conservation at no expense to the  taxpayers.   I am especially pleased that our bill provides for marine wildlife  species which often go overlooked but are increasingly targeted by  poachers, traffickers, and illegal fishing. The bill also expands the  Marine Turtle Conservation Fund to make the U.S. territories eligible  for funding and to provide for the conservation of endangered  freshwater turtles and tortoises. Many of the world's freshwater turtle  and tortoise species could become extinct in the next few decades, and  all sea turtles found in our Nation's territorial waters are listed  under the Endangered Species Act.   U.S. territories are home to numerous marine turtle species,  including the endangered hawksbill and the green sea turtles native to  Guam and the western Pacific Ocean. Lastly, the bill builds upon the  success of two laws which I sponsored: the Shark Conservation Act of  2010 and the Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing Enforcement  Act of 2015.   Together with Congressman Young, we have put together a comprehensive  bill that advances wildlife conservation and continues American  leadership in tackling wildlife trafficking and the global trade in  illegal wildlife and seafood products. And we do all this with existing  Federal resources, at no cost to the taxpayers.   I urge all Members of the House to join me and Congressman Young in  cosponsoring the Wildlife Conservation and Anti-Trafficking Act of  2018.                            ____________________
