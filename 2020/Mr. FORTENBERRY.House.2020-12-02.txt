 Madam Speaker, when I was about 8 years old, I read  a book. It was on a famous New York Yankee first baseman named Lou  Gehrig. He was nicknamed ``The Iron Horse'' because of his great  athletic ability. He could hit, he could field. His durability was  legendary. As a great athlete, his character was marked by that ability  to adjust and overcome.   But then something happened. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis caused Lou  Gehrig to lose control of his bodily functions. That famous durability  of his was mocked by this cruel, unforgiving, neurodegenerative  disease, which is aggressive, that we now know as ALS. There was no  cure then and there is no cure now. ALS has also come to be known as  Lou Gehrig's disease.   But before he died in 1941, Madam Speaker, at a ceremony at the home  plate in Yankee Stadium, Lou Gehrig looked up at the crowd and he said:         For the past 2 weeks, you've been reading about a bad       break. Yet today, I consider myself the luckiest man on the       face of the Earth.    That story, Lou Gehrig's story, stayed with me as a child.   Now, Madam Speaker, as a Member of the United States Congress, fast  forward decades later. This same cruel disease has swept upon my own  family and we, as a family, quickly learned about the profound trauma  it has caused so many other Americans.   ALS takes about 2 to 5 years to destroy a body and exhaust a family.  It is 100 percent fatal. Its victims lose the ability to write and walk  and talk and eat and move and, finally, to breathe.   Earlier this year, several hundred persons deeply affected from ALS,  along with their courageous caregivers and friends, joined me and  another Member of Congress on the other side of this body to discuss a  legislative initiative.   We are all now really familiar with Zoom calls, and on that  particular Zoom call, on the little chat box on the side of the screen,  one kind person said: ``I wish all of America could hear this  constructive conversation between Members of Congress.''   Madam Speaker, we are in the midst of a horrific pandemic. COVID-19  has become a daily reminder of our fragility and mortality. It is an  urgent health crisis, and scientists and government regulators  worldwide are responding to this urgency, as are we, by accelerating  the testing and improving approval processes for treatments and  vaccines.   I recently discussed these dynamics with our Food and Drug  Administration Commissioner, Dr. Stephen Hahn, who was optimistic that  we may just be able to put this pandemic behind us by early summer.   So, Madam Speaker, I divert for a moment because I want to applaud  the  [[Page H6042]]  speedy success in getting vaccines quickly and safely approved, and I  am hopeful for their swift delivery to those most in need.   But as we continue to fight our way through this global pandemic,  imagine for a moment that we could harness that same determination and  goodwill to rethink how we fight numerous other diseases.   Madam Speaker, in over 50 years, there have been 50 clinical trials  for ALS. ALS patients have submitted themselves to these tests in  accordance with the rules of the current regulatory framework. Many of  them received placebo therapies. All of them stopped receiving  treatment when the trials were done, even if the therapies were  affording some relief. They sacrificed their lives to science, then  they quietly and gradually weakened and died.   As we all know, drug trials can drag on for a decade or longer. Most  ALS victims do not live that long. This overly deliberate regulatory  process does not match the urgency of the disease. It is not saving  lives; it is killing hope.   Madam Speaker, when a process isn't working, it is time to change the  process.   So, I am proud of something, Madam Speaker. We have a new bill. It is  bipartisan and it is bicameral. The House and the Senate are working  together on this. It is called Accelerating Access to Critical  Therapies for ALS. Let me put it another way; it is called ACT for ALS.  It accelerates access for patients with rapidly progressing diseases  toward investigational treatments through a new public-private program  coordinated by the Department of Health and Human Services.   The bill provides expanded access to promising therapies through  public-private funding, so that more patients suffering terminal  diseases, like ALS, can access potentially life-extending therapy. It  also works toward a more consistent and streamlined review of drug  applications.   ACT for ALS is just a beginning effort to make the regulatory and  research establishment more responsive to patients suffering right now.  It does so by attacking and correcting the injustices and inequities at  the core of our drug development and healthcare systems.   It is nobody's fault. We set up a research paradigm. We set up a  regulatory process in order to try to give order to the process of  helping people. But it is now time to reexamine some fundamental  premises, particularly in this disease category and others.   Currently, our ACT for ALS has 217 cosponsors, nearly half this body,  more and more every day.   Key to this effort, Madam Speaker, have been the many, many  courageous ALS survivors who are advocating for this bill.   Now, one of those is 36-year-old Mayuri Saxena.   I want to show you something, Madam Speaker. Four years ago, Mayuri  was diagnosed with ALS and today she can no longer stand or walk, use  her legs or arms, swallow without help, and she cannot speak.   But let's go back to that earlier point I made about Lou Gehrig's  durability. This is Mayuri's mind. By communicating with her eyes and  telling an artist what she saw, she imagined this beautiful painting.                                time  1945    I wanted to first bring it up here because it is quite extraordinary.  You could apply it to so many lessons around here, Madam Speaker. The  symbols of our two political parties, the elephant and the donkey, are  chaining themselves to someone in need with the hope of our great  country, our symbol, transcending above.   Mayuri sees that as her hope and America's hope. I have never seen  something so beautifully and eloquently expressed as a call for these  Washington words that we use, like bipartisanship. It is simply a call  to care and to compassion and to be smart.   This act is well-researched. We have gotten technical assistance from  the Food and Drug Administration, as well as the National Institutes of  Health. We have worked with those who are representing and advocating  for new movement to figure out the right set of processes by which we  again can establish a new procedure inside the Department of Health and  Human Services and expanded access to treatments. We can do this. As we  are rushing to the end of the year, we have got a lot of problems, and  we have very few days to solve them. But let's solve this one.   Madam Speaker, ALS affects 30,000 Americans, 6,000 of whom will die  every year from the disease. One in six of those, by the way, Madam  Speaker, is a veteran. One such veteran is Pat Quinn, by whom our  country, through his effort, was socialized and embraced this Ice  Bucket Challenge. He thought of that in order to raise global awareness  of the brutality of the disease. Pat Quinn just recently died.   Madam Speaker, it has been 75 years since Lou Gehrig himself died.  There is still no cure, though there are some now promising therapies  and drugs. Again, the ACT for ALS would allow expanded access now to  those promising therapies and drugs.   Madam Speaker, I have met so many beautiful people who have come to  my office to explain their own journey with ALS. These are people of  good heart. They are courageous, they are fighters, and they have  created a network of solidarity trying to rethink more creatively as to  how to attack through sound science the underlying disease. They  represent a movement that has a strong desire for the right type of  science and a real hope to stop the suffering.   Madam Speaker, COVID-19 has shown us one thing: we can act quickly if  we want to. We can act quickly if we are determined.   I think it is time to apply those lessons to diseases that have  silently killed so many for so long. We can create, and we have to  create, a more humane response and a responsive system for those in  need. Especially for diseases like this, where the time is so narrow.   Madam Speaker, about 4 years ago now, a young man in his thirties was  diagnosed with this disease. He noticed his hand trembling. He went  through a battery of tests, but the moment he noticed that, he knew-- for whatever reason he knew--in his heart of hearts it was the worst  case scenario. He knew it was ALS. I don't know how he knew, he just  knew. He and his wife struggled and hoped that it would be something  else that they could possibly live with. But he died this spring, about  4 years after he contracted the disease, leaving behind his wife and  his four little children. His name is Joe Gregory. He is my wife's  little brother.   Madam Speaker, for Joe, for the artist, for the imaginative artistry  of Mayuri, for the memory of Lou Gehrig and Pat Quinn, and for all of  those who are still suffering from this cruel, relentless, and  unforgiving disease, let's make hope real. Let's work to get this done.   As I said, I have worked and seen so many beautiful people, some of  whom have expressed to our office that their wish on their deathbed,  communicated through their families, was that this act would pass. When  I reflect on that, Madam Speaker, again, we have got numerous other  problems here. We have to get a budget done, we have to avoid a  government shutdown, and we probably ought to come together on a new  COVID-type relief package. I am working on that, too.   But how could I not speak?   Why did I read a book on Lou Gehrig when I was 8 years old that  stayed with me all these years?   I don't know.   But how could I not speak on behalf of these beautiful people who  just want us to do the right thing, not out of anger and not out of  protest, but out of solidarity to show that we can get things done  because we care?   When we act with our will and resolve, we can help.   Madam Speaker, one more thing before I leave, I keep reflecting on  those words of Lou Gehrig. I don't suffer from ALS. I don't pretend to  know the profound difficulty that causes in those individuals' hearts,  but I can say this: I believe that I am also the luckiest man alive  because I get to stand with people like this and try to help.   Madam Speaker, I thank you for listening, and I yield back the  balance of my time.                            ____________________
