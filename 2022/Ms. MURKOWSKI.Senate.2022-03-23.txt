 Mr. President, Senator Sullivan and I are here this  afternoon on the Senate floor, and we are here with heavy hearts. We  are joined in the Galleries by friends of Alaska because, last Friday,  our Congressman, Congressman Don Young--the Congressman for all Alaska  and the dean of the House, who served our 49th State ably and  faithfully for the last 49 years--passed away as he was flying home to  be with the people of Alaska. Seated next to his wife, Anne, he passed  peacefully and left this world.   There is no doubt--there is no doubt--that Congressman Young lived a  large and full life. He was 88 years young, and we always referred to  him as ``young,'' not old. He accomplished an incredible amount across  the many decades that he served Alaska and served his country, but that  doesn't make the loss any less sudden or any less devastating, and it  doesn't change the fact that we are now left with a hole the size of  Alaska in our congressional delegation.   We were a team. We were small but mighty. The Presiding Officer has  heard me, on this floor, talk about the Last Great Race, the Iditarod,  and that no dog team--no dog team--can make it without the leader. We  all know that. You have got the swing dog, and you have got the wheel  dog, and we have all kind of taken different points on that team, but  it has always been with Don Young.   I was home over the weekend. I spent the weekend there, reflecting on  Don Young's life and on his legacy. I had the chance to speak with his  wife, Anne, over the phone. I talked with his daughters--Joni, whom we  know well, and Dawn, her sister. I talked to a lot of friends who  shared some stories about our Congressman. Many of those stories are  probably not fit to print in the Congressional Record, but there was a  lot of reliving of the life and times of Don Young.   For those who didn't have the privilege of knowing Congressman Young,  as so many Alaskans did, he was really all of the things that have been  written about him and all of the things that have been said about him  these past several days. He was all that, and he was more. He was  larger than life. We keep saying that: ``larger than life.''   He was colorful--as colorful as they come. He could be tough; he  could be gruff; he could be very feisty, but he was also warm,  engaging. He was charming, but, most of all, he was passionate. He was  a passionate man about Alaska and Alaskans--to his very core. And he  was loyal. He was loyal and devoted to his family, to his friends, to  his staff who served him, and was loyal to the people he loved so  dearly.   So we think about Don as forever being Alaska, but Don's life didn't  begin in Alaska. He grew up in California, working on his family farm.  His father would read Jack London to him at night, and that inspired  him, later on, to head north. He served in the Army with the 41st Tank  Battalion. Then, after graduating from Chico State college, he answered  ``The Call of the Wild.''   He eventually made his way north to the village of Fort Yukon, just  above the Arctic Circle. He tried his hand at just about everything. He  was into construction. He was into mining. He taught at a BIA school in  the winter. He was a tugboat captain in the spring and summer. He  hunted. He fished. He trapped. He took well to Alaska, and Alaska took  well to him.   By then, Don had fallen in love with Alaska, and he was also head  over heels for his first wife, Lu, who was a bookkeeper from a  respected Gwich'in family. They married in 1963.   He was elected mayor of Fort Yukon the next year, but he didn't spend  much time as mayor. He moved on to the Alaska State House of  Representatives and then to our State senate, but where he would really  make his mark was at the Federal level, as a Member of the House of  Representatives, which he joined in 1973.    Initially, it didn't start out so well. He lost the election in 1972  to Nick Begich, only to win it in a special election in March of 1973  after Congressman Begich went missing after an airplane accident. Once  in office, Don Young never stopped winning for Alaska.   In his first year in office, Congressman Young helped to authorize  the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, which has been the economic backbone of our  State ever since. Not long after, his colleagues chose him as their  Freshman Congressman of the Year. There are so many, many legislative  accomplishments over the course of the Congressman's life--too many to  list here--but I will just highlight a few.   In addition to the pipeline authorization, he helped to establish the  200-mile fishing limit and contributed to the Magnuson-Stevens Act,  which has allowed Alaska to maintain its world-class fisheries. He  wrote the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act, which guides  the use of millions of acres of those lands. Congressman Young passed  legislation to open a small part of the non-wilderness 1002 Area in the  Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and he did this a dozen times before  we steered it into law in 2017.   Believe me, Congressman Young reminded me every time how many times  he had actually gotten it across the finish line in the House, but Don  never ever gave up. Given the way of the world now, his commitment to  energy security should be more appreciated than ever.   He enacted important measures as chairman of the Natural Resources  Committee and a landmark transportation bill, SAFETEA-LU, as chairman  of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. He was also a  strong, strong champion for Alaska Natives and Native Americans.   Don was pretty independent. He was independent in his thinking, and  he was not afraid to vote his conscience to help Alaska.   Just before he left Washington, DC, this past week, he was involved  in the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act and helped  considerably with the Tribal title in that act.   I also credit him--seriously credit him--for garnering enough  Republican votes in the House last year to ensure that the bipartisan  infrastructure bill could finally move across the finish line. He knew  that that measure was good for Alaska, and he said: Not only am I going  to give my vote, but I am  [[Page S1743]]  going to work to make sure that we have the votes over here to sign  this into law.   There are a lot of stories in this body about our former Senator,  Senator Stevens, being legendary and pretty tenacious in his pursuit of  Federal dollars to help build Alaska, but just know that Congressman  Young was right there, every step of the way, making sure that Alaskans  received what we considered to be our fair share.   On December 5 of 2017, Alaskans were just filled with pride for  Congressman Young when he became the 45th dean of the House--its most  senior Member. At the time, I gave him a little gift. It was a star  designated in his name. You can actually get a certificate that says,  ``This star up there is designated to you,'' but it was given as a  sentiment, reflecting his stature as the North Star of our delegation  and our northern State.   When you think about this remarkable journey that Don Young had--from  teaching fifth graders in Alaska, to running dog teams, to guiding  barges along the Yukon River, to becoming the longest serving  Republican Member of Congress of all time--of all time--and being the  most senior Member of the House of Representatives--of all that  Congressman Young accomplished and of all that he did for Alaska, you  have to know that this was no easy task. This was no easy task. For 49  years, he stood alone in the House of Representatives as the sole voice  for Alaska. We only have one Congressman for all of Alaska. Only seven  States have just one Congressman.    And, of course, Alaska is farther away from Washington, DC, than all  of those States, bigger than all of them combined, and our vast amount  of Federal acreage means that we have more issues and perhaps more  complicated issues that have to be addressed as well, but none of that  mattered to Don Young.   He took the long trips back home in stride. He would use his time on  the plane to meet people, to talk to them, to just have conversation,  try to understand their priorities and concerns, but he was making  friends.   He did the same here in Washington. He worked tirelessly here to  build relationships, build alliances that would help him help Alaska,  help address our State's challenges. It wasn't as if he was seeking out  bipartisan relationships necessarily; Don was just the kind of guy who  would make friends.   The record shows that Congressman Young was one of the top  legislators of our time. He was the primary sponsor of 123 bills that  became law. You go over to his office, and you will see pictures on the  wall of 10 different Presidents who signed into law different measures  that Don had participated in. Again, recall Don Young was one of 435  voting Members of the House and the only one there to represent Alaska,  and he was repeatedly named one of his Chamber's most effective  Members. Don Young was old school because his relationships really ran  on both sides of the aisle, starting with Speaker Pelosi, Leader  McCarthy, and spanning the spectrum of all who would work with him. He  really did work tirelessly to do what was right for Alaska because, at  the end of the day, that is all he cared about, and he was pretty open  about that.   Being a Congressman for Alaska requires every last bit of you. It  requires tremendous sacrifice from you and your family. If you don't  trust that, if you doubt that, just ask Anne Walton Young. Since they  married in 2015, she has been by his side literally every day, in the  office, traveling with him. She knows. She knows the work ethic of this  man, she knows the heart of this man, and she knows how hard he worked  for all of Alaska.   From his first day to his last day, 49 years and 13 days, Don Young  gave it his all. As a true man of his people, he was just the right  Alaskan to serve in the people's Chamber.   Senator Sullivan and I are going to have a lot more to say about our  dear friend, our partner, our team leader in the coming days and weeks.  We will have a number of occasions to honor his life and legacy,  including on March 29, when he will lie in state in Statuary Hall for a  well-deserved tribute.   For today, however, our reality is that for the first time in 49  years, Alaska does not have a Congressman in the House of  Representatives. For the first time in 49 years, Alaska does not have  Don Young there to defend, to advocate, and to legislate on our behalf.  And I am heartbroken and so are countless Alaskans and individuals  across the country whose lives happen to intersect with this legendary  legislator.   On Saturday morning, I got a text from a former staffer who left  years ago, a young man, and in his text, he says:         Don Young was the only Congressman for all of Alaska for       all of my life. I will miss him.    We have lost a giant whom we loved dearly and who held Alaska in his  heart always. We thank him for everything he did for us to build our  State and fulfill so much of our promise. We owe his family--his wife,  Anne; his daughters, Joni, Sister--a debt of gratitude for sharing him  with us for so long. Together with them, we mourn for our late  Congressman, Alaska's champion, and our dear friend, Don Young.   With that, Mr. President, I yield to my fellow Senator from Alaska.
