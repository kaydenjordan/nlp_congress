 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of  H.R. 986, the Protecting Americans with Preexisting Conditions Act.   I was proud to vote in favor of H.R. 986 yesterday to rescind the  Trump administration's dangerous effort to weaken lifesaving  protections for people with preexisting conditions under the Affordable  Care Act.   The Trump administration has been obsessed and relentless about  undoing the historic and meaningful gains made under the ACA. Here,  that means undermining the stability of the healthcare market and  allowing States to promote junk, so-called short-term, limited-duration  insurance options that directly discriminate against people with  preexisting conditions.   Let us not forget that before the ACA, a woman's gender was, in  effect, a preexisting condition. One-third of women who tried to buy  health plans on their own were either turned down or charged a higher  premium.   Republicans have no plan to improve healthcare, only to roll back the  progress made in the ACA, putting the health coverage of the 52 million  Americans with preexisting conditions in jeopardy.    I am proud of the progress that this House has made to protect  Americans' health coverage, and I look forward to continuing action to  expand access and lower healthcare costs.                            ____________________
