 Madam Speaker, I rise today to ask: What  the hell is happening in Washington?   I am not one to spend my time throwing bombs on this floor, but  during this single minute, another American will die from COVID, and  even more people are slipping into poverty because this town can't get  its act together.   I have had enough.   Millions of people can't get to work. They can't put food on the  table. They are missing rent or mortgage payments.   Since we passed the CARES Act, which was a strong step forward, the  best this town can do is finger-pointing.   It is disgusting.   Everyone believes we are incapable of doing our jobs, and right now,  we are proving them right.   The reality is, there is plenty of blame to go around, but Americans  need another stimulus check. They needed it months ago.   We need expanded unemployment back, especially now that cases are  exploding at a higher rate than at any other point during this  pandemic.   It is time to grow up. It is time to do what we are paid for. It is  time to do our jobs.                            ____________________
