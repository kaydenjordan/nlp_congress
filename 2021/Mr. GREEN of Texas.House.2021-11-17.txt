 Mr. Speaker, and still I rise, a proud, liberated  Democrat.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address systemic racism in the judicial  system. I believe one of the best ways to explain this and help persons  understand with some degree of clarity is to use an example.   Let's use an example of a 25-year-old White man. Let us assume that  he is jogging through a neighborhood near his home. Let's assume that  he is accosted by three Black men in a truck with a liberation flag on  it. And let us assume that when they accost him, one of them has a  shotgun and there is an encounter with this person, who happens to be a  Black man. The White man is jogging, the Black men are pursuing, and  now there is an encounter.   Let's assume that this Black male shoots the White man, and in so  doing, a case is brought to court by way of a video. Let's assume that  in this case, the prosecutor is Black, that the judge is Black, and  let's assume that the defense attorneys are able to select a jury that  has 11 Black people, one White person.   Mr. Speaker, this happens quite often in our country. As a matter of  fact, it can happen regularly in our country to Black people. Black  people don't have the luxury of being tried by juries with 11 Black  people on them. They are likely to be fewer than three. Black people  don't have the luxury of being in a  [[Page H6322]]  courtroom where the judge is Black, the prosecutor is Black, the court  reporter is Black, and the witnesses are Black. We have a moral  imperative to address this level of systemic discrimination. We should  do more than simply talk about it, however. Addressing it with words is  important, but we have to do more than this. We must do more than  desire to manage systemic racism. We want to end it. If we don't end  systemic racism, too many persons of color will continue to suffer, as  is the case in this country today.    We, in this Congress, can do something about this. We have a duty to  do something about it, and that something has to entail dealing with  what is called a peremptory challenge, which allows a lawyer to simply  draw a line through the name of a person and have that person removed  from the jury, assigning some specious reason for doing so, and end up  with a Black person being tried by a jury that is almost White--11  Whites and one Black.   The peremptory challenge is not something that is embedded in the  Constitution. It is not something that is required. Persons can be  removed from a jury for cause, but this cause, this peremptory  challenge, is the cause that we should take a look at because it is  absolute and it allows systemic racism to rear its ugly head in our  courtrooms.   I hope to present legislation addressing systemic racism by way of  the peremptory challenge.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   And still I rise, Madam Speaker, as a proud ally of the transgender  community. And I rise tonight with a special message. This message  means a lot to me because I truly believe that the pledge is correct.  We pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and  to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God with liberty  and justice for all.   All cannot exclude the trans community. All has to include the trans  babies and the children in Texas who are having to suffer through  debates about what they can do athletically. All has to include people  who lose their lives simply because they are being who they are.   I rise with a message of I am with you, I am your ally, and I live  today to live to see the day that transwomen will not have to live in  fear of dying because of who they are and trans children can grow up  and simply be children in this country where we pledge liberty and  justice for all.    Madam Speaker, and still I rise. And I rise on  this occasion to bring to the attention of this House H. Res. 746, the  Original National Domestic Violence Awareness Month Resolution of 2021.   H. Res. 746 expresses support for National Domestic Violence  Awareness Month and that Congress should continue to raise awareness of  this issue.   This resolution has 160 original cosponsors including 18 Republicans.  It is a bipartisan resolution. I am honored to say that the lead  cosponsor from Louisiana, Mr. Garret Graves, is a person who has been  very helpful in helping to get this resolution presented and get  signatures of persons who would be supportive.   Domestic violence is a more prolific problem than many realize.  Domestic violence is a problem that too often is concealed. Many people  don't report the fact that they are being abused. People are locked in.  They find themselves having to live with abuse because the abuse is  being perpetrated by someone that they love and someone whom they care  for but someone who does not care as much for them.   Nearly one in three college women say they have been in an abusive  dating relationship. Ninety-two percent of homeless women experience  severe physical or sexual abuse at some point in their lifetimes.   A 2020 survey by the National Network to End Domestic Violence  reported that 76,525 violence victims were served by domestic violence  shelters and programs around the Nation in a single day. Additionally,  11,047 requests for services went unmet--went unmet--because of a lack  of resources. We have to do more to help the victims of domestic  violence. Congress can do more to help the victims of domestic  violence. Congress should do more to help the victims of domestic  violence.   Domestic violence impacts individuals of any gender. One in four  women and one in seven men ages 18 and older will experience domestic  violence at some point in their lives. Women ages 18 to 34 experience  the highest rates per capita of intimate partner violence.   Domestic violence impacts individuals of any race. African-American  women experience intimate partner violence at a rate 35 percent higher  than that of White women and about 2.5 times the rate of women of other  races.                                time  1930    Twenty-one to 55 percent of Asian and Pacific Islander women report  experiencing domestic violence; that is, physical assault, sexual  assault, or both, during their lifetimes.   37.1 percent of Latinx females are victimized by intimate partner  violence in a lifetime. One in three Native American women will be  raped, and 6 in 10 will be physically assaulted in their lifetimes.   Domestic violence impacts individuals of any sexual orientation.  Sixty-one percent of bisexual women, 43.8 percent of lesbian women,  37.3 of bisexual men, and 26 percent of homosexual men experience  intimate partner violence during their lifetimes.   Too often, children are affected by domestic violence and sexual  assault. One in 15 children are exposed to intimate partner violence  each year, and 90 percent of these children are eyewitnesses to such  violence.   Children exposed to domestic violence are more likely to attempt  suicide, abuse drugs and alcohol, run away from home, and become  victims of human trafficking. Our children are suffering. Those who  witness these acts of domestic violence need help. We need to provide  more counseling for children.   Even when this tragedy occurs, it is shameful for children to have to  witness it. But more tragic than that, when children themselves are  victimized, they have to carry that memory with them for a lifetime.   One in 10 District of Columbia high school students reported  experiencing physical violence from a dating partner in the past year.  Half of youth who have been victims of both dating violence and rape  attempt suicide, compared to 12.5 percent of non-abused girls and 5.4  percent of non-abused boys.   One large study found that men exposed to physical abuse, sexual  abuse, and adult domestic violence as children were almost four times  more likely than other men to have perpetrated domestic violence as  adults.   The point to be made is, those who suffer from domestic violence and  abuse are likely to perpetrate domestic violence and abuse; not all,  but a good many.   There is a need for primary schools, secondary schools, and  postsecondary schools to educate students about the issues of domestic  violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking. Education is  the means by which many can avoid becoming victims. We must do more to  educate our young.   The term domestic violence is often inadequate because it fails to  capture the full extent of the impacts that the event can have on a  victim's life. The average cost of intimate partner violence over a  victim's lifetime for medical and mental healthcare services is about  $103,000-plus--that is for women--and $23,000-plus for men.   The term domestic violence also fails to capture how, in some  instances, domestic violence literally means domestic murder because,  on average, more than three women are murdered by their husbands or  their boyfriends in the United States every day.   Most murdered transgender women are killed by intimate partners.   However, in spite of all of this, there is hope. Survivors of  domestic violence are strong, courageous, and resilient, but they need  help. Surviving the physical and mental abuse requires more than simply  relocating. Many times, counseling is needed.   The strength that they have is something that we can admire, but that  strength can be fortified if they can have proper counseling so that  they can get the assistance that they need, not only to stabilize  themselves mentally, but also to understand that they are not the  reason for the violence being perpetrated upon them. Too often, the  victims believe that they are responsible for the actions of the  persons who are abusing them. They need help.   This is what we can do. We can help to make sure people understand  that victims are not responsible for what perpetrators do.   A recently released multistate study shows that the Nation's domestic  violence shelters are addressing victims urgent and long-term needs,  and are helping victims protect themselves and their children. Domestic  violence advocates provide lifesaving essential services. There is a  need to increase, not reduce funding for programs aimed at intervening  in and preventing domestic violence in the United States.   So therefore, I am so proud tonight to say that we should resolve  that the goals and ideals of Domestic Violence Awareness Month are  important; that these goals and ideals should be pursued; that this  House of Representatives can do more to help the victims of domestic  violence.   I would also add that this resolution expresses the sense that the  House of Representatives--that Congress--should continue to raise  awareness of domestic violence and its devastating effects on  individuals, families, communities, and support programs designed to  end domestic violence in the United States.   Madam Speaker, people ought not have to live in fear because they  happen to be in an abusive relationship. Yes, people can take their  issues to the police. Women can. But too often they have to debate  within themselves the consequences of going to the police, the  authorities, because they understand, many of them, that they have no  other place to turn to.   But thank God this Congress has provided enough money for shelters so  that many can leave the environment where the abuse is being  perpetrated.   This is a serious issue that we should all be concerned with. If we  allow the perpetration and perpetuation of domestic violence to  continue, it does not bode well for the fiber and fabric of our  country. This is a great country, and a great country can protect  people who are being abused in their own homes.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
