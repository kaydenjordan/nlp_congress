 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Protecting  Pre-Existing Conditions and Making Healthcare More Affordable Act.   I am proud to cosponsor this legislation, which is more important  than ever following the administration's court filing last week that  pushes for the complete and total repeal of the Affordable Care Act.   Now, I wasn't in Congress when that law was passed. I don't think it  is a perfect law, but there are components of it that are undeniably  positive:   It is a good thing that people with preexisting conditions can't be  discriminated against by insurance companies;   It is a good thing that young people can stay on their parents'  insurance until their 26th birthday;   It is a good thing that preventive care, like mammograms and cancer  screenings, and even annual physicals, can be covered without copay;   It is a good thing that millions of people in our country that now  have insurance for the first time are able to get the care they need.   Now, unfortunately, all of those positive steps are put in jeopardy  as a consequence of the administration's court filing.   Now, rather than unwinding the progress that has been made, we are  proposing to build on the success of the existing law. For example, we  propose an expansion of the tax credits available under the law,  reducing cost for low-income families and enabling more middle-class  families to be eligible for assistance to make healthcare affordable.   This is the beginning of the effort on healthcare, not the end. Folks  in D.C. shouldn't be sabotaging the American healthcare system; they  should be making it work for the people of America.                            ____________________
