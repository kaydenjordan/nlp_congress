 I thank the Presiding Officer for the recognition.   Madam President, I rise today as the ranking member on the Senate  Indian Affairs Committee. In our parlance on the committee, it is  called the vice chair. Normally, our committee is very bipartisan. It  was not so in this case today. In the debate, it was mentioned that  this was a negotiated package. It was not. I was not asked for input as  the vice chair of the committee. Nothing about this bill sent over from  the House was negotiated with me.   For the first time in 10 years, this body has just considered a bill  from the Committee on Indian Affairs using a cloture filing and  valuable floor time. Let me repeat that. For the first time in 10  years, this Chamber just debated an Indian Affairs bill using valuable  floor time and not unanimous consent.   For a Senate majority, floor time and cloture filings are the coin of  the realm, and this is the first time in 10 years that it is being  spent on a Tribal issue.   Over this decade, during which both Democrats and Republicans have  held a majority, Indian Country has seen its priorities sidelined.  Important legislation that touches the lives of Native veterans, Native  families, and Native communities--from Maine to Hawaii, from Florida to  Alaska--makes it out of the Indian Affairs Committee only to die  waiting on the Senate legislative calendar, often due to objections by  one or a small handful of Senators--legislation, for example, like the  Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination  Reauthorization Act, the Esther Martinez Native Languages Preservation  Act, the PROGRESS for Indian Tribes Act, and the Indian Tribal Energy  Development and Self-Determination Act Amendments of 2017.   These are all broadly supported bipartisan bills that have gotten  stuck in the legislative process for 5, 10, or even 15 years--all  broadly supported bipartisan bills that Indian Country needs. They  address pressing issues like homelessness, language loss, and economic  development, and all of these broadly supported bipartisan bills are  central to fulfilling our solemn trust and treaty responsibilities.   My colleague, the senior Senator from Montana, tells the same story  about his fight to gain Federal recognition for the Little Shell Tribe.  This legislation is important to Montanans and Tribes he represents.  This bill has been fighting for a day on the floor since 2008.   My distinguished colleagues from Washington first took up the fight  to get the Spokane Tribe settlement act signed into law back in 2003.   I am honored to work with so many colleagues who dedicate themselves  each and every day to fighting for Indian Country. But we can't do that  if Indian Affairs legislation is not given equal weight to other bills.   It is shameful that this full body does not consider and resolve  these and other important issues facing Indian Country. It is shameful  that when the Senate gives Indian Country its first shot in 10 years,  Republicans closed the debate to prevent consideration of other  pressing pieces of Indian Affairs legislation. I am amazed that there  will be no time for amendments, that there will be no time for this  body to do what it is supposed to do--deliberate, deliberate. That is  what we are supposed to do here.   Instead, the majority leader limits consideration to one issue,  chosen specifically to amplify partisan rancor. We should be working  together for Indian Country. The majority isn't doing that. It is using  a wedge issue to pit people against each other in an attempt to score  political points.   When Republicans were in the minority, Senator McConnell lamented the  lack of debate. He complained that legislation was ``dropped on the  floor with little or no opportunities for members to participate in the  amendment process, virtually guaranteeing a fight.''   As the majority leader said, simply and eloquently:         Bills should come to the floor and be thoroughly debated. .       . . This is the Senate. . . . Let the Senate work its will,       and that means  [[Page S2189]]       bringing bills to the floor. It means having a free and open       amendment process. That is legislating.    I couldn't agree more. We came here to craft legislation. We came  here to take tough votes. That process may take more time, more work,  and more cooperation, but it would lead to better outcomes for  everyone, and, most importantly in this case, it would lead to better  outcomes for Indian Country.   Let there be no mistake. Indian Country loses when we give in to  partisan rancor. We have seen this play out before. When the trillion- dollar tax cut was rammed through this Chamber without any input from  my Democratic colleagues, what happened? Indian Country and Indian  Tribes were entirely left out in the cold. There was not a single  provision for Indian Tribes in a trillion-dollar package.   On the other hand, we know what happens when bipartisanship prevails.  Senator Murkowski, my chairman on the Interior Appropriations  Subcommittee, and I were able to deliver big wins for Indian Country in  the fiscal year 2018 omnibus. We increased funding for the Bureau of  Indian Affairs by $204 million, and we increased funding for the Indian  health programs by another $500 million--that is almost three-quarters  of a billion dollars--because Democrats and Republicans decided it was  better to work for Indian Country instead of against each other.   As anyone in Indian Country will tell you, Indian affairs issues  transcend partisan politics. Native policy issues go to the core of the  trust responsibility, to the government-to-government relationships  enshrined in our Constitution and countless treaties. Sadly, that is  not true today.   I wanted a better deal for Indian Country. Indian Country had to wait  10 years for today's vote. We should have had a full opportunity to  bring other issues onto the table and to be added onto the bill in the  form of amendments. Housing, public safety, self-determination, and  self-governance are equally deserving of the Senate's consideration. We  could have considered legislation that would do more to unite us than  divide us, like the Native American Housing and Self-Determination Act,  which expired in 2013. This important program benefits Native  Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Alaska Natives.   In my home State of New Mexico, as in most of Indian Country, NAHASDA  is the primary source of funding for Tribal housing needs and  development. For instance, in Isleta Pueblo, 44 percent of households  are low-income. Without NAHASDA funding, the Pueblo would be unable to  address this crippling need. Reauthorizing NAHASDA would provide Tribes  like Isleta the certainty they require to meet current and future  housing needs. Instead, we only voted on one Tribal priority, the  Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act. I voted yes on cloture. As a longtime  advocate for Indian Country, I understand and respect how integral  Tribal sovereignty is to Tribal governance, and I am and always will be  an unwavering supporter of Tribal sovereignty.   I am also a supporter of strong labor protections and the working  families they protect in New Mexico and around the country. I support  collective bargaining and am against right-to-work laws that are being  pushed around the country.   The tough issue here is that for decades Tribes were treated as  States and local governments and not subject to the National Labor  Relations Board. Recent Board and court decisions have changed that in  some parts of the country but not others, resulting in a patchwork of  regulations. The previous administration proposed a compromise  approach, but neither side embraced it. I hope that changes. But no  matter the outcome today, I will continue to fight for Indian Country  and seek new opportunities to enact longstanding Tribal legislative  priorities.   I close with past advice from my colleague, the majority leader: ``If  you want fewer fights, give the other side a say.'' I couldn't agree  more, and I urge the majority leader to give us and Indian Country a  say.                            ____________________
