 Mr. Speaker, there is a crisis of crime on our city  streets. Violent crime is up double digits in Seattle, Portland,  Austin, Oakland, and major cities across our great country.  [[Page H3591]]    The increase in violent crime is the predictable result of liberal  cities defunding and undermining their law enforcement, like in Austin,  Texas, where the far-left city council cut $150 million from their  police budget. What did we see weeks later? A doubling in the number of  murders.   Just this week, the police chief of Oakland, California, begged  publicly for the city council not to cut the police department budget  because it would result in more crime.   When you cut law enforcement budgets, you reduce the number of law  enforcement officers. When you reduce the number of law enforcement  officers, more criminals will be on the streets.   This is not rocket science. Stop attacking, undermining, and  defunding law enforcement, and the crisis of crime will stop being a  crisis.                            ____________________
