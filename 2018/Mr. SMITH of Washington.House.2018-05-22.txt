 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 5 minutes.   Mr. Chairman, first of all, I want to start off by agreeing with the  chairman on the importance both of the bill, but also on the incredible  work that we do in a bipartisan manner.   I think the chairman has set the right tone for the committee. His  leadership makes all the difference in the world in terms of making  sure that we all understand that we are working together to produce a  product that is enormously important to the national security of this  country.   Not that we don't have our disagreements--we have many--but we do so  in a respectful way, always with the goal of what is the best policy  for our national defense. The chairman's leadership has set the tone  for that in a way that is helpful to all of us.   All 62 members of the committee also contribute, and, of course, the  staff. The staff has to look through all the amendments, all the  issues, and make sure that we are aware of them, and they do a fabulous  job. This is the one bill that we pass every year, and the work that  our staff does is always outstanding and always puts us Members in a  position to do the best we can on the bill.   So I appreciate the staff, I appreciate the bipartisan spirit in the  committee, and I look forward to having a 58th successful year in  producing a National Defense Authorization Act because, first and  foremost, it is incredibly important that we set national security  policy for this country.   As the chairman mentioned, we face an incredibly complex set of  threat environments. We need policy to figure out what the best  approach to that is. Most importantly, right now, after nearly 17 years  of war, we have really worked the men and women who serve us in the  armed services very, very hard, and there is a very real readiness  problem within our military, as we have underfunded that to fund the  short-term needs as presented by the conflicts that we have gotten  into.   I think the most important thing about this bill is it really begins  to pay that back. It begins to bring back up the readiness levels so  that the men and women who serve us are prepared for the fights that we  ask them to do. That, to me, is the most important point.   We can have a very robust debate about how large the military budget  should be, about what responsibilities we should take on, but wherever  we come out on that debate, when we decide this is what we expect the  military to do, it is incredibly important that we provide the funds  and training to make sure that they can do it.   Now, again, we can argue that they should do less, but in my mind, it  is completely unacceptable to say: Well, we have got so many  priorities, We don't know how to do it. We are going to ask you to do  all these things and then not have the men and women to get the  training that they need to be ready for that fight.   I believe this bill starts moving us in the right direction. It also  honors the agreement that we made just a few short months ago for both  FY '18 and, now, FY '19 in terms of what the defense and nondefense  numbers should be in the appropriations process. So I appreciate that.   There are several things; and as the chairman mentioned, in a bill of  this size, of this magnitude, $717 billion, it would be a miracle if  there were any one person who agreed with absolutely everything in the  bill. I am sure there is not. But the one thing that I would point out  that is most troubling to me is the endorsement of the nuclear posture  review that was just put forward by the administration.   I am very concerned, number one, that we are spending too much money  on our nuclear weapons arsenal going forward and what impact will that  have on those other needs that I mentioned just a minute ago. What  impact will that have on readiness? What impact will it have on our  ability to have the forces forward deployed enough to deter Russia, to  deter North Korea, to deal with China's rise in Asia? So I think we are  overemphasizing nuclear weapons, number one, in terms of the amount of  money that we are spending on them.   But equally as troubling, this bill authorizes low-yield nuclear  weapons for  [[Page H4369]]  the first time in a very long time. It even authorizes a low-yield  nuclear weapon for our submarines. I believe that that puts us down a  dangerous course. We need to do more to make sure that we are deterring  any possibility of nuclear war.   There is a huge risk as Russia rises back up, with what North Korea  is doing, now that we are not in the nuclear agreement with Iran, what  they might be doing, that we avoid miscalculation and stumble into a  nuclear war. Thinking that there is such a thing as a tactical nuclear  weapon, a weapon small enough that it doesn't really rise to the level  of the other nuclear weapons, I think, is a mistake.   And, yes, I know Russia is building them. So the question is: How do  we deter Russia? Well, I think we deter Russia in a very  straightforward way. We have over 4,000 nuclear warheads. We have more  than enough nuclear firepower to present a credible deterrent to what  they are doing.   We don't have to say: Well, if you use a small nuclear weapon, we  won't want to use a bigger one in response. We want to say that our  deterrence is: If you cross the red line of all red lines and use a  nuclear weapon, we will respond overwhelmingly. We want to make sure it  never happens.   So I think building low-yield tactical nuclear weapons is a mistake.  I also think it is incredibly important that we increase the dialogue  between our country and Russia and China and North Korea, nuclear armed  powers, to make sure that there is not a miscalculation and we don't  stumble into a nuclear war.   Overall, I think this is a good product. I look forward to the  amendment debate and look forward to supporting the bill.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin), the ranking member of the  Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 3  minutes to the gentlewoman from Guam (Ms. Bordallo), the ranking member  of the Subcommittee on Readiness.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 3  minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney), the ranking  member of the Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds  to the gentleman from Connecticut.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Tsongas), our ranking member on the  Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Brown), a member of the Armed Services  Committee and a veteran of our military. I appreciate his service on  the committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi), a member of the committee.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much  time is left on each side.    Mr. Chair, I don't have any further speakers  at this time. If the gentleman from Texas is prepared to close, then I  am prepared to close as well.   I yield myself the balance of the time.   Again, I just want to emphasize the most important aspect of this  bill is the bipartisan effort that we have done working together. There  are literally thousands of provisions in this bill. All of them are  important in their own way to helping make sure that we set the right  policy and make sure that the Department of Defense can be as strong as  is humanly possible.   One thing I didn't say in the opening remarks, that I do want to  point out, I particularly want to thank Chairman Thornberry on his  leadership on acquisition reform and reform in general--the idea of how  can we make sure that every dollar we spend at the Pentagon is spent as  wisely as possible. As we know that has not always been the case. I  think we made a number of reforms, more in the previous two years' bill  than in this one, but this one continues on that. I think it put us on  a path to having a more efficient and effective use use of dollars on  the Pentagon side.   We all look forward to that day, which is supposed to happen I  believe this year, when we actually get the full audit from the  Pentagon on where they spend their money. In these times of scarce  resources, it is incredibly important we get the most out of what we  spend.   And the last little piece on that point, I do worry about the future  from a fiscal standpoint. We are right now spending roughly 20 percent  more money than we take in every year, and that is projected to go up.  The debt to GDP ratio is over 100 percent and, again, is projected to  only go up.   We have got the deal for FY18 and FY19 which gives some degree of  predictability for our military--and that is good--because the last,  gosh, 8 years now, we have gone from CR to CR, couple of government  shutdowns, a number of threatened government shutdowns, and a large  amount of unpredictability which is a problem for the entire  discretionary budget--not just for the Department of Defense but every  other Department that is dependent upon the discretionary budget has  lived with uncertainty. That makes our government less efficient and  less effective. We need to lock in more predictability.   Now, traditionally at this point, this is when everyone says that the  Budget Control Act and the budget caps have got to go, and I agree with  that. The problem is you can get rid of the budget caps and you can get  rid of the Budget Control Act--and we certainly should. That was passed  back in 2011. It wasn't even passed for a good reason back then.   But even if you get rid of those caps, it doesn't make money  magically appear. We still have the debt and the deficit that we are  facing. We still have the crushing needs that we have, not just in the  Department of Defense, but in infrastructure and research and education  and a whole bunch of critical areas to the health and wellbeing of our  country.   Someone thought I was joking when someone talked about his ``fiscal  hawk credentials.'' I am wondering if anyone has fiscal hawk  credentials at this point when you look at the debt and deficit. We  have got to get that in order. Now I don't think we are going to  balance the budget tomorrow. I don't think we should. I think the  impact on the economy will be devastating, but we have got to get on a  glide path to a more fiscally sustainable situation or we are headed  for trouble.   I simply don't believe that you can spend 20 percent more money than  you take in forever and not have it be a problem. And everything you  want to know about how big a problem this is is contained in three  votes that we took over a couple month period.   There are many, many Members of Congress who voted for the tax cut,  which estimates say it is going to reduce our revenue by $2 trillion;  for the spending agreement, which increased our spending by $500  billion; and then, a week later, they voted for a balanced budget  amendment.   To say that that is a math problem is the understatement of the year.  It doesn't add up. We all say we want to balance the budget. We don't  want to raise taxes. We don't want to cut spending. That doesn't work  and a lot of different aspects of our government pay a price for that.   But the Department of Defense is one of the biggest. As the largest  portion of the discretionary budget, they pay the highest price when we  don't get ourselves on a fiscally responsible path, and national  security is at least one of, if not the most important function that  our government needs to provide.   So I think FY18 and FY19, those are good deals. The building code for  the future, we have got to get on a fiscally responsible path.   But, again, within this bill--and you have heard a lot of it from our  Members--there are a lot of good policies that I think are going to  make a very positive difference in terms of making our Department of  Defense work better and, most importantly, providing for the men and  women who serve our country and their families.    I thank the chairman. I thank the staff. I think, once again, we have  done outstanding work. I hope that we can get through the amendment  process, get this bill passed, and then go chat with the Senate about  getting the bill finished. They are marking their bill up in committee  this week, so I think we are on a good path to do that as well.   With that, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition,  although I am not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I support the gentleman's  amendment. I just want to comment on a couple of aspects of it.   I think it is incredibly important that we get more small businesses  involved. Sometimes the best technology, the best ideas, that is where  they start, and working with the Pentagon bureaucracy can be  overwhelming.   A large company like Lockheed Martin or Boeing doesn't have a  problem, but maybe the best ideas come from some small garage startup.  I think making affirmative efforts to make sure we reach out and get  those companies involved is something that is very important and  something we need to continue to do. Yes, we need to track the success  of it.   Given the record of some of the programs of record, I personally  would hesitate to judge them based on whether or not they made it into  a program of record. I know we have done some reforms where it has  worked where they don't have to get into a program of record. The  Pentagon doesn't have to go through all of the processes that are  involved with that. They just are able to say: I like that. We are  going to buy it.  [[Page H4557]]    In fact, that is one of the reforms that the chairman has been a  leader on doing is freeing up more opportunity, particularly when you  are talking about technology, to simply buy the best product instead of  having to do an RFP and a down select and going through a lengthy  process. So I agree with the chairman on that.   As we are judging whether or not these small businesses are truly  contributing to our national security, I would hope we would keep two  things in mind. One is having a program of record may not necessarily  be a measure of whether or not they are doing that; and two, not all  ideas work out, but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't keep pursuing  them. It is the Silicon Valley mantra that it is okay to fail. You  learn something from that. You build a better technology. And with the  rapid pace of technology, that is part of what we need to do as well.   I think these programs are critically important. The gentleman's  amendment will help with that. I support the amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, first, let me say I agree with  Mr. Nolan on a couple of key points.   Number one, I think the overseas contingency fund has come to be  relied on too much. Yes, it was created before the Budget Control Act,  but these wars have been going on long enough now that we ought to be  able to incorporate it into the funds. So I agree with him on that. But  completely zeroing out the overseas contingency fund, I think, is  irresponsible, because while I agree in some cases the terrorism threat  may be overblown, it is, nonetheless, real.                                time  1900    Yemen is always the best example. We went into Afghanistan after 9/ 11. We dealt with that. We thought we had al-Qaida contained. And then  we had the underwear bomber in Detroit and the package bombs that both  almost came into the U.S. and attacked us, and they came out of Yemen.  So we had to respond to that. We had to respond in our own self- defense. And that is part of what the overseas contingency fund funds.   So, if we wanted to reduce it, if we wanted to get more transparency,  I am all for that. But to simply zero it out would basically be to say  that we have all these wars and we really have none of them.   I am somewhere in between on that. So I can't support zeroing out the  overseas contingency fund, although I do agree with some of the  statements that the sponsor of the amendment made.   Mr. Chairman, because it zeros it out completely, I have to oppose  the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I agree very strongly with my  colleague from the Armed Services Committee, Mr. Rogers, that we need a  strong nuclear deterrent. Russia is primarily the focus of that, but  not exclusively the focus of that. China has nuclear weapons, North  Korea has nuclear weapons, Iran aspires to have them. Without question,  we need a strong deterrent.   My argument is that we have one. We have over 4,000 nuclear weapons.  We do have some low-yield nuclear weapons. We don't have them in the  standoff capacity. But more than that, what we need to communicate to  Russia is not that nuclear war is something of degree; that, basically,  well, if you were to use a low-yield nuclear weapon, we wouldn't know  what to do because we don't have one that is equally as small. I think  that is the exact wrong approach.    Our approach should be that nuclear weapons are the red line to end  all red lines. There is no such thing as a tactical nuclear weapon.  Even these tactical nuclear weapons that the gentleman talks about  Russia having, I think are some 100 times more powerful than the bomb  dropped on Hiroshima.   What we need to communicate to Russia is: If you use a nuclear  weapon, we will respond with nuclear weapons. So don't.   We don't need to build small nuclear weapons so that military people  can start to imagine a survivable nuclear war. This is the way people  used to think in the sixties and seventies when we came tiptoeing up  very close on more than one occasion to stumbling in to the conflict to  end all conflicts, a nuclear war.   If we start buying in to Russia's philosophy that a low-yield nuclear  weapon is, like, a manageable thing that you can use in a combat  situation that doesn't necessarily lead to a broader nuclear weapon, we  are running the risk of creating the very thing we are trying to  prevent.   We need a deterrent. We have a deterrent. We should not mince words  with the Russians or anybody else. Nuclear weapons are red line. We  will respond. And we will not trouble ourselves to make sure that our  nuclear weapon isn't bigger than yours. We will deter them in that way,  rather than running the risk.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I am pleased to yield 1\1/2\  minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Ruiz).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Schneider).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Ruiz).
