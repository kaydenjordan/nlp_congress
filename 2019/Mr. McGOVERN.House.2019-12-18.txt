 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules,  I call up House Resolution 767 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 767         Resolved, That immediately upon adoption of this       resolution, without intervention of any point of order, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       resolution (H. Res. 755) impeaching Donald John Trump,       President of the United States, for high crimes and       misdemeanors. The amendment in the nature of a substitute       recommended by the Committee on the Judiciary now printed in       the resolution shall be considered as adopted. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the resolution, as       amended, to adoption without intervening motion or demand for       division of the question except as follows:         (a) The resolution, as amended, shall be debatable for six       hours equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary or their       respective designees.        (b) The question of adoption of the resolution, as amended,       shall be divided between the two articles.        Sec. 2.  During consideration of House Resolution 755, only       the following persons shall be admitted to the Hall of the       House or rooms leading thereto:         (a) Members of Congress.        (b) The Delegates and the Resident Commissioner.        (c) The President and Vice President of the United States.        (d) Other persons as designated by the Speaker.        Sec. 3.  After adoption of House Resolution 755, it shall       be in order without intervention of any point of order to       consider in the House a resolution appointing and authorizing       managers for the impeachment trial of Donald John Trump,       President of the United States, if offered by the chair of       the Committee on the Judiciary or his designee. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the resolution to       adoption without intervening motion or demand for division of       the question except 10 minutes of debate equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on the Judiciary. No other resolution incidental to       impeachment relating to House Resolution 755 shall be       privileged during the remainder of the One Hundred Sixteenth       Congress.        Sec. 4.  The chair of the Committee on the Judiciary may       insert in the Congressional Record such material as he may       deem explanatory of--         (a) House Resolution 755, not later than the date that is       5 legislative days after adoption thereof; and        (b) the resolution specified in section 3 of this       resolution, not later than the date that is 5 legislative       days after adoption thereof.   [[Page H12116]]                                      Point of Order     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Oklahoma  (Mr. Cole), my good friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I  may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded  is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, on Tuesday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a closed rule for House Resolution 767, providing for  consideration of H. Res. 755, impeaching Donald John Trump, President  of the United States, for high crimes and misdemeanors.   The rule provides 6 hours of debate equally divided and controlled by  the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary  or their designees. The rule provides that the question of adoption of  the resolution shall be divided between two articles. The rule limits  access to the House floor. It provides, at any time after adoption of  H. Res. 755, for consideration of a resolution appointing and  authorizing managers for the impeachment trial, if offered by the chair  of the Committee on the Judiciary, debatable for 10 minutes.   No resolution incidental to impeachment relating to H. Res. 755 shall  be privileged during the remainder of the 116th Congress. Finally, the  rule provides that the chair of the Committee on the Judiciary may  insert explanatory material in the Congressional Record.   Madam Speaker, 232 years ago, as he walked out of the Constitutional  Convention in Philadelphia, Benjamin Franklin stated that the Founders  had just created ``a republic, if you can keep it.'' He understood that  nothing was preordained, that our Nation would continue to be shaped  decision-by-decision, vote-by-vote, not by some other leaders in some  other time but day in and day out, both through the regular work of  government and during historic moments like the one we face today.   Our Founders crafted the fundamentals of government to guide us,  passages like Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution, giving this  Chamber the sole power of impeachment. But nowhere does it list exactly  what constitutes a high crime or misdemeanor.   In their wisdom, the Founders understood they could not anticipate  what the future would bring. They gave subsequent generations--us--the  chance to decide precisely what our government would become, to decide  with each passing day what a nation defined by the rule of law is  willing to tolerate.   That is what brings us here today, to decide nearly two-and-a-half  centuries later whether the United States is still a nation where no  one is above the law or whether America becomes a land run by those who  act more like kings or queens, as if the law doesn't apply to them.   Yes, Madam Speaker, this really is that serious.   Over the past several months, the House of Representatives has been  conducting an impeachment inquiry into the 45th President of the United  States, Donald John Trump.   Our inquiry is simply to answer the following question: Did President  Trump and his top advisers corruptly withhold official government  actions to obtain an improper advantage in the next election?   We now know, through the hard work of our investigative committees,  and because of the President's own admission, that the answer to that  question is yes. The President withheld congressionally approved  military aid to Ukraine, a country under siege, not to fight corruption  but to extract a personal political favor. President Trump refused to  meet with Ukraine's President in the White House until he completed  this scheme.    All the while, leaders in Russia, the very nation holding a large  part of Ukraine hostage, the very nation that interfered with our  elections, had another meeting in the Oval Office just last week.   The President of the United States endangered our national security.  The President undermined our democracy. And the President, a successor  to the same office as George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, betrayed  his oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the  United States.   These aren't opinions. These are uncontested facts.   Now, I have read the details of the July 25 phone call with President  Zelensky, where President Trump said: ``I would like you to do us a  favor, though.'' I have seen the televised press conference where his  Chief of Staff openly admitted to this deal and told the Nation to  ``just get over it.''   Hours and hours of depositions by the Committee on Intelligence,  Committee on Oversight and Reform, and Committee on Foreign Affairs  have been conducted where witnesses outlined the President's direct  involvement in this scheme.   The evidence is as clear as it is overwhelming. If a President  undermining our national security and using the Federal Government for  his own selfish, personal gain is not impeachable conduct, then, Madam  Speaker, I don't know what is.   I have heard some on the other side suggest this process is about  overturning an election. That is absurd. This is about protecting our  democracy.   These facts are beyond dispute. The only question now is whether we  are willing to tolerate such conduct, not just today by President Trump  but, furthermore, by any President of either party. To not act would  set a dangerous precedent, not just for this President, but for every  future President.   Madam Speaker, 11 months ago, many of us took an oath right here in  this Chamber. I have had the privilege to take that oath 12 times now,  and I believe it is not just for show. It is a contract between each of  us and the people we represent to place the national interest above  partisan interests and to preserve those laws that make our country  unique. We cannot reconcile the President's abuse of power  [[Page H12117]]  and obstruction of Congress with the oath of office that we took.   Madam Speaker, we are being tested on something greater than our  ability to toe a party line, something more than our ability to score  the next great television sound bite. This is a democracy-defining  moment.   History will judge us by whether we keep intact that fragile republic  handed down to us by our forebearers more than 200 years ago or whether  we allow it to be changed forever. For the sake of our country's  future, I hope, and I pray, that my colleagues will make the right  decision.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter that I  sent with regard to the Members' day.                                                 Committee on Rules                                         House of Representatives                                  Washington, DC, December 16, 2019.      Hon. Tom Cole,      Ranking Republican,      House Committee on Rules, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Cole: Thank you for your letter dated December 5,       2019, regarding a minority day of hearings on the topic of       ``The Impeachment Inquiry into President Donald J. Trump:       Constitutional Grounds for Presidential Impeachment.'' I know       that it comes from a place of respect for this institution       and for the gravity of the matters at hand, and I share your       desire to ensure that this process is in compliance with the       House rules.        You are correct that it is incumbent on committee chairmen       to schedule such a hearing, following a request of the       minority members of the Committee pursuant to clause 20(j)(1)       of rule XI. After a careful review of the legislative history       of the rule, the plain text of the rule, and Chairman       Nadler's December 12, 2019, ruling, I have concluded that       Chairman Nadler has not violated either the spirit or the       letter of the rule.        At the hearing in question, the Judiciary Committee       minority requested and received a witness. The legislative       history of clause 20(j)(1) of rule XI makes clear that the       intent was to ensure the minority position is represented in       hearings, codifying the existing practice of honoring witness       requests. The Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress       proposed this change in their 1966 final recommendations,       suggesting that a minimum safeguard be established for       ``those infrequent instances when witnesses representing the       minority position are not allotted time.'' The Rules       Committee report on the Legislative Reorganization Act of       1970, which first created the rule, stated that ``by custom,       committees ordinarily honor requests from their minority       party members to call certain witnesses. Section 114(b) will       make this a matter of right.''        Consistent with this original purpose, the rule has largely       been used as leverage for the minority to ensure they are not       shut out of hearings. It is standard practice across       committees for the minority to negotiate adding minority       witnesses to the main panels rather than holding a minority       day--not to add witnesses in addition to holding a minority       day. In the rare instance the minority is shut out, the rule       provides them a guarantee that the committee will hear from       their side on the topic at hand.        The Rules Committee report specifies that in creating this       right, ``We do not look upon this as an authorization for       delaying tactics but rather as good legislative practice.''       In this instance, Chairman Nadler has complied with the       spirit of this good legislative practice as well as following       modern committee practice. He accommodated the Judiciary       Committee minority's request to place Professor Jonathan       Turley on the main witness panel, ensuring minority views on       the constitutional ground for presidential impeachment were       represented.        Chairman Nadler has also followed the letter of the rule by       agreeing to work with the minority to schedule a hearing.       According to clause 20(j)(1) of rule XI, ``Whenever a hearing       is conducted by a committee on a measure or matter, the       minority members of the committee shall be entitled, upon       request to the chair by a majority of them before the       completion of the hearing, to call witnesses selected by the       minority to testify with respect to that measure or matter       during at least one day of hearing thereon.''        As Chairman Nadler correctly stated in his ruling, ``the       House rule does not require [him] to schedule a hearing on a       particular day, nor does it require [him] to schedule the       hearing as a condition precedent to taking any specific       legislative action.'' No precedent exists requiring a       minority day of hearings to be scheduled before a matter is       reported out of committee. In fact, very little precedent       exists regarding this rule at all, because it is typically       used as a negotiating tool and rarely invoked in practice.        The recent practice of the Judiciary Committee, in       particular, has not been to delay business in order to       schedule a minority day hearing. In his ruling, Chairman       Nadler cited a 2018 example in which he and other members       properly requested a minority day hearing and never received       a response to their request from then-Chairman Goodlatte, let       alone a hearing. That was a clear violation of clause 2(j)(1)       of rule XI. In this case, however, Chairman Nadler has       appropriately said that he will work with the minority to       schedule their hearing.        Chairman Nadler neither shut the minority out of the       hearing on the constitutional grounds of impeachment, nor did       he refuse to schedule a hearing. The process we set up       through H. Res. 660 even ensured that the President and his       counsel could participate in the Judiciary Committee, though       they chose not to avail themselves of that right.        Impeachment is a solemn responsibility, and I appreciate       your concern that we undertake the process in accordance with       the House rules. In these partisan times, I am truly grateful       for the professional and collegial manner in which members of       this committee conduct themselves. The fact that we are able       to work together even when we sometimes disagree on the       specifics gives me hope for this institution.            Sincerely,                                                 James P. McGovern,                                Chairman, House Committee on Rules.     Madam Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.   I think it is important to correct the Record that there were zero  points of order that lie against H. Res. 755.   We are here to talk about the President's behavior, and that is what  I think we all should be focused on, not just process. But I want to  just say that I am proud of the process.   Democrats and Republicans have had equal opportunity to participate  in the months-long impeachment inquiry. Members of both parties have  been involved at every stage of this process, from sitting in and  asking questions in closed-door depositions to questioning witnesses in  open hearings.   The committees took more than 100 hours of deposition testimony from  17 witnesses and held seven public hearings, which included Republican- requested witnesses. They produced a 300-page public report that laid  out their findings of evidence.   The Judiciary Committee then took that report and conducted two  public hearings evaluating the evidence and the legal standard for  impeachment before reporting out the two articles.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself an additional 15 seconds.   President Trump was given the opportunity to participate in the  Judiciary Committee's review of the evidence presented against him. He  chose not to participate. And President Trump, to date, has not  provided any exculpatory evidence but, instead, has blocked numerous  witnesses from testifying about his actions.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina  (Mr. Clyburn), the majority whip.    I do not.    Madam Speaker, I do not.    Madam Speaker, the gentleman is passionate about  records. I should remind him that we have gotten no records from this  White House, not a single document.   At this time I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida  (Ms. Shalala), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, if Republicans want to defend the  President's indefensible behavior, they can do so, but I would urge my  colleagues to stand up for the Constitution and to stand up for this  country and our democracy.   I now yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  DeSaulnier), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentleman from California.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Torres), a distinguished member of the Rules  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  New Mexico (Mr. Lujan), the Assistant Speaker.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Clark).    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record page 69 of the  Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence's November 20 open hearing  where Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper testified that  the Department of Defense was not able to distribute all of the aid,  with $35 million not provided, since it was released so late.        Quick question for you.        And I think just one question for you, Secretary Hale.        Ms. Cooper, was DOD able to put all the security assistance       funds into contract before the end of the fiscal year?        Ms. Cooper. No, sir.        Mr. Maloney. And how much were they not able to obligate?       What was left unobligated?        Ms. Cooper. I believe the figure was 35 million. It's--we       were able to actually obligate 88 percent, total.        Mr. Maloney. And I think you mentioned that you were able       because of legislation that Congress passed, continuing       resolution, to do that. Is that right?        Ms. Cooper. So the remainder we are in the process of       obligating--        Mr. Maloney. Excuse me. The remainder.        Ms. Cooper.--right now because of the provision in the       continuing resolution.        Mr. Maloney. Right. So, but for literally an act of       Congress, you couldn't have spent all the money.        Ms. Cooper. If we had not received the provision in the       continuing resolution, we would have obligated 88 percent but       not the full amount.        Mr. Maloney. Right. Which, of course, would be a violation       of law, to not spend money that Congress appropriated.        Ms. Cooper. Sir, I am not a lawyer, but that is my       understanding.        Mr. Maloney. Sure. Thank you.        Secretary Hale, where were you born?        Mr. Hale. Ann Arbor, Michigan.        Mr. Maloney. And is your family from Ireland? Am I right       about that?    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a November 18 AP  article entitled, ``U.S. officials knew of Ukraine's Trump anxiety.''                 [From the Associated Press, Nov. 18, 2019]               U.S. Officials Knew of Ukraine's Trump Anxiety                 (By Desmond Butler and Michael Biesecker)         Washington (AP)--U.S. State Department officials were       informed that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was       feeling pressure from the Trump administration to investigate       former Vice President Joe Biden even before the July phone       call that has led to impeachment hearings in Washington, two       people with knowledge of the matter told The Associated       Press.        In early May, officials at the U.S. Embassy iri Kyiv,       including then-Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, were told       Zelenskiy was seeking advice on how to navigate the difficult       position he was in, the two people told the AP. He was       concerned President Donald Trump and associates were pressing       him to take action that could affect the 2020 U.S.       presidential race, the two individuals said. They spoke on       condition of anonymity because of the diplomatic and       political sensitivity of the issue.        State Department officials in Kyiv and Washington were       briefed on Zelenskiy's concerns at least three times, the two       sources said. Notes summarizing his worries were circulated       within the department, they said.        The briefings and the notes show that U.S. officials knew       early that Zelenskiy was feeling pressure to investigate       Biden, even though the Ukrainian leader later denied it in a       joint news conference with Trump in September.        Congressional Republicans have pointed to that public       Zelenskiy statement to argue that he felt no pressure to open       an investigation, and therefore the Democrats' allegations       that led to the impeachment hearings are misplaced.        ``Both presidents expressly have stated there was no       pressure, no demand, no conditions, no blackmail, no       corruption,'' one Republican lawmaker, John Ratcliffe of       Texas, argued on the first day of public hearings last week.        The central allegation in the impeachment inquiry is that       Trump, through his allies, demanded that Ukraine, which is       fending off Russian aggression, launch an investigation that       would benefit him politically in exchange for crucial       military and strategic support.        Witnesses have detailed, in closed-door depositions and       public impeachment hearings, that allies of Trump pressed       Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son while withholding       military aid and a coveted meeting between the newly elected       Zelenskiy and Trump.        The U.S. briefings--and contemporaneous notes on       Zelenskiy's early anxiety about Trump's interest in an       investigation--suggest that Democrats have evidence in reach       to contradict Republican arguments that Zelenskiy never felt       pressure to investigate Biden.        The Associated Press reported last month about Zelenskiy's       meeting on May 7 with,  [[Page H12123]]       two top aides, as well as Andriy Kobolyev, head of the state-      owned natural gas company Naftogaz, and Amos Hochstein, an       American who sits on the Ukrainian company's supervisory       board. Ahead of the meeting, Hochstein told Yovanovitch, the       U.S. ambassador, why he was being called in.        Zelenskiy' s office has not replied to requests for comment       about the May 7 meeting.        Notes circulated internally at the State Department       indicated that Zelenskiy tried to mask the real purpose of       his May 7 meeting--which was to talk about political problems       with the White House--by saying it was about energy, the two       people with knowledge of the matter said.        After the meeting with Zelenskiy, Hochstein separately       briefed two U.S. Embassy officials, Suriya Jayanti and Joseph       Pennington, about Zelenskiy's concerns, said the two people       who spoke to the AP. Jayanti and Pennington took notes on the       meeting, the people said.        Hochstein told the embassy officials about Zelenskiy's       concerns and then traveled to Washington to update Y       ovanovitch on the meeting. The ambassador, who was facing a       smear campaign, had just been called back to Washington,       where she was informed that she no longer had the confidence       of the president. She was relieved of her duties as       ambassador on May 20.        Jayanti was also one of three witnesses to a phone call in       which Trump discussed his interest in an investigation of       Biden with his ambassador to the European Union, Gordon       Sondland. The call occurred while Sondland was having lunch       with three embassy officials in Kyiv. David Holmes, political       counsel at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, has already detailed to       House investigators what he overheard. Jayanti and the third       witness, Tara Maher, have not been interviewed.        Hochstein, a former diplomat who advised Biden on Ukraine       matters during the Obama administration, has also not been       questioned in the impeachment proceedings.        The Republican arguments about Zelenskiy's lack of concern       stem from a Sept. 25 joint media appearance by the American       and Ukrainian leaders in which Zelenskiy discussed the July       call with Trump that effectively launched the impeachment       inquiry.        The appearance came shortly after Trump released a rough       transcript of the call.        ``You heard that we had, I think, good phone call. It was       normal. We spoke about many things. And I--so I think, and       you read it, that nobody pushed--pushed me,'' Zelenskiy said       in the appearance with Trump on the sidelines of the U.N.       General Assembly meeting in New York.        ``In other words, no pressure,'' Trump spoke up to add.        In the impeachment hearings, Democrats have countered that       Zelenskiy's public comments came when he was trying to calm       the waters with the U.S. president in the immediate wake of       the transcript's release. The burgeoning scandal has brought       further uncertainty for Ukraine with its most important       Western partner as the country faces simmering conflict with       Russia. Zelenskiy's May 7 meeting suggests that he had been       concerned about U.S. support from the start.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Mrs. Trahan).    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record an October 23,  2019, New York Times article entitled ``Ukraine Knew of Aid Freeze by  Early August, Undermining Trump Defense.''                  [From The New York Times, Oct. 23, 2019]   Ukraine Knew of Aid Freeze by Early August, Undermining Trump Defense  top officials were told in early august about the delay of $391 million   in security assistance, undercutting a chief argument president trump                     has used to deny any quid pro quo.                 (By Andrew E. Kramer and Kenneth P. Vogel)         Kiev, Ukraine--To Democrats who say that President Trump's       decision to freeze $391 million in military aid was intended       to bully Ukraine's leader into carrying out investigations       for Mr. Trump's political benefit, the president and his       allies have had a simple response: There was no quid pro quo       because the Ukrainians did not know assistance had been       blocked.        But then on Tuesday, William B. Taylor Jr., the top United       States diplomat in Kiev, told House impeachment investigators       that the freeze was directly linked to Mr. Trump's demand.       That did not deter the president, who on Wednesday       approvingly tweeted a quote by a congressional Republican       saying neither Mr. Taylor nor any other witness had       ``provided testimony that the Ukrainians were aware that       military aid was being withheld.''        In fact, word of the aid freeze had gotten to high-level       Ukrainian officials by the first week in August, according to       interviews and documents obtained by The New York Times.        The problem was not bureaucratic, the Ukrainians were told.       To address it, they were advised, they should reach out to       Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff,       according to the interviews and records.        The timing of the communications, which have not previously       been reported, shows that Ukraine was aware the White House       was holding up the funds weeks earlier than acknowledged.        It also means that the Ukrainian government was aware of       the freeze during most of the period in August when Mr.       Trump's personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani and two American       diplomats were pressing President Volodymyr Zelensky of       Ukraine to make a public commitment to the investigations.  [[Page H12124]]         The communications did not explicitly link the assistance       freeze to the push by Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani for the       investigations. But in the communications, officials from the       United States and Ukraine discuss the need to bring in the       same senior aide to Mr. Zelensky who had been dealing with       Mr. Giuliani about Mr. Trump's demands for the       investigations, signaling a possible link between the       matters.        Word of the aid freeze got to the Ukrainians at a moment       when Mr. Zelensky, who had taken office a little more than       two months earlier after a campaign in which he promised to       root out corruption and stand up to Russia, was off balance       and uncertain how to stabilize his country's relationship       with the United States.        Days earlier, he had listened to Mr. Trump implore him on a       half-hour call to pursue investigations touching on former       Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and a debunked conspiracy       theory about Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 hacking of the       Democratic National Committee. Mr. Zelensky's efforts to       secure a visit to the White House--a symbolic affirmation of       support he considered vital at a time when Russia continued       to menace Ukraine's eastern border--seemed to be stalled.       American policy toward Ukraine was being guided not by career       professionals but by Mr. Giuliani.        Mr. Taylor testified to the impeachment investigators that       he was told it was only on the sidelines of a Sept. 1 meeting       between Mr. Zelensky and Vice President Mike Pence in Warsaw       that the Ukrainians were directly informed by Gordon D.       Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union,       that the aid would be dependent on Mr. Zelensky giving Mr.       Trump something he wanted: an investigation into Burisma, the       company that had employed Mr. Biden's younger son, Hunter       Biden.        American and Ukrainian officials have asserted that Ukraine       learned that the aid had been held up only around the time it       became public through a news article at the end of August.        The aid freeze is drawing additional scrutiny from the       impeachment investigators on Wednesday as they question Laura       K. Cooper, a deputy assistant defense secretary for Russia,       Ukraine and Eurasia. This month, Democrats subpoenaed both       the Defense Department and the White House Office of       Management and Budget for records related to the assistance       freeze.        As Mr. Taylor's testimony suggests, the Ukrainians did not       confront the Trump administration about the freeze until they       were told in September that it was linked to the demand for       the investigations. The Ukrainians appear to have initially       been hopeful that the problem could be resolved quietly and       were reluctant to risk a public clash at a delicate time in       relations between the two nations.        ``They didn't even know the money wasn't paid,'' Mr. Trump       wrote on Twitter last month.        The disclosure that the Ukrainians knew of the freeze by       early August corroborates, and provides additional details       about, a claim made by a C.I.A. officer in his whistle-blower       complaint that prompted the impeachment inquiry by House       Democrats.        ``As of early August, I heard from U.S. officials that some       Ukrainian officials were aware that U.S. aid might be in       jeopardy, but I do not know how or when they learned of it,''       the anonymous whistle-blower wrote. The complainant said that       he learned that the instruction to freeze the assistance       ``had come directly from the president,'' and said it ``might       have a connection with the overall effort to pressure       Ukrainian leadership.''        Publicly, Mr. Zelensky has insisted he felt no pressure to       pursue the investigations sought by Mr. Trump.        ``There was no blackmail,'' Mr. Zelensky said at a news       conference this month. He cited as evidence that he ``had no       idea the military aid was held up'' at the time of his July       25 call with Mr. Trump, when Mr. Trump pressed him for       investigations into the Bidens and a debunked conspiracy       theory about Ukrainian involvement in the hacking of the       Democratic National Committee in 2016.        Mr. Zelensky has said he knew about the holdup of the       military aid before his meeting in Poland on Sept. 1 with Mr.       Pence, but has been vague about exactly when he learned about       it. ``When I did find out, I raised it with Pence at a       meeting in Warsaw,'' he said this month.        In conversations over several days in early August, a       Pentagon official discussed the assistance freeze directly       with a Ukrainian government official, according to records       and interviews. The Pentagon official suggested that Mr.       Mulvaney had been pushing for the assistance to be withheld,       and urged the Ukrainians to reach out to him.        The Pentagon official described Mr. Mulvaney's motivations       only in broad terms but made clear that the same Ukrainian       official, Andriy Yermak, who had been negotiating with Mr.       Giuliani over the investigations and a White House visit       being sought by Mr. Zelensky should also reach out to Mr.       Mulvaney over the hold on military aid.        A senior administration official who spoke on the condition       of anonymity to speak publicly about the issue said on Monday       that Mr. Mulvaney ``had absolutely no communication with the       Ukranians about this issue.''        Ukrainian officials had grown suspicious that the       assistance was in jeopardy because formal talks with the       Pentagon on its release had concluded by June without any       apparent problem.        In talks during the spring with American officials, the       Ukrainians had resolved conditions for the release of the       assistance, and believed everything was on schedule,       according to Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze, Ukraine's former       vice prime minister for Euro-Atlantic Integration.        But by early August, the Ukrainians were struggling to get       clear answers from their American contacts about the status       of the assistance, according to American officials familiar       with the Ukrainians' efforts.        In the days and weeks after top Ukrainian officials were       alerted to the aid freeze, Mr. Sondland and Kurt D. Volker,       then the State Department's special envoy to Ukraine, were       working with Mr. Giuliani to draft a statement for Mr.       Zelensky to deliver that would commit him to pursuing the       investigations, according to text messages between the men       turned over to the House impeachment investigators.        The text messages between Mr. Volker, Mr. Sondland and the       top Zelensky aide did not mention the holdup of the aid. It       was only in September, after the Warsaw meeting, that Mr.       Taylor wrote in a text message to Mr. Sandland, ``I think       it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a       political campaign.''        After being informed on Sept. 1 in Warsaw that the aid       would be released only if Mr. Zelensky agreed to the       investigations, Ukrainian officials, including their national       security adviser and defense minister, were troubled by their       inability to get answers to questions about the freeze from       United States officials, Mr. Taylor testified.        Through the summer, Mr. Zelensky had been noncommittal       about the demands from Mr. Volker, Mr. Sandland and Mr.       Giuliani for a public commitment to the investigations. On       Sept. 5, Mr. Taylor testified, Mr. Zelensky met in Kiev with       Senators Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, and       Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut.        Mr. Zelensky's first question, Mr. Taylor said, was about       the security aid. The senators responded, Mr. Taylor said,       that Mr. Zelensky ``should not jeopardize bipartisan support       by getting drawn into U.S. domestic politics.''        But Mr. Sondland was still pressing for a commitment from       Mr. Zelensky, and was pressing him to do a CNN interview in       which he would talk about pursuing the investigations sought       by Mr. Trump.        Mr. Zelensky never did the interview and never made the       public commitment sought by the White House, although a       Ukrainian prosecutor later said he would ``audit'' a case       involving the owner of the company that paid Hunter Biden as       a board member.        Mr. Giuliani has said he had nothing to do with the       assistance freeze and did not talk to Mr. Trump or ``anybody       in the government'' about it. ``I didn't know about it until       I read about it in the newspaper,'' he said in an interview       last week.     Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes).    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record an October 9,  2019, a Politico magazine article entitled ``This Is What a Legitimate  Anti-Corruption Effort in Ukraine Would Look Like,'' which explains  that legitimate requests are made through the DOJ's Office of  International Affairs  [[Page H12125]]  and pursuant to the United States Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty.                 [From POLITICO Magazine, October 9, 2019]  This Is What a Legitimate Anti-Corruption Effort in Ukraine Would Look                                    Like                           (By Samantha Vinograd)         President Donald Trump insists there's an innocent       explanation for the July 25 phone call in which he asked       Ukraine's president to investigate political rival Joe Biden.       ``I don't care about Biden's campaign,'' he told reporters on       Friday, ``but I do care about corruption.'' Now,       congressional Republicans seem to be bolstering that defense.       Sen. Lindsey Graham said on Tuesday that he will invite Rudy       Giuliani, a key player in Trump's dealings with Ukraine, to       testify on corruption in the country--an odd choice when       Graham could have asked, for example, a U.S. government       official who is an authorized expert on corruption in       Ukraine.        When it comes to the Bidens, asking a foreign country to       investigate an American, when there is no domestic criminal       investigation into him, is a non-starter. We have domestic       law enforcement avenues for that. But there is no evidence of       wrongdoing by Biden and no criminal investigation into his       activities.        If Trump were really, legitimately focused on rooting out       corruption in Ukraine, however--whether at companies like       Burisma, which employed Hunter Biden, or within the       government--there are U.S. government processes for doing so,       when there is a credible case. Here's what they are:        Step 1: Stop cutting State Department anti-corruption funding         There is an entire State Department bureau--the Bureau of       International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INL)--focused on       law enforcement efforts overseas, including investigating       corruption. INL is headquartered in Washington, but it has       experts serving at many U.S. missions overseas. The officials       at INL work with their foreign diplomatic counterparts--some       willing and some less so--as well as non-governmental       organizations and law enforcement agencies at the local,       national and international level to support foreign       governments' efforts to build sound institutions by sharing       best practices, training and giving grants. In Ukraine, that       work has included supporting the establishment of the       National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine and the Special       Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office. INL and its partners can       investigate and report on corruption and even take actions to       punish it, like barring entry to the United States for       certain foreigners.        Strangely, while Trump has a new-found interest in fighting       ``corruption''--at least that associated with his political       rivals--his administration has requested less money for INL,       not more. In fiscal year 2019, the bureau was granted $5       million, but State requested $3 million for fiscal year 2020.       If the president were really concerned about corruption in       Ukraine, he and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo should have       requested more resources for INL work there.        Step 2: Alert the Ukraine ambassador, and let him deal with it         If Trump and Pompeo really wanted to police corruption in       Ukraine, they would have first alerted the acting U.S.       ambassador there to specific concerns, like Ukrainian       executives laundering money or a Ukrainian official misusing       his or her position (such as the former prosecutor general       mentioned in Trump's phone call). Ambassadors can't interfere       in a corruption investigation or direct that one be opened,       but they can pass information along to experts at the       embassy--including INL experts and Department of Justice       personnel.        Those U.S. law enforcement professionals in the foreign       country could see if there were a basis for them to open a       criminal investigation based on that concern, and U.S. anti-      corruption experts there could review suspect activity and       decide how best to address them with the relevant Ukrainian       officials. If there were law enforcement concerns about an       American's involvement, DOJ could coordinate on that with       Ukraine's Ministry of Justice.        For instance, the charge d'affaires in Kiev, Ambassador       William Taylor, and his team could send a ``demarche''--an       official statement of U.S. policy with respect to a corrupt       activity or individual--to Ukrainian officials at the       Ministry of Justice or in Ukrainian President Volodymyr       Zelensky's office and try to sort out ways to address them.       EU Ambassador Gordon Sandland and former special envoy for       Ukraine Kurt Volker had to have been aware of these official       channels for addressing corruption.                   Step 3. Request cooperation (officially)         Trump and his team have another tool at their disposal to       investigate corruption in Ukraine related to an ongoing       criminal case: the United States' Mutual Legal Assistance       Treaty (MLAT) with the country. MLATs are international       agreements that establish a formal process for one country to       gather evidence in another country for a criminal       investigation.        If there were an actual U.S. government investigation into       alleged criminal activity by Americans in Ukraine, or       foreigners suspected of violating U.S. laws, a request for       cooperation could have been made through a formal process       that's run by DOJ's Office of International Affairs. Once       MLAT requests are vetted by the DOJ, they are transmitted to       a foreign country's ``central authority''--in this case,       Ukraine's Ministry of Justice. If granted in the foreign       country, this arrangement could allow the DOJ to obtain       documents, locate people, take testimony, request searches       and seizures, freeze assets and more. If the United States       were actually pursuing criminal investigations into       corruption in Ukraine, U.S. officials would have made a       request under our MLAT for cooperation.        The United States even has a Mutual Legal Assistance       Agreement (MLAA) with China, the country that Trump called on       last week to investigate Biden, after the whistleblower       complaint was made public.        There is no shortage of official options when it comes to       cooperation on criminal matters and fighting corruption with       a foreign country--whether it be with the Ukrainians or the       Chinese or anyone else. If the president actually cared about       addressing corruption in Ukraine more broadly, he would       ensure that experts like INL staffers at the State Department       have the resources they need to do their jobs. The fact that       Giuliani was his answer suggests that something very       different is going on here.     Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Castor).    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a December 5,  2019, Boston Globe editorial entitled ``Impeach the President.''                [Editorial: Boston Globe, December 5, 2019]                           Impeach the President         From the founding of this country, the power of the       president was understood to have limits. Indeed, the Founders       would never have written an impeachment clause into the       Constitution if they did not foresee scenarios where their       descendants might need to remove an elected president before       the end of his term in order to protect the American people       and the nation.        The question before the country now is whether President       Trump's misconduct is severe enough that Congress should       exercise that impeachment power, less than a year before the       2020 election. The results of the House Intelligence       Committee inquiry, released to the public on Tuesday, make       clear that the answer is an urgent yes. Not only has the       president abused his power by trying to extort a foreign       country to meddle in US politics, but he also has endangered       the integrity of the election itself. He has also obstructed       the congressional investigation into his conduct, a precedent       that will lead to a permanent diminution of congressional       power if allowed to stand.        The evidence that Trump is a threat to the constitutional       system is more than sufficient, and a slate of legal scholars       who testified on Wednesday made clear that Trump's actions       are just the sort of presidential behavior the Founders had       in mind when they devised the recourse of impeachment. The       decision by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to proceed with       drafting articles of impeachment is warranted.        Much of the information in the Intelligence Committee       report, which was based on witness interviews, documents,       telephone records, and public statements by administration       officials, was already known to the public. The cohesive       narrative that emerges, though, is worse than the sum of its       parts. This year, the president and subordinates acting at       his behest repeatedly tried to pressure a foreign country,       Ukraine, into taking steps to help the president's       reelection. That was, by itself, an outrageous betrayal: In       his dealings with foreign states, the president has an       obligation to represent America's interests, not his own.        But the president also betrayed the US taxpayer to advance       that corrupt agenda. In order to pressure Ukraine into       acceding to his request, Trump's administration held up $391       million in aid allocated by Congress. In other words, he       demanded a bribe in the form of political favors in exchange       for an official act--the textbook definition of corruption.       The fact that the money was ultimately paid, after a whistle-      blower complained, is  [[Page H12126]]       immaterial: The act of withholding taxpayer money to support       a personal political goal was an impermissible abuse of the       president's power.        Withholding the money also sabotaged American foreign       policy. The United States provides military aid to Ukraine to       protect the country from Russian aggression. Ensuring that       fragile young democracy does not fall under Moscow's sway is       a key US policy goal, and one that the president put at risk       for his personal benefit. He has shown the world that he is       willing to corrupt the American policy agenda for purposes of       political gain, which will cast suspicion on the motivations       of the United States abroad if Congress does not act.        To top off his misconduct, after Congress got wind of the       scheme and started the impeachment inquiry, the Trump       administration refused to comply with subpoenas, instructed       witnesses not to testify, and intimidated witnesses who did.       That ought to form the basis of an article of impeachment.       When the president obstructs justice and fails to respect the       power of Congress, it strikes at the heart of the separation       of powers and will hobble future oversight of presidents of       all parties.        Impeachment does not require a crime. The Constitution       entrusts Congress with the impeachment power in order to       protect Americans from a president who is betraying their       interests. And it is very much in Americans' interests to       maintain checks and balances in the federal government; to       have a foreign policy that the world can trust is based on       our national interest instead of the president's personal       needs; to control federal spending through their elected       representatives; to vote in fair elections untainted by       foreign interference. For generations, Americans have enjoyed       those privileges. What's at stake now is whether we will keep       them. The facts show that the president has threatened this       country's core values and the integrity of our democracy.       Congress now has a duty to future generations to impeach him.     Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the December 11,  2019, USA Today editorial entitled ``Impeach President Trump: The  President's Ukraine shakedown and stonewalling are too serious for the  House to ignore.''                      [From USA Today, Dec. 12, 2019]            USA TODAY's Editorial Board: Impeach President Trump                           (The Editorial Board)         ``Put your own narrow interests ahead of the nation's,       flout the law, violate the trust given to you by the American       people and recklessly disregard the oath of office, and you       risk losing your job.''        USA TODAY's Editorial Board wrote those words two decades       ago when it endorsed the impeachment of President Bill       Clinton, a Democrat. Now, in graver circumstances with       America's system of checks and balances at stake, they apply       to another president facing impeachment, Republican Donald       Trump.        The current board has made no secret of our low regard for       Trump's character and conduct. Yet, as fellow passengers on       the ship of state, we had hoped the captain would succeed.       And, until recently, we believed that impeachment proceedings       would be unhealthier for an already polarized nation than       simply leaving Trump's fate up to voters next November.                     Trump leaves Democrats little choice         Unless public sentiment shifts sharply in the days and       weeks ahead, that is the likely outcome of this process--      impeachment by the Democratic-controlled House of       Representatives followed by acquittal in the GOP-controlled       Senate. So why bother? Because Trump's egregious       transgressions and stonewalling have given the House little       choice but to press ahead with the most severe sanction at       its disposal.        Clinton was impeached by the House (but not removed by the       Senate) after he tried to cover up an affair with a White       House intern. Trump used your tax dollars to shake down a       vulnerable foreign government to interfere in a U.S. election       for his personal benefit.        GOP leader on House Judiciary Committee: Articles establish       nothing impeachable and allege no crime        In his thuggish effort to trade American arms for foreign       dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter,       Trump resembles not so much Clinton as he does Richard Nixon,       another corrupt president who tried to cheat his way to       reelection.        This isn't partisan politics as usual. It is precisely the       type of misconduct the framers had in mind when they wrote       impeachment into the Constitution. Alexander Hamilton       supported a robust presidency but worried about ``a man       unprincipled in private life desperate in his fortune, bold       in his temper'' coming to power. Impeachment, Hamilton wrote,       was a mechanism to protect the nation ``from the abuse or       violation of some public trust.''                       Approve articles of impeachment         Both articles of impeachment drafted by the House Judiciary       Committee warrant approval:        Abuse of power. Testimony before the House Intelligence       Committee produced overwhelming evidence that Trump wanted       Ukraine's new president to announce investigations into the       Bidens and a debunked theory that Ukraine, not Russia,       interfered in the 2016 U.S. election.        To pressure the Ukrainian leader, Trump withheld a White       House meeting and nearly $400 million in congressionally       approved security aid, funding that was released only after       an unnamed official blew the whistle.        To former national security adviser John Bolton, the       months-long scheme was the equivalent of a ``drug deal.'' To       Bolton's former aide Fiona Hill, it was a ``domestic       political errand'' that ``is all going to blow up.'' To Bill       Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, ``it's crazy to       withhold security assistance for help with a political       campaign.'' And to Ukrainian soldiers, fighting to fend off       Russian aggression in the eastern part of their country, the       money was a matter of life and death.        Obstruction of Congress. Trump has met the impeachment       investigation with outright and unprecedented defiance. The       White House has withheld documents, ordered executive branch       agencies not to comply with subpoenas and directed       administration officials not to testify.        Allowing this obstruction to stand unchallenged would put       the president above the law and permanently damage Congress'       ability to investigate misconduct by presidents of either       party.        The president's GOP enablers continue to place power and       party ahead of truth and country. Had any Democratic       president behaved the way Trump has--paying hush money to a       porn star, flattering dictators and spewing an unending       stream of falsehoods--there's no doubt congressional       Republicans would have tried to run him out of the White       House in a New York minute. Twenty-seven Republicans who       voted to impeach or convict Clinton remain in Congress. If       they continue to defend Trump, history will record their       hypocrisy.        Our support for Trump's impeachment by the House--we'll       wait for the Senate trial to render a verdict on removal from       office--has nothing to do with policy differences. We have       had profound disagreements with the president on a host of       issues, led by his reckless deficits and inattention to       climate change, both of which will burden generations to       come.        Policy differences are not, however, grounds for       impeachment. Constitutional violations are.        Bill Clinton should be impeached and stand trial ``because       the charges are too serious and the evidence amassed too       compelling'' to ignore, the Editorial Board wrote in December       1998.        The same can be said this December about the allegations       facing Donald Trump. Only much more so.     Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Khanna).    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a December 17  CNN article entitled ``Fact check: Trump's wild letter to Pelosi is  filled with false and misleading claims.''                       [From CNN, December 17, 2019]    Fact Check: Trump's Wild Letter to Pelosi is Filled With False and                             Misleading Claims                 (By Daniel Dale and Tara Subramaniam, CNN)         Washington (CNN)--It was on White House letterhead. It read       like a string of President Donald Trump's tweets.        And it was just as dishonest.        On Tuesday afternoon, Trump released a six-page letter to       House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in which--employing his       distinctive vocabulary and punctuation--he blasted Democrats'       push to impeach him, defended his dealings with Ukraine and       touted his accomplishments in office.        Like much of his previous rhetoric about Ukraine and       impeachment, much of the letter was false or misleading.        Trump repeated multiple false claims that have been       debunked on numerous occasions. He also delivered some new       claims that were false, misleading or lacking in context.        We're not finished going through all of Trump's claims in       his letter, but here are some early fact checks.                            Dealings with Ukraine         Trump decried ``the so-called whistleblower who started       this entire hoax with a false report of the phone call that       bears no relationship to the actual phone call that was       made.''        Facts First: The whistleblower's account of Trump's July       call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been       proven highly accurate. In fact, the rough transcript       released by Trump himself showed that the whistleblower's       three primary allegations about the call were correct or very       close to correct. You can read a full fact check here.        Trump claimed the whistleblower ``disappeared'' because       ``they got caught, their report was a fraud.''        Facts First: There is no evidence the whistleblower has       disappeared, let alone that they have vanished because they       were shown to be inaccurate. Whistleblowers do not have an       obligation to speak publicly after filing their anonymous       complaints.        Trump wrote, ``Ambassador Sondland testified that I told       him: `No quid pro quo. I want nothing. I want nothing. I want       President Zelensky to do the right thing, do what he ran on.'       ''        Facts First: Sondland, Trump's ambassador to the European       Union, did testify that Trump told him this--but Sondland       nonetheless said that, in his own opinion, there was indeed a       quid pro quo.        Trump wrote that the rough transcript of his call with       Zelensky ``was immediately made available.''        Facts First: The call occurred in July. Trump released the       rough transcript in September, after the public learned of       the existence of the whistleblower complaint about the call.        Trump wrote, ``President Zelensky has repeatedly declared       that I did nothing wrong, and that there was No Pressure. He       further emphasized that it was a `good phone call,' that `I       don't feel pressure,' and explicitly stressed that `nobody       pushed me.' ''        Facts First: Zelensky did say there had been ``no       pressure'' from Trump and made other statements to that       effect, but he has not gone so far as to say Trump did       nothing wrong.        In an interview published by Time magazine in early       December, Zelensky did say, ``Look, I never talked to the       President from the position of a quid pro quo. That's not my       thing.'' But Zelensky continued: ``I don't want us to look       like beggars. But you have to understand. We're at war. If       you're our strategic partner, then you can't go blocking       anything for us. I think that's just about fairness. It's not       about a quid pro quo. It just goes without saying.''        Trump wrote, ``I said to President Zelensky: `I would like       you to do us a favor, though, because our country has been       through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it.' I said do us       a favor, not me, and our country, not a campaign. I then       mentioned the Attorney General of the United States.''        Facts First: It's worth noting that Trump only adopted this       explanation for his ``favor'' comments more than two months       after he released the rough transcript of the July call.       Trump quoted himself accurately here--but in between his       ``favor'' sentence to Zelensky and his mention of the       attorney general, he had asked Zelensky to look into a       debunked conspiracy theory about Democratic computer servers.       In his next series of comments to Zelensky, after Zelensky       spoke, Trump asked Zelensky to look into former vice       president and current Democratic presidential candidate Joe       Biden.                            Joe Biden and Ukraine         Trump wrote that Biden ``used his office and $1 billion       dollars of U.S. aid money to coerce Ukraine into firing the       prosecutor who was digging into the company paying his son       millions of dollars.''        Facts First: There is a lot wrong with this claim. The $1       billion in question was a loan guarantee, not an aid payment.       The prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, was widely viewed by American       diplomats and in the international community as corrupt;       Biden was pursuing official policy in pushing for Shokin's       ouster. And the prosecutor's former deputy has said that the       investigation into the company where Biden's son, Hunter       Biden, sat on the board of directors was dormant at the time       Joe Biden applied the pressure.        Trump wrote, ``Biden openly stated: `I said, ``I'm telling       you, you're not getting the billion dollars'' . . . I looked       at them and said: ``I'm leaving in six hours. If the       prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money.''       Well, son of a bitch. He got fired.' '' Even Joe Biden       admitted just days ago in an interview with NPR that it       `looked bad.' ''        Facts First: Trump was not entirely clear on what he meant       by ``it,'' but he left open the impression that Biden had       recently told NPR that his effort to oust Shokin, or the 2018       video of him telling the story of his effort to oust Shokin,       ``looked bad.'' In fact, Biden's ``looked bad'' comment was       about something different: Hunter Biden's position on the       board. Specifically, Biden said ``the appearance'' of Hunter       Biden's presence on the board ``looked bad and it gave folks       like Rudy Giuliani an excuse to come up with a Trumpian kind       of defense.''        Trump wrote, ``Now you are trying to impeach me by falsely       accusing me of doing what Joe Biden has admitted he actually       did.''        Facts First: Democrats are accusing Trump of abuse of power       for soliciting foreign interference in the presidential       election and for trying to use official acts to pressure the       Ukrainian government into doing something that would help him       personally. Biden has not admitted to anything of the sort.                           The impeachment process         Trump wrote, ``I have been denied the most fundamental       rights afforded by the Constitution, including the right to       present evidence, to have my own counsel present, to confront       accusers, and to call and cross-examine witnesses.''        Facts First: The constitutional rights of criminal       defendants do not apply to public officials in a House of       Representatives impeachment process, though Trump is free to       argue that they should. Trump's counsel was denied the       opportunity to participate in House Intelligence Committee       impeachment hearings but was invited to participate in House       Judiciary Committee hearings; Trump's counsel declined that       opportunity. House Republicans were allowed to have their       lawyer question witnesses at the House Intelligence       Committee.        Trump wrote, ``More due process was afforded to those       accused in the Salem Witch Trials.''        Facts First: Trump might have meant this as a non-literal       figure of speech, but as a factual matter, the claim is       absurd. (Salem's current mayor told Trump to ``learn some       history.'') Nineteen innocent people were hanged after they       were accused of witchcraft in the trials of the late 1600s.       The courts accepted ``spectral evidence'' from dreams. Some       of the accused were tortured into confessions.                                  Democrats         Trump wrote of Hillary Clinton: ``Your chosen candidate       lost the election in 2016, in an Electoral College landslide       (306-227).''        Facts First: Leaving aside Trump's characterization of the       result as a ``landslide,'' he got the numbers wrong--again.       If he was going by the number of electoral votes each       candidate earned in the voting, the result was 306 for him to       232 for Clinton. If he was going by the final result, after       some ``faithless electors'' defected from both him and       Clinton, the result was 304 for him to 227 for Clinton. This       was not a one-time slip; Trump is habitually inaccurate about       this.        Trump said Pelosi has a policy of ``open borders.''        Facts First: While Pelosi wants a more liberal immigration       policy than he does, she does not support completely       unrestricted migration. She has repeatedly endorsed funding       for border security measures aside from the President's       proposed wall.                          The Mueller investigation         Trump again claimed the cost of the Mueller investigation       was ``45 million dollars.''        Facts First: The investigation cost $32 million, according       to figures released by the Justice Department, and the       government is expected to recoup about $17 million as a       result of the investigation, most from former Trump campaign       chairman Paul Manafort, according to a CNN analysis of the       sentences handed out to people charged by Mueller.        Trump said that the world now knows that former FBI       Director James Comey is ``one of the dirtiest cops our Nation       has ever seen.''  [[Page H12128]]         Facts First: We give Trump wide latitude to express       opinions about public figures, but the December report from       Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz       presented no evidence that Comey was corrupt in any way.       Horowitz found significant errors in FBI work connected to       the Russia investigation, and rejected Comey's claim of       vindication, but he did not make any finding accusing Comey       of deliberate malfeasance.                           Supposed accomplishments         Trump claimed ``a colossal reduction in illegal border       crossings.''        Facts First: While there has been a reduction since May, it       is only a reduction from the high point of the Trump era; the       total number of people apprehended at the southwest border, a       proxy measure for the number of actual crossings, has been       higher under Trump than it was in the late Obama era.        Trump boasted of the US ``becoming the world's top energy       producer.''        Facts First: The US became the world's top energy producer       in 2012, according to the government's Energy Information       Administration--under Obama, whom Trump has repeatedly       accused of perpetrating a ``war on American energy.''        Trump claimed ``a completely reformed VA with Choice and       Accountability for our great veterans.''        Facts First: The Veterans Choice program was signed into       law by Obama in 2014. Trump signed a law in 2018 to expand       and modify the Choice program, the VA MISSION Act, but he did       not create Choice.        Trump touted ``the building of the Southern Border Wall.''        Facts First: As of December 6, the date of the latest       official update from Customs and Border Protection, no miles       of border wall had been constructed where barriers did not       previously exist. (Construction had started on some new       barriers, the government said.) Trump has argued that the       replacement of old barriers with newer barriers should count       as the building of his wall; as of December 6, 90 miles of       replacement barriers had been erected.

Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Brendan F. Boyle).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Clay).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, let me thank my friend, Mr. Cole, for his kind words,  and I appreciate his leadership on the Rules Committee and the fact  that he respects this institution.   But, Madam Speaker, let me say again what happened here: The  President withheld congressionally approved military aid to a country  under siege to extract a personal, political favor. That is a cold,  hard fact.   The question before us comes down to this: Should a President be  allowed to ask a foreign nation to interfere in an American election?   I remember my first political experience as a middle schooler in  1972, leaving leaflets at the homes of potential voters urging them to  support George McGovern for President--no relation, by the way. I  remember what an honor it was to ask people to support him, even though  I was too young to vote myself, and what a privilege it was later in  life to ask voters for their support in my own campaigns.   I have been part of winning campaigns, and I have been part of losing  ones, too. People who I thought would be great Presidents, like Senator  McGovern, were never given that chance. Make no mistake: I was  disappointed, but I accepted it.   I would take losing an election any day of the week when the American  people render that verdict, but I will never be okay if other nations  decide our leaders for us. The President of the United States is  rolling out the welcome mat for that kind of foreign interference.   To my Republican friends: Imagine any Democratic President sitting in  the Oval Office--President Obama, President Clinton, any of them. Would  your answer here still be the same? No one should be allowed to use the  powers of the Presidency to undermine our elections, period.   This isn't about siding with your team. I didn't swear an oath to  defend a political party. I took an oath to uphold the Constitution of  the United States of America. And when I vote ``yes'' on this rule and  the underlying articles, my conscience will be clear.   I ask all of my colleagues to search their souls before casting their  votes. I ask them all to stand up for our democracy, to stand up for  our Constitution.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous  question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Cole is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 767         Notwithstanding the first section of this resolution, the       House shall not proceed to consideration of H. Res. 755,       impeaching Donald John Trump, President of the United States,       for high crimes and misdemeanors, until such time as the       Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee notifies the House       that:        (a) All evidence in possession of Chairman Schiff of the       House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence has been       made available to the House Judiciary Committee.        (b) All members of the House Judiciary Committee have been       given the opportunity to ask questions of the Chairman of the       House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence with regards       to his report titled ``The Trump-Ukraine Impeachment Inquiry       Report.''        (c) All underlying, unclassified, evidence used to create       the report described in subsection (b) has been made       available to the public.        (d) Minority members of the House Judiciary Committee have       received their right to a minority hearing day.        (e) Minority witnesses requested by Ranking Member Nunes at       the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and       Ranking Member Collins at the House Judiciary Committee are       called and allowed to be heard in accordance with H. Res.       660.        (f) Subpoenas requested by Ranking Member Nunes at the       House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence pursuant to       H. Res. 660 are issued and enforced.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.    Madam Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
