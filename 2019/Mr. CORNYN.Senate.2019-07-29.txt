 Mr. President, yesterday President Trump announced that  after nearly 2\1/2\ years of dedicated service, our former Senate  colleague Dan Coats would be stepping down from his post as Director of  National Intelligence.   Director Coats has led the intelligence community during a turbulent  time for our country, and with our country continuing to face  persistent threats from rogue and hostile states, as well as the  ongoing war against terror, he has done a magnificent job and one that  deserves all the accolades we can possibly bestow upon him. We know he  entered the job on the tail of a blatant attempt by the Russian  Government to interfere with our Nation's elections, and he made it a  top priority to ensure that the American people could cast a vote with  confidence in 2018 and beyond.   I just happened to come in the Chamber, when the Senator from Ohio  was continuing to question the majority leader's commitment to election  integrity, and I must say that it is ironic to me that the Russian  interference with the 2016 election was, by and large, met with  inaction, really nothing that the Obama administration did, even though  they knew it was ongoing as early as the summer of 2016.   The truth is, as a result of this administration's and this  Congress's efforts, the 2018 election was essentially interference  free, and that is because of tremendous actions being taken by the  Department of Homeland Security to work with our partners in the State  election systems to provide sensors that can identify attempts to hack  into their system as well as the movement of State election officials  to move to paper ballots and the like.   We also know we have been much more aggressive attacking the cyber  threats at their source, and while much of that is classified and can't  be discussed in a public forum, suffice it to say that if we can just  repeat the successes of 2018 during the Trump administration in 2020,  Americans can be confident their vote will be cast and be counted as it  should be.   That is not to suggest for a moment that we shouldn't remain vigilant  because we know the Russian Federation is going to continue to try to  sow discord and cause us to question our own institutions. They are  very good at it. They have been doing it a long time, but now they have  additional tools like social media and propaganda as well as the  complicity sometimes of the mainstream media in writing unverified and  unsourced stories that create more and more and contribute more and  more to this atmosphere in which we currently live.   Let me talk again about Director Coats because his remarkable career  as a public servant included, at times, a Congressman, an ambassador to  Germany, a U.S. Senator twice, and Director of National Intelligence.   I know I speak for others in this Chamber in saying that we are  grateful for Dan Coats' dedicated service to our country, and I am  honored to be one of those who can call him a friend. I wish him and  Marsha the best in whatever the next chapter brings, hopefully starting  with a well-deserved vacation.   I was also glad to see that the President has chosen a worthy  successor to that position, my friend   John Ratcliffe. For 4\1/2\  years, John has faithfully and diligently served Texas's Fourth  District in Congress for the people of Texas.   Prior to that, he served with distinction as U.S. attorney,  prosecuting cases that spanned a wide spectrum of issues, including  counterterrorism and national security.   Mr. Ratcliffe is a Member of the House Intelligence, Homeland  Security, and Judiciary Committees, a pretty good portfolio for  somebody who would be the next Director of National Intelligence. So he  already has an understanding of the threats facing our country and the  challenges that lie ahead. I am confident he will continue Dan Coats'  strong leadership as a nonpartisan strong leader for the intelligence  community.   Sadly, though, we can already begin to see our Democratic colleagues  beginning to play their partisan games, threatening to defeat this  nomination at the expense of the American people. This position is  simply too important to the security of our Nation to be bogged down in  partisan politics. Since this job was created, every single Director  has been confirmed by an overwhelming bipartisan vote. In fact, none of  these men received the support of fewer than 85 Senators. This one  should be no different.   I look forward to the President formally nominating   John Ratcliffe  to be the next Director of National Intelligence.                             Judicial Nominations    Mr. President, on another matter, during the first 2 years of the  Trump administration, the list of vacancies across the Federal  Government was a long one, particularly on the Federal bench. The  administration worked swiftly to find well-qualified nominees who were  eager to serve our country and our Federal judiciary. Once those  nominees were submitted to the Senate, the chairman quickly held  confirmation hearings and advanced the vast majority of these nominees  to the floor, but from there the process came to a screeching halt. But  from there, the process came to a screeching halt. Our colleagues on  the other side pulled every trick in the book to bog down and slow down  the nominations process. For no other purpose than delay, they forced  cloture votes on nominees with broad bipartisan support. Many were  confirmed without a single Senator voting against them. Our Democratic  colleagues didn't do this because these men and women were unqualified  or otherwise controversial, but they did so because they were willing  to do whatever it took to stymie President Trump and his administration  and bring the work of this body to a crawl.    The list of vacancies kept growing longer and longer until, earlier  this year, we were forced to pass a modest rules change that has  fortunately broken the logjam and allowed us to fill these critical  positions. As the majority leader likes to say, we are now making  serious headway in the personnel business. The number of vacancies has  gotten smaller, and the list of public servants who are now on the job  keeps getting longer.   Last week, we added more names to that impressive list. We confirmed  two district judges, inspector general for the Department of Homeland  Security, and both the Administrator and Deputy Administrator of the  Federal Aviation Administration. In addition, we approved two leaders  whose experience will provide needed stability and leadership at the  Pentagon.   After nearly 7 months with an Acting Secretary of Defense, Mark Esper  has finally been confirmed for the position of Secretary of Defense on  a permanent basis. Throughout his career, Secretary Esper has  demonstrated integrity, sound judgment, and unabashed patriotism. I saw  those qualities when I met with him most recently a few weeks ago and  we had the chance to speak about some of the most pressing global  threats we were facing as a nation today. Secretary Esper received  broad  [[Page S5128]]  bipartisan support, with 90 Senators voting for him. I am glad he is  now on the job, leading America's national security.   We also confirmed another important senior Department of Defense  official last week. GEN Mark Milley was resoundingly confirmed to be  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with only one Senator voting  against him. I can't think of anyone more prepared for the job than  General Milley, a former Army Ranger and Green Beret. He has a  remarkable military resume, including commander officer of the III  Corps in Fort Hood, TX, where I first got to know him years ago. I know  he and Secretary Esper will continue to have a strong working  relationship, and I look forward to continuing to work with both of  them in their new roles.   This week, we intend to keep our progress on nominations going  strong, and we have seven Texas district court judge nominees on the  docket. Among those well-qualified nominees is a former Army  paratrooper and Marine JAG officer, former and current intermediate  court judges, former and current Federal and State prosecutors, and a  Texas Supreme Court justice--a job I once held. They have all proudly  served the Lone Star State in a variety of capacities.   I am, again, impressed by the outstanding nominees that the President  has recruited to fill these important judicial vacancies. When these  nominees are confirmed, we will finally break down two barriers in the  Texas district courts. Ada Brown will be the first African-American  woman to sit in the Northern District of Texas, and Jason Pullman will  be the first African American in the Western District of Texas. Each of  these nominees has shown their legal acumen, clear judgment, and  unwavering commitment to the rule of law. I look forward to voting for  their nominations later this week.   In addition to confirming these Texans and a dozen other district  court judges, the Senate will confirm a critical Cabinet-level position  in the administration. When Nikki Haley announced that after 2 years of  dedicated service, she would leave her post as Ambassador to the United  Nations at the end of last year, we knew it would leave a major hole in  that organization. But the President didn't have far to look to find a  well-qualified nominee. Two years ago, the Senate unanimously confirmed  Kelly Knight Craft to serve as the U.S. Ambassador to Canada. Looking  back on that 2 years now, it is safe to say it has been a dynamic time  during our relationship with our neighbor to the north, a fact that  made Ambassador Craft's job all that much more important.   Through each challenge and difference between our leaders, Ambassador  Craft has demonstrated her tact and diplomatic skills. In addition to  the usual duties of the office, Ambassador Craft facilitated the  renegotiation of NAFTA--the North American Free Trade Agreement--and  helped broker the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement--the USMCA. She helped  build consensus on this agreement, which will benefit North American  workers, farmers, and businesses, and won friends from both countries  in the process.   Once Trump nominated Ambassador Craft to represent the United States  in the U.N., we heard glowing endorsements from many of those people.  Canadian officials praised her role in NAFTA negotiations and border  conditions, and U.S. diplomats who served under Republican and  Democratic administrations spoke of their confidence in Ambassador  Craft and her ability to represent our country on the world stage.   For the last 2 years, Ambassador Craft has made our country proud as  the U.S. Ambassador to Canada, and I am confident her outstanding  record will continue at the United Nations. I appreciate her  willingness to serve in this important role and look forward to voting  for her nomination later this week.   As we prepare to head home for the August recess to spend time with  our constituents, I am glad to know these important positions  throughout the Federal Government will not be left vacant for much  longer.   I yield the floor.
