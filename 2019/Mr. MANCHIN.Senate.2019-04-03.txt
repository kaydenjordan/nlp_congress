 Madam President, I thank my colleague. He has more  institutional knowledge, has been here longer, and understands this  process. I haven't been here as long, but I am trying to put a little  common sense to it, and I am having a hard time.   I am not naive enough to stand up thinking that if I could have given  my speech before we took that vote, it might have made any difference.  I wish it would have. I wish I could have. But it didn't happen that  way.   Words cannot express how disappointed I am--I truly am--to stand here  as the only Member of the Senate who voted against the nuclear option  in 2013 when it was a Democratic proposal and in 2017, the Republican  proposal, and now what we did today. I have consistently voted against  this because it is not who we are, and it is not about what we are  about either.   For those who don't know, the nuclear option is strictly a gimmick  that allows the majority party to truly steal the power of debate and  the power of the filibuster from individual Senators. Why does it  matter? Because so much of our influence as Senators comes from our  power to filibuster. It is also the most powerful tool we have to force  compromise and to stand up for the people we represent.   In spite of the importance of this power, everyone else in the body  who has had the chance has voted to use the nuclear option to lower the  votes required to end debate from 60 votes to a simple majority of 50  plus 1 on different types of nominees. That is a tragedy for our  constituents. For this country, it is even more of a tragedy. For the  institution of the Senate, it is a disaster.   This debate is not new, and I would not be honoring the legacy of the  late Senator Robert C. Byrd, whose seat I sit in, if I did not take the  opportunity to at least recite a little history here on the floor of  the Senate.   The Founding Fathers always intended the Senate to be deliberate, and  we are known as the most deliberate body in the world.   George Washington himself was said to have told Thomas Jefferson that  the Senate should serve as a ``cooling saucer'' for legislation from  the House. As you know, the House works on a simple majority; 218  Democrats or 218 Republicans can do anything they wish. The Senate is  supposed to temper that down.   This body was created to protect the rights of individual States-- small States in particular. In the Federalist Papers, John Jay notes  that ``in this spirit it may be remarked, that the equal vote allowed  to each State, is at once a constitutional recognition of the portion  of sovereignty remaining in the individual States, and an instrument  for preserving that residuary sovereignty.''   The filibuster is essential to preserving that residual sovereignty,  and diminishing that power should matter to anyone who comes from a  small or rural State like my State of West Virginia. This power was  also meant to empower individual Members, like me, who often find  themselves in the minority of their own party.   That doesn't mean we can't make changes for efficiency. But today's  rule  [[Page S2222]]  change and the two that came before it in 2013 and 2017 were not meant  to make this place more efficient; they were meant to take power from  each and every Senator. That means you and I have given up our power  and our ability to represent our States.   Before 1917, there was no way to end a debate in the Senate  whatsoever, from our beginning, so one Member could grind this place to  a halt for however long they felt necessary. Then, at the urging of  President Woodrow Wilson, the Senate adopted rule XXII that year, 1917,  and first used it 2 years later to end a filibuster against the Treaty  of Versailles.   For the next 80-plus years, some tweaks were made to the rule and its  reach was expanded, but there was no real threat to the existence of  the rule. In 2005, that all changed when then-Majority Leader Bill  Frist made the first serious effort to change the rules of the Senate  and reduce the power of every Member of this body by deploying the  nuclear option. None other than John McCain and Robert C. Byrd, our  dear departed friends, teamed up to form the Gang of 14 that cut a deal  on a package of nominations that took the nuclear option off the  table--but only for a little while.   In 2013, when Harry Reid and Democrats--my side of the aisle--voted  to end the filibuster for Presidential nominees, I was one of only  three Democrats to fight and vote against it. The other two, Mark Pryor  and Carl Levin, are no longer serving in the Senate today, but we  represented all wings of the Democratic Party--from the liberal end, to  the conservative end, to the moderate centrist end. We stood together  despite our differences because we knew that it would forever lessen  the institution of the Senate and that it would come back to bite us  when we weren't in the majority. That was the point we made at that  time. That was the argument we made and pleaded with our colleagues.   For the past 5 years, we have seen the consequences of those actions.  Today, our Republican friends are using the same excuse our Democrats  used--historic obstruction. Democrats are using the same argument today  that our Republican friends have used--unprecedented overreach. This is  the hypocrisy that makes us understand why people think Washington  sucks. It is on both sides. No one is innocent on this.   In 2013, the current majority leader, Mitch McConnell, was furious  about what the Democrats were threatening to do. He called it breaking  the rules to change the rules. And I agreed with him. He was right. I  voted with him.   In 2013, I heard and listened to Leader McConnell when he said:         The American people decided not to give the Democrats the       House, or to restore the filibuster proof majority they had       in the Senate back in 2009, and our Democratic colleagues       don't like that one bit. They just don't like it. The       American people are getting in the way of what they'd like to       do. So they are trying to change the rules of the game to get       their way anyway.    This is precisely what the American people decided about Republicans  in the 2018 election, and the Republicans have now gone down the same  path Leader McConnell warned us against. You would think that at least  we would understand the definition of ``insanity''--doing the same  thing over and over, thinking we are going to get a different outcome.  It doesn't work that way.   Leader McConnell went on to say: ``So look, I realize this sort of  wishful thinking might appeal to the uninitiated newcomers in the  Democratic conference who served exactly zero days in the minority, but  the rest of you guys should know better.'' And he is absolutely  correct. Everyone should know better. Those of you who have been in the  minority before should know better because what goes around comes  around.   His final warning, which I am disappointed my Republican friends  didn't listen to, was this:         If you think this is in the best interest of the United       States Senate and the American people, to make advice and       consent mean effectively nothing, obviously you can break the       rules to change the rules to achieve that.    That is what we have done.         But some of us have been around here long enough to know       that the shoe is sometimes on the other foot.    While the majority leader and minority leader have flipped their  positions and their perspective today, the lesson is clear: Breaking  the Senate for political expedience will, over time, hurt all of us  and, most importantly, our constituents and the American people.   I firmly believe the filibuster is a vital protection of minority  views and exactly why the Framers of our Constitution made the Senate  the cooling saucer. Lately, both parties have lit the saucer on fire  and thrown it out the window. The Senate was set up by our Founding  Fathers to force us to work together. Think about that. They knew that  whatever we receive from the House would be hot as a firecracker.  Someone had to put out the flame. Someone had to know to say: That is  not who we are as a country, and it is not basically who we want to be  as a country.   We are not the House of Representatives, and by golly, we are going  there at a rapid pace--a rapid pace. It seems that when people come  from the House, they bring that House mentality--scorched and burned  earth. That is not what we were set up to be. This is a very different  body. It is the most unique body in the world.   As the late great Robert C. Byrd himself said in the months before  his death, ``While I welcome needed reform, we must always be mindful  of our responsibilities to preserve this institution's special  purpose.'' And we are better than this, he said.   I always tell people back home that I can't vote for something unless  I can go home and explain it. I don't care if it is an idea that my  friends on the Republican side have. It makes sense to me. My  constituents understand it. I go home and vote and tell them why I  voted with my Republican friends. If I vote with my Democratic friends  and it makes sense, I tell them the same. If I vote against something  of my Republican friends or Democrats, I explain to them. It has  nothing to do with politics; it is policy. Does it make sense? Will it  help the constituents of the State of West Virginia? Will it make my  country stronger and better? That is really what I care about. That is  the purpose of my being here.   For the life of me, I can't figure out how anyone who voted for this  can explain it when they go back home, because we have given our power  away. Every time you do this, you continue to erode the powers you have  as a Senate by the Constitution of the United States of America and by  the Founding Fathers who created this body. Now, how we can do it in  such a willing way makes no sense. How do you look people in the eye  and say: I gave up my individual power to represent you. How do I do  that? I am not going to do it. I am not going to do it, and I haven't  done it, nor will I ever do it.   You can say it was because of obstruction. Well, if there is an  obstruction, there is a way around obstructions. You drive around  obstructions. You have obstructions in your life every day. You learn  to work around obstructions. It is basically by communicating. It is  basically by sitting down and looking at the other side, the other  point of view.   I have always said that I am not always right. I need help. But I am  not always wrong either. I have, hopefully, some input, and I try to  make that as a balance as I approach these things. And Republicans  are--what they have done today is basically the same. We don't have  obstructions we can't overcome if we respect each other. You can't  blame everybody for everything. You can't blame somebody else for  something you are unwilling to do. You can't blame somebody else if you  don't have the patience to sit down and talk through your problems and  try to understand better. You can't blame somebody else if you are not  willing to give and take. That is what the whole process is about if  you are going to be successful in life--anyone who has been successful.  It is not ``my way or the highway''; it is ``our way going down the  highway together.''   This move is a betrayal of the people we represent, and everyone in  this body is complicit. It is a shame that we are going to go back and  try to explain our positions with the votes that were made today. It is  just a shame. It should never have come to this. For hundreds of years,  we have managed to overcome obstructions and preserve our Founders'  vision for the Senate, but for the last 6 years, Members on both sides  of this aisle have decided that is no longer possible.  [[Page S2223]]    This abdication of our power and responsibility is nothing more than  weakness in the face of partisanship. This is truly tribal. What tribe  do you belong to? Do you belong to the Democratic tribe, or do you  belong to the Republican tribe? I am sorry, I belong to the American  tribe, and I am going to stay right in the tribe I belong to, and I am  going to be loyal to the American tribe.   This abdication of our power and responsibility is truly, truly a  weakness in the face of partisanship, and my colleagues need to stand  up to the leaders. We have given too much power to the leadership here.   I remember the day when people used to talk about, oh, the committee  chairman had so much power. They could run a bill and make sure it got  on the floor and got voted on. Those days are gone. There is always a  reason why something doesn't go to the floor, even if it goes through  the committee process. Something comes out of the committee  unanimously, and it still doesn't come to the floor. Try to explain  that one.   To protect the powers of the Senators as representatives for their  States and to protect the institution of the Senate, that is not that  hard, and I know because I have done it. I have voted against my  colleagues on my side of the aisle. I was up front, and I was honest. I  said: I am sorry; I can't go home and explain that. It doesn't make  sense at all, and I am not voting for it.   If they want to get my vote, they are going to have to sit down and  say: What would it take to get your vote?   And I would explain to them: You have to adjust this or adjust this  and make sense.   It is fair to the minority, and if we were in the majority, or vice  versa, the majority should be fair to us. If you can work through that,  you can make it. You can make it on this side. If not, it is going to  be a miserable 6 years for every Senator who just got elected, if we  don't come back to reality.   I know I keep calling it an individual right, but it really isn't. It  is a trust passed down from the Senators who preceded us. They had the  will and they had the determination to make this place work, and we  have given up on that. This belongs to our constituents, the power we  have here, and we have no power to protect them now.   The solution to obstruction isn't ruining the Senate. It is outreach.  It is compromise. It is finding solutions that make a bunch of people  on the far left and the far right very uncomfortable and mad  sometimes. Until we are willing to do that, the hard work of this  institution is going to get worse. So it is not that we are fractured,  we are almost broken, and it was never intended. I have never seen  anything broken that we couldn't fix. I hope we come to our senses. I  hope we act as Americans. I hope we understand basically the whole  thought process from our Founding Fathers, who had the great insight of  having two bodies in a bicameral, not a unicameral, branch that was  supposed to work to help each other and protect us from ourselves.  Right now, we have become the worst enemy of ourselves. I hope we  change.    Thank you.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    It is. I thank my colleagues for their support of this  critical legislation and for participating in the discussion here  today.
