 Mr. President, for Congress to work on artificial  intelligence is to enter unchartered territory. AI is not like other  issues Congress deals with. It is not like appropriations or healthcare  or defense, where we have decades of experience to lean on; quite the  contrary, from a legislative view, we are starting very close to step 1  when it comes to AI.   So today, the Senate is taking the next step in our effort to learn  about AI so we can be ready to act. Later this afternoon, we will hold  the first-ever classified all-Senate briefing on national security  implications of AI. It will be our second all-Senate briefing on this  issue. Close to 70 Senators attended the last one, and I hope we will  get similar attendance today.   We will be briefed by Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines,  Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks, and other top experts in AI  from our defense and our intelligence Agencies.   Today's classified briefing is crucial because, of all the issues AI  would impact, national security may well be the most consequential. In  the hands of autocrats or foreign adversaries or domestic rogue actors  interested in political chaos or financial gain, the dangers of AI  could be extreme.   But AI could also become one of our greatest tools for keeping  Americans safe, for predicting and intercepting attacks on the homeland  and for adding unprecedented sophistication to our cyber security and  for protecting our elections. So we have a responsibility--a real  responsibility--to educate ourselves on these matters.   Finally, these briefings are just part of the larger effort to learn  more about AI and prepare the Senate to take action. Last month, I laid  out my SAFE Innovation Framework for AI, a way for Congress to balance  the urgent need to promote American innovation in AI, while making sure  it is done in a safe and responsible way.   Last month, I also announced that this fall I will invite the top AI  experts to come to Congress and convene a series of first-ever AI  insight forums for a new and unique approach to developing legislation.   There is a lot we still don't know about AI. We need outside help if  we want to ensure congressional action is effective, responsible, and  promotes innovation in a safe way.   So these insight forums will bring the best of the best to Congress.  Our  [[Page S2292]]  jobs as legislators will be to listen and learn as much as we can so we  can translate these ideas into action.   And we are getting a very positive response from those we are asking  to participate in the forums, top people in the field and in areas like  intellectual property, like facial recognition that we need to look for  guardrails.   So the positive response we are getting means that we expect these  inside forums to do just what they are intended to do: yield new  insights on the issue. And today's briefing likewise represents an  important step in our efforts to learn as much about AI as possible.   I look forward to today's briefing. I want to thank Senator Rounds,  Senator Heinrich, and Senator Young for their help in making them  possible.    I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin),  the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fetterman), the Senator from Maine  (Mr. King), and the Senator from New Hampshire (Mrs. Shaheen) are  necessarily absent.
