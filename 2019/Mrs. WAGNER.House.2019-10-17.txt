 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Huizenga) for yielding his time. He has been a terrific leader on  capital markets and has been serving in his capacity as we try and work  hard for that low- and middle-income investor, that Main Street  investor who is so important that we finally get some regulation and  some guidance in place that is going to make sure that they are getting  the information that is going to help them make good investment and  savings decisions that are truly in the best interest of that consumer.  The gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), the ranking member of the  Subcommittee on Investor Protection, Entrepreneurship, and Capital  Markets, is absolutely right.   Since my very first year in Congress 7 years ago, I have been  fighting for that Main Street investor. I have been fighting to make  sure that the best interest of that investor is in place.   This is not about Wall Street; it is about Main Street. It is about  taking care of the low- and middle-income consumer. And the SEC has  been dealing with this fiduciary rule and with the best interest  standard for years and years and years.   Mr. Chairman, we have studied it. We have had countless comment  periods. It has been litigated. The investor testing has been done.  Years and years have gone into this moment where the SEC is finally  ready and has, in fact, moved forward with the best interest standard.   The difficulty with this piece of legislation, H.R. 1815, is it is,  frankly, just a political ploy, Mr. Chairman, a political ploy that is  an attempt to stop the rule in its tracks, one that is going to take  care of those that need the kind of support from their broker-dealer  the most.   It is important that we finally have this issue back in the  jurisdiction of the SEC where it belongs. It is time that this rule  move forward and that we look out--all of us--for the best interest of  our retail investors. Let's let this go forward and stop the political  ploys.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment to H.R.  1815, which would apply the bill's additional investor testing  requirements only to disclosure documents developed after January 21,  2021.   If enacted, this legislation would hinder the implementation of  important rules designed to better protect Main Street investors,  particularly, the SEC's Regulation Best Interest rule. This rule has  been in effect since September 10, 2019, but it has a compliance date  of June 30, 2020.   If further and ongoing testing were required, it would onerously roll  back and delay further--after 7 years of testing, debate, deliberation,  comment periods, litigation, it would only roll back and further delay,  Mr. Chairman, all of the SEC's efforts to better protect those retail  investors.                                time  1330    The bottom line is that this legislation is duplicative for rules  already under consideration. The SEC has already conducted extensive  investor testing of the proposed Form CRS, a component of the  Regulation Best Interest rule. This is nothing, Mr. Chairman, but a  political ploy, rope-a-dope, more neglect in not doing the work of the  people. It does not serve those low- and middle-income investors, those  constituents of mine in Missouri's Second Congressional District.   It makes no sense to go back and conduct repetitive investor testing,  leaving broker dealers and their clients--again, there are low- and  middle-income investors--without a uniform best interest standard.   That is why I ask all of my colleagues to support this commonsense  amendment, and if it is not agreed to, to oppose the underlying bill,  H.R. 1815, that does nothing but delay and disserve the people that we  should be working hard to protect, those low- and middle-income retail  investors that are a part of our beautiful and wonderful Main Street  districts.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining?    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), the ranking member of the  Investor Protection, Entrepreneurship, and Capital Markets  Subcommittee, my friend, to speak in support of the amendment and in  opposition to the underlying bill.    Mr. Chairman, let me just say, I have been working on  this issue and fighting for the retail investors for all 7 of my years  here in Congress with several pieces of legislation to bring this to  fruition and to always, always hold that retail investor in the best  interest to make sure that we are taking care of them and giving them  the best advice, the best access, the best cost, but most of all that  we secure their savings and their retirement investment and do  everything we can to serve in their best interests. And that is why we  must bring this after 7 long years to a close.   It is time that we stop playing rope-a-dope with duplicative rules  that have already been under consideration and by conducting extensive  investor testing that has already been done. The SEC is the absolute  body of jurisdiction. They must harmonize with the Department of Labor,  and have, and now we have got a short, two-form page. We have got  disclosures and titles that are clear that is serving the best  interests of our constituents.    I would ask everyone to consider my amendment to H.R. 1815, and if it  is not agreed to, to oppose the underlying bill.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
