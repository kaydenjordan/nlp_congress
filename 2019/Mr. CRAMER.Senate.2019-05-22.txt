 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it recess until 9:30 a.m.,  Thursday, May 23; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day.
