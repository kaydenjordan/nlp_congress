 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life and  achievements of Mr. Roshell ``Mike'' Anderson, acclaimed journalist for  36 years with the Milwaukee-based television station, WISN-12.   Mike was born in Bogalusa, LA, in 1952 and raised in New Orleans. New  Orleans' rich musical culture inspired Mike's life-long passion for R&B  that landed him twice on the R&B soul charts in the 1970s with ``Snake  out of Green Grass'' and ``Grapevine will Lie Sometimes.'' His musical  accomplishments continued into the early 1990s and helped spawn a  unique brand of journalistic storytelling.   Mike attended Louisiana State University and the Career Academy  School of Broadcast Journalism in Atlanta, GA. He started his career as  a disc jockey in various Atlanta radio stations in 1970 and got his  start in television in Seattle, WA, in 1979. When Mike took the job at  WISN in Milwaukee in 1981, he planned to stay 3 years. He retired from  the station 36 years later in 2017.   Mike's journalism career spanned nearly four decades and six U.S.  Presidencies. He was proud to have interviewed Richard Nixon, George  Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush. But Mike's most powerful work  involved telling powerful and moving stories about the Milwaukee  community. He is perhaps best known for his two award-winning  documentaries on inner-city violence, ``Children in the Line of Fire''  and ``Solutions to Violence.''   Five years after Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, Mike returned  to his home city to cover the city's devastation and its slow process  of rehabilitation. Through his interviews with local residents, Mike  found stories of hope, resilience, and many sobering reminders that  much work was left to be done. As always, Mike brought his unique style  of warmth, kindness, and optimism to even the darkest issues and  events.   After breaking racial and class barriers, he mentored other  journalists of color and worked to celebrate their success through his  work with the Wisconsin Black Media Association and Milwaukee's annual  Black Excellence Awards.   Mike's straightforward style and commitment to fairness led to a deep  sense of trust on the part of his viewers. He will long be remembered  for telling the stories of Milwaukee honestly and with a deep  connection to the community.   Mike Anderson's most lasting legacy, however, is that he was beloved  by the Milwaukee community for not only being a great reporter people  could trust, he was a good person whose kindness will be missed.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life and work  of Mr. Eugene Albert Kane, a renowned, passionate, and fearless  journalist who for more than 30 years spoke truth to power and forced  his readers to confront the uncomfortable realities of racism and  injustice in Milwaukee, in Wisconsin, and in America.   Eugene was born to Eugene Albert Kane, Sr., and Hattie (Freeman)  Kane. He grew up in North Philadelphia and graduated from Temple  University where he majored in journalism and minored in Black studies.  In 1984, Eugene moved to Milwaukee to take a job with the Milwaukee  Journal, the precursor to today's Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. There, he  wrote what would become a very well-known column, ``Raising Kane.'' The  title's insinuation of stirring the pot and causing what civil rights  icon Congressman John Lewis has termed ``good trouble,'' was indeed,  intentional.   His early personal experiences with discrimination shaped his passion  for equality and his need to speak publicly about racism. His  grandfather, seriously ill with pneumonia, died after being turned away  from hospital emergency rooms because of the color of his skin. As a  teenager attending a mostly White school, Eugene remembered a fellow  student he considered a friend, who taunted and berated him with vile  racist insults. Racism followed him into his professional life as well.  He recounted times when it was next to impossible to obtain interviews  from people in mostly White settings and was even falsely accused of  being part of a pickpocket scheme while covering the Green Bay Packers  in 1997 during Super Bowl XXXI in New Orleans. These experiences and  others inspired him to give voice to the systematic racism saw and the  lack of economic opportunities facing African Americans in Milwaukee  and the country. Rather than shying away from the unvarnished truth of  racism and social injustice in America, he walked right towards it, pen  and notebook in hand.   As a Black journalist who elevated the voice of Black Milwaukee in a  column read predominantly by a White audience, Eugene's work garnered  irritation as well as praise. Even a fellow Wisconsin journalist  wondered out loud why the Journal Sentinel would ``give this guy a soap  box?'' He took hateful responses to his column in stride, viewing them  as proof his words were landing exactly where they needed to. In fact,  he took pride in motivating people to care enough about an issue to  disagree with him.   A greater number of readers and colleagues, however, were motivated  to praise his work. In 2014, he was inducted into both the Wisconsin  Media Hall of Fame and the Milwaukee Press Club Hall of Fame. In 1992,  he was awarded the Knight Fellowship at Stanford University. He also  received national recognition, winning first place for Best General  Column from the Society of Professional Journalists in 2000 and two  first-place National Headliner Awards for Best Local Interest Column in  2001 and 2003.   His accomplishments and contributions went beyond the written word.  He hosted ``Black Nouveau'' on Milwaukee Public Television from 2002- 2006, taught at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and Marquette  University, and served as president of the Wisconsin Black Media  Association in 2002.   I am forever grateful that Eugene shared his important perspective  throughout his long, storied career. Each step of the way he  demonstrated the courage to tell the truth and shine a light on the  injustices that were more comfortably left unspoken. This is a true  testament to the value he served Wisconsin as a journalist.   Eugene was a vital and honest voice for the Milwaukee community. Call  him an agitator if you must. I don't believe he would have it any other  way. He said and wrote and needed to be heard and read. Eugene Kane  will be missed by so many, but what he said and the words of wisdom he  wrote will  [[Page S2322]]  not be forgotten to us. They should be, and will be carried on                            ____________________
