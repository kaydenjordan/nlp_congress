 Mr. President, today the Senate will vote to confirm  Loren L. AliKhan to the U.S. District Court for the District of  Columbia.   Born in Baltimore, MD, Judge AliKhan earned her J.D., magna cum  laude, at the Georgetown University Law Center. She also received her  B.A., summa cum laude, and A.A., with distinction, from Bard College at  Simon's Rock. After law school, Judge AliKhan completed clerkships on  the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and on  the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. She then served as a Bristow Fellow  in the Solicitor General's Office at the U.S. Department of Justice.  Judge AliKhan then worked as an associate and later counsel at  O'Melveny & Myers LLP. There, she represented companies in matters  involving contract interpretation, statutory interpretation, class  certification, antitrust, patent infringement, and products liability.   From 2018 to 2022, Judge AliKhan served as solicitor general in the  Office of the Attorney General for the District of Columbia after  previously serving as acting solicitor general and deputy solicitor  general. In that role, she was responsible for the District's  litigation in local and Federal trial and appellate courts on issues  including constitutional law, criminal law, employment discrimination,  tax, and torts. In 2022, Judge AliKhan was confirmed to the DC Court of  Appeals, where she has heard approximately 100  [[Page S5728]]  appeals as a member of a merits panel and has issued 200 decisions as a  member of a motions panel.   The American Bar Association rated Judge AliKhan as ``well  qualified,'' and her nomination is strongly supported by Congresswoman  Eleanor Holmes Norton.   The Senate Judiciary Committee also received several letters of  support for Judge AliKhan's nomination to the Federal bench, including  from a bipartisan group of current and former State solicitors general  across the country.   Judge AliKhan's qualifications, including her judicial and litigation  experience, make her exceptionally qualified to serve on the Federal  bench. I am proud to support her nomination and urge my colleagues to  do the same.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 3404         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
