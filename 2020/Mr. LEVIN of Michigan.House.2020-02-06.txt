 Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Scott for his  incredible leadership on this bill.   Mr. Chairman, I am so proud to support the PRO Act. It is an  essential step to restoring the power of the American middle class,  raising wages, improving benefits and working conditions, and tackling  income inequality.   I have spent most of my career helping workers form unions and  bargain collectively, so I know firsthand the power that comes with the  ability to organize.   Union workers make, on average, 13 percent more than their nonunion  counterparts; they are 27 percent more likely to be offered health  insurance through their employers; and they are five times as likely as  nonunion workers to have a real pension.   Working families across this country who are trying to make ends meet  need bigger paychecks, better benefits, and a safe place to work where  they are treated with respect. The PRO Act will get us there, and I  urge my colleagues to support it.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I want to emphasize that the  gentlewoman's amendment is not about the PRO Act; it is about current  law.   All the PRO Act does on the question of lists and how they are to be  given from the company to the union is codifying current law. So this  is not an argument against the PRO Act; it is an argument against the  structure of our labor relations as they have been for decades.   Mr. Chair, I would offer to the gentlewoman that, if she would like  to join me in writing the law that would allow workers to have access  to union organizers in the workplace, I would be glad to do that with  her, and then we wouldn't need a law that allows workers to gain access  to unions the only way they can under our system, which is at home or  on the phone.    Our country provides workers no right to have access to union staff  in  [[Page H900]]  their workplace. It is pretty unusual among countries. And if the  gentlewoman is serious about feeling like it is better for workers to  interact with the union at work rather than at home, that would be a  wonderful discussion to have for another day.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chairwoman, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.   The Acting Chair (Ms. Pingree). The gentleman is recognized for 5  minutes.    Madam Chairwoman, first I would like to enter  into the Record letters of support for the PRO Act from the  International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the International Federation of  Professional & Technical Engineers and the United Auto Workers.   [[Page H906]]                                            International Brotherhood                                                    of Teamsters,                                                   February 4, 2020.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.4 million members       of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, I am writing       to state our strong support for H.R. 2474, the Protecting the       Right to Organize Act (PRO Act). I urge you to support this       critical legislation and to oppose any weakening amendments       and any motion to recommit when H.R. 2474 comes to the House       floor this week.        Today, the economy is not working for working people. Wages       have stagnated for workers across the economy, while income       has skyrocketed for CEO's and the wealthiest one percent.       This inequality is the result of a loss of bargaining power       and the erosion of workers' ability to exercise their rights       on the job.        Today, when workers make the decision to stand together and       bargain with their employer for improved working conditions,       the deck is stacked against them from day one. Under current       law, unscrupulous employers, armed with limitless funds,       routinely violate the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) and       block workers' ability to exercise their right to bargain for       better wages and better working conditions. The Protecting       the Right to Organize Act is an important step forward for       workers' rights. It would restore and strengthen worker       protections which have been eroded over the years.        The Protecting the Right to Organize Act addresses several       major weaknesses in current law. H.R. 2474 enacts meaningful,       enforceable penalties on employers who break the law and       gives workers a private right of action if they've been       terminated for union activity. The bill would make elections       fairer by prohibiting employers from using coercive       activities like captive audience meetings. H.R. 2474       establishes a process for mediation and arbitration to stop       stalling tactics at the bargaining table and help parties       achieve a first contract. Importantly, the bill also       addresses rampant intentional misclassification and ensures       that misclassified workers are not deprived of their right to       form a union under the NLRA. These are among the many       important provisions in the bill to help restore the middle       class.        Research shows that workers want unions. However, there is       a huge gap between the share of workers with union       representation and the share of workers that would like to       have a union and a voice on the job. The PRO Act would take a       major step forward in closing that gap and ultimately growing       a strong middle class.        I urge you to demonstrate to the American people that       workers and their rights are a priority for this Congress. I       hope I can tell our members that you stood with them and       other workers in their efforts to achieve meaningful workers'       rights and protections and better wages and working       conditions. The Teamsters Union urges you to support H.R.       2474 and oppose all efforts to weaken this bill by amendment.            Sincerely,                                                    James P. Hoffa,      General President.                                   ____                                         International Federation of                              Professional & Technical Engineers,                                   Washington, DC, January 31, 2020.        Dear Representative: On behalf of 90,000 workers       represented by the International Federation of Professional       and Technical Engineers (IFPTE), we urge you to vote for the       H.R. 2474, the Protecting the Right to Organize Act of 2019       (PRO Act), scheduled for a floor vote next week. As currently       written, the PRO Act would restore and protect workers'       rights to organize and collectively bargain in their       workplaces and we urge you to oppose any Motion to Recommit       and any amendments that would weaken the language, intent, or       purpose of the bill.        If enacted, the PRO Act would counter the all too common       anti-union intimidation tactics that workers who are       organizing a union are subjected to. For example, upwards of       800 highly trained professionals employed by Southern       California Edison are currently engaged in an organizing       effort with IFPTE Local 20 to address issues such as       mandatory overtime and ever-shortening training for new       hires. These designers, estimators, field planning       technicians, and planners play an important role in ensuring       safety and wildfire mitigation to the more than 15 million       people in Southern California. Unfortunately, Southern       California Edison has decided to engage in some of the very       anti-worker behavior that this bill seeks to correct. This       include such activities as mandatory all-staff captive       audience meetings, one on one meetings, and handing out anti-      union literature filled with misinformation, all aimed at       discouraging union activity.        The PRO Act would counter the all too common anti-union       intimidation tactics that workers in union organizing       campaigns and first contract negotiations are subjected to.       This bill meaningfully restores workers' rights to determine       for themselves if they want a union by providing a fair       process for union recognition if the National Labor Relations       Board (NLRB) determines that the employer illegally       interfered with the union representation election. Provisions       in the bill also allow the union or the employer to request a       mediation-arbitration process for first contract negotiations       that take longer than 90 days. Language in this bill that       prohibits captive audience meetings and reinstates the       employer requirement to disclose any hiring of anti-union       consultants will help workers make informed choices when they       receive information from their employers. By clarifying and       updating the National Labor Relations Act's definitions for       employee, supervisor, and employer, the PRO Act closes       loopholes that allow employers to misclassify workers and       prevents employers from dodging joint employer liability.       Furthermore, this bill gives the NLRB the authority to       conduct economic analysis as it sets policies and       regulations, increases penalties against employers who       violate the National Labor Relations Act, requires employers       to reinstate workers while the NLRB investigates the       retaliatory firing, and gives unions the ability to collect       fair-share fees.        For all the reasons above, IFPTE we request you vote for       the PRO Act and opposed any weakening amendments that may be       considered.            Sincerely,                                                      Paul Shearon,                                                         President.                                                     Matthew Biggs,      Secretary-Treasurer/Legislative Director.                                   ____           International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace &             Agricultural Implement Workers of America--UAW,                                                  January 29, 2020.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the more than one million       active and retired members of the International Union, United       Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of       America, UAW, I urge you to vote Yes on the Protecting the       Right to Organize (PRO) Act (H.R. 2474) and oppose any       weakening amendments, including the motion to recommit.        The right to form unions paved the way for the creation of       a strong middle class. Over time, unions have vastly improved       workplace rights, wages, benefits, and conditions for all       workers. A worker with a union contract earns, on average,       13.2 percent more in wages than a peer with similar       education, occupation, and experience in a nonunionized       workplace in the same sector. Although unions are fundamental       to rebuilding the middle class, the percentage of workers in       unions has declined over the last several decades. Weak labor       laws, anti-worker policies and court rulings have severely       curtailed workers' rights to have a voice on the job.       Aggressive employer anti-union campaigns and weak labor laws       have taken a toll on workers as union membership has       diminished from 33 percent in 1956 to 10 percent in 2019. The       ramifications of anti-worker policies extend well beyond the       workplace and impact our society at large. Our labor laws       need to be strengthened significantly.        Over the past several decades, workers seeking to form       their union at their workplace have faced aggressive       opposition from unscrupulous corporations and other well       financed anti-union special interest groups. According to the       Economic Policy Institute (EPI), in one out of every three       campaigns, employers fire pro-union workers, and spend at       least $1 billion annually in opposition to organizing. EPI       found that 90 percent of employers require captive-audience       meetings to dissuade workers from joining a union.        Lower unionization rates harm our middle class, economy and       democratic institutions. Collective bargaining raises wages       for both union and non-union workers, lessens racial wage       gaps, and increases wages for women.        The PRO Act directly addresses these and other problems by       including provisions that could help ensure workers have a       voice on the job and a fair opportunity to form a union if       they so choose. Under the PRO Act, the National Labor       Relations Board (NLRB) would be empowered to assess       significant monetary penalties to deter or punish employers       that unlawfully fire workers for exercising their rights to       form a union or for speaking out to improve working       conditions. The bill would also allow workers to enforce       their labor rights in federal court and prohibit mandatory       attendance in captive audience meetings. Should workers vote       to form a union, the NLRB would be authorized to order       immediate bargaining of a first contract, which would avoid       common employer stall tactics and deliberate       misclassification of workers. It would also ensure that       unions can collect ``fair-share fees'' and eliminates so-      called ``right to work'' laws in order for unions to have the       necessary resources to effectively enforce collective       bargaining agreements and other legally protected rights.        Furthermore, the PRO Act protects employees' right to       strike by preventing employers from hiring permanent       replacement workers. H.R. 2474 also permits unrepresented       employees to engage in collective action or class action       lawsuits to enforce basic workplace rights, rather than being       forced to arbitrate such claims alone. It also reigns in       offensive lockouts. In a lockout, a company expels its union-      represented employees from the worksite, locks the gate, and       refuses to permit them to return to work unless they accept       the employer's proposal. Companies have all too often chosen       to lock out workers than rather engage in good faith       negotiations.        The PRO Act will strengthen the middle class and our       national economy. We urge you to vote Yes on H.R. 2474.            Sincerely,                                                       Josh Nassar,                                          UAW Legislative Director.     Madam Chairwoman, I would remind the gentleman  that the strikes of 1937 were  [[Page H907]]  precisely the result of the arrangement, the balance that was struck by  the National Labor Relations Act, which was passed in 1935.   The National Labor Relations Act sets forth procedures so that  workers and employers could both advocate for their rights in the  economy. And so to ban intermittent strikes, as the gentleman would  propose, puts at stake two core portions of our Constitution's First  Amendment: the freedom to peaceably assemble and the freedom of speech.   This amendment would place speech- and content-based restrictions on  workers only because they choose to gather and speak on behalf of a  union or forming a union.   We freely allow civil rights protesters, animal welfare activists,  anti-choice activists, and all others to gather and share their  messages. Union members should be no different.   Understand, going on strike is an option of last resort. No worker  wants to risk their job and their paycheck to walk a picket line in the  cold, the rain, or anything in-between. I have stood with striking  workers and seen their resolve and know the impact striking has on them  and their families.   These workers strike because they must, because they have no other  option but to say: ``No more.'' We must respect this resolve by  allowing workers the dignity to stand up for themselves and shout:  ``One day longer. One day stronger.''   I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Chairwoman, recently, members of the  United Auto Workers went on strike at General Motors for 40 days. There  was no leader who made them do this, and I have never seen a strike, in  fact in my life, that was dictated by someone from on high. The workers  voted, in that case way over 90 percent, to go on strike.   When I repeatedly visited picket lines at various workplaces  throughout my district in Michigan, I was amazed that a lot of the  veteran workers were out there striking; not for themselves. They were  striking for workers forced to be temporary workers, and not having  full-time status and regularized status for months and years at a time.   These veteran workers, some of whom had worked there 10, 20, 30 years  said it just felt wrong to work side by side doing the same job with  someone who was denied the pay and benefits due to workers at that  workplace.   All of this talk about union bosses disgusts me, Madam Chairwoman.  Unions are organizations that workers build themselves to advocate for  their interests. They are nonprofits. They are not businesses. In an  economy where the real bosses are making 300 and 400 times what the  regular workers make, that is something that would be an obscenity to  the people in the manufacturing sector, to CEOs in the manufacturing  sector, decades ago.   The CEO of General Motors, then the biggest company in the land, made  80 times or 50 times--I forget, something like that--what the workers  made, which is nothing like what happens today. Those are the bosses  that need to be brought under control.   The right to strike is basic to our labor relations and it must be  preserved. We must pass the PRO Act.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chairman, I claim the time in opposition  to this amendment.    Madam Chairwoman, this amendment is a naked  attempt to undermine unions by making it harder to collect reasonable  fees for the services that they are required by law to perform.   Unions have a legal obligation to represent and advocate for all  members of  [[Page H909]]  a bargaining unit, even if those people choose to remain nonunion. As a  result, the law has created a perverse incentive for workers to receive  the benefits of unions' labor without paying a reasonable fee for these  services--in fact, without paying anything at all.   For years, so-called right-to-work laws have been wildly misnamed.  They don't actually provide any right to a job. Instead, they allow  States to interfere with the freedom of contract, solely for the  purposes of pitting workers against one another and threatening a  union's ability to exist at all.   Let me be clear, the PRO Act does not allow the employer and union to  agree that employees must be a member of the union as a condition of  employment. Despite the rhetoric, that has not been possible since the  late 1940s when the Supreme Court decided that no worker can be  required to be a member of a union. It is simply false. Nor does it  allow fair share dues to go toward political activity or advocacy.   It covers only the cost of representation and contract  administration, what the union is required by law to provide for  everybody in the bargaining unit.   The PRO Act simply restores fairness to the system.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chairwoman, the real motives are  revealed in the rhetoric. This is an attack on unions themselves.   The way that our labor relations have been organized since the 1930s  when the Wagner Act was passed is that private-sector labor relations  are governed by Federal law. Everything about our National Labor  Relations Act and the way workers can form unions in the private sector  and the rules for how elections happen, all these things are Federal.   This carve-out for States to be able to try to starve workers'  organizations by allowing this free-riding to go on is something that  happened over President Truman's veto, and, yes, we have been against  it for the last 70 years. The proof is in the pudding. The right-to- freeload States have lower incomes; they have lower percentages of  workers who have benefits; and they have shorter life expectancy.    Over and over, the statistics show that workers and families are  better off. The old saw about letting people keep their hard-earned  money, unions are something that workers form voluntarily to advance  their interests. Union members make more money than nonunion members.  They make a great investment by coming together and bargaining together  to form a union.   Our labor relations are set up for workers to make a democratic  choice as a group in a workplace about whether or not to form a union.  If workers come together and make that choice, it is only fair that  everybody pays their fair share to administer the contract that  benefits all of them.   Madam Chairwoman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chairwoman, I challenge the gentleman to  point out a Chamber of Commerce in this country that allows people to  receive the benefits of the chamber without paying dues. They have  members and nonmembers. Health clubs, any kind of organization in this  country, people pay their fair share for the benefits that it creates.   The purpose of right-to-freeload laws has been nakedly obvious from  the beginning in the 1940s when they were pushed by far rightwing  foundations like the Olin Foundation and the Scaife Foundation, whose  sole purpose was to destroy collective bargaining in this country.   The other side is trying to destroy the solidarity of American  workers, to benefit the bosses and the employers that want to have a  union-free environment.   The facts are so obvious. When workers come together and form unions,  they make more money; they make better wages; they are five times more  likely to have a pension; and they are much more likely to have  employer-provided health insurance. This is the truth.   Employers and their enablers simply want to destroy collective  bargaining in this country, and I don't care if it is State by State or  any other way.   Right is right, and wrong is wrong. These laws have been wrong since  they came into existence, and they are still wrong today.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    I rise in opposition to this amendment, Madam  Chairwoman.    Madam Chairwoman, there are no workers in  America who are ``locked into collective bargaining agreements  negotiated decades ago''--zero.   What happens in our country is that workers vote to form a union in a  workplace, and then they periodically negotiate contracts.   Usually, contracts last 2 or 3 years, 4 or 5 years. It is usually  employers who want them to last longer. And the two parties, in freedom  of contract, agree on those terms.   What the gentleman's amendment seeks to do is not for workers to have  any rights whatsoever. Workers already have the right to decertify a  union through an election. What this amendment seeks to do is to give a  right to employers to destroy unions by not recognizing a union anymore  under very strange circumstances.   The point of the National Labor Relations Act is to protect  employees' freedom to choose a union or refrain from forming a union.  This amendment, however, undermines that right by allowing an employer  to step in and demand a new election without any objective showing that  the union no longer enjoys majority support, no objective showing  whatsoever.   As I said, employees already have the right to petition for another  election if that is what they want. That is an existing law. It is in  the PRO Act.   This amendment is a backdoor to providing an employer the ability to  conduct another antiunion campaign designed to sow fear and discord  amongst its employees. Under this amendment, a union with majority  support could be challenged by an employer simply by virtue of the  passage of time and the natural turnover that exists in all workplaces.   My colleagues across the aisle often speak about the need to protect  employees' rights to choose a union, and yet here they are seeking to  undermine that very right. This amendment is about promoting  decertification, not protecting the rights of workers.   Madam Chairwoman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chairwoman, I reiterate that workers  have the right to decertify a union if they want to under existing law  and under the PRO Act. It doesn't change that. What we do is say that  employers may not stop recognizing a union simply because of turnover.   If workers negotiated a contract with an employer through their union  several years ago and now there has been some turnover, that doesn't  mean the workers are against the collective bargaining agreement that  benefits them. The contract will expire, and then the workers will  negotiate another one, whichever workers are there at that time. At  that time, if a majority of the workers want to decertify the union,  they are fully free to do that.   What the gentleman is trying to defend is the employer's role in  destroying unions. That is what is really going on here.   Madam Chairwoman, in my 30-some years of being involved in the labor  movement, the biggest problem in workers' freedom to form unions is the  idea that the employers are a party, and you have to try to create a  union or keep a union by going up against your boss, the person who  decides your wages, decides your assignment. This is just another  tactic to allow employers to pressure workers out of having collective  bargaining.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chairwoman, I reserve the balance of my  time.    How much time do I have, Madam Chairwoman?    Madam Chairwoman, I would point out that the  gentleman's amendment says that an employer alleging that a labor  organization no longer has majority status because of turnover may seek  a decertification election. The gentleman's amendment empowers the  employer to decertify the union.   What we are doing in the PRO Act is overturning the Johnson Controls  decision of the Trump NLRB from July 3 of last year that allowed an  employer to announce it was withdrawing recognition of a union because  of this turnover, because simply more than half the people weren't  there the last time they negotiated a contract or when the union was  formed.   This is an attempt to allow employers to determine that they want  another election and to go all, again, through the captive audience  meetings where they force workers to attend on pain of termination,  meetings whose sole purpose is to scare workers out of forming a union,  to show movies or other propaganda that doesn't have to be truthful at  all to scare workers out of forming a union.   It is time to stop having employers prevent workers from forming a  union. That was the purpose of this amendment. That is why I oppose it.  I urge all my colleagues to oppose it.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the  motion to recommit.    Madam Speaker, the PRO Act is about tackling  income inequality and remedying laws that have failed to protect  workers' rights.   The PRO Act expressly says it shall not be construed to amend any  laws regarding hiring undocumented workers. It also prevents employers  from being able to bust a union organizing drive simply by firing  undocumented workers they had hired previously.   The real-world effect of this MTR is to create a perverse incentive  to go ahead and hire undocumented workers, because they could never  receive information from a union about organizing.   Moreover, carving out undocumented workers from organizing deters all  workers from exercising their rights. Employees who witness employers  violating labor laws without repercussions will be afraid to rely on  the National Labor Relations Act.   Finally, our immigration laws require employers to find out about  whether workers are documented or not. There is no provision in our  laws that allow unions to find that out.   This MTR is truly bad policy. It will encourage more hiring of  undocumented workers; exactly the opposite of what the authors intend.  But the main thing is it will undermine the freedom to form unions and  bargain collectively for all workers.   Republicans offered this MTR to score political points. But we are  focused on rebuilding the American middle class.   I have spent most of my career helping workers form unions and  bargain collectively. The power of workers to unite and demand fair  wages, better benefits, and safer working conditions is truly  inspiring, and it is essential for working families simply trying to  get by.   Right now, corporate profits are skyrocketing, while the share of  healthcare costs paid by employers is falling. Worker productivity is  at a peak, yet wages are stagnant. The gap between the rich and poor is  the highest ever recorded.    One of the main causes of these problems is declining union  membership, which is at its lowest point in decades. The PRO Act is  about reversing these trends so workers can enjoy their fair share in  the economy that they help create.   Recent studies have shown that in cities where union membership is  strong, children in low-income families go on to ascend to higher  income levels than their parents. Isn't that what every parent wants?   Creating a pathway to a better life, that is the American Dream, and  that is the power of a union.   Fifty-eight million Americans say they would join a union if given  the opportunity; 58 million, 48 percent of nonunion workers.   Just think of the impact we could have simply by making it easier for  Americans to exercise the rights they already supposedly have under the  law; rights that have been undermined systematically by special  interests that want to keep the economy working for the very  wealthiest, at the expense of the vast majority of Americans.   The PRO Act is about that most American of ideals, freedom. All we  are doing today is allowing workers to decide on their own, free of  harassment and intimidation, whether or not they wish to form a union  and bargain collectively, and to access their other rights under the  NLRA.   When we pass the PRO Act today, we say loud and clear that we are not  on the side of special interests. We stand proudly on the side of  working families.   I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this motion to  recommit, and to vote ``yes'' on the PRO Act.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott),  the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.
