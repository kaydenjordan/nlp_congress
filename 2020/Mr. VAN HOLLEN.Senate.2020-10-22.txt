 Mr. President, every day we see more Americans dying  from COVID-19 and more Americans contracting this virus. As of today,  we have hit the awful mark of over 220,000 Americans dead from COVID- 19, the highest death level in the entire world, and, with that, we are  also experiencing the economic fallout and pain that has come with it.   It did not have to be this way. President Trump knew about this  deadly virus early on, and he could have and should have acted. But  even at this moment, there are things that this U.S. Senate can be  doing to both stop the spread of the virus and ease the economic pain.  We could be taking up and voting on the legislation that passed the  House of Representatives called the Heroes Act, which is a  comprehensive emergency relief package for the American people--both  addressing testing and contact tracing and other issues to stop the  spread of the virus and providing essential economic relief to American  families, workers, and businesses that are struggling from the fallout.   But we haven't even had a chance to vote on that bill here in the  U.S. Senate. The Heroes Act was passed by the House more than 5 months  ago, and then, recently, the House passed a revised version called  Heroes 2.0. We tried to get a vote on that just this past Tuesday here  in the U.S. Senate. It was blocked by the Republican leader, Senator  McConnell, and here we have 12 days to go until the election. Instead  of focusing on that relief, we are trying to rush through and use an  illegitimate process to put another Justice on the Court.   But there is something else that we should also be doing now instead  of rushing a Justice on the Court, in addition to the Heroes Act, and  that is defending the integrity of our democratic process and the  integrity of our elections.   That is what brings me to the floor today because we have, of course,  a few days to go--12 days, to be exact--to get to the election. Yet it  has been years--not just 1 year, not just 2 years, not just 3 years-- years when some of us have been pushing to enact legislation here to  defend against foreign interference in our elections--Russian  interference, which we have known about since 2016, and interference  from other adversaries.   So, yesterday, we heard from the Director of National Intelligence  that there are foreign actors interfering in our elections and  attempting to disrupt our process--Russia and Iran. Well, the question  for the U.S. Senate is not the issue of whether we were going to have  foreign interference. The question for the U.S. Senate is, Why did we  sit back and do nothing about it for 3 years--for 3 years?   Senator Rubio and I introduced a bipartisan bill. It is called the  DETER Act, which is very straightforward. It says that if we catch  Russia and Putin interfering in our elections again, there will be  automatic, swift sanctions, so if you are Vladimir Putin and you are  thinking about interfering in our elections, you will know there will  be a certain price to pay. Right now, it is cost-free to the Russians  and cost-free to other adversaries.   Our bill called for the executive branch to put together a plan to  respond and establish upfront penalties not just for Russian  interference but for interference from any adversary. That is the way  you deter interference in the first place. You can't stop interference  if there is no cost to be borne by the adversary seeking to disrupt  your process. That is pretty simple.   We have used the idea and concept of deterrence in many other cases  to try to keep the peace. Yet, here we are, talking about safeguarding  our democracy by putting in place a very simple mechanism to say to  anyone who wants to undermine faith in the democratic process or  support a particular candidate--as Russia did in 2016 and as they have  worked to do over the last couple of years in favor of President  Trump--to put in place a process where they know if they get caught,  they will be punished, and I don't mean punishing a few oligarchs. I am  not talking about punishing a few bureaucrats who may be responsible  for actually doing the disruption, but creating penalties on the  Russian economy--the banking sector, the energy sector--because we all  know that you don't have Russian bureaucrats and intelligence officials  interfere in our elections without the green light from the very top,  and that is true of other adversaries who seek to interfere in our  elections.   So the real question is, Why do we continue to see stonewalling on  this simple legislation? Why does the Trump administration continue to  oppose it? And why doesn't the Senate do its job as an independent  body, supposedly, to protect the integrity of our elections?   Here is what President Trump said just a few years ago in Helsinki  when he was side by side with President Putin. President Trump said:         My people came to me--Dan Coats came to me and some       others--they said they think it's Russia. I have President       Putin; he just said it's not Russia.        I will say this: I don't see any reason why it would be. .       . . I have confidence in both parties.    Then he went on to say:         I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I       will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and       powerful in his denial today.    This was years ago, yet we hear from our intelligence officials that  Russia is still interfering. We heard that just yesterday and that  other adversaries are interfering.  [[Page S6391]]    But the Trump administration didn't want to do a damn thing about it,  and, unfortunately, this body has been complicit in doing nothing-- doing nothing--to seriously protect the integrity of our elections. We  have to keep asking ourselves the question why we would leave ourselves  defenseless. The only thing you can keep going back to are these  continuing statements by President Trump talking about how he respects  his friendship with Vladimir Putin and President Trump's actions time  and again favoring the Russian position.    We have a last-minute opportunity here. There are 12 days to go  before our election. Let us, finally, in light of the information we  got yesterday and the information we have gotten on a monthly basis,  let us, as the U.S. Senate, at least say today: If we catch you,  Russia, if we catch you, Iran, we don't care who you are, if you are an  adversary interfering in our elections, there will be a price to pay.   That was a bipartisan idea more than 2 years ago. We still get a lot  of lipservice in favor of it here on a bipartisan basis. But when it  comes to actually doing something about it and holding a vote, time and  again we are denied that opportunity.   What is interesting is when this issue came up just last year as part  of the national defense authorization bill, we had a motion on this  floor to instruct the conferees from the House and the Senate that as  part of the Defense authorization bill, we thought it was important to  also protect our democracy from interference. We said that you should  include a provision like the DETER Act. But as soon as that got behind  closed doors, there was a furious effort by the Republican Senate  leader and the Trump administration to prevent that from happening. I  had numerous conversations with my colleague from the House side, the  chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and it was opposed by the  administration and opposed by the Republican Senate.   So here we are. Nobody should be surprised by what we heard  yesterday. The surprise for the American people has got to be: Why the  hell didn't we do anything about this for 3 years? We brought everybody  together after 2016. I remember we lined up all the intelligence  officials, including recent appointees by President Trump, and they all  told us what had happened in 2016. Everybody said we are going to work  really hard to stop it from happening in 2020. Yet one thing that we  could do to make it clear upfront that there would be a price to pay,  we have not done. Shame on the U.S. Senate for not moving forward.   There are 12 days left. The clock is ticking. Let's finally take  action so at least our adversaries will know that there will be a price  to pay if they continue in these final 12 days to try to interfere in  our election process.   Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs be discharged  from further consideration of S. 1060, the DETER Act, and the Senate  proceed to its immediate consideration. I further ask unanimous consent  that the bill be considered read a third time and passed, and that the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I thank my colleague for the comments,  but to suggest that this is a fight over the schedule and not an effort  to protect our elections from what we know is an ongoing and continuing  imminent threat, I believe, misses the point entirely.   He mentioned that this is a take-it-or-leave-it proposition. I would  suggest that the Senate has already taken this because we voted  unanimously last year, as part of the Defense authorization bill, to  adopt this provision as part of our national defense to defend our  democracy. Every single Senator voted--or no one came forward to object  at that time. Yet here we are 12 days out from election, no action  taken. We get this report yesterday about foreign interference, and  nobody should say: Oh, we are shocked there is foreign interference in  our election going on. The shocking thing is we haven't done enough.   I appreciate him listing some of the actions the administration took  about particular Russian individuals, oligarchs, but as you know, and  as we know, the DETER Act is not aimed at just punishing particular  bureaucrats and apparatchiks who are obeying the orders of President  Putin. The whole idea is to deter President Putin by making him  understand that he and his country will pay a price if they interfere  by sanctions on the banking sector and on the all-important energy  sector in Russia.   In order to stop interference, we need to do two things: We need to  harden our systems at home. My colleague mentioned some of the actions  that have been taken to do that. I will remind my colleagues that  Democrats put forward the proposal for more resources for State and  local governments to harden those defenses, and it was only after a big  fight and lots of opposition from the Republican leader here in the  Senate that we were able to get those funds. Additional funds have been  sitting in the Heroes Act which passed the House 5 months ago and yet  nothing.   In the proposal put forward the other day by the Republican leader,  there was no more money to harden our defenses. But hardening our  defenses is not enough. What you want to do is prevent the attacks in  the first place, prevent the interference in the first place. And so  long as that is cost-free to Vladimir Putin or any other adversary,  they are going to go for it. They have got nothing to lose. They have  got everything to gain by sowing more unrest and lack of confidence  here.   So the way to deal with that is the DETER Act. And the Senate agreed,  at least with that unanimous vote a little while ago, and then nothing  happened. Yet, we got report after report from our intelligence  community that--no surprise--we have this ongoing interference.   The Senator mentioned all these actions the Trump administration has  taken. Obviously, Vladimir Putin didn't get the message. He didn't get  the message. Taking pinprick actions after the fact isn't going to  scare off Vladimir Putin or any of our adversaries. The only way to get  them to focus and stop interfering is to say now, up front, that if you  cross this wire, if you trip this threshold and interfere in our  elections in certain substantial ways, it is going to hurt--not just  somebody in the bowels of your bureaucracy or one intelligence officer  or five or ten, but it is going to hurt, and you are going to feel the  pain in your country.   So I must say I remain incredibly disappointed that, even at this  late hour, we are unwilling, as a body, to take this very important  action, just as we have been unwilling to act on the Heroes Act, both  the first version and the second version.   I think, as my colleagues know, the Democratic leader has proposed  that we adjourn subject to being called back for the purpose of acting  on a bipartisan agreement, which we would all like to see, on a COVID- 19 response bill but something which the Republican Senate leader has  said he is unwilling to pursue, even the contours of an agreement that  have been discussed between Speaker Pelosi and the administration. The  majority leader continues to block that, and we continue to see today  blocking a measure to protect our democracy with 12 days to go before  November 3.   So, again, I think we are going to rue the day that we weren't clear,  up front, that the United States is going to stand up and protect its  democratic process.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I will be very brief in response.   This is a bipartisan bill. It has bipartisan cosponsorship. We have  been working for 3 years. We have made changes. And the proof that  everything we are doing right now is not working is the fact that we  just had the DNI say we continue to have Russian interference and other  interference in our election. That is why we have to do something.
