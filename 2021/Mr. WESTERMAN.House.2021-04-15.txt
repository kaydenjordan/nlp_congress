 Madam Speaker, it has been 85 days since President  Biden halted the Keystone pipeline. We have yet to see those green jobs  he promised. Promises won't pay the bills.   We stand with the hardworking Americans who were forced out of work  and ask this administration, Where are the jobs? Knee-jerk policies  here in Washington have life-altering implications for people like Mr.  Neal Crabtree, a welder and union foreman from my district who lost his  job on the Keystone pipeline.   Of course, if you bring up this topic with Climate Czar John Kerry,  he will tell you all these workers can switch to working in solar  energy.   Madam Speaker, from looking at salary data, a welding wand in the  hand of a highly-skilled pipeline welder is worth more than two  screwdrivers in the hands of solar panel installers.   These job-killing energy policies are yet another example of how out  of touch the Biden administration is with the men and women who keep  our country going.   Talk is cheap, action is harder. If President Biden is going to  continue promising these elusive green jobs, then he needs a long-term  plan in  [[Page H1838]]  place. A plan to have a plan is not enough.   Neal Crabtree and thousands of Americans like him are the people the  Democrats are choosing to forget. We won't forget them.                            ____________________
