 Mr. Speaker, when John Tang was earning his doctoral  degree in physics at Georgia Tech in 1999, he never imagined that some  20 years later he would be heading the fourth largest American  newspaper by subscription count.   At the time, the Chinese Communist Party, the CCP, had just started  persecuting the spiritual discipline Falun Gong, practiced at the time  by roughly 1 in every 12 Chinese. People would practice the slow-moving  exercises in the morning in parks before going to work.   Just like any other persecution campaign by the CCP, the regime  relied on the media it controlled, both the state media and the private  media, to demonize and isolate the group. In an attempt to demonize  Falun Gong and justify its persecution, the media played nonstop hate  propaganda attacking this peaceful meditation group.   John, who had immigrated to the United States, watched from afar in  horror as friends were persecuted for their beliefs.   John decided to take action. Despite having no experience or  investment, he started Dajiyuan, the Chinese edition of The Epoch  Times, in the basement of his home in the suburbs of Atlanta, Georgia.   John was driven by a wish to provide uncensored information to not  only people in China but to people around the world. Soon, other  Chinese Americans left their well-paying jobs to help John with this  seemingly impossible endeavor.   The Epoch Times' first reporting group was established in China in  the year 2000, covering key events with a main focus on the CCP's human  rights abuses. The CCP, however, sees any kind of independent reporting  on its brutal human rights abuses as a threat. Within a few months,  Chinese police raided the underground newsroom, arresting every  reporter and every editor. They were imprisoned, specifically Zhang  Yuhui and Shi Shaoping, who received sentences of 10 years where they  faced frequent torture.   The Epoch Times' China operation went underground, yet the Chinese  edition quickly became a leading website on Chinese current events with  millions of readers. Its print newspaper is now distributed nationwide  as well as in 30 other countries around the world. Every day, many  Chinese break through the CCP's internet firewall to read The Epoch  Times' website.   All of this has not been easy. Since the newspaper's founding, the  CCP has waged a nonstop campaign to totally destroy it. The party has  threatened the newspaper's advertisers, they have launched incessant  cyberattacks on its website and IT systems, and threatened relatives of  staff members back in China.   The harassment has not been limited just to China. In 2006, the home  of then-chief engineer Peter Li was broken into by assailants, who tied  him to a chair and beat him before stealing two computers.   Meanwhile, in Hong Kong in 2019, assailants started a fire in the  newspaper's printing press, and in 2021, armed men entered the building  and used sledgehammers to smash printing equipment.   The Epoch Times also inspired the Tuidang, which means ``Quit the  CCP'' movement. As a result of The Epoch Times' publication of this  special series ``Nine Commentaries on the Communist Party,'' which  provides the most thorough interview to date of the true nature of the  CCP, more than 410 million Chinese people, and counting, have sought to  sever their membership in this party and its affiliated organizations.   Realizing that the CCP had put enormous efforts into infiltrating the  United States of America, especially media organizations, resulting in  many U.S. media carrying the communist regime's propaganda, The Epoch  Times launched in English in 2003 and started a print edition in New  York in 2004.   The Epoch Times' independent reporting has attracted a large  readership in the United States, now ranking as the fourth largest  newspaper in the country by subscriber count. Its website is read by  tens of millions of people each month.   Just like its Chinese companion, The Epoch Times prides itself on  being independent and serving the interests of the readers. Under its  slogan ``Truth and Tradition,'' The Epoch Times adheres to the best  practices and highest principles of journalism and seeks to highlight  the best of humanity.   The Epoch Times now has editions published in 36 countries and in 22  different languages.   This is all about one word: Freedom.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, it is really an embarrassment for those in  the balcony and those watching on TV to even have to put up listening  to amendments to deal with what Matt Rosendale was talking about and to  deal with what my amendment is doing, which is similar to his, which is  dealing with surgeries using taxpayer dollars for those who don't know  whether they are a man or a woman.   It is total insanity. If you don't know if you are a man or a woman,  you shouldn't be going into war.   We have got China building ships and airplanes, and here we are  debating on the House floor whether taxpayer dollars should cover  medical care for that person who thinks they ought to be another sex  than what they are.   My amendment prohibits the provision of gender transition procedures,  including surgery or medication, through the Exceptional Family Member  Program.   Let me tell you what the Exceptional Family Member Program is. It  provides resources to military families with special needs children.  The program is designed for military spouses, children, or other  dependent family members who require ongoing medical or educational  services, such as individuals with asthma, autism, chronic respiratory  illnesses, and others.   Recently the military has tried to politicize this valuable program  for transgender procedure purposes. I almost think this administration  is trying to use something insane, like what we are having to do here,  to take the focus off the things that are happening in America, like  the invasion at the border, crime in the streets, or an economy that is  sinking, that we are having to talk about this. I am glad to do it,  though. Somebody has to stop it.   For example, last year the Air Force suggested using the EFMP for  families who want to help their child transition. Representative  Panetta introduced a bill to expand the EFMP to include transgender  dependents and specifically lists gender dysphoria as a qualifying  medical need for the program.   If you put this out to the everyday American, would they want their  tax dollars used for this type of surgery? Would they want their tax  dollars--and, by the way, spending money we don't have--going for this.   My amendment ensures that we reserve this valuable program for its  original intent, to help families with special needs, and prohibits the  use of the program for the provision of or referral for gender  transition procedures, such as a gender surgery or for medication. This  amendment also prohibits the change of duty station simply for the  purpose of providing a child with easier access to these procedures.   Hopefully, we can all agree we should not be using taxpayer dollars  to help children get transgender procedures, but, rather, reserve these  resources for military families that have children with special needs,  chronic illnesses, and educational needs.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, what he just said, I don't think his facts  are right. You could take everybody in this balcony and ask if they  know members who fall into two classes of people, those with special  needs and those where a man wants to be a girl. Line them up. The  numbers of the group with special needs would far exceed the numbers of  the other, and they are the ones that need the tax dollars, not the  ones that want to change their sex.   Now, let me tell you some of the chronic life-threatening conditions  that this money should go for and did go for until this idiotic idea of  using dollars for the trans. It is life-threatening conditions or  chronic, including current chronic mental health conditions, asthma or  other respiratory-related diagnosis with chronic recurring symptoms,  attention deficit disorder, chronic conditions that require adaptive  equipment, including technology and environmental or architectural  considerations.    I mean, it is idiotic for him to say that the needs of a huge group  of people all over this country will be trumped by the needs for a very  few. The trans, I think if you do the math, it is less than 1 percent.   No, I think this is a diversion tactic to just get people away. They  are weakening the military. That is why we are down 30 percent in  recruitment.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, again, I cannot believe we are sitting here  debating this issue with all of the problems this country has. The fact  that we are taking up this much time is bizarre to me.   The overview of this amendment is the fact that the military's sole  purpose is to provide for the defense of our Nation. Our military's  focus should be the protection of the American people and our freedoms,  not liberals' feelings.   Therefore, my amendment would eliminate any offices of diversity,  equity, and inclusion in the Armed Forces and the Department of  Defense.   We should be spending our hard-earned tax dollars to focus on  diversity of ideas. We should be focused on diversity of ideas and  opinions, not races and genders. DEI programs tend to be ineffective,  and the cost to the taxpayer is spending more money that we don't have.   To sum this up, a woke military is a weak military. The fact is that  woke ideology undermines military readiness in various ways. It  undermines cohesiveness by emphasizing differences based on race,  ethnicity, and sex.   It undermines leadership authority by introducing questions about  whether promotion is based on merit or quota requirements.   It leads to military personnel serving in specialties and areas for  which they are not qualified or ready. It takes time and resources away  from training activities and weapons development that contribute to the  readiness.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Rogers).    Will the gentleman yield?    It is not.    Correct.    Mr. Chair, this is not about taking away anybody's  career. This is not about trying to harm people.   The brave men and women who serve in our military do it because they  are a family, and the whole point of this bill, this amendment, is to  get the recruiting where it needs to be. We are 30 percent down.   As of today, we have spent $1.4 billion on an equity action plan, and  nobody has any idea where that money is going. It is high time that we  just cut it out and get back to what the military is supposed to do,  which is to protect this Nation.   As Eli Crane said, who has been on the front lines, this country is  in trouble. This country has other Nations that want to do harm to us.  By eliminating this, we will take the first step in hopefully getting  safety back at the forefront.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I would say we do have a difference of opinion on what  diversity is. I believe diversity is diversity of new ideas. Diversity  is not based on your race or your ethnicity.   That is where we are in this country now. We hire the finest to go  into the military not because of the color of their skin and really not  because of their sexual preference.   This is just continuing to try to claim everyone is victimized in  this country. Well, I am sorry. It is time for us to put the priorities  in place.   This administration has been more divisive and is more concerned  about ensuring cadets use the right pronouns. How stupid is that? How  uncaring is that about the men that are serving?   This administration is more concerned about the government forcing  our military to take shots. That is not their role. That is why some of  the recruiting is down.   Yes, it is down. We are weak. Why do you think China is doing what  they are doing? Why do you think Russia is doing what they are doing?   This would have never happened under a strong administration led by  Donald Trump, and to this administration, you don't keep peace by  weakness.   The purpose of my amendment will strengthen the military, and that is  my first and number one goal, which is the security of this country.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  California (Mr. LaMalfa), my good friend.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, what my amendment does is codify the Trump  administration's guidance to prohibit the display of unapproved flags.   My amendment prohibits any member of the Armed Forces or civilian  employees of the Department of Defense from displaying a flag other  than an approved flag in a workplace, a public area, a training  facility, or other areas owned or leased by the Department of Defense.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, let me reiterate, flags mean something. We  wear flags on our sleeves. We honor it prominently on parade fields. We  carry it in combat. We drape it over the coffins of those who have  given their lives for this Nation.   Approved flags include the American flag; the flag of a State or the  District of Columbia; a general officer flag; a presidentially  appointed, Senate-confirmed civilian flag; a Senior Executive Service  and military department-specific flag; a POW-MIA flag; the flag of  another country that is an ally or a partner of the United States or  for official protocol purposes; the flag of an organization in which  the United States is a member; a ceremonial, command, unit, or branch  flag or guidon.   In the words of former Secretary of the Army Mark Esper: ``Flags are  powerful symbols, particularly in the military community, for whom  flags embody common mission, common histories, and the special,  timeless bond of warriors.''   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time I have remaining?    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   I will just sum this up: Flags have meaning. Flags have purpose.  Flags are a symbol of a great nation, as America is. Flags mean  something. It is not something to be flippant about. It is not  something to take lightly.   To my friends on the other side of the aisle, this amendment has  nothing to do with medical service. It has nothing to do with a lot of  things that have been brought up. This is about having the Department  of Defense approve flags before they go up, pure and simple. Nothing  else.   I would just say that, as we debate this, I am still amazed that we  are spending the time here. I think the diversion that the left wants  to provide in the House is to try to move the ball and get the American  public off the real problems that we are facing, which are a weakness  that we have now under  [[Page H3537]]  this administration, which is a denial of where we are as a country.   It is time to take our country back. It boils down to one issue. We  are going to preserve our freedom, and we are going to fight for it. A  flag represents that.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
