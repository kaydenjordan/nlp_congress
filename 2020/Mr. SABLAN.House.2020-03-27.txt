 Mr. Speaker, the legislation we are considering to stop  the coronavirus is not perfect. No legislation ever is, and we have  more work to do.   But even amid the crisis, we should not forget to say thank you. For  the third time, Speaker Pelosi has led this House to respond forcefully  to the coronavirus, to give healthcare providers resources, to give  families financial aid, and to support workers and businesses.   Throughout this unprecedented time, always the Speaker and her  leadership team remembered that the United States of America includes  the people of the Northern Mariana Islands, and for that I am grateful.    Mr. Speaker, even amid crisis--and particularly in these  days of social distancing--we should not forget to say thank you.   For the third time in as many weeks Speaker Pelosi has led this House  to respond forcefully to the coronavirus.   To give healthcare providers the resources they need to heal and halt  the spread of this disease.   To give families the financial aid they need to weather the crisis.   And now to support the workers and businesses that are the heart of  our economy.   Throughout this unprecedented effort, negotiated at lightning speed  late into many nights, with ideologies at loggerheads and the eye of  history upon them, always the Speaker and her leadership team  remembered the United States of America includes the people of the  Mariana Islands.   And for that I am grateful.   The legislation we have enacted to stop the coronavirus is not  perfect. No legislation ever is. We have more work to do, until we  defeat this disease and revive our nation.   But I can work every day confident in the knowledge the people of the  Marianas are considered every bit as much a part of this battle as  every other American--not to be left behind, not forgotten.   And for that I am grateful.
