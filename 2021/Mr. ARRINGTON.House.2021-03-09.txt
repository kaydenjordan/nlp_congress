 Mr. Speaker, this bill is further proof that there is  virtually no distinction between the Democratic Party and unions as a  political organization.   In 1 week, Mr. Speaker, the Democrats are bailing out failed union  pensions with tens of billions of dollars in taxpayer moneys, and now  they are forcing States and workers into this failed union system.   This bill is definitely prounion, but it is antiworker,  anticompetitive, and antifreedom. This bill forces workers into unions,  forces them to pay union dues. It deprives them of their right to  privacy. It forces workers to divulge their personal information to  their union bosses. What a racket. It would wreak havoc on our workers.   Talk is cheap, Mr. Speaker, and the American worker isn't buying this  empty political rhetoric. They understand the best way to protect  workers is through progrowth, America-first policies that give our  workers more freedom, more opportunity, and more of their hard-earned  money in their pockets.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to call up H.R.  682, the Reopen Schools Act, to get our kids out from behind screens  and back in the classroom.
