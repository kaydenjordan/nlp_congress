 Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment to the  fiscal year 2024 National Defense Authorization Act, which addresses  the shocking rise in child sexual abuse and exploitation in the United  States and around the world.   Last year, there were over 32 million reports of online child sexual  abuse material, an 89 percent increase since 2019.   The Pentagon's Combating Trafficking in Persons Office coordinates  vital programs to prevent human trafficking, bring perpetrators to  justice, and to protect victims.   My amendment will direct this office to analyze ways that the  Department can better combat child sexual abuse and to recommend  educational programs for servicemembers to identify and report  exploitation, both online and offline, to law enforcement.   I thank the chair and the ranking member for their hard work on this  legislation, and I urge all my colleagues to support this commonsense  bipartisan amendment.
