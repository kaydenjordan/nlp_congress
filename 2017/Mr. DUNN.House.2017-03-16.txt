 Mr. Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 1259, the VA  Accountability First Act of 2017.   President Lincoln reminds us of our duty ``to care for him who shall  have borne the battle,'' and, frankly, our government has done a  miserable job of it.   While a large number of VA employees honorably serve our veterans,  that is not always the case. In the real world, if you don't do your  job, you get fired. Yet we have employees at the VA who are guilty of  gross misconduct, even major felonies, and they are still on the job.   ``Why is this?'' you ask. Because the process to fire them is too  arduous. The VA system that lives up to our veterans' sacrifices starts  with personnel. The VA Accountability First Act is a great first step  in addressing poor performance and misconduct at the VA. It will allow  Secretary Shulkin to make substantive changes as he works to improve  veterans' care.   We need to make the VA work for our veterans instead of our  bureaucrats.
