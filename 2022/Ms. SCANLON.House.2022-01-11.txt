 Madam Speaker, as chair of the Congressional Youth  Mentoring Caucus, I rise to recognize National Mentoring Month, a time  to celebrate the impact of mentoring and raise awareness about the  critical need for caring adults to become mentors, as our youth face  the often-overwhelming challenges of our time.   One-third of young people in the United States don't have a  meaningful connection with adults outside their homes, and the pandemic  has only made it harder for them to call on caring adults for support.   Mentoring has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my adult  life, allowing me to participate in the personal and professional  growth of scores of young people. I am fortunate to be able to continue  that mentoring with some of the best and brightest young people in my  district through our Congressional Youth Cabinet, where high school  juniors and seniors in my district, on a monthly basis, explore the  policy and government issues facing our community and our country.   I urge all adults to think about how they can serve their communities  and the next generation by becoming a mentor, whether through sports,  career exploration, school, or faith-based programs.                            ____________________
