 Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today, I am pleased to acknowledge the  confirmation of Shalanda Young to be the Director of the Office of  Management and Budget with a bipartisan vote of 61 to 36.   Director Young has a depth of experience that cannot be matched to  lead the Office of Management and Budget. A staff member on the House  Appropriations Committee for 15 years--serving 4 of these years as the  committee's staff director--Director Young has years of experience in  crafting the budgets of the Federal agencies that the American people  rely on.   In 2019, Director Young was one of the few staff present in the room  while then Chairman Shelby, Chairwoman Lowey, Ranking Member Granger,  and I negotiated the end to the longest Federal Government shutdown in  U.S. history. Her knowledge of Federal programs, understanding of the  political process, and years of critical insight into the operations of  the federal government were invaluable in our negotiations to reach a  deal.   I was glad to strongly support Director Young's nomination to be  Deputy Director of OMB. After she was confirmed to that position, she  began to serve as its Acting Director. It was in this role that she  guided the Biden administration's budget priorities through the COVID  pandemic, devastating natural disasters, a long sought after bipartisan  infrastructure law, and now the response to President Putin's  unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.   As if she did not have enough on her plate, on October 31, 2021, she  gave birth to a beautiful baby girl, Charlie. If juggling all of that  did not prove she is more than qualified for the job, I am not sure  what would.   As the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I look  forward to working with her and her team at OMB on the fiscal year 2023  appropriations process. Director Young understands how to work across  the aisle to get a deal done. I cannot think of someone I would rather  work with in putting the appropriations process to work on behalf of  the American people.                            ____________________
