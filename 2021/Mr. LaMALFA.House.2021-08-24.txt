 Madam Speaker, first of all, to all those who served in  Afghanistan, we thank you. God bless you. You did everything you were  asked to do. You did your duty with honor. But like most Americans, I  watched with disgust as the Taliban retook Kabul last Sunday.   Any shame of that operation lies here in D.C. with the suits, not  with the boots, who allowed this to happen. Yet, what are we hearing?  Rhetoric. White House communications director Jen Psaki says: Now, it  is irresponsible for those to be talking about Americans that are  stranded in Afghanistan.   We see the word ``stranded'' on the front page of the newspaper. We  see the word ``hostage.'' We see the words--all sorts of things-- showing what a debacle this has been, including ``debacle'' right on  the front page. So what do we get from the White House? We are not  getting transparency, as promised by the Biden administration, unless  you want to define ``transparency'' as invisible, which they have been.   We have to do much better to get our people out of this country, and  all that material that was left behind is now in the hands of our  enemies.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, it is interesting when President Trump  was in office that the name-calling in this place about him occurred  often during the President's time in office.   In California, we currently have a special election about to be  underway here. Just the other day, 300 mail-in ballots were found in  the car of a guy passed out in a 7-Eleven parking lot, 300 ballots. And  we don't think there is an issue sometimes with the way mail-in ballots  are distributed.   I get anecdotes all the time from folks like this current special  election. Oh, I received three ballots for people that haven't lived at  my apartment for a long time, or relatives that have long since passed  away, because you just mail them out willy-nilly everywhere.   H.R. 4 is not about voting rights, it is about election control and  manipulation. It is about political appointees at the Department of  Justice overturning State and legislative process, and controlling from  D.C. local election decisions.   We know that Americans of the right age and legal status have the  right to vote, and no one here is trying to take that away from them.  Voter suppression hype is just a big lie. It is absurd what is trying  to be perpetrated in this legislation.
