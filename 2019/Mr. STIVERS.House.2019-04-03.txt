 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona for  yielding.   I rise today to commemorate one of America's heroes, United States  Army Sergeant Joseph P. Collette of Lancaster, Ohio.   Sergeant Collette gave his life in the service of our Nation on March  22, 2019, while serving in Afghanistan with the 242nd Ordnance  Battalion, 71st Explosive Ordnance Disposal Group.   Serving with the United States Army was a goal for Sergeant Collette.  On September 11, Sergeant Collette was only 11 years old, but on that  tragic day he felt the call of service. It is that bravery,  selflessness, and commitment that Sergeant Collette will be remembered  for.   A man of many talents, he loved sharing his passion for cooking with  others and challenging his friends to paintball matches and Pokemon  battles.   He loved spending time outdoors, but he loved nothing more than  spending time with his friends and family, and his legacy will live on  in their memories.   As a brigadier general in the Ohio Army National Guard, I have been  privileged to serve alongside men and women like Sergeant Collette. I  can say without a doubt that Lancaster, Ohio, and our Nation is a  better and safer place as a result of his service.   I am honored to celebrate his life and legacy, and my heart goes out  to his entire family.   This country needs to recognize heroes like Joseph Collette, so I  hope that we all will take a moment of silence to recognize the life of  Joey Collette.
