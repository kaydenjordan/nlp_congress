 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  4468, and in full disclosure, I am a car dealer. I am, frankly, the  expert in the room.   This legislation would stop the EPA from implementing a rule that is  an attack on hardworking Americans and, if implemented, would decimate  small businesses and wreak havoc on the pocketbooks of families.   As chairman of the House Committee on Small Business and owner and  operator and expert in car dealerships in Texas for over 52 years, I  have seen firsthand the impact that overregulation can have on small  businesses. Competition drives my industry, not government innovations.  By the way, no one wants to buy an EV vehicle.   We are a country of competition, of risk and reward, and the Federal  Government should not be in the car business. We must allow individuals  to choose the vehicle that best suits their needs, not the government  or Joe Biden.   The EPA's proposed rule would have heightened impact on hardworking  American families with an estimated increase in costs from maintenance  to interest costs to lack of equity. It is clear President Biden's EPA  are out of touch with the American people by ignoring out-of-control  inflation while pushing a green energy bailout.   The customer is getting hammered again and your local car dealer is  getting hammered again. The proposed rule would also increase our  dependency on China, something the administration seems determined to  ensure happens.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stand with the American people  and Main Street America and vote for H.R. 4468.                                time  1330
