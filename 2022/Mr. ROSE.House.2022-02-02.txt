 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, Democrats marketed the America COMPETES Act as a bill  that would decrease our economic reliance on China and ramp up our  domestic production. However, as we have already heard, a more  appropriate title for this bill is the America concedes act.   Unfortunately, the Democrats employed the same strategy with this  bill as they did with the Build Back Better Act. They used the  legislation as a vehicle to ram all their far-left social policies  through Congress without any Republican input.   Democrats claim this bill would crack down on the Chinese Communist  Party, but it does nothing to prevent them from growing their influence  here in the United States and around the world, nor does it hold China  accountable for their role in the COVID-19 pandemic.   The America concedes act does more to answer the Democrats' radical  social agenda and further their massively expensive climate change  schemes than it does to improve domestic production.   Why does this bill, which authorizes or appropriates hundreds of  billions of dollars, include $2 billion in foreign aid to combat  climate change or $8 billion for the United Nations Green Climate Fund?   These provisions, along with many others, have nothing to do with our  economy but everything to do with Democrats' obsession with furthering  their leftwing agenda. This bill is just another attempt to move toward  changing our great Nation into a mythical socialist utopia.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to  stop thinking about their woke political agendas and start focusing on  getting our economy back on track.  [[Page H903]]
