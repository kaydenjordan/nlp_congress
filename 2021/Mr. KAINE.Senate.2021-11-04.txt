 Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to improve  stormwater management practices at Department of Defense, DOD  installations across the country.   Climate related impacts, such as increased rainfall intensity and sea  level rise, exacerbate the problem of stormwater runoff. Excess  stormwater can threaten our military readiness and pollute surrounding  waterways and ecosystems.   This phenomenon is acutely present in the Chesapeake Bay watershed,  where DOD is the second largest Federal landholder, and stormwater is  the only pollutant in the watershed that continues to increase.  Therefore, it is imperative that the DOD, as an official partner to the  Chesapeake Bay Program, do all that it can to support reduction in  pollution runoff consistent with the State-based watershed  implementation plans required by the Environmental Protection Agency.  Climate change has put numerous Virginia and Maryland military bases at  increased risk of flooding, including Naval Station Norfolk, Naval Air  Station Oceana, Naval Support Activity Hampton Roads, Langley Air Force  Base, Naval Support Activity Annapolis, Naval Support Activity  Bethesda, Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Joint Base Andrews, and  Naval Support Activity South Potomac.   While there are 137 DOD installations, sites, and facilities in the  Chesapeake Bay watershed, this proposal will help ensure stormwater and  natural resources beat management practices are constructed,  maintained, and repaired at DOD facilities across the Nation.   The Federal Government provides State and local governments with  billions in financial assistance each year to invest in stormwater  infrastructure through the Clean Water State Revolving Fund. Very  limited funding exists for the financing of stormwater infrastructure  on military installations. The EMBRACE Act would make stormwater  management projects eligible for Federal funding under either military  construction projects, military installation resilience projects,  unspecified minor military construction projects, defense access roads  projects, the Defense Community Infrastructure Program DCIP, and the  Energy Resilience and Conservation Investment Program ERCIP.   The bill instructs the Defense Department to give priority to  projects that retrofit buildings and grounds on bases and improve  access roads prone to flooding. It backs the building of stormwater  ponds and other retention strategies. It also supports replacing  impermeable paving with materials that let water seep into the soil  rather than run off. Projects such as rain gardens, cisterns, and  planters also would be eligible for funds.   I am proud to be joined in this effort by Senators Warner, Cardin,  and Van Hollen. The bill has also been endorsed by critical partners  such as the Chesapeake Bay Commission, the  [[Page S7797]]  Chesapeake Bay Foundation, the Chesapeake Conservancy, Choose Clean  Water Coalition, American Flood Coalition Action, the Nature  Conservancy, Southern Environmental Law Center, and Wetlands Watch. I  was glad to see that Representative Bobby Scott successful in including  his bipartisan companion EMRBACE Act as an amendment to the House  version of the National Defense Authorization Act NDAA for fiscal year  2022. It is my hope that this legislation will be included in the NDAA  upon its final' passage in Congress.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Marshall, Mrs. Gillibrand,          and Ms. Ernst):   S. 3203.
