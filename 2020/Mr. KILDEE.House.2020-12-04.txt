 Mr. Speaker, look, we all know this pandemic is not  over--it is far from over--and Congress has to do its job. Families,  seniors, small businesses are suffering, and they need Congress to act  now before we leave town.   When we were all home over the Thanksgiving holiday, we all saw the  same thing: the heartbreaking images of people, people who never have  had to seek help, standing in lines for food, millions of people out of  work.   Small businesses, well, they are closing. We are losing small  businesses every single day, and now Federal unemployment benefits are  set to expire.   Look, families are falling into poverty as a result of our inaction.   The people who are hurting are represented by Democrats and  Republicans. The people who are hurting are in every district across  this country.   We worked to get to a solution. In this House, we passed, twice,  legislation that would provide that relief, but, at this moment, we  need to come together as Democrats and Republicans.   The people who are hurting are represented by Democrats and  Republicans. The solution has to come in a bipartisan form. So let's  set aside our differences. Let's find common ground. Let's pass a COVID  relief bill now.                            ____________________
