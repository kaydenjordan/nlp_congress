 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the  children in Georgia's Fighting 5th Congressional District at risk of  going hungry in the face of this cruel Republican default.   Extreme MAGA Republicans are proposing cuts to 200,000 Head Start  slots and 180,000 childcare slots nationwide. You all, that is more  than 300,000 families who will be thrown into a devastating bind.   When families don't have access to care, they can't get to work,  making it harder to put food on the table every day. This is a real- life dilemma facing parents like Chelsea and Dorian in Clayton County,  Georgia, two mamas who are looking for jobs, but facing one major  roadblock: Childcare.   Now, extreme MAGA Republicans are threatening to make their childcare  search even harder. That, or risk a disastrous default on our debt.  Republicans are headed home for barbecues and hanging out with their  families making their priorities clear.   A great speaker once said: ``Sometimes you have to take a punch and  give a punch for the children.'' You all, I am ready to fight for a  solution on behalf of our children, and I am waiting for my Republican  colleagues who are brave enough to fight alongside me for the children  putting people over politics.                            ____________________
