 Mr. Speaker, I rise really on behalf of the entire  California delegation to honor our friend and former colleague, Ellen  Tauscher, who passed away much too soon last month at the age of 67.   Ellen was a trailblazer in virtually everything she did in her  remarkable life, and her passing is a great loss not only to  California, not only to our country, but to the world.   I met Ellen when she ran for office, but I got to know her here. I  recall so well Democratic Congresswomen--and there weren't as many of  us at the time--all telling their own personal story and all of us  being kind of surprised that we came from modest beginnings. Ellen was  born in Newark, New Jersey. Her father was a shop steward at the UFCW,  and he was at the Shop Rite store in Union City. Her mom, like my mom,  was a secretary. But, she went on, because this country gave her an  opportunity, she got a great education, and, of course, then, as will  be said later tonight, became one of the youngest and one of the first  women to become a member of the New York Stock Exchange.   She excelled in the issue of childcare. She wrote a book and did some  technology about that before she ran for office.   But I ran into her in 1996 when I had been in Congress just a short  time, and she decided and actually was recruited to run against a very  conservative gentleman who had been in the House, but was really more  conservative than his district, especially when it came to being pro- choice and the need to do something sensible about gun violence. I  remember Ellen had a parade when she ran for office, and people were  cheering her on. I thought: This woman is going to win this seat.   Sure enough, she did.   She was so popular and so different than the predecessor. People were  talking about Tauscherism in the State of California, using her last  name as an -ism. Really what it was was a very sensible, business- oriented approach, heavily interested in technology but wedded with  good values that reflected her constituency: pro-choice, pro-education,  pro-equal rights, pro-LGBTQ rights, and that was what she brought to  this body.   We remember her for the mark that she left on this institution. She  continued to lead on the Armed Services Committee where she chaired the  Strategic Forces Subcommittee and was a leading figure on arms control  policy.   She also worked on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee in  a remarkable way. Not only was she a national leader on environmentally  sustainable transportation policy, as a founding member of the  Intelligent Transportation Systems Caucus, she also delivered for her  district. It really mattered to her that she got a widening of the  Sunol Grade on 680 which made a difference, not only for her district  but for mine, as people were trying to commute between the two regions.   She got a fourth bore for the Caldecott Tunnel so that commuters  could get around. She played a leadership role securing funding for the  BART extension to the San Francisco Airport and her work to get the  Army Corps to fund the dredging of the Port of Oakland.   I am particularly excited by the work we did together for the  Lawrence Livermore National Lab as well as the Sandia Lab. She was so  interested in the National Ignition Facility. She saved the funding,  she was there at the groundbreaking, she was there when we opened the  facility, and she really believed that the science that was going on  there would change the world, and I still believe that it will.   But here in the House I think all of us will remember her as the  presiding officer. Ellen was completely unflappable. I can remember  when we had the worst, most contentious issues, we knew it would be  okay because Ellen would take the dais and she would preside. She would  help people calm down, focus on the disagreements, and adhere to the  rules of the House. Nothing could shake her ability to preside in a  wise, thoughtful, and very calm way over the House of Representatives.   We had such fun with her. Women Members went out to dinner with her  and shared stories. She never put up with nonsense. She was very matter  of fact. She had a wicked sense of humor, but she was someone with  tremendous integrity. Of course, as we know, that integrity, expertise,  and vision was recognized when President Obama nominated her to be  Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security.  She was confirmed and left the House.   She did important things in that office. She helped negotiate the New  START Treaty with the Russian Federation--the first agreement signed  with Russia in nearly 20 years--and it was ratified by the U.S. Senate.   After leaving the Department of State, she continued to make  contributions. She served on the Board of Regents for the University of  California. She continued to make sure that the science at Lawrence  Livermore National Lab was protected and also at Los Alamos. She  continued in her efforts to make sure that the cutting edge was always  protected as a member of the Board of Advisors of SpaceX, eHealth, and  other important technology businesses.   These achievements really don't do justice to Ellen's legacy. I know  from our many good times talking with her, her funny irreverence and  her smart insight, the one thing that she loved more than anything else  on this Earth was her wonderful daughter, Katherine, who I hope is  watching tonight. We loved Ellen Tauscher, and she loved Katherine.   Not every Member who planned to be here this evening was able to. We  will make sure that all of the statements are entered into the Record.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), who  is the majority leader of the House of Representatives.    Mr. Speaker, all of us knew Ellen in a different way,  but those who served with her on the Armed Services Committee knew her  work there, so I would like to recognize the gentlewoman from  California, Susan Davis, who served not only in the delegation with  Ellen but also on the Armed Services Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Davis).    Mr. Speaker, all of us, as I said, knew Ellen in  different ways. I was surprised that the gentlewoman from Florida  probably knew Ellen Tauscher longer than anyone else in this body, and  I am so pleased to recognize Donna Shalala.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Shalala).    Mr. Speaker, talking about how we each knew Ellen in  different ways, she was very active in the New Democrat Coalition. We  have someone who served with her as one of her cohorts, as a New  Democrat who, I believe, chaired it with her at one time. I am happy to  recognize Ron Kind.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Kind).    Mr. Speaker, much has been said about the New Dems, and  I would like to recognize the current New Dem chair. I yield to the  gentleman from Washington (Mr. Kilmer).    Mr. Speaker, I think so many of us in the House could  think of the different things we did with Ellen. As I was listening, I  was remembering her capacity to reach agreement. She was a legislator,  and whether it was reaching across the aisle or disagreements even  within the Democratic Party, she was always trying to come up with a  solution that would make the country better.   I remember a disagreement we had. We were good friends, but we had a  disagreement on a legislative issue. There was a disagreement in the  Democratic Party, and we had a big meeting. Rather than let people  fight, we stood in front of the group and we actually drafted the  compromise that would move us forward in the course of about 20  minutes. It was an extraordinary experience for both of us and  especially for the new Members who had never seen legislators actually  legislating themselves.   I know that there are people throughout the House who have such  memories, and I hope that they will be able to put them into the  Record, keeping Katherine and the entire Tauscher family in their  prayers.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 9 o'clock and 10 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, May 15, 2019, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.
