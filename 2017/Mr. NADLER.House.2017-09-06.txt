 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R.  3440, the DREAM Act, to protect New York DREAMers like Jessica, who has  been in this country since she was two and hopes to become a doctor.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous  consent request cannot be entertained.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Aguilar) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.    Mr. Chair, last year, Congress passed an updated formula  for the Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (the HOPWA  program). The change was necessary to ensure the program better  reflected how the HIV/AIDS epidemic is changing in this country.  However, at the current HOPWA funding levels, the new formula leaves  several jurisdictions, including New York City and Miami, at risk of  losing funding for this important program.   In a program as efficient as HOPWA, when grantees lose funding,  people living with AIDS lose their housing. Research clearly  demonstrates that housing instability leads to worse health outcomes  for those living with HIV/AIDS, and these potential cuts could have a  devastating impact on these patients and their families. The new  formula will only be effective in addressing the AIDS housing crisis if  we maintain adequate funding levels.   My amendment increases funding for HOPWA by $19 million, ensuring  that, under the new formula, no jurisdiction loses funding in Fiscal  Year 2018. The amendment is fully offset through the HUD Information  Technology Fund.   I thank Chairman Diaz-Balart and Ranking Member Price for their long- standing support of HOPWA and for accepting this important amendment to  protect people living with AIDS and their families. I look forward to  continuing our work on HOPWA in the future. I also speak for all New  Yorkers in lending our support to Chairman Diaz-Balart and his district  in the face of Hurricane Irma, just as they stood with us during  Superstorm Sandy.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered  by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart).   The en bloc amendments were agreed to.                   Amendment No. 21 Offered by Mr. Lipinski    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 21  printed in part B of House Report 115-295.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment,  which would eliminate funding for the Gateway Project.   The Gateway Project, which includes work on the Portal Bridge and  construction of a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River, is widely  recognized as one of the highest priority transportation projects in  the country.   We should have built new tunnels and expanded capacity on the  Northeast Corridor long ago, but the damage to the existing tunnels  caused by Superstorm Sandy has brought a new urgency to the situation.  If those tunnels were to go down, as they certainly will in the next 10  years without the Gateway Project, there would be no rail service  between New York and New Jersey, massively disrupting transportation  all along the Northeast Corridor from Washington to Boston. Twenty  percent of the economy of the country would be disrupted.   This amendment cuts funding for Gateway and eliminates almost $500  million from the bill completely, sending it to the spending reduction  account. It does not direct that funding to other infrastructure  projects. It does not restore TIGER funding. It reduces national  infrastructure spending when we should be increasing it.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to reject this extremely  shortsighted and punitive measure.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from New York  (Mr. King).   Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Chairman, the Gateway program will create the new infrastructure  essential to greater resiliency against future potential storms and  disasters, while enabling repairs to damage and achieve capacity and  reliability-related investments for the needs of the Northeast  Corridor's operators for the next 30 to 50 years.   Without extensive repairs and rebuilding of the existing tunnel,  service reliability is likely to continue to deteriorate due to ongoing  damage from saltwater incursion during Superstorm Sandy, from which we  are still suffering 5 years later, eventually forcing a shutdown of one  or both tubes of the Hudson River Tunnel.   Mr. Lance pointed out and Mr. Nadler pointed out the Northeast  Corridor is not just the Northeast. It services the entire Nation. It  serves a massive economic purpose.   It is essential we stand behind this. This is absolutely essential  infrastructure spending. I support Chairman Frelinghuysen, and I  support the ranking member and the chairman of the subcommittee for  their work. Again, it is truly a bipartisan effort and something that  is absolutely essential.   Mr. Chairman, I urge defeat of the amendment.                                time  2015    Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana  (Mr. Visclosky), the ranking member of the Defense Subcommittee.
