 Mr. Speaker, the people of the Illinois 14th elected  me as their Representative to protect their access to healthcare  coverage and to make healthcare and prescription drugs more affordable.   I am a nurse, and I have a preexisting condition and so I know,  personally, how critically important having high-quality affordable  healthcare is for people.   Today, we are taking an essential step to protect access to  affordable coverage from the GOP's cruel lawsuit which seeks to destroy  the Affordable Care Act and its lifesaving protection.   My community sent me here to use my voice and my vote as their  neighbor and as a nurse, and I am proud to vote today to protect people  with preexisting conditions; to prohibit insurance companies from  imposing lifetime and annual limits on health coverage; and to preserve  young adults' ability to remain on their parents' insurance until age  26, and more.   I commend my colleague, Mr. Allred, and am proud to join my  Democratic colleagues in wasting no time delivering on our promise to  defeat Republican attacks on the Affordable Care Act, and to fight for  the people, and to protect Americans with preexisting conditions.                            ____________________
