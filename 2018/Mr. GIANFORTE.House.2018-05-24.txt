 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and recognize the  men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our liberties,  our freedoms, and our precious way of life.   Montanans are a proud and patriotic people who always answer the call  to serve their Nation. They are mothers and fathers, brothers and  sisters, sons  [[Page H4723]]  and daughters. Some did not return from the theater of conflict, giving  their lives for our country and our liberty.   I extend my heartfelt gratitude to them and to their families. We owe  them a debt we can never fully repay, as much as we try.   As we mark Memorial Day, we pray for the families of the veterans  whose sacrifices have secured our freedoms, and we give thanks for the  blessings of life and liberty, peace and prosperity that their service  has secured for all of us.                            ____________________
