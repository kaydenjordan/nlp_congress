 BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his  remarks.)    BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, in commemoration  of Black History Month, I am honored to be joined by six of  Philadelphia's most distinguished ward leaders and want to ensure that  their contributions to our city remain enshrined in our historical  Congressional Record for future generations to recognize.   Ms. El Amor M. Brawne Ali of Ward 37, Mr. Arthur Green of Ward 14,  Shirley Gregory of Ward 49, Peter Lyde of Ward 61, Renee McNear of Ward  20, and Sharon Vaughn of Ward 42 all take after the long lineage of  Philadelphians who advanced our democracy towards an increasingly  inclusive system.   Mr. Speaker, I extend to them our most sincere gratitude for their  leadership on behalf of our shared constituencies and look forward to  honoring them here at the Capitol later this afternoon.                            ____________________
