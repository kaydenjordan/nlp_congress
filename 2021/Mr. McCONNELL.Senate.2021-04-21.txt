 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, early on, a major theme of the Biden  administration has been false advertising. We have the so-called COVID  relief bill that broke a long bipartisan streak on pandemic response  and only spent 1 percent of the money on vaccinations.   We have the reintroduction of a sprawling election takeover bill that  Democrats wrote years ago under the guise that it is a commonsense  voting rights bill.   We have a President who ran on protecting norms flirting with  proposals to hot-wire the Senate rules and pack the Supreme Court. And  then we have the latest example, where even one Ivy League expert says  Democrats' spin ``does a bit of violence to the English language.''  They have assembled a patchwork of leftwing social engineering programs  and want to label it ``infrastructure.''   Now, as I pointed out before, the first notable thing about the  Bide administration's plan is what it doesn't focus on. Less than 6  percent of the alleged infrastructure bill would invest in roads and  bridges. The total amount of funding it would direct to roads, bridges,  ports, waterways, and airports combined--all together--adds up to less  than what it would spend just on electric cars.    The far left sees a strong family resemblance between these proposals  and their socialist Green New Deal. Yesterday, the House and Senate  authors of that manifesto reintroduced it, while noting and boasting  that the DNA of the Green New Deal is all over President Biden's  legislative proposals. No wonder that White House's document rolling  out the President's bill mentioned the words ``climate'' and ``union''  more often than ``roads'' and ``bridges.''   It would pick winners and losers in automotive manufacturing. It  would force-feed the electrical grid some of the least reliable forms  of energy. It would hector school cafeterias to stop using paper plates  and force new standards and mandates on family homes.   And the relative pittance this proposal does allocate to actual  infrastructure would have to creep through a tangled environmental  review process. Without serious permitting reform, it won't build back  better; it will build back never.   But at least some of these bad ideas have a tangential relationship  to the actual concept of infrastructure, not so for some other  statements we have heard from actual Democrats in recent days:         Climate action is infrastructure.        Police accountability is infrastructure.        Caregiving is infrastructure.        Supreme Court expansion is infrastructure.    Now, unsurprisingly, this liberal omnibus is not exactly an efficient  engine for driving our economy. The White House's inflated claims of  expected job creation have been fact-checked and received Pinocchios  from the Washington Post.   Even under the rosiest scholarly assumptions--the rosiest  assumptions--the White House's own favored estimates, taxpayers would  pay more than $800,000 for each job the plan might create. Now, I know  a lot of small businesses that could create more than one job if we  handed them $800,000.   And then there are the tax hikes. This proposal is a Trojan horse to  roll back the historic 2017 tax reform plan that helped spur big-time  wage growth and the best job market in a generation before COVID-19. So  the administration's proposal bears little resemblance to the  bipartisan infrastructure bill Americans need and deserve. It just  reads like customer service for the radical fringe.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on another matter, over the past  few months, Senate Republicans have made clear we believe a President  is entitled to choose qualified, mainstream nominees to staff the  executive branch and receive prompt and fair treatment from the Senate.  I would say the 50 Senate Republicans have treated President Biden's  nominees considerably more fairly than Senate Democrats treated the  last President's, but the nominee we are considering this week is way  outside the mainstream.   I will strongly oppose confirming Vanita Gupta to serve as Associate  Attorney General, and I would urge colleagues to do the same. Ms. Gupta  has spent her career, in large part, as an activist for leftwing  causes. Her work for high-profile liberal interest groups and the Obama  Justice Department have left a record of astoundingly radical  positions. Those far-left positions were loud and proud until this  prospect of promotion seemed to change the nominee's tune.   Previously, this nominee stated that ``states should decriminalize  simple possession of all drugs.'' She said ``states should  decriminalize simple possession of all drugs.'' Ah, but now Ms. Gupta  claims her position has ``evolved.''   At her confirmation hearing, she refused to say she would accept  any--any--limitation on abortions, up to and including partial-birth.  That puts her at odds with nearly 70 percent of Americans across the  political spectrum.   Recently, Ms. Gupta has insisted she can be trusted to oppose efforts  to defund law enforcement, but she told the Judiciary Committee just  last year that State and local leaders should ``heed calls'' from  groups demanding that they decrease--decrease--police budgets.   This nomination has revealed a lengthy trail of radical claims and  hasty backtracks, but there are also questions of temperament. The  nominee has repeatedly amplified leftwing fearmongering toward judicial  nominees and sitting Federal judges. She has levied ad hominem attacks  on Members of this body. And during the confirmation process, she  employed the loosest possible interpretation of her oath to deliver  honest testimony, even drawing the ire of the liberal Washington Post  for transparent flip-flops and misleading Senators about her own public  statements.   This nominee contrasts sharply--sharply--with the resume and  reputation of Attorney General Garland, whom I voted to confirm. The  White House needs to make a better choice for this key post. The Senate  should create that opportunity by voting no today.                            ____________________     Mr. President, my friend Joe Grossman has approached  his work for the last 35 years with a head for numbers and a heart for  people. As an accountant turned CEO of the largest healthcare  organization in Southeastern Kentucky, Joe's experienced leadership has  helped improve the quality of life for hundreds of thousands. This  summer, Joe will close his chapter leading Appalachian Regional  Healthcare, ARH, and a career of excellence and accomplishment. As he  begins a well-deserved retirement, I would like to share my  congratulations and gratitude for his many contributions to the  Bluegrass.   For nearly two decades, Joe has been entrusted with key financial and  operational positions at ARH. At each step, he has helped the system  expand and thrive. When the position opened, Joe was the obvious choice  to take over as president and CEO. He pushed ARH to continue growing in  service to its patients, employees, and communities.   Today, the system operates 13 hospitals in Kentucky and West Virginia  as well as 80-plus clinic locations. With a team of more than 6,000  dedicated professionals, ARH serves nearly 400,000 individuals across  the region. The system's extensive reach makes a transformative impact  on rural Kentucky communities every day and helps make the area a  destination for top-tier medical talent. Joe's leadership even  contributed to a national magazine naming ARH one of the Top 10  Employers in Kentucky.   Overseeing an organization of ARH's size and importance would be a  remarkable feat in any year, but Joe exceeded expectations once again  during the pandemic. Last month, I visited the ARH facility in Hazard  to speak with Joe and his team about the rollout of the multiple safe  and effective COVID-19 vaccines. At that time, three  [[Page S2118]]  of the five counties in Kentucky with the top vaccination rates were in  ARH's service area. I was proud to congratulate Joe and his team of  healthcare heroes who were getting shots in arms to beat this virus.   Joe's contributions to Kentucky extend beyond the hospital doors. He  has gone to great lengths to personally partner with the communities he  serves. His work with organizations like One East KY, the Hazard-Perry  County Economic Development Alliance, and One Harlan County has helped  encourage new growth and opportunity. Joe developed a vision for a  healthy and successful Kentucky, and he worked tirelessly over the  years to bring it closer to reality.   So, we are all going to miss working with Joe. But now he gets to  spend more time on his most important roles, husband to Leigh, father,  and grandfather. Along with Joe's colleagues and friends, I extend my  best wishes for a fulfilling retirement. On behalf of the Senate, I  would like to congratulate Joe on all of his success and thank him for  his leadership in Kentucky.                            ____________________
