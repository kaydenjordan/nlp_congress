 Mr. President, I am proud to be on the floor today,  proud to stand with my colleagues, and I hope that at the end of this  week, I will be proud of all of my colleagues when we vote to defeat  this measure, or at least to delay it, because we owe the American  people the right to be heard.   Our responsibility as elected representatives is at the very least to  listen. I have been listening over the last week but really over the  last year to constituents of mine in the State of Connecticut and over  the last week at two emergency field hearings that I conducted because  no hearings were held by the Senate and no markups and no votes in  committee. What we saw here in Washington was complete secrecy, a bill  produced behind closed doors, only seeing the light of day for the  first time last Thursday.   Our Republican colleagues have gone from total secrecy to total  chaos. The reason for the chaos is the facts that were most  dramatically revealed today--just hours ago--when the Congressional  Budget Office told us, not surprisingly, that 22 million Americans  would be thrown to the wolves as a result of this measure--thrown to  the wolves of no healthcare coverage--and eventually 49 million  Americans would be without healthcare insurance by 2026.   Next year alone, 15 million more people will be uninsured under the  Republican plan, TrumpCare 2.0. Low-income Americans would be unable to  afford any plan at all, and anybody who does would be paying higher  costs for fewer services of lesser quality. Americans will pay a higher  share of their income and receive less as a result. A 64-year-old  making almost $57,000 will go from paying $6,800 under the Affordable  Care Act to $20,500 under the proposal before this body. This jump in  cost is absolutely staggering.   It will destroy the financial well-being of middle-class Americans  who also, when they need nursing home care, after they have exhausted  their savings, will be thrown to the wolves. I visited one such  facility just last Friday, where two-thirds of its 60 beds will be  unaffordable when those middle-class families find their savings will  no longer cover it.   These facts are the reason for the Republican chaos. One of our  former colleagues, my mentor, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, famously  said: ``Everybody is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own  facts.'' The administration's statement that the CBO is not to be  blindly trusted--nobody has to trust the CBO blindly. Those facts are  driven by reality. Their report speaks truth to power and to the  American people, and the American people get it.   None of us can look our constituents in the eye, look ourselves in  the mirror, look inside ourselves, in our hearts, and justify a vote  for this bill. The American people are angry, many of them because we  are even considering it. It is not an anger that is kind of a shrug of  the shoulders; it is a deep, vocal, vehement, vitriolic anger. I have  seen it and heard it at those hearings, where I listened to people  coming forward and talking about this bill, recognizing it for what it  is. It is not a healthcare bill; it is a massive tax cut for the  wealthy.   Just Friday afternoon, one of the folks who attended the hearing came  to the microphone and said: Don't call it a healthcare bill; it is a  wealth care bill. In fact, she is absolutely right. This bill cuts  hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes for the richest so that they  will do better, but it also cuts $800 billion in Medicaid spending and  investment to provide for that kind of tax cut. It is not a healthcare  bill; it is a wealth care bill. And for most Americans, it is a  catastrophic, cruel, and costly insult to their intelligence, their  health, and our American values. It is a sham and a charade, making  possible those cuts for the rich--tax cuts for them--at the expense of  our most vulnerable citizens. And it has been the result of a  profoundly undemocratic process--secrecy and speed.   Despite the best efforts of our Republican colleagues to keep  Americans in the dark about what this proposal would do, I have seen  growing awareness, again, not only at these hearings but as I walk  through the airport, as I march in parades--twice over this weekend--as  I attend public gatherings. Whether it is Boys State, sponsored by the  American Legion for 16- and 17-year-olds, or nursing facilities for  elderly citizens, there is a growing awareness that this bill is bad-- profoundly bad--for the American people.   The people I have heard from have prescriptions to fill, appointments  to make, lives to live, but they have come to these hearings on very  short notice in Hartford and in New Haven, literally filling rooms so  that there was standing room only.   I challenge my colleagues to hold the same kinds of hearings, to  delay this vote so that they can go home at the end of this week and  hold hearings in their State and listen to their constituents about  what they have to say and what the consequences will be.   Nearly 1 in 10 veterans has Medicaid coverage, meaning that a  staggering 1.75 million veterans, including 18,000 veterans in  Connecticut, would be impacted by these reckless cuts. Let me repeat  that number for all of us who rejoiced in the recent Accountability and  Whistleblowers Act. Some 1.75 million veterans--18,000 of them in  Connecticut--will be harmed by this reckless and needless insult and  injury.   Put simply, this bill would make it hard for veterans with mental  health disorders like post-traumatic stress disorder to get care.  Nearly a quarter of all veterans receive care for mental health  disorders outside the VA system, meaning they rely on protections that  guarantee their access to affordable care. Under this proposal, those  protections would be severely threatened, and the veterans who need  that care would see that care at risk.   Here we are talking about a choice program that enables veterans to  seek care outside the VA system, privately, and we are endangering care  for millions of Americans--veterans--who need and seek it by using  Medicaid.   If my colleagues listen to their constituents, they will hear from  many of the people who have come to my townhalls, like Christine  Girassi. Christine has two beautiful 4-year-old twins named McKenzie  and Cameron. McKenzie was born with Prader-Willi syndrome, a rare  genetic disorder that her mom described as ``including low muscle tone,  seizures, temperature instability, sleep apnea, infertility, OCD,  intellectual disabilities, and developmental delay.''   In the first few weeks of her life, McKenzie was in the hospital for  57 days, accounting for $2 million in costs. Their family was spending  $30,000 a year to help their daughter thrive. So when Christine learned  that her daughter had received a waiver to become a Medicaid  beneficiary, she was overjoyed.   Christine told me:         When we received McKenzie's diagnosis, we were told that       she wouldn't do a lot of things, and at only 4 years old       she's already defying the odds. I have no doubt in my mind       that if we are able to continue down our current path of the       proper therapies and doctors, McKenzie will be able to have       her fruitful life. I am terrified if the rug comes out       beneath her that she will become just another statistic.    Another statistic? There are enough statistics in that CBO report. We  will hear a plethora of statistics on the  [[Page S3769]]  floor, but a picture is worth a thousand words and many more than a  thousand statistics, and no one--no one should be consigned to being a  statistic.   This family is one of the many faces and pictures and stories of  Medicaid. They deserve to be heard. If we gut this program, if we strip  away the important services it provides, we know all too well what will  happen to McKenzie and her family as statistics. Like her mother said,  Medicaid has been the path to success for them, and that rug will be  pulled from that family, from beneath McKenzie.   At the hearing on Friday in New Haven, I heard from Kent O'Brien, who  told me about the eight prescription medications he takes--four for  psychiatric reasons and four for medical reasons.   Of course, mental health parity has been one of the crusades of my  life. When I was State attorney general, I worked with Senator Ted  Kennedy and Congressman Patrick Kennedy to help advocate for that bill.  As a Senator, I advocated for the regulations that were necessary for  its enforcement, and we finally got it done.   I want to quote what Kent said directly. He told me:         Hi, everybody, how are you today? I'm going to keep this       brief, because I know the senators are on a very strict time       constraint and I respect that. So I'm just going to talk very       quickly about my prescription medications; there are eight of       them. Four of them are for psychiatric reasons and four are       medical. And if I lose my Medicare and Medicaid, I will be       unable to pay for them obviously, which in turn I will end up       in the hospital.    Kent went on:         Now, for the Republicans who are seeing this in Washington,       can you please listen to me carefully?    I am speaking to an empty Chamber. Let nobody make any mistake that  Republicans are hanging on Kent's words as I speak now, but every one  of them should go to the Record. Every one of them should be listening  in their offices. Every one of them should go to the Record.   Kent goes on:         If I lose that medication, I will end up in the hospital,       and it's going to cost the state and the federal government       much more money than it would be to simply let me go to the       pharmacy and pick up my medication.    If there were ever a message that Washington should hear, it is from  Kent O'Brien, who closed by simply saying:         So I'm just going to close up with that, and don't hurt the       American people. Help them!    If you met Kent, you would wonder how he was capable of that  eloquence. He is an ordinary American, someone who looks like all the  rest of us. He has said to this body what it means to hear: ``Don't  hurt the American people.'' He couldn't be more right. This proposal  would cost our Nation so much, not just financially--Kent had it  right--but morally. It will lead to a weakening of what makes our  country strong and great in the first place: our ability to care about  our neighbor, to fight for what is right, and to listen to the people  who represent here in the Senate.    First, do no harm. That is what the ethos of the medical profession  is. It ought to be our mantra as well. It ought to be what my  colleagues, if nothing else, heed as we reach this decision to listen  to people who sent us here and hear their stories. Listen to the  anxieties and fears and value of America. They will tell you all you  need to know about this bill. Kent told me. As he said, the cost will  be staggering--not just in financial terms but in human terms.   This bill--written behind closed doors, away from the light of day,  away from the realities of medical care in the United States of  America, away from the voices and faces I have brought to the floor  today, and which I will continue to bring to the floor--ignores the  most important thing we can do this week. As Kent said, don't hurt the  American people. As the doctors tell us: First, do no harm.   I yield the floor.
