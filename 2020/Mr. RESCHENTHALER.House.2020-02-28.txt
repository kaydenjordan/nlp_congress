 Madam Speaker, I commend the House Energy and  Commerce Committee for including language in the Protecting American  Lungs and Reversing the Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act of 2019 (H.R. 2339)  to more appropriately treat premium cigars, which are marketed to and  enjoyed by adult consumers. However, a $12 per cigar price requirement  is arbitrary, impossible to enforce, and puts states like Pennsylvania  at a significant disadvantage.   Pennsylvania is home to small business premium cigar retailers,  importers, distributors, and farmers who grow tobacco used in hand-  [[Page H1286]]  made cigars. The history of cigar tobacco farming in Pennsylvania dates  to the 1700s, and today, farmers in the Commonwealth produce the  coveted cigar leaf. Numerous premium cigar mail order companies are  based in Pennsylvania, due to the state's favorable business climate.  In fact, Pennsylvania is second in the nation in premium cigar industry  jobs, and my district is home to small businesses who proudly serve  their adult consumers.   The Commonwealth is also one of few states without an additional tax  on premium cigars. When I was in the Pennsylvania State Senate, I  fought against proposals to impose such a tax, which would have  crippled small businesses and hurt consumers. If a price requirement  like the one proposed in this bill were enacted, small businesses in my  district and across Pennsylvania would be disproportionately impacted,  as more products in their humidors would fall below $12 than products  in other states that are subject to higher taxes.   Madam Speaker, while I am grateful this bill acknowledges that  premium cigars are marketed and enjoyed solely by adults, a $12 price  requirement will devastate Pennsylvania's cigar industry. As Congress  and the Trump Administration continue to work to address important  issues related to regulation of tobacco products, I urge removal of an  arbitrary price point that picks winners and losers.                            ____________________
