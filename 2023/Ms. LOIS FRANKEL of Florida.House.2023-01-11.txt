 Madam Speaker, my, my, my, here we go  again.   First off, let's all condemn the violence on the streets of our  country.   This resolution is a political ploy and a distraction from the  violence that abortion providers and patients face every day.   Bombings, murder, arson; let's condemn these, too.   Madam Speaker, women across our country are being denied lifesaving  care, and healthcare providers are being punished for doing their jobs.   Women deserve access to all forms of health services, including  abortion and the freedom to make decisions about their health and their  lives and their future without interference of politicians.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this resolution which  sidetracks us from the real danger women and healthcare providers are  facing today: The Republican agenda.    My, my, my. Here we go again.  Republicans are racing full steam ahead to criminalize abortion  nationwide.   Madam Speaker, the American people want women--not politicians--to  make their own healthcare decisions, including those about abortion.   So as to this misleading and offensively named bill, let's vote it  down. Let's say no to putting women's lives in danger, no to denying  patients needing lifesaving care, and no to putting healthcare  providers in prison for doing their job.   Madam Speaker, because I love my grandchildren, I reject the extreme  Republican agenda, and I am standing here today with the Democrats for  people to have the freedom to make their own personal decisions about  their health, their life, and their future.
