 Mr. Speaker, Senator Louis Pate, of Mount Olive, North  Carolina, recently retired from the North Carolina General Assembly  after more than 16 years of serving the great people of eastern North  Carolina. I had the pleasure and honor to serve with Louis in the North  Carolina Senate. We shared representation of Wayne County, and I can  attest to what a great member he was.   Senator Pate is known across the State for his leadership,  compassion, and commitment to public service. He is a Vietnam war  combat veteran, having served 20 years in the United States Air Force  earning multiple service medals for his bravery while defending our  country. His commitment to advocating for those who serve our country  was a top priority during his time in public office, and I know he has  been honored to represent the fine men and women serving at Seymour  Johnson Air Force Base in Goldsboro, North Carolina.   During his tenure in the State senate, Louis spent much of his time  working to implement policy to strengthen and improve access to quality  healthcare, including major reforms to Medicaid so the program would  better meet the needs of those for whom it was designed to help.   Senator Pate's legacy as a statesman, mentor, and friend to many will  continue to impact all those who cross his path. I wish him and his  family many blessed days ahead.                            ____________________
