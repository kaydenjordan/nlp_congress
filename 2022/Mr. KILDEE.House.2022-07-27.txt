(c) Treatment of Standard for Enforcement Purposes.--A       consumer product safety standard promulgated under subsection       (a) shall be treated as a consumer product safety rule       promulgated under section 9 of the Consumer Product Safety       Act (15 U.S.C. 2058).        (d) Exception for Reliance on Voluntary Standard.--        (1) Before promulgation of standard by commission.--      Subsection (a) shall not apply if the Commission determines,       before the Commission promulgates a final consumer product       safety standard under such subsection, that--        (A) with respect to any consumer product for which there is       a voluntary consumer product safety standard that meets the       requirements for a standard promulgated under subsection (a)       with respect to such product; and        (B) the voluntary standard described in subparagraph (A)--        (i) is in effect at the time of the determination by the       Commission; or        (ii) will be in effect not later than the date that is 180       days after the date of the enactment of this Act.

(e) Treatment of Voluntary Standard for Enforcement       Purposes.--        (1) In general.--If the Commission makes a determination       under subsection (d) with respect to a voluntary standard,       the requirements of such voluntary standard shall be treated       as a consumer product safety rule promulgated under section 9       of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2058) beginning       on the date described in paragraph (2).        (2) Date described.--The date described in this paragraph       is the later of--        (A) the date of the determination of the Commission under       subsection (d) with respect to the voluntary standard       described in paragraph (1); or        (B) the effective date contained in the voluntary standard       described in paragraph (1).        (f) Revision of Voluntary Standard.--        (1) Notice to commission.--If a voluntary standard with       respect to which the Commission has made a determination       under subsection (d) is subsequently revised, the       organization that revised the standard shall notify the       Commission after the final approval of the revision.        (2) Effective date of revision.--Beginning on the date that       is 180 days after the Commission is notified of a revised       voluntary standard described in paragraph (1) (or such later       date as  [[Page H7202]]       the Commission determines appropriate), such revised       voluntary standard in whole or in part shall be considered to       be a consumer product safety rule promulgated under section 9       of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2058), in place       of the prior version, unless, within 90 days after receiving       the notice, the Commission notifies the organization that the       revised voluntary standard, in whole or in part, does not       improve the safety of the consumer product covered by the       standard and that the Commission is retaining all or part of       the existing consumer product safety standard.        (g) Future Rulemaking.--At any time after the promulgation       of a final consumer product safety standard under subsection       (a), a voluntary standard is treated as a consumer product       safety rule under subsection (e), or a revised voluntary       standard becomes enforceable as a consumer product safety       rule under subsection (f), the Commission may initiate a       rulemaking in accordance with section 553 of title 5, United       States Code, to modify the requirements of the standard or       revised standard. Any rule promulgated under this subsection       shall be treated as a consumer product safety rule       promulgated under section 9 of the Consumer Product Safety       Act (15 U.S.C. 2058).

Safe Connections Act of 2022                                 H.R. 7132         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Safe Connections Act of       2022''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.         Except as otherwise provided in this Act, terms used in       this Act that are defined in section 345(a) of the       Communications Act of 1934, as added by section 4 of this       Act, have the meanings given those terms in such section       345(a).       SEC. 3. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, sexual       assault, human trafficking, and related crimes are life-      threatening issues and have lasting and harmful effects on       individuals, families, and entire communities.        (2) Survivors often lack meaningful support and options       when establishing independence from an abuser, including       barriers such as financial insecurity and limited access to       reliable communications tools to maintain essential       connections with family, social safety networks, employers,       and support services.        (3) Perpetrators of violence and abuse described in       paragraph (1) increasingly use technological and       communications tools to exercise control over, monitor, and       abuse their victims.        (4) Communications law can play a public interest role in       the promotion of safety, life, and property with respect to       the types of violence and abuse described in paragraph (1).       For example, independent access to a wireless phone plan can       assist survivors in establishing security and autonomy.        (5) Safeguards within communications services can serve a       role in preventing abuse and narrowing the digital divide       experienced by survivors of abuse.       SEC. 4.

Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1254, I call  up the bill (H.R. 6929) to increase the benefits guaranteed in  connection with certain pension plans, and for other purposes, and ask  for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on the bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 6929, the Susan Muffley Act of 2022, will restore  the hard-earned pensions of more than 20,000 Delphi salaried retirees,  including 5,000 in my home State of Michigan.   The Susan Muffley Act is a bipartisan bill supported by Republicans  and Democrats in both the House and the Senate. I worked most  particularly with Mr. Ryan of Ohio and Mr. Turner of Ohio on this  legislation along with the other cosponsors. It is endorsed by the  AARP, the AFL-CIO, and the UAW. I am glad we can come together finally  to do what is right for these workers. These are workers who lost their  pensions through no fault of their own.   In this country, Madam Speaker, if you work hard and play by the  rules, you should be able to retire with dignity and with peace of  mind. Instead, these workers had the rug ripped out from underneath  them and lost their hard-earned benefits. When General Motors filed for  bankruptcy during the Great Recession the Federal Government--I repeat,  the Federal Government--made the unprecedented step to move in and save  the auto industry. At the direction of the Federal Government, however,  the U.S. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the PBGC, assumed  responsibility for the Delphi salaried retiree pensions. After  negotiations with the Federal Government, the PBGC cut those hard- earned benefits by as much as 70 percent for 20,000 Delphi salaried  retirees.   These retirees were treated differently than other retirees impacted  by the GM bankruptcy. They suffered significant cuts to their benefits,  upending the lives of thousands and thousands of families.   In September of 2019, the Delphi Salaried Retirees Association filed  suit against the PBGC to have their pension benefits restored. It went  all the way to the Supreme Court until the Court declined to hear the  case, making it clear that only congressional action could restore  these earned pension benefits.   Our legislation would make this unique group of retirees who had  their pensions unfairly and disproportionately cut will make them whole  again. This means that beneficiaries will receive a payment of the  difference of what was actually paid to them by the PBGC and what they  would have earned had they been able to keep their pensions like  everyone else did. Moving forward, beneficiaries will receive their  full earned pension.   This bill is fully paid for and will not add to the deficit.   Delphi salaried retirees deserve to have their pensions made whole  because it was the Federal Government that singled these workers out.  It was the Federal Government who stepped in to rescue General Motors  but decided to treat these workers differently and cut their earned  pensions. It was the Federal Government, not General Motors, who  directly negotiated with the PBGC.   What happened to these hardworking retirees was wrong, and now it is  the Federal Government who has the responsibility to fix the mess that  itself created.   We need to get this legislation done for people like Susan Muffley  for whom this bill is named. David Muffley, Susan's husband, worked at  Delphi as an electronics technician for 31 years but lost the full  value of his pension in 2009. His wife, Susan Muffley, was a core part  of the Delphi Salaried Retirees Association's leadership team fighting  to restore these pensions.   Because of the financial difficulties of losing their pension, Susan  avoided seeing her doctor because they couldn't afford it. Sadly, she  was ultimately diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and passed away.   After working hard for 30 years to earn a pension to support your  family through retirement, no worker and no family member should be  forced to forgo medical treatment to make ends meet. These workers need  the Susan Muffley Act. The last 13 years have been an absolute  nightmare for these families. These are people I know.   During the Obama Administration, the problem was created but never  addressed. During the Trump administration, the former President talked  about fixing the issue but never acted. He ran out of time before that  moment could occur. But now, today, after lots of talk and not so much  action, Congress can finally act to provide relief and justice for  these workers, these Delphi salaried retirees.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I appreciate the comments of my colleague. I disagree  with the conclusions that she makes, and I would only challenge a  couple of things.   One is on the issue of precedent. There is no precedent, unless the  precedent is when the Federal Government intervenes and takes control  of a company, takes ownership of a company, it buys the problem. It  then owns the solution. It owns responsibility for the solution.   So the only precedent that I think this sets is one that I learned a  long time ago: if you broke it, you bought it. The Federal Government  intervened and made these decisions disproportionately affecting these  particular employees.   The rest of the employees got their pensions topped up, why wouldn't  this particular set?   Secondly, I disagree with the reference that this is candy. For these  taxpayers, these families, this is rent, this is food on the table, it  is their mortgage payment, it is a car payment, and it is medicine-- medicines that, sadly, Susan Muffley didn't have the ability to get to  because her pension was cut. This is about justice.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan  (Mrs. Lawrence), who unfortunately is spending her last months in  Congress. I wish that weren't the case.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Higgins), my colleague on the Ways and Means Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I appreciated the gentleman's comments. I will point out, since the  gentleman did refer to the former President, Mr. Trump, that Mr. Trump  saw this as an injustice and directed his administration to address it  as well.   And I also think there is enough partisanship in Washington, more  than enough, so let's not make something that is bipartisan just for  the point of rhetorical value into something that is claimed to be  partisan.   This is not a partisan piece of legislation. I see Mr. Turner on the  other side of the aisle. We have worked together on this for years; 17  of the 37 cosponsors of this legislation are Republicans, including  Members with whom I don't think I have ever shared sponsorship. I don't  recall, for example, being a cosponsor of any piece of legislation with  Mr. Mo Brooks. We are on this one.   This is not a partisan bill, so let's not call it that. You can  disagree with it. You can vote against people getting their hard-earned  pensions, but let's not make it into something that it isn't.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan  (Mrs. Dingell), a friend that I have known for a very long time, a  member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Ryan), a gentleman that I have been working with on this  issue for as long as I have been in Congress.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Ohio.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), the longest-serving woman in the history of the  United States Congress.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  to close.   I do believe, and I agree with my colleague, that the facts ought to  be correct and that the Record ought to be clear. That is why I want to  clarify a couple of things.   Number one, I continue to hear opponents of this legislation depict  it as a Democratic bill, a partisan bill. That is just not true. It is  amazing to me in this body that we can still have people say things  that just are patently untrue. That is not true.   Just look at the list of Republican cosponsors of this legislation.  If you don't want to look at that list, don't look at that list. Just  look back a couple of years when then-Republican President Donald Trump  saw this as an injustice and directed his administration to solve this  problem.   This is not a partisan piece of legislation. I understand the game; I  get it. Everything around here somehow has to be turned into Democrats  versus Republicans.   I am going to tell you something about the Delphi salaried retirees.  Some are Democrats. Some are Republicans. Some are Independents. They  live in every part of this country. They are people who worked really  hard and did nothing wrong and lost everything that they had worked for  in some cases.   Two, the other fact that I want to correct, it is true that only the  losses that these pension recipients received, the losses that they  experienced would be made up for. So when my colleague points out the  fact that some did not receive a 70 percent cut, that is true. People  will only receive what was promised to them. That is kind of an  American ideal, isn't it? We keep our promises.   As to the point that this is a private pension that was mismanaged  and failed and the government shouldn't become involved, that ship  sailed a long time ago when the government got involved. The government  took control of the company, took control of its assets, made these  decisions.   So if there is a precedent to be set, the precedent is this: The  Federal Government makes a mistake, the Federal Government has the  obligation to fix it. I don't know what is wrong with that. I don't  know what is wrong with that. I mean, that is the way I was raised.   I don't know who is watching today. I don't know how many Americans  are watching, but I hope they are paying attention. I know a lot of  those Delphi salaried retirees are watching. Despite some of what you  heard today--because this place becomes very political, unfortunately-- despite some of what you heard, what you saw and what you are about to  see in a little while, we are Democrats and Republicans who disagree on  a lot of things and we are coming together to fix a problem that has  lasted for 13 years, a problem that occurred on the watch of a  Democratic President, a problem that a Republican President was  attempting to address, but who didn't get it done, and now in this  moment Members of Congress--with whom I have very little in common-- share one thing for sure, we represent many of the same people, people  who have suffered an injustice and are looking to the Congress of the  United States as the last chance they have to have that mistake made  right.   That is a precedent I don't mind seeing us set. If the Federal  Government makes a mistake, we fix it. That is what we are about to do  here today.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
