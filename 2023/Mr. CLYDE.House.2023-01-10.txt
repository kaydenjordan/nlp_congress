 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the 2023 college  football national champions, my alma mater, the University of Georgia  Bulldogs.   In a stunning triumph last night, the Georgia Bulldogs defeated the  TCU Horned Frogs 65-7, marking the largest margin of victory in bowl  game history. After boasting an impressive undefeated record in the  regular season, last night's historic win proved without a doubt that  the Dawgs are victorious and on top.   Congratulations to the talented young men that put their all into the  game, including a Heisman finalist and four-time College Football  Playoff MVP, quarterback Stetson Bennett.   Congratulations to Head Coach Kirby Smart and the entire coaching  staff for leading the Georgia Bulldogs in becoming back-to-back  national champions.   Go Dawgs.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for  yielding.   Last week, as I fought as one of the 20 conservative Members to  secure victories for the American people by dismantling this  institution's broken system and restoring this people's House as it  should be, part of the status quo here in Washington, which we fought  to change, is politicians making empty promises of government  accountability.   But believe me in this, Mr. Speaker, when we vowed accountability is  coming, we meant it. Establishing the Select Subcommittee on the  Weaponization of the Federal Government hands the House a powerful tool  to uncover the two-tiered justice system that is rotting our Republic.   It is no secret that alphabet agencies have been dangerously  weaponized against the American people. As an alarming example, the FBI  has coerced citizens to relinquish their Second Amendment rights and  has used Big Tech companies as private-sector proxies to silence  Americans' free speech.   It is time to thoroughly investigate our Government agencies'  atrocious behavior and abuse of power in disregarding and destroying  America's precious freedoms, and this select subcommittee will have the  teeth to do just that.   I thank Speaker McCarthy and Chairman Cole for their invaluable  support in bringing this resolution to the floor for a vote.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in voting for  this resolution so we may deliver transparency, answers, and, yes,  accountability to the American people as we have promised.
