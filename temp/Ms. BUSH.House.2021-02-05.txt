 Mr. Speaker, St. Louis and I rise today in support of the  National Apprenticeship Act of 2021 and in support of our amendment.   For more than 80 years since the New Deal, the Registered  Apprenticeship Program has sought to build pathways into dignified and  stable work. But we know that the promise of good jobs with good pay  and benefits has never been fully realized in America.   The pandemic has unevenly devastated communities like Missouri's  First District, including families of color, unhoused communities,  people with disabilities, and heavily incarcerated communities.   Mr. Speaker, as we rebuild our economy, we must target jobs to them.  Our amendment will ensure childcare is not a barrier to successful  reentry home. It centers the more than 5 million young children in this  country who have had a parent incarcerated by adding childcare as an  essential transitional service.   Mr. Speaker, as a single mother, as a nurse, as a former childcare  worker, I know what it is like to miss a day of work because a sitter  fell through or I couldn't afford childcare.   When you are a single mother, not working is rarely an option. Not  working means you can't feed or shelter your family. I have been there.  I have been evicted, and I have lived in a car with my own children.   Over 80 percent of women in jail are mothers to minor children and  are their primary caretakers. When anyone is released from prison, they  need resources to be reunited with and provide for their families. Our  amendment ensures that participation in the workforce can be equally  shared by all, including those who need it most.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Scott and his amazing staff for  collaborating, and I thank Representatives Bowman and Pressley for  their partnership. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.
