 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that, following  Senator Menendez, I be recognized for up to 20 minutes prior to the  scheduled rollcall vote.    Madam President, we have a lot of work to get done  before January 19, the next deadline to pass our funding and avoid a  shutdown.   The American people are looking for serious leadership and results,  and I come to the floor today to be clear about what the standard for  success is here.   We need to pass regular, full-year funding, based on the bipartisan  spending agreement from earlier this year, that actually responds to  the challenges before us. Anything less means missing critical  opportunities and worse.   A ``date-change, full-year CR,'' as proposed by House Speaker  Johnson, would be unprecedented and reckless.   Why is that? Well, because the Speaker's proposal would lock in  outdated spending plans and devastating across-the-board cuts while  locking all of us out of any kind of thoughtful decision-making process  for our Nation's future, all of which should be absolutely unacceptable  to everyone here.   It is one thing to have a short-term CR so we have additional time to  negotiate in good faith and finish passing bills, full-year bills that  strengthen our Nation, but it is another thing entirely to do a  yearlong CR because we have no intention of doing our job.   We cannot just throw up our hands, act like nothing in the world has  changed in the past 12 months, abdicate our responsibility to our  constituents, and box in our Nation's future by putting the government  on autopilot.   When you put the government on autopilot, without direction or any  consideration of changing needs, you are functionally causing year- over-year funding cuts without any rhyme, reason, or recalibration for  new and changing priorities, causing huge uncertainties and  inefficiencies across our Federal Government and seriously impairing  every single one of our Agencies' ability to fulfill their mission and  move our country forward. And that, by the way, is all before taking  into account the incredibly steep across-the-board cuts that would come  into play under this scenario under our Fiscal Responsibility Act.   This runs way deeper than numbers, at best, stagnating on a page and  Agencies cutting hard-working staff and crucial services. We are  talking about missing opportunities on issues where the clock is  ticking, pulling the rug out from our families who are struggling, and  undermining our national defense and security in front of the whole  world.   I think we all understand now is a dangerous time to signal America's  global leadership is faltering, but that is exactly the message a  yearlong CR would send: a year of America's military falling behind and  a year of our diplomatic and humanitarian efforts falling behind.   When we put our government on autopilot, we are telling the world  Congress is asleep at the wheel and incapable of responding to the  growing threats of an ever more dangerous world.    In practical terms for defense, as my colleague--the senior Senator  from Maine and vice chair of the committee--said here on this floor  recently, it means the Pentagon freezing 330 new programs or production  increases. It means falling behind in building our ships and our subs  and much more and doing so, by the way, at a time when China already  has a larger navy.   It means essentially no new progress in our efforts to strengthen our  military and diplomatic footprint in the Indo-Pacific so we can forge  strong partnerships and deter aggression from the Chinese Government.  This is something we devoted significant thought and resources to  across our bipartisan spending bills, with new funding for our Indo- Pacific strategy and the Countering PRC Influence Fund, not to mention  other global leadership investments like the new Economic Resilience  Initiative that will help strengthen our supply chains for critical  resources and weaken the financial pressure our competitors can exert  on key U.S. partners.   But all that goes out the window with a full-year CR, particularly  under the construct that has been proposed by the Speaker of the House,  where he would simply change a date and quit--change a date and quit.   Can you imagine a leader, one of the highest ranking officials in  this country, if not the world, seriously proposing that as an answer  right now?   Under the yearlong CR, we would not have critical funding increases  to support our servicemembers, to support their families, from troop  readiness essentials like recruitment and training to family support  like childcare and barracks, to other projects like the Shipyard  Infrastructure Optimization Plan.   I also want to remind our colleagues, a full-year CR would not just  hurt our national security, it would be devastating for our families  and our communities across the country and our country's future.   When it comes to keeping our economy strong, there are simply too  many missed opportunities to even list.   We would lose out increases in bolstering trade and U.S. business  competitiveness. We would lose out on strengthening our supply chain  and building innovation hubs. We would lose out on research funding for  manufacturing; AI; agriculture; clean energy; cures and treatments for  cancer, Alzheimer's, and other terrible diseases and a lot more.   We would lose ground in our plans to send Americans back to the Moon,  while the Chinese Government is going full speed ahead.   And when it comes to fighting the opioid epidemic, resigning our  Nation to a yearlong CR means the increased investments that we did  include in our Senate bills to keep fentanyl out of our country by  stopping drug cartels and getting help to patients and families won't  happen.   Instead, stagnant funding means furloughs at our border and thousands  of pounds of illicit drugs reaching our communities.   A CR also will not include any funding to reform cosmetics safety or  retirement security or the organ donation and transplant system.   And let's talk about WIC. WIC is the lifeline for moms who need  formula, nutritious food, and other essentials to feed their babies. It  is at risk of being severely underfunded by a CR.   I grew up in a family who knew what it meant to fall on hard times  and have a government that had our backs. I will not let our country  pull out the rug from folks in their time of need. But if we put  spending on autopilot for the next year, we will be kicking struggling  families off benefits and onto wait-lists.   It is not just WIC that is going to see these painful shortfalls that  will ultimately hurt families, it is programs that keep families warm  in the winter or cool in the summer and safe from extreme temperatures  like LIHEAP. It is programs that give people healthcare, like community  health centers and the new suicide prevention lifeline. It is programs  that make sure families have a roof over their head, rental assistance,  affordable housing, homelessness prevention--programs that already  can't meet the needs in their communities.   It is the Social Security Administration, for crying out loud. A CR  would  [[Page S5792]]  force them to reduce hours and lay off staff. You want to call up and  sign up for new benefits or see how you can fix a problem? There will  be no one to answer you--long wait times.   And let's not forget, it is programs for folks who are trying to  improve their situation, get a better job, and further their own  career. A CR means no increases for apprenticeship funding, workforce  training, or the maximum Pell amount.   What else do parents need if they are going to go to work? I have  said it many times, childcare. We are in a childcare crisis, and with a  full-year CR, this is only going to go from bad to worse because we  will be resigned to across-the-board cuts to our Nation's childcare  programs.   And our public schools also will face tight budgets. Kids are still  recovering from this pandemic, and we can't afford to provide our  schools less funding when our students deserve and need more support.  It is that simple.   Look, I have been going on for a while. But the truth is, I have  barely scratched the surface on what we will lose with a full-year CR:  Increases throughout our bills to support Tribal communities, gone;  over a billion dollars for FAA modernization efforts, gone; housing for  wildland firefighters, improvements in our rail system, next-generation  weather satellites, gone, gone, and gone.   And here is the kicker: I have only been talking so far about half  the equation because the Fiscal Responsibility Act would force  absolutely devastating across-the-board cuts on virtually all domestic  programs that could be as much as nearly 10 percent.   Let's be clear about the damage here. Immediate hiring freezes and  furloughs at just about every Agency. Millions of women and kids would  lose WIC benefits; wait times at ports of entry would quadruple; wait  times for new business permits from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and  Trade Bureau would increase fivefold; nearly 1,000 fewer full-time food  safety inspectors; 2,500 fewer national park employees and less staff  and equipment for our Federal firefighters; 5,000 scientists, students,  and technical staff no longer receiving research support at our  national labs and universities; 130,000 fewer small businesses getting  training and counseling from the Small Business Association; nearly  700,000 households losing Federal housing assistance and being pushed  toward homelessness; 2\1/2\ million patients across Indian Country hurt  by a $235 million cut to the Indian Health Service hospitals and  clinics.   And that is the tip of the iceberg. We are talking tens of billions  of dollars slashed to programs that keep our country competitive and  our economy strong and our families safe and sound. So this is really  no run-of-the-mill CR outcome, which would be bad enough as it is.   The bottom line here is this: We have a job to do. We have a job to  do. Our constituents expect us to come to work, to listen to them,  respond to the challenges in their life, write the bills, solve our  problems, and deliver results. At a minimum, they expect us to try--not  threaten, as the Speaker is doing, to change a few words and give up.   A long-term CR wouldn't just shut out their voices, it would cede  ground to our adversaries, let America fall behind, and cut off vital  resources families count on each and every day.   If we want to make sure that America continues to lead; if we want a  strong, competitive economy; if we want a safer world; and if we want a  real future for our families, we cannot just throw our hands up and  hope for the best. We have to come together, do the hard work of  governing, hammer out bipartisan spending bills that actually reflect  what we think our Nation needs, get back to the bipartisan spending  agreement that the House Republicans wanted--actually, getting back to  that, they demanded it--and agree that extreme partisan riders have no  place in our spending bills.   In the full Senate here, as the Presiding Officer knows, we wrote 12  bipartisan spending bills that follow the full terms of the bipartisan  spending agreement, but now we need House Republicans to hold up their  end of the bargain. That means sticking to the entire agreement and  using the full resources it provides for defense and domestic programs.   We cannot move forward if House Republicans are busy trying to go  back on their word, especially for a deal that they pushed for and  negotiated in the first place. Let's all remember that House  Republicans were the ones who chose to hold the debt limit hostage  until they secured this agreement. Let's also remember it was their  leader who negotiated this deal directly with the President. They cut  this deal. When you negotiate a deal, you don't then bargain over how  much of your word you are going to keep. Deals are built on common  ground and mutual trust, not shifting sand.   So, Madam President, I will be clear. I am not calling on Republicans  to do anything extreme here or anything I wouldn't do myself. I get  that no one ever gets everything they want, especially in a divided  government. In fact, as I have said many times, I believe the cuts that  were enacted by the Fiscal Responsibility Act set us back. But that was  the deal. That was the deal we voted on. So, here in the Senate, we did  write 12 bipartisan bills to those terms. That is the job. That is what  legislating looks like in a divided government.   If we are going to avoid an unnecessary shutdown or an absolutely  unacceptable, inflexible, yearlong CR--for the first time ever--we need  everyone to get real about just what is at stake if we give up on  writing serious, full-year funding bills. And that is just what it is  going to take to get that done. So I call on everybody: Let's do our  job.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, the clock is ticking. Aid for our  allies in Ukraine has run dry, and the whole world is now watching to  see if the United States is still capable of standing by all of its  allies in times of need.   There is a lot at stake here. Now is the time for choosing whether  the United States will continue being a leader in the world and a  champion for democracy. So I hope Senate Republicans think carefully  about whether they truly want to abandon our allies in Ukraine over  draconian, far-right immigration policies that will never become law or  if they will work with us to stop conditioning this aid on partisan  nonstarters and get this vital funding over the line.   If they can put forward a commonsense bipartisan proposal regarding  the border, we will consider that. They had a real opportunity today to  do just that and debate those policies here on the Senate floor.   But let's be clear: We do not have time to give up and call it a day.  We have too much at stake to settle for half steps that tell the world  the United States no longer knows how to stand with its allies or stand  up to dictators.   Votes matter. Blocking consideration of today's supplemental sends a  real and dangerous signal to the entire world--to our allies and our  adversaries alike. But it is not too late for us to come together and  send a different message, a message that says ``America is united''  when it comes to leading on the world stage and keeping our country and  our friends safe.   Let's talk to one another. Let's understand that compromise has to  happen. And let's act quickly and completely to deliver the national  security resources that are so badly needed. I am ready to get to work  with my colleagues and do just that.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume legislative session.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I have  been clear about why we must deliver support for Ukraine, Israel, and  humanitarian assistance together, as have many of my colleagues. That  is actually why we just attempted to move forward on one package that  meets all of these needs--a package that Republicans blocked.   I spoke about this before the vote, but let me just reiterate how  dire the situation is right now.   Our support for Ukraine has been essential, but it has also now been  exhausted. Our allies are waiting for aid, and Putin is just waiting  for us to send a sign that it is not coming. But Putin is not the only  one watching right now. The world is watching this debate. Our allies  want to know, when they are facing a crisis, can they count on America  to stand with them or will we give up on them when it gets tough or  when we get distracted with other crises? They are all watching and  wondering, can America still lead or are we overwhelmed? Will America  pick and choose which promises it keeps?   Let's not forget, it is not just big-name allies and adversaries we  are talking about here; there are many smaller but no less important  countries that are watching. Some are in critical regions, facing  historic decisions about the paths and partnerships they will pursue in  the years ahead, and they are wondering, is the United States a  reliable partner? We have to put those concerns to rest with a strong  package that shows that our commitment to our allies and to standing up  to dictators is ironclad.   That is what is at stake here--not just our allies in Ukraine, who  are at a key moment in their battle to protect their sovereignty, not  just our deterrence to adversaries like Putin and other dictators who  would trample democracy if given the chance, but our very credibility  on the world stage.   We have to respond to all these crises or we are telling the world:  Don't count on America. We are at capacity.   That is an incredibly dangerous message to send, especially at such a  critical moment. It should be unthinkable.   I appreciate my colleague's urgency to get aid to Israel, but this is  a deeply flawed way to deliver it. This bill would not provide a single  dollar in desperately needed humanitarian assistance to civilians in  Gaza and elsewhere, and it would not address the urgent need to extend  funding for Ukraine.   There are civilians in Ukraine right now who are suffering and have  been for months. There is also an enemy in Ukraine who is on the march  and is just waiting for an opening to gain the upper hand.   We have been discussing the aid for our allies in Ukraine for much  longer than aid for Israel, which is also urgently needed, and we have  already been delayed here for too long. To force Ukraine to wait or to  withhold future aid is to abandon an ally, surrender to a dictator, and  invite more chaos around the world.   We cannot leave Ukraine behind, nor can we fail to deliver  humanitarian assistance before the humanitarian crisis in Gaza devolves  further into hopelessness that can worsen the threats we are already  facing.   At this critical moment, it is not just the right thing to do, it is  essential to our national security interests to help promote stability  and security. That same logic applies to other investments as well,  like supporting our allies in the Indo-Pacific. Invest in stability so  we avoid paying for chaos.    We have to move quickly to respond to these challenges, yes, but we  also have to move completely to respond to them because, as I have said  before, they are all connected.   If we let the Israel-Hamas war weaken our resolve elsewhere, we are  telling dictators across the world: The best way to get America off  your back is for it to be distracted by a crisis somewhere else.   We are essentially giving Hamas and other extremists a new sales  pitch to make when seeking support from bad actors: Give us support,  and we will keep America busy. They can't deal with you if they are  focused on us.   That is a profoundly dangerous message to send.   Putin is watching closely to see if this is his opportunity to make  our resolve waiver in Ukraine. As it plots its next move, the Chinese  Government is watching closely to see if we will stand up to  aggressors. If we falter, other adversaries will take note as well.  That is why doing half the job here is just not going to cut it. We  have to do the whole job. Anything less is telling our allies that  America cannot be trusted and telling dictators that they have free  rein because America is too busy to lead right now.   We must not invite chaos. We must not abandon any of our allies. We  have to show that U.S. leadership is strong and capable of meeting all  the challenges before us.   So I urge Republicans to get serious about the situation before us so  we can pass a package like the one we just voted on that shows the  world that America takes its commitments seriously and doesn't just  stand by some of its allies some of the time.   With that, I yield to Senator Reed.    Mr. President, on behalf of all the Senators who spoke  so eloquently and forcefully tonight, I object.
