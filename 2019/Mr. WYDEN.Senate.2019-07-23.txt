 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today I rise to rebut the deeply flawed  proposal the Attorney General made this morning. This morning, he  raised a tired, debunked plan to blow a hole in one of the most  important security features protecting the digital lives of the  American people. Mr. Barr--once again echoing the views of some on the  far, far right--is trying to undermine strong encryption and require  government back doors into the personal devices of the American people.   ``Encryption'' is a technical term that gets thrown around by people  in government who don't want you to use it. The idea, however, is  simple: It is using math to encode your information so that the only  people who can read it are the ones you want to read it.   As is often known, encryption is used every time a credit card is  swiped or an online bank account is accessed. It helps protect our kids  from predators who would spy on them through their cell phone cameras  or surreptitiously track their movements. It keeps our health records,  our personal communications, and our other sensitive data secure from  hackers. Strong encryption helps protect national security secrets from  hackers working for the Russians, the Chinese, the North Koreans, and  other hostile governments.   I have spent a full decade fighting off horrible plans to undermine  strong encryption. My usual argument goes something like this: You  can't build a back door only for the good guys, for government  officials who are trying to protect people. Once you weaken encryption  with a back door, you make it far easier for criminals and hackers and  predators to get into your digital life. Then I go through all the  reasons the government's plan to build a back door is just about the  worst idea since Crystal Pepsi.   Today, I want to raise some even more pressing concerns that are new.  Many times in the past, I have warned that unnecessary government  surveillance holds the potential to be abused, but I have never done  what I am doing today. Today, I fear--rather, I expect that if we give  the Attorney General and the President the unprecedented power to break  encryption across the board and burrow into the most intimate details  of Americans' lives, they will abuse those powers. I don't say that  lightly. Yet, when I look at the record, the public statements, and the  behavior of William Barr and Donald Trump, it is clear to me that you  can't make the case for giving them this kind of power. There is too  much evidence that they will abuse it. Their record shows they do not  feel constrained by the law. They have not been bound by legal or moral  precedents. Donald Trump, by his own words, has no ethical  compunction--these are his words--about using government power against  his political enemies.   Never before have I been so certain that an administration in power  would knowingly abuse the massive power of government surveillance. It  is for that reason that building government back doors into the  encrypted communications of the American people is now uniquely  dangerous and must be opposed at all costs.   These are serious charges that I have made, and I am going to walk  through my reasoning. First, I would like to discuss the Attorney  General's history when it comes to government surveillance and  government power.   When this body voted on Mr. Barr's nomination earlier this year, I  laid out in great detail his history when it comes to Executive power.  Anyone wishing for a full airing of Mr. Barr's lifelong devotion to  unbounded Executive power can dial up those remarks of mine on C-SPAN,  but I just want to highlight one item again this morning.   Mr. Barr testified in October of 2003, and he laid out his  ideological position that the President is not restrained when it comes  to surveilling people here in the United States--not by laws passed by  Congress, not by the Fourth Amendment, no constraints.   In that 2003 testimony, Mr. Barr said that the PATRIOT Act didn't go  far enough in terms of government surveillance. Even worse, Mr. Barr  said that laws going back to the 1970s have no real effect on  Presidential power. Mr. Barr said: ``Numerous statutes were passed,  such as FISA''--Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act--``that purported  to supplant Presidential discretion with Congressionally crafted  schemes whereby judges become the arbiter of national security  decisions.'' In one sentence, Mr. Barr just swept 40 years of  congressional action and 200 years of constitutional governance out the  window. We ought to take him at his word that he has contempt for the  Fourth Amendment and critical laws that protect our law-abiding people.  [[Page S4989]]    It is far more than just words, however, that lead me to this  conclusion. It is now public record that William Barr, when he was  Attorney General in the 1990s, approved a massive, illegal surveillance  program.   The inspector general at the Department of Justice revealed this  March that William Barr gave the OK to a bulk phone records dragnet at  the Drug Enforcement Agency that ran for more than 20 years. The  inspector general found that Mr. Barr never even looked to see whether  that Drug Enforcement Administration bulk surveillance program was  legal. The inspector general called it ``troubling'' because of the  disconnect between what the law says and how it was secretly being  interpreted and used. The Drug Enforcement Agency program that William  Barr approved relied on subpoena power that requires that the records  being collected be ``relevant or material'' to an investigation. But  Mr. Barr didn't bother to consider whether all of those phone records  that were collected in bulk were consistent with the law; he just went  ahead and rubberstamped it.   The inspector general tends to be polite about outright calling  government programs illegal, but even the inspector general pointed out  that there are multiple court cases that ``clearly suggested potential  challenges to the validity of the DEA's use of this statutory subpoena  power in this expansive, non-targeted manner.''   Finally, the inspector general found that the records collected from  the program were used outside the Drug Enforcement Agency for  investigations that had nothing to do with drugs--a practice the  inspector general said ``raised significant legal questions.''   The inspector general goes on to note that Congress was kept almost  entirely in the dark. At a time when the American people are hungry for  transparency and openness and accountability, the inspector general  says Congress was kept in the dark by Mr. Barr about a decades-long,  illegal bulk collection program, with the exception of a single secret  Intelligence Committee hearing in 2007. Even then, it was obvious the  program was illegal. That is why my colleague Senator Feingold and I  wrote to the head of National Intelligence pointing out that the  subpoena authority the DEA was using was never intended for bulk  collection. This was secret law, and it was wrong and dangerous.   That is why I wanted to make sure people knew Mr. Barr's history,  because this secret, illegal bulk collection program was approved by  the current Attorney General. So you have an Attorney General who not  only has said he is not constrained by the law, but he has a history of  breaking the law. You also have a President who almost every day  expresses contempt for any legal or constitutional restraints on his  powers. That attitude applies to surveillance too. In 2016, in response  to Russian hacking of his opponents, Donald Trump said: ``I wish I had  that power.''   So Donald Trump--a President who Attorney General Barr thinks can do  no wrong--is the one who is driving this. This is the President who  Attorney General Barr thinks is above the law. This is the President  whom the Attorney General will, in effect, cover for at virtually every  turn, as he did when he repeatedly lied about the contents of the  Mueller report.   Let me close by talking about why this matters to William Barr's  efforts now to break into Americans' encrypted communications. The  argument that the government needs to weaken encryption has always been  based on the promise that the government will never use the back door  without a court-ordered warrant.   Yet Mr. Barr, in his own words and actions, has demonstrated  repeatedly, when it comes to surveillance, that the laws don't matter,  that the courts don't matter, and that even the Constitution doesn't  matter. The only thing that matters is what he and the President feel  like doing.   So I would ask my colleagues who are here, what Senators in their  right minds would give these men the authority to break into the phone  of every single American? Imagine what kind of information they could  gather on their political opponents. Imagine if a Member of Congress  were secretly gay and were desperate to hide the fact. Despite  campaigning on family values, imagine if a Member of Congress had  cheated on his wife. Would a man like the individual I have described  here use that information against them? Would Donald Trump use it to  secure their loyalty in the face of his own wrongdoing?   I understand that the world is a frightening place, and anybody who  serves on the Select Committee on Intelligence would share that view.  Some government agencies will always advocate for greater powers to  surveil Americans and intrude into their digital lives. It is important  to remember, as I touched on in the beginning, that the banning of  encryption in America will not stop the bad guys from using encryption,  and it will not ban basic math algorithms elsewhere in the world. It  will only leave Americans less secure against foreign hackers, and--I  regret having to say this--it will leave Americans less secure against  intrusions by an administration that has shown it is willing to support  lawless measures.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I am lifting my hold on the  nomination  [[Page S5010]]  of Elizabeth Darling to be Commissioner on Children, Youth, and  Families at the Department of Health and Human Services.   I will not object to any unanimous consent request concerning the  nomination of Ms. Darling at this time. Please remove my hold from the  back of the Executive Calendar in the section titled Notice of Intent  to Object.                            ____________________
