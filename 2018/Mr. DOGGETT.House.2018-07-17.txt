 Mr. Speaker, I rise to respectfully call upon our  Republican colleagues to stand up for America by standing up against  and rejecting President Donald Trump's surrender to murderous dictator  Vladimir Putin.   Putin may well have elected Trump, but Putin is against us all,  Democrats and Republicans alike, and he is against our cherished  democracy.   Without his congressional Republican enablers, Trump cannot continue  to coddle the Russians at the very time that his Director of National  Intelligence, lifelong Republican Dan Coats, is warning that we are  under sustained Russian attack.   In his embarrassing, fawning praise of Putin, Trump expresses no  concern for Putin's military shooting down a civilian airliner four  years ago today; Putin's agents poisoning his enemies and jailing his  opponents; Putin's invasions of Ukraine and Georgia; and Putin's  interference and attacks on our elections, as certified by U.S.  intelligence agencies.   Don't await your retirement to stand up and address the truth of  Trump's betrayal of our country.                            ____________________
