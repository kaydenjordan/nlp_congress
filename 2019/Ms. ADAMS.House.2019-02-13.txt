 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of my colleague,  Representative Walter Jones, Jr.   For 24 years, Congressman Jones represented the people of North  Carolina's Third Congressional District with pride and integrity. In  his quarter century in service to our great country, Congressman Jones  was a steadfast voice and advocate for North Carolina.   He was unafraid to put people before politics and was a dedicated  public servant. He was a principled leader. He stood firmly for what he  believed and wasn't afraid to admit when he made a mistake.   Second Corinthians 5:8 reminds us that `` . . . to be absent from the  body is to be present with the Lord.'' I pray that Congressman Jones  has now found the peace that he sought.   To his wife, Joe Anne, and daughter, Ashley, please know that Walter  Jones left an indelible mark upon our State and Nation, and he will be  missed.                            ____________________
