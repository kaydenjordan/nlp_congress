 MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong  support, and I thank Chairman Pallone for his incredible leadership on  this.   Madam Speaker, I also want to thank Congressman Krishnamoorthi, who  has been a leader on the youth vaping epidemic as the chair of the  Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy on the Oversight  Committee. He has led a months' long investigation into e-cigarette  companies, which revealed mountains of evidence that these companies  are illegally targeting children in advertising campaigns.   And the way they target children is by selling flavored tobacco  products with kid-friendly flavors like mango and mint. This is  despicable and will cause long-term damage to countless children's  lives.   This bill is very important because it will ban the manufacture and  sale of all flavored tobacco products, which will make it much more  difficult for companies to target children. This is extremely  important. It will save lives.   I strongly support the bill and urge my colleagues for a ``yes''  vote.
