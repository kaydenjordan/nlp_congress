 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Hoyer) for yielding.   Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the en bloc amendment, which  highlights the importance of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network,  FinCEN, to protect our financial system from illicit activities, combat  money laundering, and promote the United States' national security.   As we speak, oligarchs, kleptocrats, and other criminals are using  anonymous shell companies to engage in money laundering, terrorist  financing, tax fraud, corruption, bribery, and other illicit  activities.   FinCEN is working tirelessly to implement the Corporate Transparency  Act's beneficial ownership rule to increase transparency and, yes, to  follow the money to pursue bad actors, from Russian oligarchs to drug  traffickers and, more recently, terrorist groups.   Particularly in the wake of the recent Hamas attack, it is evident  how vital the bureau's work is to direct and deter financial streams  for terrorist groups, so I ask that we support this amendment.   Unfortunately, House Republican's Financial Services and General  Government Appropriations Act cuts FinCEN's funding by more than 12  percent and would necessitate significant personnel layoffs.   My colleagues across the aisle claim to prioritize national security  while simultaneously undermining the very offices at the Treasury  tasked with safeguarding our financial system. This office is already  stretched thin, working hard to fulfill its mandate with the limited  resources it has. Let's not further hamstring the bureau's national  security efforts with a 12-percent budget cut.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.
