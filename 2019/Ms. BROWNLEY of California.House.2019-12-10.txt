 Mr. Speaker, his name was Carlos Gregorio  Hernandez Vasquez. He was 16. He was sick with the flu, so sick with  the flu that he passed out. He was being detained by U.S. Border  Patrol. He laid on the floor of his cell for hours without a single  person coming to help him. He spent hours, until he died, on the floor  alone.   When CBP detained him, they were responsible for his well-being. We  were responsible for his well-being, and we failed him.   Some say we must create a deterrent from children fleeing their home  country. I ask, Mr. President, is this deterrent enough for you?   Our country was founded on the principle that human rights are  universal rights. It is at the very core of our Constitution, our  democracy, and it is why this democratic experiment endures. Without  it, we are nothing.                            ____________________
