 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Strike section 6.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 198, the gentlewoman  from Hawaii (Ms. Hanabusa) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Hawaii.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak on my amendment to strike  Section 6, Reemployment of Former Employees.   Mr. Chairman, I understand the value of rehiring competent and  capable former employees who left and want to return to serve our  veterans at the Department of Veterans Affairs. However, the current  text would allow the Secretary to rehire a former employee without the  former employee going through any competitive process. And the current  text allows the Secretary to hire them at a grade higher than when they  were previously in the department.   So, I asked my colleagues, what about the hardworking, competent  employees who chose not to leave the Department of Veterans Affairs and  who dedicated their lives to serving veterans? Is it fair to them for  former employees to reenter civil service without going through the  competitive selection process and be rewarded with an automatic pay  grade increase?   My amendment supports the retention of a Federal hiring process that  is fair and time-tested.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 23, line 16, strike ``the number of employees who''       and insert the following: ``the total number of employees who       voluntarily separated from the Department and the number and       percentage of whom''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 198, the gentlewoman  from Hawaii (Ms. Hanabusa) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Hawaii.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak on my amendment to ensure  certain types of information are added to the Department of Veterans  Affairs survey data that this bill requires the Department to create  and report to the House and Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs.   This bill instructs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to develop and  carry out a standardized exit survey to be voluntarily completed by  career and noncareer employees and executives of the Department of  Veterans Affairs who voluntarily separate from the Department.   The bill currently requires the Department to report to Congress the  following types of information on an annual basis: first, an analysis  of the most common reasons employees choose to leave; second, steps the  Secretary is taking to improve retention; third, the demographic  characteristics of employees choosing to leave; fourth, the legislative  barriers to improving employee retention; and, fifth, the number of  employees who took the survey.   Mr. Chairman, there is important information missing that must be  gathered by the Department: one, the total number of employees who  voluntarily exited the Department during the reporting period; and,  two, the percentage of those employees who actually responded to the  survey.   Without this critical information, Congress will be unable to assess  the value of the reported data relative to the total number of  employees who departed the Department.   Mr. Chairman, I am asking that we get a full picture, and my  amendment will help us do that.  [[Page H2165]]    I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
