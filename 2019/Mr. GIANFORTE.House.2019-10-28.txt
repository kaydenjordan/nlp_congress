 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Far too many Montanans can't afford the prescription drugs they need.  They shouldn't have to leave the pharmacy counter empty-handed because  costs are too high. Montanans need access to affordable medications,  which is why reducing drug prices is one of my top priorities.   To lower costs, we need more transparency in our healthcare system.  We need to shine a light onto the opaque drug pricing process. Our  commonsense, bipartisan bill before the House today will shine that  much-needed light.   The Payment Commission Data Act gives Congress' nonpartisan think  tanks MedPAC and MACPAC greater access to drug pricing data. Armed with  this data, they can better advise Congress about who is being a bad  actor in the drug supply chain. It will help Congress address  prescription drug prices more effectively.   We all want to ensure the American people can buy more affordable  prescription drugs. I believe the bipartisan approach we have here  should be a working model for how to move forward, not simply ramming  through partisan bills.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this  commonsense reform to lower drug prices.
