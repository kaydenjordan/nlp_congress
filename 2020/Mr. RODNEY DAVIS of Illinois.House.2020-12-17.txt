 Mr. Speaker, I want to remind my  colleagues that, in 1985, the Democrats in this House stole a seat, and  they can do it again.   The day after the election in 1984, Republican Rick McIntyre was  ahead of incumbent Frank McCloskey by 34 votes. After the State's  recount, McIntyre's lead grew to 418 votes. In the weeks following the  election, McIntyre was certified the winner of Indiana's Eighth  Congressional District.   But come January 1985, House Democrats refused to seat the duly- elected Member of Congress, Rick McIntyre. Instead, they sent a  partisan task force to Indiana which then determined ballots not valid  under Indiana law should have been counted. They changed the rules.  Under the Democrats' new rules, McCloskey was now ahead by four votes.   On May 1, 1985, the House voted to seat McCloskey. Ten Democrats  joined every Republican in voting against seating him. This contest was  dubbed the ``Bloody Eighth,'' and my Democrat colleagues are  considering repeating this same battle this year in Iowa's Second  District.   Just as in 1985, they are about to change the rules of the game after  the game has already been played. Democrats have been trying to do this  in States throughout the 2020 cycle.   After a thorough recount of votes in all 24 counties in Iowa's Second  District, Mr. Speaker, and a unanimous bipartisan vote by Iowa's State  Canvassing Board, Congresswoman-elect Dr. Mariannette Miller-Meeks was  declared the winner.   Instead of challenging the certification that Dr. Miller-Meeks now  has in her possession in court, the Democrat candidate has decided to  skip that step and, instead, is going to ask Washington Democrats to  overturn Iowa's voters. And the reason is because she couldn't win in  court.   But if Washington Democrats change the rules, she can. She can  disregard the people of Iowa.   Setting this precedent that you don't have to exhaust all of your  options and prove your case in court, but that whatever party is in  charge of the House can come in, change the rules, and determine the  winner is a terrible precedent to set.   I am hoping that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will  think long and hard if they want a repeat of the Bloody Eighth, because  there will come a time when the shoe is on the other foot.   The Federal contest of 1985 eroded public trust in our elections and  undermined the integrity of our election  [[Page H7240]]  process. I hope my colleagues will come to the same conclusion and  decide to stand by the people of Iowa's Second Congressional District  and seat Congresswoman-elect Mariannette Miller-Meeks on January 3.                         Farewell to Congressman Clay     Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I  didn't congratulate you on leaving this great institution and making  this institution a much better place for you serving with all of us.   I have enjoyed our time together, flying back and forth from our  districts, and I have enjoyed the friendship that you and I have been  able to have over the last 8 years that we have served together.   Mr. Speaker, you have done a great job representing the district in  Missouri right across the river from mine, and our partnership is one  that is bound not just in politics and not just in legislating, but in  friendship. I am going to miss being here with you.   This institution will be a better place, again, because of your  service. We will all be at a loss without being able to go to you and  ask you for your expertise, your guidance, and just having some fun.   I am going miss you, my friend, but our institution's loss is your  personal time and your family's gain, and I look forward to working  with you in whatever the next endeavor is on your horizon. May God  continue to bless you.                            ____________________
