 Mr. Speaker, had I been present for the vote today on  H.R. 4533--To designate the health care system of the Department of  Veterans Affairs in Lexington, Kentucky, as the ``Lexington VA Health  Care System'' and to make certain other designations, (rollcall No.  70), I would have voted ``aye.''   Additionally, had I been present for the vote on H.R. 4979--To extend  the Generalized System of Preference and to make technical changes to  the competitive need limitations provision of the program (rollcall No.  71), I would have voted ``aye.''                            ____________________
