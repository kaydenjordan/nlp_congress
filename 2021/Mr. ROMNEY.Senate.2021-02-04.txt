 Mr. President, we had a vote a moment ago to have 10- minute votes. So far the vote are closer to 30 minutes than 10 minutes.   I ask unanimous consent that the clerk time the votes to 10 minutes;  that we not go beyond 10 minutes; that at the end of 10 minutes, we  give an extra 1 minute of grace time; and that we close the vote after  11 minutes.   (Applause.)    Would the gentleman agree, then, that we take as much  time as it takes to read the names, and if it requires the Vice  President to come here, we give her sufficient time to get here, but,  otherwise, 10 minutes?    That is probably not practical tonight.    Certainly.    Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 803 and ask it  be reported by number.    Mr. President, the most predictable fiscal crisis our  Nation faces is the looming insolvency of our Federal trust funds. That  is why a group of 12 Senators put together an act to enable Congress to  get ahead of this problem before it becomes insoluble.   These colleagues include Democrat Senators Manchin, Warner, Sinema,  King, and Jones.   Last year we introduced this legislation called the TRUST Act to  create three bipartisan, bicameral committees to rescue each of our  major trust funds. This enables Congress to form those committees.   I would note that failure to do so would imperil the solvency of the  Social Security and Medicare trust funds and speed us along the road  even further to crushing national debt.   I am happy to take this amendment by voice vote, but I yield my time  to Senator Angus King.
