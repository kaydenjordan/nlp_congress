 Mr. Speaker, it is ironic  today that we are celebrating the international success and celebration  of women when we are also working to repeal affordable quality health  care for women and families.   I am reminded, in fact, of my own mother, who fought during a time in  the 1960s and 1970s to ensure that my sister, who was very sick and  disabled, would have access to a quality public education and also to  affordable health care. Quite frankly, it was not available. My mother  and father were financially destitute. Today, as a result of trying to  provide that health care, I am my mother's caregiver.   Today, I am reminded of all of the women primarily--49 million of  us--providing more than $500 billion worth of long-term care and  caregiving support to our families, that this is a day to really  celebrate that leadership, that support, and the efforts made by women.  Congress, as a body, should do much, much more to preserve and protect  those rights of women and their families all across America.                            ____________________
