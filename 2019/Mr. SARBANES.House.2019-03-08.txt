 Madam Chair, my colleagues, somewhere in America there  is a family in their living room looking at the television, hearing  another report about how billionaires and super-PACs and insiders and  lobbyists are running Washington and calling the shots on what happens  in their lives.   And they are asking themselves: Do we matter anymore? Do we count?  Will our voice be heard?   H.R. 1 says to that family and millions of families across the  country who feel the same way: We get it. We hear you. We want to  change this place and give you your voice back by restoring ethics and  integrity, by pushing back on the influence of big money in our  politics and by making sure that, when you go to vote, you don't have  to run an obstacle course to the ballot box in America.   That is what we stand for.   Our colleague   John Lewis reminds us all the time that we have to  keep our eyes on the prize. Well, on this day, at this moment, in this  House, the prize is H.R. 1. Let's pass H.R. 1.
