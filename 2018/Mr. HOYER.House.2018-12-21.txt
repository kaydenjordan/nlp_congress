 Mr. Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of the  majority leader the schedule to come.   Mr. Speaker, let me just preface it: I know all of our Members are  concerned. I know the majority leader, having spoken to him, is very  concerned about what we are doing and when we are doing it. Members,  obviously, Christmas is coming, and they want to know what they can do.  I am pleased that the majority leader agreed to have this colloquy to  give us a sense of the schedule as he sees it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy),  my friend, the majority leader.    Mr. Speaker, the majority leader agreed to have a colloquy  on the schedule. He has given us the schedule.   Obviously, there are still a lot of questions, but I understand, and  I appreciate the majority leader bringing us as much up to date as he  can.   Will the flood vote later this afternoon or this evening be the last  vote that the gentleman would perceive?    I think the Senate vote is still open. Is that accurate?    Well, I hope that can happen. We certainly, on this side-- I am sure on your side--hope that can happen as well so that we can get  home to our families and celebrate Christmas.   The gentleman does not expect any further votes after the flood vote;  is that correct?    I understand the angst continues. We all have that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
