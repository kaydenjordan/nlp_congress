 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the CARES  Act, even though it doesn't protect everyone I wish it would, including  all immigrants.   However, it represents a bold, unprecedented step in protecting  workers and bolstering our healthcare system and in stabilizing our  economy, especially our small businesses.   That is why I will vote ``aye.''
