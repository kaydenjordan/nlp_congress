 Mr. President, what is the order right now? It is my  understanding, I say to my good friend from Illinois, that I was to be  speaking and alternating back and forth. Is that correct?    Mr. President, I ask that I be recognized for 10 minutes.    Let me ask my friend how long he would be, if I defer to  him at this point.    All right, I am going to defer to the Senator for 10  minutes.   I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of his remarks, I be  recognized for such time as I may consume.    Mr. President, amid all the unfounded, uncorroborated  accusations and attacks on a fine jurist, I think it is important for  us to remember that other things are happening here at the same time.  For one thing, I will only make one comment about the comments of the  previous speaker; that is, the program that is somewhat accurately  described actually started not in the Trump administration but in the  Obama administration.  [[Page S6462]]                                FAA Reauthorization Act    Mr. President, what I want to say is that something really  significant is about to happen; that is, something we have been waiting  for for a long time. If you are not on the Commerce Committee, you are  not dealing with this issue--actually, there are three committees  dealing with it--and you wouldn't be aware of how significant the vote  coming up really is.   We are going to be voting to reauthorize the FAA. This is something  we have been trying to do now for many years. This is actually a 5-year  reauthorization. That is significant. The last time we did a 5-year  reauthorization of the FAA was in the 1980s. It is a huge win, not just  for the obvious good things that are going on and what we need to be  doing to update the system we are working with, but if you single out  general aviation and pilots, it is a big, major deal.   The legislation makes needed investments in our Nation's airport  infrastructure and supports the general aviation community. It improves  commercial service for the flying public and streamlines the FAA  regulatory process, eliminating a lot of the redtape that goes along  with any bureaucracy. It enhances aviation security and promotes  responsible and safe integration for drones in our national airspace.   As an active pilot, I am especially pleased that many pilot  protections I have fought for are in this bill. In fact, I am very  proud that I actually introduced in committee and was able to get in  the bill six of my amendments that I know are very significant, and  they mostly address general aviation. It is going to have more  transparency in communicating with the FAA.   We have heard the stories about some of the FAA enforcement  proceedings. That is common to a lot of bureaucracies. It strengthens  one area: the notice to airmen. That is called NOTAM. NOTAMs are  notifications to people who are pilots to let them know if they are  going to land on a runway and if there is a problem on the runway and  it is under construction or something like that. It came from a  personal experience I had when I landed on one where there was work.  But there were no NOTAMs. So there was no way of warning people.   I remember that I said: Well, where are the NOTAMs, if you say there  are NOTAMs?   They said: Well, that is for you to find out.   This changes all of that. We have the NOTAM reform that is in there.  It includes the Volunteer Pilot Protection Act. That is like the Good  Samaritan act. I remember that about 30 years ago, when I was mayor of  Tulsa at that time, on the island of Dominica--not to be confused with  the Dominican Republic--there was a radio conveyor that reached the  entire Central America and a lot of South America, and it was wiped out  by a hurricane.   I remember getting 12 pilots together and 12 aircraft together and  going to take medical supplies and take food and all of these things to  that island. I actually had to fly through a hurricane to get down  there. There were four people who were going to go and did not go  because they might incur some kind of liability or they might do  something on the way that would create that problem.   The Good Samaritan law that is in this bill is something we have been  working on for a long period of time and will allow people not to be  punished for their generosity, which has been the case before. The bill  directs the FAA to update regulations and policies related to this  selection and training and designation of pilot examiners.   There is a big problem. I experienced this personally just about 3  months ago. They are called DPE, or designated pilot examiners. There  are not enough of them around. What we did with this bill was to add a  new form of inspecting pilots that is going to allow one examiner to do  twice as many pilots. Here it is in this bill.   Without the proper examiners, the commercial pilots are prevented  from obtaining the recurring qualifications, and flight schools are  prevented from graduating students. There is a problem right now in the  numbers of people who are out there who have passed and want to take  examinations and are not able to do that. It also addresses the problem  of contract towers. Contract towers are mostly towers you see around  the country. The largest ones are called FAA towers. However, some of  them are contract towers, so they are contracting with the private  sector. Well, this is good. They do a good job. I would just suggest,  though, that if we had not allowed for these contract towers, we  wouldn't have, in my State of Oklahoma, some seven towers that would be  out there. Two of those contract towers are in the cities of Stillwater  and Norman, OK. Well, Stillwater happens to be the home of Oklahoma  State University, and Norman is the home of Oklahoma University.    I suggest to you, Mr. Chairman, on game day, if you are in there,  going in with sometimes up to a thousand aircraft, and if you don't  have a tower there, how is that going to work? Well, that is a  recognition that that is a problem which needs to be dealt with, and  that is in this bill. It also affects a lot of the airports that are  adjacent to military bases.   It updates the FAA's dated benefit process, ensuring that communities  invest resources without unnecessary paperwork.   The FAA reauthorization unlocks the economic growth potential of  aviation it provides to local communities. We have in Oklahoma--not far  from Tulsa, actually--a very small community called Bristow, and  Bristow had two large industries that wanted to move in there and were  not able to do it and were making a decision to go not to another  community in Oklahoma but to another State. It wasn't as far as Alaska;  it was not too far away from Oklahoma. So what we were able to do was  leverage the State funding to put in these improvements to the airport.  I was there during the dedication. Those two very large industries are  moving in. People don't realize what an airport means to a local  community in rural America. So this has provisions in there that will  allow that to take place.   There is another one I want to mention. If you are in a general  aviation airport environment--now, that is not like DFW or Dulles or  one of those; it is the smaller ones. In the Chair's State of Alaska,  that is about all they have up there. If you are in that type of an  environment, if you get Federal funds--and they all get Federal funds-- if you don't use those in a general aviation airport, they  automatically, under current law, go to DFW or one of the giant  airports. Under this, it is guaranteed that they will go to another  general aviation airport, which is a huge win.   Our Nation's aviation industry is facing a dire shortage of pilots.  We have language in here that is going to be helpful. We all know about  the problem--particularly those of us who are serving on the Senate  Armed Services Committee--about the pilot shortage we have. We have  some 2,000 pilots right now who are actually fighter pilots, but we  have a shortage of pilots.   One of the problems is that during the 8 years of the Obama  administration, in the process of starving the military, they were not  allowing their pilots in the Navy and the Air Force to fly more than 12  hours a month. This was something that can't be done, and consequently  they were in the position of not being able to have them--well, in this  bill, we are starting out and actually have language in a pilot program  to allow students in high school to go through ground school, to get  people interested in aviation. All that is in this bill. The programs-- there is a wide array of public and private sector stakeholders  dedicated to furthering aviation and an accessible future career path  for pilots.   I applaud the reforms in the FAA's process for certifying aircraft  and aircraft products.   One of the problems we have had out there is that people are  building--I am talking about major builders or experimental builders-- aircraft and then not being able to get them certified because of the  long certification process. We have shortcut that and have the same  amount of requirements in this bill, but we will be able to almost  double the number of certifications.   So that is happening right now. I thank Senator Thune and Senator  Nelson and the committee for acknowledging that we finally have to do  it. For 10 years now, I have been sitting around waiting for a  reauthorization  [[Page S6463]]  bill and have been talking to people about the consequences. Now,  finally, after about 30 years, we have a reauthorization bill that is a  5-year bill. We are going to be voting on it shortly. It is going to be  a great improvement.   So other things are happening here. We are passing things. We are  being productive. We will continue to do so as soon as this fiasco is  over, the challenges to our fine Justice Kavanaugh.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
