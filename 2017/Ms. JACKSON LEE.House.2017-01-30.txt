 Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Veasey) and the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett)  for their continuing leadership on a very important and needed response  to the actions of many, in particular, this new administration.   My time is short, so I want to thank Mr. Veasey for his leadership on  the challenge to the voter ID law and, as well, his continuing  leadership on the empowerment of voters, as well to Ms. Plaskett for  ensuring and fighting for the right to vote for the Virgin Islands.                                time  2000    I stand with both of them. But I come today to plead and also to  enunciate what crisis we find ourselves in. The White House is in  crisis. When the White House is in crisis, that means America is in  crisis.   Mr. Speaker, it is not a frivolous statement that I make; it is a  truthful statement because less than 72 hours ago, without the counsel  of many experts, Members of Congress who are on the jurisdictional  committees, without the notice and input of the Secretary of Homeland  Security, an executive order was produced by one young staffer in the  White House and another individual who has pushed an agenda of  exclusiveness. That is not the way to run this country.   So this executive order came out, and what we find is that 67,000  refugees are stranded around the world who actually had documents, who  were vetted, and, as some stories have told us, waited 10 and 12 to 13  years to be able to get in line and to be vetted to come to the United  States of America. The tragedy is that some of them were, in fact, our  friends from Iraq who have stood by our military personnel who had, in  fact, provided them the interpretation that they needed to save their  lives. In one story we heard tonight on the steps of the United States  Supreme Court was a woman who finally got here with her two children.  Her husband was murdered, and her father was tortured.   So, to Mr. Trump, today I think it is important as we have joined in  to repeal and to rescind this unconstitutional order, it is clear that  you need to read the writing on the wall. The Deputy Attorney General,  duly appointed and confirmed, of the U.S. Department of Justice, the  remaining individual who has power in that office, has made a very  conscious decision that they cannot defend this order because it is  unconstitutional. This is not a person who takes her task lightly. This  is not someone who is not an officer who has not taken an oath of  office. This is akin to what happened in the Nixon administration. They  were willing to lose their position to stand for the Constitution.   So the Congressional Black Caucus is on the floor today with our  chairman, Mr. Richmond, to be able to inform America that this is  patently unconstitutional. It does not provide for due process. It did  not provide for equal protection of the law. As well, it is a blatant  attack on freedom of religion.   For those of you who need a better explanation, let me tell you what  a ban on Muslims is. A ban on Muslims is one country, two countries,  seven countries, and the idea of who cannot come in are Muslims--that  is a ban on Muslims. It is not a ban on Christians. It is not a ban on  any other faith. It is a ban on Muslims, and the White House needs to  understand what an interpretation of that means.   Further, let me say, as I come to a close, please do not try to cover  yourself with the announcement that was made by President Obama. As a  member of the Homeland Security Committee, I am well aware of that  announcement that he had regarding a number of countries. It was not a  ban. It was to take note that those countries were in conflict and that  individuals who were coming from those countries specifically needed to  have a higher level of scrutiny. It was not a ban. It is well  documented that the tragedies that we have had from Boston to Orlando  to San Bernardino were not individuals who came through as refugees or  came from those particular countries.   What are we doing here? We are blatantly violating the Constitution.  When the President of the United States violates the Constitution, this  body has to stand up and respond. So I would ask this body to direct  the President to rescind. In the alternative, I would ask that the  legislation that is being introduced call upon the President to repeal  this.   In all fairness, I would appreciate if the President took it up on  his own to suspend this order that is impacting so many who are being  left along the highway of despair, people who are able to--if you will,  people and individuals who are able to seek refuge here are now being  left.   I believe that the Congressional Black Caucus--the conscience of the  Congress--stands now, tonight, to seek to ban the Muslim ban, to seek  to stop the suppression of voting, and to also say to the nominee for  the Attorney General: Are you prepared to represent all of us and to be  able to support the institution, or reinstitution, of section 5 of the  Voting Rights Act?
