 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary life  and legacy of Mrs. Romay Catherine Johnson Davis, who was awarded the  Congressional Gold Medal for her extraordinary service to our Nation as  one of the women of the ``Six Triple Eight'' postal battalion during  World War II.   At the age of 102, Mrs. Davis is the oldest living member of the  6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion of the United States Army.  Throughout World War II, this dedicated group of African-American women  sorted mail and care packages to maintain the morale of American  soldiers stationed abroad.   Helping to sort 65,000 pieces of mail every shift, Mrs. Davis and her  colleagues worked tirelessly to uphold the battalion's motto: ``No  mail, low morale.''   Mrs. Davis is a trailblazer for African-American women everywhere,  and it is befitting that her award comes on the 74th anniversary of the  integration of the armed services.   I was proud to vote in favor of the bill to award the Six Triple  Eight postal battalion to receive the Congressional Gold Medal, the  highest civilian honor Congress can bestow.   I ask my colleagues to join me and the Montgomery community in  celebrating the extraordinary life and legacy of Mrs. Romay Catherine  Johnson Davis.                            ____________________
