 Mr. President, as I said yesterday, the Senate has  more work ahead this legislative period, including passing the FDA user  fees legislation and confirming a number of nominees.   We have made important progress already, and just last night we  passed the critical Veterans Choice legislation. That bill, which is  now on its way to the President's desk, will allow many veterans to  bypass long wait and travel times at VA facilities by accessing private  care.   We also confirmed several nominees. We confirmed eight officials who  will be critical to advancing administration policy in the Defense  Department. It is a good start, but we have other nominees to confirm  for many other positions, both security- and nonsecurity-related,  across many different agencies and departments. In the national  security realm, for instance, we must confirm nominees for the  Department of Homeland Security, Department of State, and the  intelligence community.   The Senate also came together to confirm a well-qualified judicial  nominee for the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, as well as the  Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Christopher A. Wray.  The position of FBI Director is one of great importance when it comes  to protecting the American people, especially at a time when we face a  range of threats both at home and abroad. Wray's impressive  credentials, demeanor, and commitment to the rule of law make clear  that he is the right person to lead the Bureau in its efforts to keep  our communities safe. The work of an FBI Director is difficult, but I  am confident that Wray is capable of shouldering this important  responsibility and that he will lead the FBI with the strength and  professionalism that the position demands.   Our work on nominees continues today. We will, for instance, take a  procedural vote on the nomination for the National Labor Relations  Board later this morning. But there is more to do. I was pleased to  hear the Democratic leader reaffirm his interest in working with us now  to clear more nominees before the conclusion of this work period. Many  of these nominees have been held up far too long, leaving the  administration without a number of key officials at various agencies.   I look forward to our Democratic colleagues working with us to finish  up the FDA user fees legislation that I mentioned earlier, as well.  Members will continue to work on other issues in the meantime, such as  tax reform, which is one of the things the Senate--led by the Finance  Committee--will turn its collective attention toward after the State  work period.  [[Page S4698]]                                ____________________     Mr. President, during the 8 years of the Obama  administration, our economy failed to live up to its full potential-- meager growth rates, wages that failed to keep pace, and a decline in  opportunities. Middle-class families were hurting, and they needed  policies that would allow the economy to begin to grow again.  Unfortunately, the last administration often gave them exactly the  opposite. Some were sins of commission, such as making things worse  with an aggressive regulatory rampage. Others were sins of omission,  such as failing to address an outdated tax code that has made American  companies increasingly uncompetitive in a global economy and, as a  result, has moved investment and jobs offshore.   Then, in November Americans chose to go in a different direction.  They elected a pro-growth President who would sign legislation from a  pro-growth Congress. Ever since, we have been working to turn the tide  back in favor of the middle class. We have undertaken what has been  described as the ``most ambitious regulatory rollbacks since Reagan.''  We have pursued policies that can once again encourage job growth and  American investment.   Just last week, the administration and congressional leaders and,  most importantly, the chairmen of the Senate Finance and the House Ways  and Means Committees issued a joint statement outlining shared  principles for unleashing the American economy through comprehensive  tax reform. Comprehensive tax reform represents the single most  important action we can take now to grow the economy and to help  middle-class families finally get ahead. It is no secret that the  current Tax Code is overly complex and highly punitive and makes it  harder for individuals and small businesses to succeed.   Fortunately, we now have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to  fundamentally rethink it. It has been over three decades since that  last happened. In the years since, the international economy has grown  much more competitive. American workers and American businesses have  only found it harder to keep up with foreign contenders. Put simply,  the rest of the world is running circles around us in this area, making  it more difficult for American firms to hire, invest, and compete.   The time has come to fix this so we can help our economy grow and  help the individuals and families we represent realize their true  potential. For families, we want to make their taxes simpler, fairer,  and lower. For small businesses, we want to provide the conditions they  need to form, invest, and grow. For all American businesses and their  employees, we want to ensure they have the best chance to compete with  foreign companies and succeed. We want a tax system that encourages  American companies to bring jobs home again.   These are some of the key goals of tax reform. They sound like goals  we should all share, regardless of party. For years, the tax-writing  committees have focused on this particular subject--holding hearings,  soliciting input from stakeholders, and considering the views and  priorities of Members, both on and off these committees. They are eager  now to begin the process of developing tax reform legislation that  achieves the shared goals I outlined above.   The administration and congressional leaders stated:         We have always been in agreement that tax relief for       American families should be at the heart of our plan. . . .       And we are now confident that . . . there is a viable       approach for ensuring a level playing field between American       and foreign companies and workers, while protecting American       jobs and the U.S. tax base.    Our expectation is for this legislation to move through the  committees this fall under regular order, followed by consideration on  both the House and Senate floors. There is a great deal of bipartisan  consensus about what ails our Tax Code, and my hope is that our friends  on the other side of the aisle will join us in a serious way to address  it, because the American people deserve a tax system that works for  them instead of against them. They deserve a tax code that encourages  companies to bring jobs home instead of encouraging just the opposite.  Americans deserve true comprehensive tax reform.   I appreciate the good work of our colleagues in the administration  and by Members in both Chambers already to get us there, particularly  Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch. Chairman Hatch has been working  hard with his fellow Finance Committee members--Senators from both  sides of the aisle--literally for years, on this issue, and he  continues to lead the way today. Under his leadership and the  leadership of Chairman Brady in the House, Congress's tax-writing  committees will advance these principles through regular order, so that  Members on both sides of the aisle will have an opportunity to  participate in this historic effort, if that is what they choose to do.   This will not be an easy process, but the people we represent are  depending on us for help. Now is the time to deliver tax reform, and I  look forward to working with my colleagues to accomplish it.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that all  postcloture time on the Kaplan nomination expire at 5 p.m. today; that  if the nomination is confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table; that the President be immediately  notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative  session and be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted  to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and that following my remarks the Senate  resume executive session as under the previous order.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 168, S. 829.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  committee-reported substitute amendment be considered and agreed to,  the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time and passed, and  the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 191, S. 81.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered  read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that applicable  committees be discharged and the Senate proceed to the immediate  consideration of the following resolutions en bloc: S. Res. 199, S.  Res. 225, S. Res. 227, and S. Res. 238.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolutions be agreed to, the preambles be  [[Page S4716]]  agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table, all en bloc.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Veterans' Affairs be discharged from further consideration  of S. 1282 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the Democratic  Leader, I send to the desk a resolution authorizing testimony,  production of documents, and representation by the Senate Legal  Counsel, and ask for its immediate consideration.   Mr. President, this resolution concerns the case pending in the  United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against  Senator Robert Menendez. Both the Department of Justice and Senator  Menendez are expected to seek trial testimony from Members and Senate  staff.   This resolution would authorize Senate individuals called to appear  to testify and produce documents in this case and related proceedings,  except concerning matters for which a privilege is asserted. It would  also authorize the Senate Legal Counsel to represent individuals called  to testify at trial as fact witnesses regarding their performance of  official Senate responsibilities.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 11:45  a.m. on Thursday, August 3, the Senate proceed to executive session for  consideration of Calendar No. 103, the nomination of the Deputy  Secretary at the Department of Energy. I further ask that there be 15  minutes of debate on the nomination equally divided in the usual form,  and that following the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote on  confirmation with no intervening action or debate, and that, if  confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action.

There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:40 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, August 3, 2017, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
