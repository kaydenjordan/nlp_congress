 Madam Speaker, for decades, my island, my home, St.  Croix, was the home of the largest refinery in the Western Hemisphere,  an identity that largely shaped our economic makeup to the detriment,  in some instances, of historic industries such as agriculture or at the  detriment of our environment but provided thousands of jobs throughout  the years to our residents. The recent failure of the refinery to  restart successfully has been a disappointment to many, but in there  lies a unique opportunity before us.   With the rapid changes taking place in our climate and the urgency  that the Biden administration has placed on environmental reform and  the much-needed transition to green energy and renewables, we have an  opportunity to reimagine how the south shore of St. Croix can be  redeveloped.   The green energy initiatives and the focus on historically  disadvantaged communities contained in the Inflation Reduction Act,  along with the incentives and funding included in the bipartisan  infrastructure law, are not only timely but critical for us as a  territory.   I ask my colleagues, I ask Virgin Islanders, I ask our Governor and  our elected officials to all join in reimagining and getting to work on  redefining what we look like.                            ____________________
