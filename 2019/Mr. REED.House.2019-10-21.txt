 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor Bill Winkky, who  recently celebrated his 80th birthday.   Bill Winkky, son of Mary Emma and Robert Winkky, was born in  Kingston, New York, on September 29, 1939. In his 80 years of life, he  has been a mentor, a friend, a father, a husband, and an all-around  good man who deserves to be recognized.   In 1963, Bill married Charlotte Sommerfield and has remained by her  side for the past 56 years. Bill has such dedication to his wife and  his family that it is heartwarming to see. Yet his family is not the  only thing he has been dedicated to over the years.   He was a teacher, dedicating 32\1/2\ years to educating and enriching  the lives of the youth he taught. He also coached several sports,  including football, wrestling, swimming, and track. The hours he spent  dedicated to young people were well spent, and he had a profound impact  on his students.   Bill also dedicated time to serving the people as the town of Veteran  supervisor for 10 years, and he continues to hold this role now.   It is not often you have the pleasure of meeting a man as dedicated  to helping others as Bill Winkky. He is a pillar in the community who  has given so much of himself to our youth through his coaching and  teaching tenure. He continues to do a great deal as the town of Veteran  supervisor.   I am honored to know him, and I am equally honored to celebrate his  achievements and his legacy of hard work, compassion, and community- mindedness here today.   Mr. Speaker, given the above, I ask this legislative body to pause in  its deliberations and join me to honor Bill Winkky on his 80th  birthday.   Godspeed, Bill, and God bless.                            ____________________
