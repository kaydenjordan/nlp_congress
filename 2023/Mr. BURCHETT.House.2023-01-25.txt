 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor Colonel Jason M. Brock  who served 32 years in the Tennessee Air National Guard.   Colonel Brock began his military career as an enlisted member in 1991  and worked hard during his service to earn a bachelor of science degree  from the University of Tennessee in 1994.   In 1998, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant. Since then,  Colonel Brock has served in a variety of assignments as a logistics  readiness officer and a maintenance officer, and has deployed numerous  times in support of multiple operations including Enduring Freedom,  Iraqi Freedom, Southern and Northern Watch, Joint Guard, and Noble  Eagle.   During his assignment as director of staff for the State of Tennessee  Air, he also supported many domestic operations, including Tennessee's  military response to the COVID-19 pandemic.   Colonel Brock plans to retire this year, and it is a well-earned  retirement, Madam Speaker. He plans to spend more time with his wife  and his two sons on family outings to the lake and camping. He also has  his private pilot license, and he looks forward to enjoying more time  in the sky.   Our country's heroes are the men and women of our armed services,  like Colonel Brock, who served and sacrificed for our freedom. It is my  honor to recognize Colonel Jason Brock as the Tennessee Second  District's January 2023 Veteran of the Month.                                  Midway IGA     Madam Speaker, I rise to congratulate Joe and Dale  Longmire on selling Midway IGA and retiring from the grocery business.   Claude and Ruby Longmire started Longmire Grocery in Corryton in  1947. They raised Joe and Dale in the grocery business, and they worked  very hard in this their entire lives.   In 1988, Madam Speaker, Joe and Dale bought the Midway IGA right  there on Tazewell Pike, as you well know.   Joe and Dale say the community has been very good to the Longmires,  and the Midway IGA has been very good to the community. They have been  great friends of mine. When you go in there, Madam Speaker, local kids  work there. They work the counters and they work everywhere. They have  some of the best fried chicken--I believe it is actually called  broasted fried chicken--that I have ever had, except, of course, what  my wife and my sweet mama used to make.   Of course, my family and I trade at the IGA on a regular basis, and  the Longmires supported me when I first ran for mayor. They were some  of the first people who came out and supported me. They had a  fundraiser for me at their house. They live on Emory Road, the same  road I live on now. Emory Road is a very long road, Madam Speaker. I  actually went to the wrong end of Emory Road, and I was 1 hour late to  my own fundraiser; but it just increased the anticipation of my  arrival.   The Longmire brothers have said that nothing about the store will  change, which I am very glad to hear. Midway IGA has been great to our  community, and I hope we don't lose that.   I wish their sister, Leesa, the best as she sticks around the store  as their scanning manager. I wish Joe and his wonderful wife, Becky-- who has been a dear friend to me and my girls a long time--and Dale and  his wife, Ellen, the best in their retirement.   Joe plans to finish a book he has been researching about the history  of Corryton. I look forward to getting an autographed copy which I am  sure I will pay dearly for.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Velazquez--I  believe I got that right; I have been working on it for about 5 years-- it is a pleasure being here with you all.   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the great work you do. There is nobody, I  think, better at the helm of the Small Business Committee than somebody  who has actually taken a business and made it into something. That is  very American and very cool, and I thank you for your friendship to me  and my family.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 449, the Microloan  Transparency and Accountability Act of 2023.   The Small Business Administration's microloan program helps America's  entrepreneurs access capital to help their small businesses grow.                                time  1330    These loans are usually around $13,000; $13,000, the difference  between them making it or not. That kind of money would go a long way  for a lot of our mom-and-pop stores in the rural areas of East  Tennessee that I am proud to represent, and in our inner cities, as  well.   Unfortunately, the microloan program has a low participation rate,  Mr. Speaker, among our rural businesses. My bill would increase  transparency by requiring the Small Business Administration to report  data about the program to Congress. This will help us better understand  how the program is operating and what we can do to improve it.   Government programs that support small businesses shouldn't be full  of waste, and they shouldn't neglect businesses simply because of their  ZIP Code.   My bill will increase transparency and establish accountability at  the Small Business Administration to ensure it is working on behalf the  small businesses everywhere.   I thank my colleagues, especially my sponsor across the aisle who has  been my friend for a few years here, for their support on this  bipartisan, commonsense bill which passed the House in the 116th and  117th Congresses, and I look forward to seeing the Microloan  Transparency and Accountability Act pass the House again today.   I also look forward to the Senate doing their work and taking this  up, Mr. Speaker.
