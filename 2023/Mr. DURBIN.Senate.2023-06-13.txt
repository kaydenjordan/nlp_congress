 Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm  Judge Hernan Vera to the U.S. District Court for the Central District  of California. With his years of experience defending equal justice  under law, Judge Vera will make an excellent addition to the Federal  bench. He received a B.A. from Stanford University and a J.D. from the  UCLA School of Law before clerking for Judge Consuelo B. Marshall on  the Central District of California. Following his clerkship, Judge Vera  entered private practice and focused on complex business disputes with  an emphasis on commercial civil litigation and intellectual property  issues. He then spent 12 years working for Public Counsel, the Nation's  largest pro bono law firm, and eventually became the firm's CEO. During  his time with Public Counsel, he exclusively represented low-income  clients and litigated hundreds of matters involving consumer fraud,  housing, employment, and other civil rights issues.   In 2020, Judge Vera was appointed to the Los Angeles Superior Court.  Since his appointment to the bench, he has presided over more than 200  cases that have gone to verdict or judgment, including cases involving  juvenile dependency issues and allegations of child abuse and neglect.   Judge Vera has extensive litigation experience and a proven track  record of independent decisionmaking on the bench. And having dedicated  such a significant portion of his career to pro bono work, he will  bring a unique perspective to the Central District of California.   The American Bar Association unanimously rated Judge Vera ``well  qualified'' for the Federal bench, and he has the strong support of his  home State Senators: Mrs. Feinstein and Mr. Padilla.   I urge my colleagues to support his nomination.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  [[Page S2063]]  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I would like to congratulate the  Northwestern Wildcats for winning this year's National Collegiate  Athletics Association--NCAA--Division I Women's Lacrosse Championship.  This historic victory marks the team's first national title since 2012,  nearly a decade in the making.   Clinching a championship comes down to a series of moments: split- second decisions during showdowns on the field, putting in extra  sprints after practice, and taking time to strategize after a close  loss. For the Northwestern women's lacrosse team, this year's victory  can be traced back to one moment in 2002. That was the year  Northwestern started its varsity women's lacrosse program with Coach  Kelly Amonte Hiller at the helm, a role she still holds to this day. A  lacrosse legend in her own right, Coach Amonte Hiller has cultivated a  culture of excellence at Northwestern.   During her first year, Coach Amonte Hiller built an impressive team,  recruiting players from across the country and adding students from  around campus. Two players on the inaugural team had never even played  lacrosse. Nonetheless, Coach Amonte Hiller saw something in the young  team--and her instincts were right: The players, who began as freshmen,  went on to finish the 2005 season 21-0. It was the first time the  Wildcats were crowned national champions, but not the last. And with  their victory in 2005, Northwestern became the first non-Eastern Time  Zone school--male or female--to win an NCAA national championship in  lacrosse. In every season that followed, Coach Amonte Hiller led the  Wildcats to the NCAA finals--and secured the championship eight times.   Throughout her tenure, Coach Amonte Hiller has been applauded for her  recruitment efforts--searching for players across the country and  shaking up the model for what collegiate lacrosse teams traditionally  have looked like. While lacrosse was invented by Native Americans,  collegiate teams have been predominantly White, with the majority of  recruits coming from the East Coast. Instead of limiting her recruiting  efforts to this area of the country, Coach Amonte Hiller has sought to  discover talent from all over. In fact, one member of the Wildcats was  inspired to play at Northwestern as a young athlete, after watching a  fellow Black player and Texas native, who Coach Amonte Hiller had  recruited, compete in the NCAA finals. And in 2011, ``ESPN The  Magazine'' named Coach Amonte Hiller one of the 20 best recruiters  across all college sports, joining the ranks of other NCAA championship  winning coaches.   Resilience can be defined as believing in the possibility of success  and remaining determined to overcome any challenge. And the Wildcats  rise to this year's NCAA national championship was a masterclass in  resilience. Last season, after a bitter loss that knocked Northwestern  out of the semifinals, alongside season-long injuries that kept key  players on the sidelines, the Wildcats dusted themselves off and  committed themselves to bringing home a national title. Several players  even made the decision to stay on campus and play in their fifth year  of eligibility as graduate students, which meant putting their  postgraduation plans on hold. And it was a sacrifice worth making.   The Wildcats never shied away from a challenge, and the team filled  their schedule with tough, matchups. They opened the 2023 season with a  game against a top-ranked team, which they lost by a single point. It  was the Wildcats' first and final loss of the season, and they began a  21-game winning streak.   In the championship game, the Wildcats faced Boston College. With  vital contributions from both freshman players and graduate students  alike, the depth of the Wildcats' bench was on full display. They  finished the game with a 12-point lead. And as a result, for the first  time in 11 years, the Northwestern Wildcats claimed the national title.   The continued success of this program has inspired young athletes  throughout the region. The expansion of lacrosse to other colleges and  westward, along with the rise in demand for youth lacrosse in Illinois,  is a testament to the excitement Northwestern has helped generate.  Since that fateful moment in 2002, when Amonte Hiller took the reins as  coach, Northwestern has emerged as a powerhouse in women's lacrosse.   I would like to congratulate every member of the Northwestern  Wildcats women's lacrosse team, and especially Coach Kelly Amonte  Hiller for her years of leadership. This year's national championship  will be Amonte Hiller's eighth national title, matching Navy coach,  Cindy Timchal, for the most won championships in women's college  lacrosse history.   Coach Kelly Amonte Hiller and her team represent the best of  Illinois. I hope their resilience, dedication, and commitment will  continue to serve as an inspiration for young athletes across the  country for years to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the en bloc consideration of the following Senate  resolutions: S.
