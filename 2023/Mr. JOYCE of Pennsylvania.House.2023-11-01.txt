 Mr. Speaker, at the Constitutional  Convention in my home State in Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, Benjamin  Franklin called upon his fellow delegates to begin each day in prayer.  He said: I know that my redeemer lives. And if a sparrow cannot fall  without His notice, surely a nation cannot rise without His aid.   Since coming to Congress, Speaker Mike Johnson has embodied Benjamin  Franklin's words, turning to prayer and to faith in God as he serves in  the U.S. Congress.   Since first being elected, Speaker Johnson has been a tireless  champion for conservative values, fighting for life, protecting our  Constitution, and standing for the rule of law.   Now, as we move forward, it is clear that Speaker Johnson is the  right choice to lead the House of Representatives at this critical  time.   In the days before he was elected as Speaker, I had the opportunity  to talk with Speaker Johnson about the challenges that we face in  Pennsylvania. We discussed the fentanyl poisonings that have become the  leading cause of death for young Americans. We discussed how energy  prices are soaring and how families are worried about how they are  going to be able to afford gas and food for their families. We  discussed how so many Pennsylvanians are feeling the effects of  President Biden's failed leadership. As we confront these issues,  Speaker Johnson is ready to lead.   Together, let's work to defend our allies from Hamas terrorism, let's  address the skyrocketing inflation that we face, and let's pass a  budget that is worthy of the American people.                    Returning to the Energy Under Our Feet     Mr. Speaker, as the leaves begin to fall  from the trees, American families, businesses, and churches are  confronted once again with the soaring prices of energy that will make  it difficult to heat their homes, their businesses, and their places of  worship this winter.   Instead of addressing this crisis and opening new oil and natural gas  leases, which would help to address OPEC's cuts to oil production,  President Biden has chosen to cut permits, create new bureaucracy, and  enact policies that will only drive energy costs higher.   Simply, this is unacceptable. By working to impose Green New Deal tax  incentives, the President has chosen to put his wealthy donors ahead of  Pennsylvania families.   With energy prices now costing Americans over $3,000 more each year  than when Joe Biden took office, it is clear that the President's  failed policies are to blame for the skyrocketing price of gas, oil,  and electricity.   It is time to rein in these runaway prices by returning to the energy  that is underneath the feet of the constituents in central and western  Pennsylvania.                            ____________________
