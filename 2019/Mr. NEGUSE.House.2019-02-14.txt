 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 8.   I serve on the House Judiciary Committee. Last night, after 10 hours  of debate, our committee passed this bill to be brought to the floor,  and it is vital that we pass it.   In Colorado and across our country, we have experienced undue  devastation by countless tragedies of gun violence--Columbine, Aurora.   Mothers, sisters, brothers, husbands, wives, and young children have  been lost at the hands of gun violence.   One year ago today, 17 lives were taken in 6 minutes and 20 seconds  in Parkland, Florida.   There is no question we need to address the epidemic of gun violence  in our country. We cannot sit idly by. Universal background checks are  overwhelmingly supported by the American people, and 20 States,  including my home State of Colorado, have either wholly or partially  closed the background check loophole.   Americans understand what it takes to keep our communities safe from  gun violence, and it is time for Congress to act as well.    So, Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say, simply: Enough is enough. We  must act on gun violence. We must pass H.R. 8 here on the floor.                            ____________________
