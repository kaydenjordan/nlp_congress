 Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to rise today in support of H.R. 2339, the  Reversing the Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act.   This bill would ban menthol products which are primarily used because  of decades of predatory advertising by tobacco companies in the African  American community and on the African American community, particularly,  Madam Speaker, African American males, the so-called Kool generation,  spelled with a K and not a C.   Smoking cigarettes, especially menthol-flavored cigarettes, has  resulted in approximately 45,000 African American deaths each and every  year. Lung cancer, COPD, and heart disease are the leading preventable  causes of death for African Americans. Smoking menthol-flavored  cigarettes is the primary culprit.   Earlier this week, Madam Speaker, I wrote an op-ed with Nancy Brown,  the CEO of the American Heart Association, on the importance of this  bill and the ban on menthol flavoring for our kids' health. I am  pleased to report that our op-ed was published in The Hill on last  Wednesday.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record my op-ed.                       [From The Hill, Feb. 26, 2020]                No Exceptions When It Comes To Kids' Health               (By Rep. Bobby L. Rush (D-IL) and Nancy Brown)         Imagine a world in which our children are not using tobacco       or addicted to nicotine--a world in which tobacco products       that appeal to youth cannot be sold, the tobacco industry is       prohibited from preying upon youth with their deceptive       marketing, and tobacco no longer represents a grave health       threat to children.        With tobacco and nicotine use among youth at epidemic       levels in this country, we must address this public health       crisis. The House of Representatives has an historic       opportunity to do just that this week by passing the       Reversing the Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act, a bill that takes       bold action to remove all flavored e-cigarettes and other       tobacco products, including menthol, from the market.        Until recently, the goal of a tobacco- and nicotine-free       generation seemed within reach. Youth smoking rates, which       were at 28 percent in 1997, fell to just 5 percent in 2018.       But this hard-fought public health success against youth       tobacco use is threatened by the skyrocketing popularity of       e-cigarettes. More than 1 in 4 high-school students and more       than 5 million youth nationwide now report using e-      cigarettes, which pose serious health risks to users and       could increase the likelihood of traditional cigarette use.       An American Heart Association study released last year found       that kids who use e-cigarettes are more likely to start       smoking traditional cigarettes.        The reasons for this surge in youth e-cigarette use is       clear. Tobacco companies introduced thousands of products       with fruit, candy, mint, and menthol flavors specifically       intended to appeal to youth. The companies then designed       sophisticated and well-funded marketing campaigns that       relentlessly target youth on social media. While the Trump       administration pledged last fall to halt the sale of all       flavored e-cigarettes, the policy it released last month fell       far short of that goal. Urgent action is still needed to stem       the youth e-cigarette epidemic given menthol products,       disposable e-cigarettes, and flavored liquid nicotine used in       open tank systems are being allowed to remain on the market.        Congress took an important first step in December by       raising the national minimum legal sales age for tobacco       products from 18 to 21. But we know that just raising the       sales age for these products is not enough to counteract the       actions of an industry intent on addicting another generation       of youth. The industry has known for decades that cigarettes       and other tobacco products flavored with menthol are less       harsh and more appealing to users--especially youth smokers.       Tobacco companies have been especially aggressive with retail       advertising and price promotions for menthol products in       minority communities. As a result, more than 70 percent of       adolescent African-American smokers and more than half of       adolescent Latino smokers use menthol.        Where existing policies have fallen short, the Reversing       the Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act will fill the gaps. The       bipartisan legislation, first introduced by Reps. Frank       Pallone (D-N.J.) and Donna Shalala (D-Fla.), will remove all       flavored tobacco products from the market within a year and       subject all tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, to the       same advertising restrictions that currently apply to       cigarettes. It will also require e-cigarette companies to       stop selling any flavored product without pre-market       authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)       within 30 days. Additionally, the bill directs the FDA to       prohibit online sales of most tobacco products, cutting off a       way many youth access these products.        We are at a pivotal moment in the fight to protect our       children from tobacco-caused addiction and disease. We urge       lawmakers to listen to and stand with parents and health       advocates to support this important legislation.     Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in  supporting this very, very worthwhile legislation.
