 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a true warrior from  my district, Grandmaster Kevin Thompson. Grandmaster Thompson was a son  of Newark and a world-famous martial artist.   He was a lightweight fighter at 155 pounds who defeated many  heavyweight challengers.   In his time, he won more than 100 trophies at world championships in  three disciplines: weapons, forms, and fighting.   Today, he is in the Black Belt Hall of Fame alongside noted martial  artists Bruce Lee and Chuck Norris. Through his skill, he earned the  rank of grandmaster, a rare honor for his achievements and  contributions to the sport.   Grandmaster Kevin Thompson's bravery and courage helped him battle  Lou Gehrig's disease until his passing on January 8, but that will not  dim the bright legacy he left in the world of martial arts and in our  Newark community.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank our majority leader for those kind  words. I also thank Joint Economic Committee Vice Chairman Beyer,  Budget Committee Chairman Yarmuth, and Ways and Means Committee  Chairman Neal for organizing this Special Order hour.   It is important to discuss the state of our economy because it is a  case of true contrast. Trump's economic decisions have created two very  distinct Americas.   There is the one America for the affluent where incomes are rising  and taxes are dropping. There is the other America, the one reserved  for minorities and low-income Americans, the one for middle Americans,  the one that is losing manufacturing jobs to automation and cheap,  foreign labor, the one that forces people to turn to minimum wage jobs  as careers.   President Obama worked to unite these two Americas. Trump has worked  very hard to divide them, once again.   As President, Trump is known for two major business moves. First, he  passed his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, but his law did not give the  vast majority of Americans tax cuts. It actually cut their tax  deductions. He did not improve their ability to get new jobs. He made  it more difficult.   He has taken away benefits that low- and middle-income American  families took for granted. He took away their ability to deduct moving  expenses when they had to find a better job and support their families.  He took away their ability to deduct alimony, which could lead to more  deadbeat dads. He even forced average Americans to declare more of  their income, costing them more money in taxes. And while you cannot  deduct your moving expenses, millionaires can deduct the entire cost of  a private plane.   Then, Trump chose to impose tariffs on Chinese goods. Economic  advisers said the move would hurt our country before Trump did it, and  they were right. A Federal Reserve study published last December said  that tariffs have caused Americans to lose critical manufacturing jobs  and raised the costs of goods for consumers.   Manufacturing jobs have helped millions of Americans get out of  poverty, and that opportunity wanes today. They have allowed older  generations to pay the college tuitions of younger generations. They  have been critical for minorities to grab a piece of the American  Dream.   President Trump likes to point to his work around minorities  participating in the job sector, but where I come from in north New  Jersey, we do not see it. Where I come from in my district, we do not  see it.   It is a situation of two Americas, once again, one for the haves and  the other for the have-nots. The majority of the people under this  President have not.
