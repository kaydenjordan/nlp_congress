 Madam Speaker, I rise on behalf of the people of my  district, California's central coast, who are worried about healthcare  and the high cost of prescription drugs.   Earlier this month at home, I spoke with people at retirement  communities, town halls, and at their doorsteps delivering food for  Meals on Wheels. Throughout these conversations, one thing was made  clear: We need to lower the cost of prescription drugs.   I am proud the House passed H.R. 987 to strengthen health protections  and bring down drug costs. I am excited that we are looking ahead to do  more to ensure people never have to choose between lifesaving medicine  and putting food on the table.   That is why I cosponsored H.R. 3, the Lower Drug Costs Now Act. When  we give the power to Medicare to negotiate prices directly with drug  companies and make these lower prices available to everyone, we all  win.   H.R. 3 gives power back to the patients. It is what people in my  district are working for, and I am proud to support it.                            ____________________
