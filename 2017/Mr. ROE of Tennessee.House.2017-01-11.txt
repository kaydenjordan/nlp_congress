 Mr. Speaker, I stand here in the well of the  House tonight remembering 8 years ago when I stood here. I am the only  one, other than Pete Olson, that was here that has spoken tonight.   I actually left my medical practice of 31 years. I have been a  physician--it is hard to believe--46 years. I ran for Congress because  I wanted to be involved in the healthcare debate. I realize that the  American people needed healthcare reform.   One of the most disappointing things I have had since I have been in  the U.S. Congress was, when I showed up here, I naively thought that  people cared what I thought. I found out I was wrong about that.   We had nine physicians in the Doctors Caucus on the Republican side  in 2009, and not one of us was asked one thing about that healthcare  bill. Not one Republican amendment to that bill that would have made it  better was ruled in order.   So it was passed on one-party rule, and now the Democrat party owns  it. Unfortunately, patients own it. And that is what I came here to do,  was to try to help people.   I had spent 31 years of my life in the small town of Johnson City,  Tennessee, practicing medicine and trying to do a good job for patients  that I saw every single day.   You have heard it many times before: If you liked your doctor, you  can keep it. We are going to reduce your premiums by $2,500.   The President also said that I will go over this bill line by line  with anyone who wants to. We asked to do that on multiple occasions,  and I am still waiting for my cell phone to ring.   So we have heard over and over and over again that the Republicans  have no ideas. Two Congresses ago we were challenged and asked to write  a Republican alternative to the Affordable Care Act, and we did just  that.   I want to show you out there tonight--those of you who are watching-- this is the bill right here. It is a 184-page bill. You can read it in  an hour or so or less than that.   I read the entire Affordable Care Act. I felt like I should. I didn't  pass it and see what was in it. I actually read it ahead of time.   We had healthcare reform in Tennessee in the nineties called  TennCare. I wrote the epitaph on this bill with Marsha Blackburn in  2010, if anyone is interested in reading that.    So what did we do with this bill?   With the Affordable Care Act, the Federal Government said: You will  purchase 10 essential health benefits or your insurance is no good. You  have to get rid of it.   And this 10 essential health benefits cost, in many cases, is a lot  of money.   Then what do we do?   We passed a tax, a mandate, a fine, a penalty, whatever Judge Roberts  decided he wanted to decide that it was, or define it, I should say.  But here we are passing a mandate for people to purchase something they  can't afford. I find that astonishing that you tax people for something  they cannot buy.   So what our bill did was repeal the Affordable Care Act. It then  massively expanded health savings accounts. Look, there are Indian  tribes out there that use the Indian Health Service that can't have an  HSA. There are disabled veterans that can't have an HSA. There are  retired people that can't have HSAs. We expanded that. I have used them  in my own practice for patients. I use one myself.   We used high-risk pools, and we expanded ERISA benefits to help  offset preexisting conditions. Quite frankly, I think in two paragraphs  I could have done two-thirds of what the Affordable Care Act did, which  is expand Medicaid, which is a system that needs to be reformed, and  allowed 26-year-olds to stay on their parents healthcare plan.                                time  2000    We also allow you to buy across State lines with association health  plans, malpractice reforms, and transparency. It is a very simple,  patient-centered bill. We have said this before, our bill is open for  amendment. If a Democrat has a good idea, I am open to listen to it.  The main thing is I want patients and doctors to be in charge of their  healthcare decisions.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to be here tonight, and I  look forward to going into much more detail about the details of this  particular bill.
