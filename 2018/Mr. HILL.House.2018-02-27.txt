 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 5078) to amend the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974  to modify requirements related to mortgage disclosures, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5078         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``TRID Improvement Act of       2018''.       SEC. 2. AMENDMENTS TO MORTGAGE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS.         Section 4(a) of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act       of 1974 (12 U.S.C. 2603(a)) is amended--        (1) by striking ``itemize all charges'' and inserting       ``itemize all actual charges'';        (2) by striking ``and all charges imposed upon the seller       in connection with the settlement and'' and inserting ``and       the seller in connection with the settlement. Such forms'';       and        (3) by inserting after ``or both.'' the following new       sentence: ``Charges for any title insurance premium disclosed       on such forms shall be equal to the amount charged for each       individual title insurance policy, subject to any discounts       as required by State regulation or the title company rate       filings.''.       SEC. 3. POSITIVE CREDIT REPORTING PERMITTED.         (a) In General.--Section 623 of the Fair Credit Reporting       Act (15 U.S.C. 1681s-2) is amended by adding at the end the       following new subsection:        ``(f) Full-File Credit Reporting.--        ``(1) In general.--Subject to the limitation in paragraph       (2) and notwithstanding any other provision of law, a person       or the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may furnish       to a consumer reporting agency information relating to the       performance of a consumer in making payments--        ``(A) under a lease agreement with respect to a dwelling,       including such a lease in which the Department of Housing and       Urban Development provides subsidized payments for occupancy       in a dwelling; or        ``(B) pursuant to a contract for a utility or       telecommunications service.        ``(2) Limitation.--Information about a consumer's usage of       any utility services provided by a utility or       telecommunication firm may be furnished to a consumer       reporting agency only to the extent that such information       relates to payment by the consumer for the services of such       utility or telecommunication service or other terms of the       provision of the services to the consumer, including any       deposit, discount, or conditions for interruption or       termination of the services.        ``(3) Payment plan.--An energy utility firm may not report       payment information to a consumer reporting agency with       respect to an outstanding balance of a consumer as late if--        ``(A) the energy utility firm and the consumer have entered       into a payment plan (including a deferred payment agreement,       an arrearage management program, or a debt forgiveness       program) with respect to such outstanding balance; and        ``(B) the consumer is meeting the obligations of the       payment plan, as determined by the energy utility firm.        ``(4) Definitions.--In this subsection, the following       definitions shall apply:        ``(A) Energy utility firm.--The term `energy utility firm'       means an entity that provides gas or electric utility       services to the public.        ``(B) Utility or telecommunication firm.--The term `utility       or telecommunication firm' means an entity that provides       utility services to the public through pipe, wire, landline,       wireless, cable, or other connected facilities, or radio,       electronic, or similar transmission (including the extension       of such facilities).''.

(c) GAO Study and Report.--Not later than 2 years after the       date of the enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of       the United States shall submit to Congress a report on the       impact of furnishing information pursuant to subsection (f)       of section 623 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C.       1681s-2) (as added by this Act) on consumers.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I will yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in favor of my bill, H.R. 5078, the TRID  Improvement Act. This important package will cut through the red tape  and level the playing field for making sure that regulations are  smarter, fairer, clearer, and more efficient, while, at the same time,  ensure that consumers and investors are protected.   You know, Mr. Speaker, when the CFPB, the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau, was first initiated as a part of the Dodd-Frank Act,  one of now-Senator Elizabeth Warren's goals was simpler regulation,  that we would streamline regulation, that we would take bulky complex  consumer forms and make them simpler. And the TILA-RESPA, truth-in- lending form and the real estate settlement form, were examples in  those early days that they were going to make these forms simpler and  easier for consumers.   Well, that is what we are talking about today, Mr. Speaker, for it  did not become simpler and easier. It became costly, complex, and  difficult for consumers.   Today, we are back on the floor on this issue. It is not a new issue  or a new concern because the confusion related to TRID has been  apparent for years.   In November 2013, the CFPB finalized TRID, combining, as I said, the  truth-in-lending form with the real estate settlement procedures form  necessary for consumers in this country to close a home loan to have  that American Dream. The effective date for this final rule was  originally set for mortgage applications received on or after August 1,  2015, but due to the administrative errors of the CFPB, the agency  delayed it until October 3, 2015.   In October, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 3192, the  Homebuyers Assistance Act, which I proudly sponsored, and it passed  with a bipartisan vote in this House of 303-121. It would have provided  a hold-harmless period for those trying to make a good faith effort to  comply with this complex rule.   In April 2016, with complaints pouring in from both homeowners,  homebuyers, consumers, bankers, title companies, the CFPB decided to  reopen the rulemaking on TILA-RESPA and the TRID rule. The CFPB issued  a final rule clarifying and amending certain mortgage disclosure  provisions.   So as you can hear from this long story, Mr. Speaker, this rule is  complex. So we are here today to try to fix a part of it, a small part  of it that will make it easier, better, and more clearer for consumers.   The American Bankers Association stated that if there was one thing  to fix about the current regulatory system, it would be the TILA-RESPA  Integrated Disclosure rule, TRID--not qualified mortgage definitions,  not the Volcker rule, the TRID rule. Mortgage lenders have seen  regulatory change around every aspect of their lending for the last 8  years, and this rule is no exception.   Today, Mr. Speaker, over in the House Small Business Committee, the  GAO testified. They have issued a report about the TILA-RESPA  Integrated Disclosure rule. They told the committee today that this  rule was one of the most expensive facing community banking across the  country, the most burdensome.   So here, the TILA-RESPA rule before our House Small Business  Committee says that we are burdening community banks, and they, in  turn, are not able to do the kind of work that we want, that we expect  for our homebuyers of homes across this country.   CFPB Associate Director David Silberman said the Bureau agreed with  the GAO's recommendation, that it assessed the effectiveness of the  TRID  [[Page H1307]]  guidance and that it intended to ask the public for input on ways to  improve regulatory guidance.   Well, Mr. Speaker, I am glad to have this report from the GAO, but we  have been calling for this for almost 2\1/2\ years that we want this  rule made simpler and more direct and better for our consumers.   H.R. 5078 fixes the title insurance disclosures so that consumers  actually know what their expenses are going to be for title insurance.  And despite our best efforts, the CFPB has been unwilling to fix this  problem on its own; so today, Congress comes to act.   The other aspect of this bill--and I want to thank my good friend  from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison) and my good friend from North Carolina  (Mr. Pittenger) for the second portion of this bill, the Credit Access  and Inclusion Act of 2017.   The Credit Access and Inclusion Act amends the Fair Credit Reporting  Act to allow the reporting of certain positive consumer credit  information for consumer reporting agencies. Specifically, a person or  the Department of Housing and Urban Development might report  information related to a consumer's performance in making payments  either under a lease arrangement for a dwelling or pursuant to a  contract providing utility or telecommunication services. This kind of  positive reporting on a consumer's ability to make their payments on  time will help more families in our country build a credit record.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Minnesota for his work  on this bill and providing the chance to build a credit file for those  who really need it.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Pittenger), my friend, who, this week, I know, is  having a touching time with his almost five decades of friendship with  Reverend Billy Graham--we all salute their work together for the  betterment of our world--and who is the vice chairman of the Financial  Services Subcommittee on Terrorism and Illicit Finance.    Mr. Speaker, I again thank Mr. Pittenger and Mr. Ellison  for their work on this measure, and for all of my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle who have brought these bills to the floor and,  particularly, for speaking out for consumers on bills that will help  consumers have more access to credit, whether it is a mortgage and a  speedier, easier, more transparent mortgage closing or the chance to  build credit, with the work from my friend from Minnesota and my friend  from North Carolina.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back  the balance of my time.  [[Page H1308]]
