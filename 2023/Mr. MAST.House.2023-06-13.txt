 Mr. Chair, I thank my friend for yielding me the time. I am  not going to need 2 minutes. You can calculate for that right now.   I am just going give a quick warning. With this administration, it is  always an example of getting the camel's nose under the tent.   We are dealing with gas stoves today, and here is my prediction  today: Give it a couple months, and they are going to be coming after  everybody's backyard grills. They are going to be coming after your  Fourth of July. They are going to be coming after you saying: Well,  this is what it does if you go out there and you put burgers and dogs  on your gas grill in your backyard on Memorial Day and Labor Day and  Fourth of July. That is my prediction today.   Mr. Chair, that is really all the time I needed to say that this is  how this administration is constantly working against the American  people, and I expect this to be no different.                                time  1630
