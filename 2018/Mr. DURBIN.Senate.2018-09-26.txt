 Mr. President, Saturday, August 25, 2018, marked 1 year  since the brutal attacks in Burma that sent more than 700,000 Rohingya  fleeing for their lives to Bangladesh.   Horrific stories were reported, including mass murder, rape, babies  being thrown into fires, and entire villages razed to the ground at the  hands of Burmese military officials. In Bangladesh, these desperate  refugees joined hundreds of thousands of others who fled in waves of  previous violence.   The Rohingya sadly have a long history of being discriminated against  and even violently attacked in Burma. In fact, UN Secretary General  Antonio Gutteres said recently of the Rohingya, ``there is no  population in the world that I have seen more discrimination against.''  While we have seen changes in Burma recently, the horrible treatment of  ethnic minorities such as the Rohingya has continued.   Saturday, August 25, 2018, is also the day we lost our Senate  colleague, the great patriot, John McCain.   John McCain and I historically partnered with Senators Feinstein and  McConnell to renew sanctions against Burma until it released Aung San  Suu Kyi and moved toward democracy. More recently, John McCain was the  sponsor of bipartisan Senate legislation that would narrowly sanction  those Burmese military officials response for the violence against the  Rohingya. I was proud to join him in that effort. The bill has nearly  two dozen cosponsors, Members from across the country and the political  spectrum. We all recognize as John McCain did that, despite the  historic changes in Burma, we must not allow the Burmese military to  continue to act with impunity.   We appreciate the efforts of our administration--humanitarian aid,  sanctions on a few security officials and units, interviewing refugees  and documenting crimes--but it is not enough, especially as Burmese  officials continue to deny that any crimes took place and ignore calls  of safe and voluntary repatriation and accountability. There are even  reports that the Burmese military continues to bulldoze and overtake  former Rohingya villages, as well as engage in attacks in Shan and  Kachin State against other ethnic minorities.  [[Page S6336]]    It is no wonder that the UN's Independent International Fact-Finding  Mission on Myanmar reported recently that the Burmese military acted  with ``genocidal intent''--genocide, not a term taken lightly and not a  term applied often. This comes on the heels of reports by others, such  as Fortify Rights, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch.  Presented by the UN's Human Rights Council, the latest report is the  result of interviews with nearly 900 witnesses, and it calls for the  international community to act.   Our State Department has similarly reported that the Burmese  military's operations against the Rohingya were ``well-planned and  coordinated,'' although I am disappointed that the Department stopped  short of making a legal determination on the crimes.   Senator McConnell continues to block any action on the late John  McCain's bipartisan legislation.   A year after the latest wave of violence, report after damning report  documents the Burmese military's scorched-earth tactics. The  international community calls for immediate action: accountability,  humanitarian relief, conducive conditions in Burma for safe and  voluntary repatriation.   Congress has its hands tied by the majority leader.   Like Senator McConnell, I have also been a big fan of Aung San Suu  Kyi and had high hopes for her, and I recognize the near impossible  position she is in with the Burmese military, but her blindness to the  suffering of her own people, not to mention her defense of the absurd  jailing of the two Reuters reporters, troubles me deeply. That is not  the Aung San Suu Kyi that John McCain called his ``personal hero.''   John McCain's bill is about ensuring that we hold the Burmese  military accountable for its operations. I hope the majority leader  will finally recognize that and allow this bipartisan bill to move.                            ____________________
