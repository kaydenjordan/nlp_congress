 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R.  3375, the Stopping Bad Robocalls Act. These unwanted and annoying  robocalls, which are increasing at an alarming rate, need to end.   I am very pleased that the House has set aside partisan differences  and worked together on legislation to benefit all Americans and address  this serious issue.   This important legislation would require service providers to  implement new technology that ensures caller ID is authenticated and  establishes additional protections for consumers receiving unwanted and  sometimes fraudulent--robocalls.   I am also pleased that H.R. 3375 includes legislation that I  sponsored with my colleague, Representative Butterfield, which would  require the FCC to publish an annual report on the private-led efforts  to trace the origin of unlawful robocalls, an important step in  stopping these bad actors from reaching consumers.   This kind of illegal, annoying, and harassing activity must stop, and  I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.                                time  1445
