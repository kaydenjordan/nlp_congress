 Madam Speaker, it is hard to believe there is anything  else going on here with 3,000 people a day streaming across our  southern border, but we are taking time to put together our budget for  the next fiscal year. And in light of the fact that we recently cleared  $28 trillion in debt, it is important to look at how frugal we are  going into next year.   If you look, Labor HHS, which is a significant part of the budget, is  going up 36 percent; Interior and the Environment going up 19 percent;  Transportation and HUD up 13 percent; individual smaller lines even  more. The White House is taking this opportunity to increase its  spending by 39 percent; the Vice President by 22 percent; the EPA is  going up 23 percent. This is just plain fiscally out of control.   Meanwhile, the only area of the budget that probably should go up,  Homeland Security, which guards our border, is not going up at all. In  any event, I hope the press has some time to put some of those numbers  out there so the public can see that the fiscal incompetence of this  House continues on.                            ____________________
