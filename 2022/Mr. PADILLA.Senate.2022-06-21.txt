 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today, I am proud to celebrate two  district judges joining the Federal bench for the State of California.   We are scheduled to vote shortly on the confirmation of Judge Ana de  Alba, who is nominated to become a judge for the Eastern District of  California.   Judge de Alba brings a lifelong commitment to advancing justice in  California's Central Valley. The daughter of immigrants from Mexico,  she was born in Merced, CA, and grew up in a family of farmworkers.   Judge de Alba watched her mother and her grandmother struggle with  unfair treatment, as they worked together in some of the hardest jobs  in the world.   She decided at a young age that one day--one day--she would become a  lawyer to help families like her own.   Judge de Alba is a first-generation high school graduate. She went on  to earn her bachelor's degree and her J.D. from UC Berkeley. And after  graduating, she built a successful career in private practice in the  Central Valley, and she realized her childhood dream of service by  establishing a Workers' Rights Clinic for low-wage workers to learn  their rights and to seek legal advice.   In 2018, based on her extensive legal experience and proven  commitment to the public good, Judge de Alba was appointed by then- Governor Brown to serve as a superior court judge for Fresno County.   Judge de Alba is a dedicated, fair, and universally respected public  servant, respected by her colleagues.   I also want to note that if confirmed, Judge de Alba will be the  first Latina to sit on the Eastern District bench. She will bring a  deep knowledge of the Central Valley and a passion for equal justice,  informed and inspired by her own family's story.   So I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting Judge de Alba's  confirmation today.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would also like to take this moment to  celebrate the confirmation last month of Judge Robert Huie, now serving  in the Southern District of California.   Judge Huie is a resident of San Diego, where he has lived and worked  for nearly 20 years, but his roots in California, in fact, began  generations ago. His grandfather immigrated to San Francisco from China  in the 1930s, making his home there until joining the U.S. Army.   Judge Huie is a talented lawyer who has continually sought out  opportunities to promote justice.   He earned his undergraduate degree from Calvin College and his J.D.  from Yale Law School. His career includes 12 years of service as an  assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of California.   During that time, he investigated and prosecuted more than 600  district court cases and two dozen appeals on matters ranging from  public corruption to securities fraud, to bank robberies.   And at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Judge Huie took the  initiative to create a districtwide working group that combated  pandemic-related fraud.   Judge Huie's commitment to service, his strong work ethic, and his  insightful legal thinking will benefit the community of the Southern  District.   Mr. President, as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I am  proud of the work that we continue to do to confirm outstanding,  effective, and diverse judges across the Federal court system. That is  especially important in places like the Southern District and Eastern  District of California--two of the busiest Federal judicial districts  in the entire country. As we confirm more nominees like Judge de Alba  and Judge Huie, we are building a Federal court system that can better  deliver on the promise of equal justice for all.   I yield the floor.    I ask unanimous consent that the order with respect to  Judge de Alba's nomination be executed at 5:30 p.m. today; further,  that if the nomination is confirmed, the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table and the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.
