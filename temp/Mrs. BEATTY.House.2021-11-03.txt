 On behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus and the  millions of Black voters, I rise today in support of H.R. 4, the John  R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.   Today, we step into history as we tread the same path taken 56 years  ago when President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into  law, calling that day ``a triumph for freedom as huge as any victory  that has ever been won on any battlefield.''   We have not come this far to turn the clock back, nor shall we let  the sacrifices of Fannie Lou Hamer, Martin Luther King, and countless  others who marched, fought, disrupted, and lost their lives for the  right to vote, be in vain.  [[Page H6130]]    Therefore, I ask all of my colleagues to support H.R. 4, the John R.  Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.   As our friend and brother, the late John Lewis, said so well: ``The  time is right. The time is now.''   Our Power, Our Message.                            ____________________
