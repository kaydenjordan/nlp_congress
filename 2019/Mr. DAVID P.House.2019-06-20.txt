 ROE of Tennessee asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute.)    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to once again  rise  [[Page H4929]]  to join in commemorating June 20, 2019, as American Eagle Day and to  celebrate the recovery and restoration of the bald eagle, the national  symbol of the United States.   On June 20, 1782, the eagle was designated as the national emblem of  the United States by the Founding Fathers at the Second Continental  Congress.   The bald eagle is the central image of the Great Seal of the United  States and is displayed in the official seal of many branches and  departments of the Federal Government.   The bald eagle is an inspiring symbol of the spirit of freedom and  democracy of the United States. Since the founding of the Nation, the  image, meaning, and symbolism of the eagle has played a significant  role in art, music, history, commerce, literature, architecture, and  culture of the United States. The bald eagle's habitat only exists in  North America.   Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me in celebrating June  20, 2019, as American Eagle Day, which marks the recovery and  restoration of the bald eagle.                            ____________________
