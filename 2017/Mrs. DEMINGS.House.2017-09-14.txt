 Madam Speaker, I spent 27 years as a law enforcement  officer. I had the honor of working my way up through the ranks to  become the chief of police. I co-chaired an antigang task force for the  State of Florida. As chief, I launched an all-out war against violent  crime. Through the hard work of a lot of good men and women, we were  able to reduce violent crime by 40 percent.   Do I take gang activity very seriously? You better believe I do. I  have the record to prove that.   The spirit of H.R. 3697, with this broad, new definition of what  constitutes a gang, has nothing, based on my experience on the ground,  to do with curtailing gang activity.   As a former law enforcement officer who has been there on the front  lines, there is no way I would vote for this law. This law targets a  group of people based on their status and does not target criminal  activity. That is what law enforcement officers do.   We all take gang activity seriously. I heard the question earlier:  Who would favor gangs? Who really would favor gangs?   I invite my colleagues on the other side to join me in continuing our  aggressive efforts to target criminal behavior, because that is really  what we want to stop--criminal behavior--and not profile or target  people. That is just not who we are.
