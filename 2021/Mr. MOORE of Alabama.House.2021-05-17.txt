 Madam Speaker, today I rise and I am proud that  two of my bills, the Colonel John McHugh Tuition Fairness for Survivors  Act, and the Overseeing the GI Act of 2021, were included in the GI  bill.   Members of our military and their families have sacrificed so much in  their service to our country. As a grateful Nation, we have a  responsibility to take care of our heroes and their families. My bill,  the Colonel John McHugh Tuition Fairness for Survivors Act, secures in- State tuition benefits for the survivors and dependents for eligible  veterans under the Dependent Educational Assistance program.    This bill is named after the U.S. Army Colonel John McHugh, who was  tragically killed in 2010 in Afghanistan by a roadside bomb. His family  currently resides in my district. Like many Americans, Colonel McHugh  dreamed of building a bigger and better life for his family, and we owe  it to them, and the millions of families like the McHughs, to help them  realize this dream.   The second bill, the Overseeing the GI Bill Act of 2021, provides  much-needed oversight for the VA's digital GI Bill project by requiring  the VA to submit a series of base-level reports to ensure the VA is on  track.   These reports will provide Congress with the critical information  needed to perform proper oversight over these IT upgrades and ensure  that they are using taxpayer dollars efficiently and effectively. These  bipartisan developments bring us closer to securing long overdue  support for our veterans and their families, and I appreciate my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle for lending their support to take  care of our veterans and their families.   Madam Speaker, I appreciate and thank Chairman Takano and Ranking  Member Bost for their leadership.
