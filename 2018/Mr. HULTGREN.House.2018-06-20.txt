 Mr. Speaker, I rise on World Refugee Day to draw  attention to the plight of the Rohingya people in Myanmar.   Since October 2016, the Burmese military has targeted the Rohingya  people with what the State Department has described as ethnic  cleansing. Through interviews in refugee camps and other fact-finding  missions, the U.N. Office of High Commissioner for Human Rights and  multiple NGOs have documented a systematic campaign of mass rape,  extrajudicial killings of young babies and children, brutal beatings,  burning of entire villages, and other serious human rights violations.   Mr. Speaker, 7,000 Rohingya were killed in the first month of the  violence, while an estimated 700,000 have fled to Bangladesh. At the  Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, we have worked to bring attention  to the sickening discrimination and mistreatment of the Rohingya.   The oncoming monsoon season in Bangladesh will cause more  difficulties for the Rohingya refugees. Congress must hold the Burmese  military accountable for their actions and provide the necessary aid  needed to meet this crisis.                            ____________________
