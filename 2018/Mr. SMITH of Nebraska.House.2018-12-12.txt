 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong  support for this farm bill conference report. Given the ongoing  challenges in the agriculture economy, it is very important our  producers have policy certainty as they make their spring planting  decisions.   I held a series of listening sessions around Nebraska's Third  District, our Nation's number one producing district for agriculture,  last year to hear producers' thoughts about the farm bill. The number  one item on producers' minds was the continuation of strong crop  insurance. This bill accomplishes this objective.   The bill also recognizes the challenges and threats facing our  livestock producers by creating a disease prevention program and  vaccine bank to help contain the potential future outbreak of disease  within the livestock industry across our country.   This bill, and continued positive progress on trade, will go a long  way toward increasing producers' peace of mind. I encourage my  colleagues to join me in supporting this important piece of  legislation, and I appreciate the support of the administration in  bringing this legislation to a successful conclusion.
