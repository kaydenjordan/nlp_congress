 Madam President, back in 2007 and 2008, a group of us  who had never run for Congress or for the Senate jumped into campaigns  against incumbent Members of this body, hoping to fight for a vision of  government of, by, and for the people. Al Franken was one of those  individuals taking on an incumbent, Republican Norm Coleman, and as I  heard Senator Franken on the campaign trail, I heard what we heard  today in his speech: a willingness to fight for that vision so embodied  in our Constitution of government that would provide a foundation for  families to thrive, that would lift everyone up; not a government of,  by, and for the privileged; not a government of, by, and for the  powerful.   It takes a lot of guts to throw yourself into the political world,  but because he did and because he won that campaign, we were able to  advance a number of policies.   I shared with Al the experience not only of running against an  incumbent Republican but not having results on election night. However,  I only had to wait 2 days; I didn't have to wait the many months that  he did to come and be part of this body.   Because he came, we were able to pass the Affordable Care Act. My  home State of Oregon went from 15 percent uninsured to 5 percent  uninsured. Hundreds of thousands of people gained access to healthcare  through the expansion of Medicaid and through the healthcare exchange  made affordable by the tax credits provided by that bill. In that bill,  we were able to provide free preventive healthcare practices. We all  know that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and we  embodied that in the healthcare bill. In that bill, we fought for folks  to be able to stay on their parents' policies until age 26. In that  bill, we fought to say that if someone had a preexisting condition,  they wouldn't have to pay any more than anyone else would, creating  healthcare opportunities for millions of people who thought they would  never have a chance to have an insurance policy again.   Al Franken threw himself into public life, and he made that happen  not just for the folks back home in Minnesota but for people across  this entire Nation.   Another such battle was the Dodd-Frank battle, and again I doubt we  would have been able to win that battle without his coming to share in  that effort. I think about the fact that we had seen so many millions  of families devastated by predatory mortgages with exploding interest  rates--interest rates that, upon presentation, started at 3 percent or  4 percent but 2 years later would jump to 9 or 10 percent, and a family  would end up in foreclosure. The fact is we had Wall Street writing  securities based on those mortgages, which then disintegrated in 2007,  2008 and caused people not to just lose their homes but to also lose  their jobs, to lose their retirement, and to be incredibly devastated  and see their whole lifetime's work to become financially stable  evaporate, destroyed, exploded. That CFPB portion, or Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau portion, has given us ongoing efforts to  take on predatory mortgages and that enables financial instruments to  be a foundation for families to thrive and to have home ownership be  the dream of home ownership and not the nightmare of home ownership.  This, again, is an example of a bill passed because Al Franken threw  himself into that battle, and there are many more on this list.    I was particularly appreciative of his support for the Employment  Non-Discrimination Act. Senator Kennedy, as he was in declining health,  had asked me to take on and carry the torch for that bill, which was a  huge honor to me as an incoming freshman. I felt he was on my shoulder  every day saying: Why haven't you gotten it done yet? In 2013, we  finally got it on the floor. I had been pushing hard for leadership to  get it on the floor, and we got it on the floor. I thought: What if we  lose this bill fighting for equality and to end discrimination in  employment? But because Al was here helping in that fight, we won that  bill. We did not win it in the House because the House didn't put it on  the floor of the House. So it is unfinished business--fighting for  equality of opportunity, that vision in our Constitution.   As we heard today, as we heard Al in his campaign in 2008, as we  heard Al on the floor today, and we have heard of this fight for a  country of, by, and for the people, I know that we are going to hear  his voice in that fight for many years to come.   I thank Senator Franken for being willing to put himself in the  public world, for being willing to fight here on the floor of the  Senate for bill after bill after bill that made life better for  Americans and for the many battles he will be in in the years to come.  Thank you.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   Mr. BLUNT addressed the Chair.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his suggestion?    Yes.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.  [[Page S8202]]                                ____________________
