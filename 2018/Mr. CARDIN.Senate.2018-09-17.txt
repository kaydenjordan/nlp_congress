 Mr. President, shortly we are going to have an  opportunity to vote on the Opioid Crisis Response Act of 2018, which I  strongly support. But I want to share with my colleagues a roundtable  discussion I held in Baltimore just a few hours ago. In an area of  Cherry Hill, I met with leading experts in regard to the opioid crisis.  We had leadership from Baltimore city, Baltimore County, Anne Arundel  County, representatives from the State, and a lot of different other  organizations.   It started with Dr. Jason Kletter, who is the president of BayMark,  giving us a tour of the new facility that he opened up in Cherry Hill.  This is a wonderful new facility for opioid addiction. It uses  medicines in order to control a person's addiction, and it is a state- of-the-art facility. It was just opened last month--or 2 months ago--so  it is a brandnew facility.   I asked Dr. Kletter exactly how he was able to do this. The first  thing he mentioned to me was the importance of the Affordable Care Act.  Because of the expansion of Medicaid and the coverage for addiction and  the coverage of essential health benefits within the Affordable Care  Act, the clinic can get a lot more reimbursement for the people who use  the facilities, giving them the wherewithal to be able to construct a  new facility in the community, giving access to care for those who have  addiction.   We then heard from Jose Rodriguez, who is the Baltimore City Health  Department's director of opioid overdose prevention, and he told us  about a lot of the innovative programs we are looking at in Baltimore  in order to provide treatment to opioid-addicted individuals.   One of the innovations that Mayor Pugh of Baltimore wants is known as  a stabilization center. A stabilization center would be 24/7, which is  critically important. People who are stressed normally are not during  normal business hours, and it is important to have availability in the  inconvenient hours of the early morning. An emergency room provides  that access, but the problem is that emergency rooms--many--are not  capable of handling people who have OD'd, and that individual could  become very disruptive within the emergency room setting, making it  difficult for the hospital to provide adequate care for the other  patients.   So the mayor of Baltimore wants to establish a stabilization center,  which would be 24/7 and available to handle people who have drug  problems when they need it and provide the necessary services not only  to save their life, but to put them on a track to deal with their  addiction needs.   We are very proud of the leadership in Baltimore city to move forward  on this, and I wanted to share with my colleagues some of the  innovative programs that are being suggested.   Linda Bryan is the Baltimore County program manager for recovery- oriented systems of care. She was telling us about a program in  Baltimore County where they use peer coaches or a peer support system,  people who have gone through the addiction recovery process. They train  them under this program, help them to go out and coach those who are  suffering from addiction, so they not only get treatment, but they stay  in treatment, and they have a road to recovery. It is an innovative  program that is working well in Baltimore County.   We then heard from Jen Corbin, who is the program director for the  Anne Arundel County crisis response team. Here we have an innovative  program known as safe stations, and let me explain this. This is 24/7  also. I have already told you the need for 24/7 programs. What the  leadership at Anne Arundel County--and this is a county that borders  Baltimore and borders Annapolis; Annapolis is part of Anne Arundel  County, so it is an urban area, but it has some rural aspects to it.  They allow every one of their fire stations--every single one in their  county--to be accessible 24/7 for any individual who is stressed and  needs help with regard to their drug problems.   When they set this program up, which was less than a year ago, they  were expecting to get about five visits a week. They are getting 5 to  10 visits a day--a day. People are coming in to get rid of their drug  paraphernalia. No questions asked--they will take it there. They are  getting in there to access the system as to how they can deal with  their drug addiction problems. They are seeking care. They are going in  there when they are stressed, and they are getting care. First  responders will provide immediate help, and they have the availability  of county services to get people into treatment 24/7. It is working.   It is working so well that we have people from other counties who are  referring their people to go to Anne Arundel County to go to the fire  station. Just this past week, one of the private insurers asked one of  their insured: Why don't you go to the Anne Arundel fire station in  order to get help?   We need to expand these types of programs.   The fire chief told me one other thing, which was very interesting:  Since they started this program, theft crime in Anne Arundel County is  down 13 percent. Theft crime, of course, as we all know--a lot of it-- feeds habits, and this program is paying off in the community with  reduced crime.   I mentioned today's roundtable. I have had about a dozen in Maryland  throughout the entire State, from the Eastern Shore to Western  Maryland, to the Washington suburbs, the Baltimore suburbs, Southern  Maryland, the northern counties, and there is a common theme. The  common theme is that there is no simple answer to the opioid crisis. It  involves not only a health issue--and we need to have services for our  health--but we also need to recognize that it deals with  transportation, it is a social problem, and it deals with how the  courts handle these issues. There are multiple disciplines involved in  dealing with the opioid epidemic, and that is why I am so pleased that  we are going to have a chance to vote on the Opioid Crisis Response Act  of 2018.   We all know that despite our great efforts here--and we have provided  billions of dollars of additional Federal support for these programs-- the opioid crisis is still on the rise. The number of OD deaths are  still increasing in many parts of the country. Every community is  experiencing challenges with the opioid crisis, so it is appropriate  that we are taking comprehensive action to deal with this problem.   The Opioid Crisis Response Act of 2018 reauthorizes and improves the  21st Century Cures Act. Governor Hogan, the Governor of Maryland, has  strongly urged us to pass this section. In fiscal year 2017, Maryland  received $20 million under the Cures Act, and these modifications will  help States like  [[Page S6167]]  Maryland do even more. It is a true Federal partnership with our State  and local governments to deal with this crisis by providing greater  base support for opioid problems.   Secondly, this bill provides comprehensive opioid recovery centers  under SAMHSA. Why is this important? This allows for locals to apply  for Federal grants for innovative new programs.   I mentioned the stabilization program in Baltimore city. There is  also one in the Upper Shore. There is no direct funding for  stabilization centers because they are not hospitals, and they don't  fit into the normal reimbursements. This program that is included in  the Opioid Crisis Response Act will allow grants to move forward on  these innovative programs, such as the one in Baltimore city.   The legislation provides for us to deal with peer support, an area I  have championed on the Finance Committee, and I have talked frequently  on this floor about the importance of peer support programs. This  legislation will help provide technical assistance in order to provide  peer support but also asks the GAO to take a look at Medicaid  reimbursements to see whether we can't have a more comprehensive way to  deal with peer support reimbursement.   It expands telehealth, an area that I have been directly involved  with. I am happy to hear that. That is an important part of dealing  with the opioid crisis.   It deals with a new area that we haven't really dealt with before,  and that is housing. As I said, the problem of opioid addiction is not  just health, it is also housing, and this legislation will provide a  way in which we can help the homeless and deal with housing issues in  order to make people less vulnerable to being left out of opioid  recovery.   It does deal with the underlying causes, with research and  development in nonaddictive pain killers to get CDC grants and to look  at mechanisms to control prescription drugs.   It also deals with the killer effect that we have in fentanyl.  Fentanyl, as you all know, is a synthetic drug that is primarily  produced in China, but there are other sources that come into this  country and are mixed with heroin causing, in many cases, instant  death. This legislation will provide a way in which Customs will have  greater enforcement to keep fentanyl out of the United States and will  provide detection for first responders so they can protect themselves,  because they go on a scene, there may be fentanyl there, and if they  don't know it, they can become afflicted by this synthetic drug.   All of this is good news. I have only scratched the surface of a lot  of the provisions in this bill. It is a comprehensive bill. It is  bipartisan. It represents the work of several of our committees,  including the Senate Finance Committee on which I proudly serve.   I urge my colleagues to pass this legislation, and let's increase the  government's role and deal with this crisis in all parts of America.                      Recognition of the Minority Leader     Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, this Sunday, I will have the honor  and pleasure of attending services at Ebenezer African Methodist  Episcopal, AME, Church in Fort Washington, MD to celebrate the 35th  anniversary of service to this wonderful church by my dear friends, the  Reverend Dr. Grainger Browning, Jr., and his wife, the Reverend Dr. Jo  Ann Browning.   Ebenezer AME Church's beginning is similar to the origin of many  other AME churches. In 1856, 13 Black members left Mt. Zion Methodist  Episcopal Church in Georgetown because of discrimination and  segregation. They erected a new church at 2727 O Street, NW, not far  from Mt. Zion. They named it ``Ebenezer'', meaning ``stone of help,'' a  reference to I Samuel 7:12. The congregation worshiped in the historic  Georgetown location for well over one century. By 1983, however, many  Black families had left Georgetown. Church membership fell to fewer  than 30 people, with a Sunday offering of only $200 per week.   With the vision, leadership, and support of Bishop John Hurst Adams-- the presiding prelate, Second Episcopal District at that time--the  Reverend Howard C. Wright as pastor, Dr. Joseph C. McKinney as the  African Methodist Church treasurer, and the Washington Conference Board  of Trustees, 17 faithful members moved to Fort Washington, MD, and the  church in Georgetown was sold.   One month following the move to a 500-seat sanctuary with a $3,500  monthly mortgage note and a $300 weekly offering, the Reverend Dr.  Grainger and Reverend Dr. Jo Ann Browning were called to serve the  Ebenezer family. The congregation soon outgrew the building and began  holding worship services at the Friendly High School auditorium in  1986. In 1994, having outgrown the 1,500-seat auditorium at ``Friendly  Ebenezer,'' members carried their faith pilgrimage to ``Ebenezer the  Beautiful,'' a 2,600-seat sanctuary on 33 acres of land. Many people  call the current church ``The Miracle on Allentown Road.''   The Reverend Dr. Grainger Browning, Jr., is the senior pastor of  Ebenezer AME Church. He is a 1974 graduate of Hampton University in  Hampton, VA, where he earned a bachelor of science degree in history  and education and was a member of the Omega Psi Phi Fraternity. He was  awarded a master of divinity degree in 1982 from Howard University  Divinity School, where he was awarded the Benjamin E. Mays Theological  Fellowship. He received doctor of divinity degrees from Payne  Theological Seminary in Wilberforce, OH and from the AME University in  Monrovia, Liberia. Before Pastor Browning was called into ministry, he  was a high school educator with the Newton Massachusetts Public School  System, serving as department chairperson in social science. While he  was living in the Boston area, Pastor Browning was also vice president  of the Boston NAACP from 1982 to 1983.   In addition to his pastoral duties, Pastor Browning has ministered  extensively throughout the African continent, including Senegal,  Gambia, Lesotho, Zambia, South Africa, Liberia, and Egypt. He currently  serves as a member of the board of trustees for both Wilberforce  University--after serving as vice chairman from 2002 to 2006--and Payne  Theological Seminary. Pastor Browning is also a member of the board of  directors of the Rainbow/People United to Save Humanity, PUSH,  Coalition. In that capacity, he has traveled on several delegations  with the Reverend Jesse Jackson, Sr., to Israel, Palestine, Sudan,  Libya, Lebanon, Syria, and Ghana, meeting with the heads of state in  each one of these countries.   Pastor Browning is married to the Reverend Dr. Jo Ann Browning,  copastor of Ebenezer AME Church. She graduated from Boston University  in 1976 with a bachelor of science degree in Communications. She  received a master of divinity degree in 1986 and a doctorate of  ministry from Howard University School of Divinity in 1991. While at  Howard, she was a recipient of the Benjamin E. Mays and the Pew  Fellowships.   Pastor Browning immediately began assisting her husband and was hired  as assistant minister in 1985. She originally served as assistant  pastor. In 1998, Bishop Vinton R. Anderson, then presiding prelate of  the Second Episcopal District, made the unprecedented appointment  assigning the Reverend Dr. Jo Ann Browning as copastor of Ebenezer.  Since 2005, Bishop Adam J. Richardson has continued this groundbreaking  appointment.   In addition to her pastoral responsibilities, Pastor Browning has  preached, taught, and facilitated workshops throughout the United  States, Haiti, Bermuda, Barbados, Germany,  [[Page S6185]]  Israel, and South Africa. She is a widely recognized community leader  and has received numerous awards and accolades. In July 2002, for  instance, Pastor Browning was inducted as an honorary member into Delta  Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. In 2006, she received an honorary doctor of  divinity degree from AME University in Monrovia, Liberia. In 2007, she  was honored to preach Spelman College's Baccalaureate Ceremony, where  she served on the Spelman College Sisters Chapel Wisdom Center  Executive Board. In 2016, she became a member of the board of trustees  at Wesley Theological Seminary, and in 2017, she accepted the request  to serve on the Board of RISE TOGETHER: The National Mentorship Network  for Women of Color in Ministry, WOCIM.   Pastor Browning has also organized and convened over 30 annual  women's spiritual retreats, attracting thousands of participants from  throughout the United States and around the world. She self-published  her first book, ``Our Savior, Our Sisters, Ourselves. Biblical  Teachings & Reflections on Women's Relationships,'' in 2006. The book  provides teachings that explore the realities of being a Black woman,  wife, mother, and minister. It is designed to empower and bless women  as they continue on their own journeys of faith. Her second book,  ``Faithful, Focused and Fearless: Lessons to Fortify Your Future,'' was  released June 2009.   The Brownings are the proud parents of Grainger Browning III, a 2008  graduate of Morehouse College, and Candace Davis, a 2008 graduate of  Hampton University and current graduate student at Howard University.  They are the proud grandparents of Grainger Browning IV and Kaylah  Browning and Imani Davis.   The story of Ebenezer AME Church is much like the Parable of the  Mustard Seed. When Grainger and Jo Ann Browning arrived at Ebenezer AME  in 1983, the church had a membership of 17 people and an annual budget  of $12,000. Under the Brownings' inspired leadership, the membership  now exceeds 8,000 people, and the church has an annual budget of $10  million. Ebenezer AME Church has over 100 different ministries  dedicated to serving the spiritual, educational, political, social,  economic, health, and recreational needs of the community. For nearly  30 years, the Ebenezer AME Church family has donated nearly $2 million  in scholarships to high school graduates and returning college  students. Ever mindful of the multitude of spiritual and physical  needs, Ebenezer AME Church's future plans include the development of a  school, family life center, and senior citizen complex. The Brownings  and Ebenezer AME Church continue to strive to be a source of help and  inspiration within the walls of the church and throughout the  community.   I am proud to celebrate the Brownings' 35th anniversary at Ebenezer  AME Church this Sunday. I call upon all of my Senate colleagues to join  me in congratulating the Reverend Dr. Grainger Browning, Jr., and his  wife, the Reverend Dr. Jo Ann Browning, for their extraordinary  leadership and dedicated service to their parishioners, the surrounding  community, and all of humankind.                            ____________________
