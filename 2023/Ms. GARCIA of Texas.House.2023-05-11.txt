 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2, the  Secure the Border Act of 2023, scheduled for a vote on the House floor  today.   This bill is extreme and wrong. This bill in no way secures the  border. In fact, it would only make security worse.   It is an assault on asylum seekers and those who flee poverty,  hunger, and violence, including unaccompanied minors and families with  children. It exploits challenges on our border for political points. It  adds to the human suffering of those who come to our country seeking  safety and a better life. It is also about putting politics over  people.   We all expect our government to effectively manage our borders and  thoroughly vet those who seek to enter as refugees, to join their  family already in the country, or to work. We all agree on that.   Instead, what we see is children are in danger, families are  separated or detained, and people are dying.   We need reform and we need it now.   The last time Congress passed immigration reform was in 1996, 27  years ago. This Republican-led bill eliminates several legal  immigration pathways, essentially making fewer people eligible for  legal status while making more people deportable.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is extreme and wrong. Again, session after  session, we talk about reform but nothing ever passes, not a single  immigration law update, again, since 1996.   Time and time again, Republicans block meaningful legislation for  safe and legal immigration from moving beyond this floor. Our job as  public officials is to serve and protect our constituents, but we have  been failing them for 27 years.   House Republicans focus solely on immigration as a border issue,  providing billions of dollars in so-called border security, building  walls, increasing personnel, and rapid expulsion policies. That hasn't  worked, has it?   The promised security involves a militarized border, wasting the  taxpayers' money, and increased violence for those seeking asylum.   Since 1988, at least 8,000 undocumented immigrants have died  attempting to cross the border from Mexico to the United States. People  are dying every day while we wait on Republicans to budge.   While rightwing media and extreme MAGA Republicans call immigrants  ``illegals,'' seeking asylum is a legal right. It is in our immigration  law. They are following the law. This law and this right would be  denied to thousands under this bill.   The administration and Congress must act. Again, this bill is simply  extreme and wrong and does nothing to secure our border.   Meanwhile, we continue to see the violence at the border and violence  in my home State of Texas. I was born and raised in South Texas. I am  not from Long Island or Boston or somewhere else talking about the  border. I am from South Texas. I am talking about our South Texas  border.                                time  1015    Over the weekend, it was heartbreaking to see that 8 people were  killed and 10 injured when a vehicle was driven into a group of people  waiting in line at a migrant shelter in south Texas.   We all know that there will be a surge of migrants coming in as of  tonight, and cities like Brownsville, where this occurred, are  preparing. We are preparing in Houston because we know we will get some  of the impact, too.   We must keep in mind that since migrants will no longer have the  protections they have been afforded in the past--this bill will  eliminate all that. People are losing their lives as they wait, even at  this shelter. People are losing their lives on their way over.   Now more than ever, safe and legal immigration reform is necessary.  We must protect all God's children. We must always put people over  politics and rhetoric.   Now more than ever, we need safe and legal immigration reform. Now  more than ever, we cannot wait another moment.   Mr. Speaker, I oppose this bill and ask my colleagues to do the same.  [[Page H2251]]                                ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2, the  Secure the Border Act of 2023, scheduled for a vote on the House floor  later today. This legislation is harmful, dangerous, irresponsible, and  just plain wrong.   Instead of securing the border, this bill will separate families, put  human lives at risk, lead to more unlawful migration by blocking off  lawful pathways to protection, and waste taxpayer dollars on an  ineffective wall that can't even withstand wind much less criminal  smuggling cartels.   Instead of treating this like the emergency that it is, House  Republicans focus on immigration solely at the border, providing  billions of dollars in so-called border security, building walls,  increasing personnel, and rapid expulsion policies.   Since 1998, at least 8,000 undocumented migrants have died attempting  to cross the border from Mexico to the U.S.   People are dying. They are dying every day. Children are exploited.  They are exploited every day. Families are being separated. They are  being separated every day.   We have all been waiting for many years, 27 years, in fact, since the  last meaningful legislation on immigration reform was passed by this  body.   Since then, Republicans have rejected every bill that has been  proposed. This bill, again, is wrong. It is not a solution. It is a  slap in the face to our immigration system.   There is no time left, Mr. Speaker. This bill is extreme, it is  wrong, and what we really need is safe immigration law now.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to add the text of my amendment  into the Record immediately prior to the vote on the motion to  recommit.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the  desk.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
