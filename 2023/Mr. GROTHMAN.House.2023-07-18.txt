 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk a little bit about a  hearing we are going to have tomorrow in the Oversight and  Accountability Committee regarding members of President Biden's family.   It is a hearing I don't want to have. I think the President has done  a pretty bad job, and politically he has made a lot of mistakes that  have made him unpopular, but what we are dealing with here is  significant sums of money, tens of millions of dollars, that appears to  have flowed to his family from other countries around the world--in  particular, China and Ukraine.   It is very difficult as a Congressman to know exactly what American  policy should be with regard to these countries, but it makes it even  more difficult if it is apparent that the President of the United  States or his family may have received significant amounts of money and  may have even been subject to blackmail if the worst had happened.   I strongly encourage the American public and the Chair to tune into  our hearing tomorrow because we are going to unveil a new witness whose  name has not been publicly revealed, and I think it is important for  all Americans to pay attention and see exactly what is going on.                            ____________________
