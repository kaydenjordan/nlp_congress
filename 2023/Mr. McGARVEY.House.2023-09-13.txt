 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in solidarity with the United  Auto Workers.   Louisville, Kentucky, is a Ford town. Since 1969, we have been making  Ford trucks. Every Ford Escape, Ford F-250, F-350, and F-450 is made in  Louisville, Kentucky, with union labor from our brothers and sisters in  Local 862, providing solid, middle-class jobs and a good life for so  many Louisville families.   We make Ford trucks, and we are proud of Ford's success. Ford made  billions in profits last year, and Local 862 was responsible for 54  percent of Ford's North American profits.   That is more than enough to go around and make sure every worker  earns a good wage, has good benefits, and operates in a safe working  environment.  [[Page H4276]]    We must have a fair contract for the men and women of Local 862 and  the UAW. It is real simple: The people who build Fords should be able  to buy Fords.   I am proud that Louisville is a union town with a thriving middle  class built on union labor. Let's keep it that way because when our  workers win, we all win.                            ____________________
