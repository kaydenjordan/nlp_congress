 Madam Speaker, for decades, America's mining industry  has suffered at the hands of foreign competition from China.   Yesterday, President Trump signed an executive order to expand the  domestic mining industry, supporting thousands of American mining jobs  and reducing our dependence on China for critical minerals.   A domestic mineral supply chain is essential for our national  security, because they are used for military, infrastructure, and  energy projects.   America certainly should not be depending on China for precious  materials that are critical to our national defense. This should rest  solely in our hands.   By streamlining development of critical minerals at home and creating  jobs for American workers along the way, this executive order is a win- win.   With all the push for renewable energy in this country and electric  vehicles, we certainly need to have this supply chain come from our  country and not somewhere else.   Madam Speaker, I am grateful for President Trump's bold action to  continue our economic growth while also taking bold action against a  foreign adversary.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to call up H.R.  8265 to extend the Paycheck Protection Program to keep millions of  employees on the payroll of America's small businesses.
