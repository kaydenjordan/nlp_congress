 Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentlewoman from  California for her leadership, and, certainly, I rise enthusiastically  on her motion.   I rise in strong opposition to the rule governing debate for H.R.  6157. We must oppose this rule and defeat the previous question. The  reason for such is not because we do not support the troops or our  children but because defeating the previous question will enable this  House to consider and pass H.R. 6545, the Violence Against Women  Reauthorization Act of 2018.   This is an opportunity that we should not squander. This bill is a  bill that we have worked on for 2 years, and a bill that I introduced  with over 150 cosponsors, timely, in July 2018, after working for 2  years with all of the Nation's women's advocacy groups, groups that  opposed and fought against domestic violence, and all other  stakeholders.   I would like to thank them for 2 years of tedious and hard work,  ensuring that immigrant women were protected, ensuring that Native  American women were protected, ensuring that those who had a domestic  abuse warrant could not have a gun without having a lockbox. I want to  say to them that we will never give up.   The Violence Against Women Act is a landmark piece of legislation,  passed in 1994 following the Anita Hill moment that opened our eyes to  the then overwhelming problems faced by victims of domestic violence,  dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. It is now even more  evident with the Justice Kavanaugh confirmation hearings and the  allegations that have been made by Dr. Ford and others that raise a  sense of urgency for the passage of the Violence Against Women Act.    It baffles me that Republicans can leave without passing the updated,  reauthorized legislation and not just a mere extension. By passing  VAWA, we can stop the revictimizing, retraumatizing, and stigmatizing  of sexual assault survivors.   Enough is enough. Science tells us that trauma severely impacts  recall, so let us do our jobs and help them. Women deserve to be  respected, protected, and never neglected.   As we all know very clearly, VAWA is set to expire this week, and  millions of innocent lives are counting on us to get this right and  reauthorize VAWA now, reauthorize it with the new provisions to  increase funding; increase recognition of stalking, sexual assault,  dating violence, and sexual harassment; help women, men, and children  everywhere throughout our great country who have and will suffer at the  hands of perpetrators who commit these violent and abusive crimes.   The bill generically adds the word ``people,'' because we know that  abuse is across the lines of men, women, and children. Clearly, these  victims deserve more than a mere 3-month expedient extension or  piecemeal product to combat these challenges of monumental proportions.   What will we say to them? The current climate of the #MeToo movement  is a wake-up call to the Nation. Let's not make this a partisan issue.  It should not be--it was not in 1994--because crimes of violence  against anyone must be addressed.   I remember standing next to Senator Joe Biden, and I remember  standing next to Congressman Henry Hyde, the chairman of the Judiciary  Committee, reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, standing next  to Republicans and Democrats to do this. Why can we not do it now?   Therefore, when we ignore an extraordinary movement such as the  #MeToo movement by not reauthorizing a strengthened and improved VAWA  that meets today's challenges, then we have failed the Nation. If we do  not defeat this previous question, we are telling all of our  constituents and all of those stakeholders and those women's centers,  like the Houston Area Women's Center that are waiting for this to be  reauthorized and are a place of refuge for women who are fleeing all  kinds of violence and who rely heavily on VAWA and all of those who  care about protecting women, men, and children's rights against  violence that we do not care.   On July 26, 2018, I introduced H.R. 6545, VAWA 2018, which is a  compromise version with modest improvements, because I am committed to  passing a bipartisan reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.  Hopefully, we can do more that is tailored to appeal to Members of  Congress across the political spectrum.   My question is, why didn't the Republicans stand up? Where were they?  This is not a bill that is out of line. It is a bill that is updated in  response to needs.    This is the moment for my colleagues to do the right  thing, for the right reasons, to help bring H.R. 6545 to the floor for  a vote. This has always been a bipartisan effort.   Let us not let the current times and background noise sway us away  from our pivotal duties. What is happening on the other side, the other  body, does, in fact, emphasize our need to act.   Let us show the American people that we care about victims of  domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, sexual assault, and  sexual harassment, which have been added to the VAWA 2018.   H.R. 6545 has received the support of the National Task Force to End  Sexual and Domestic Violence, women and men who are both Republicans  and Democrats, which is a national collaboration comprising a large and  a diverse group of national, Tribal, State, territorial, and local  organizations, advocates, and individuals who focus on the development,  passage, and implementation of effective public policy to address  domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, the  four crimes.   These modest yet vital updates we have made in the existing Violence  Against Women Act are based on the needs identified by direct service  providers who work daily with the victims and the survivors of the four  crimes.   H.R. 6545 makes the following improvements and more.   It makes important investments in prevention, a key priority  identified not only by people who work with victims and survivors daily  but also by our very own Bipartisan Women's Caucus.   It provides resources to implement evidence-based prevention  programs, which will make our communities safer and, ultimately, save  taxpayers money. Law enforcement officers are waiting for the resources  to help them protect the community.   It also safeguards important protections that ensure all victims and  survivors have access to safety and justice, and provides mechanisms to  hold predators who prey on Native women accountable.   Moreover, it provides law enforcement with new tools to protect their  community.   It offers protections for survivors in Federal, public, subsidized,  and assisted housing. It supports victims and survivors who need  assistance rebuilding financially. It addresses the needs of  underserved communities and improves the healthcare response to the  four crimes.    It closes many of the loopholes found in dating  violence.   And in response to the overwhelming victims in the #MeToo movement,  it adds sexual harassment as part of the applicable crimes of violence.    In short, the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act of  2018 is a bill that should draw wide support but provides across-the- board protection for those who need it. There is no reason for this not  to be bipartisan and no reason for it not to be on the floor.   Let's not play politics with people's lives. Let's not shortchange  them by slashing funding in half. Let's not kick the can down the road  while omitting funding. Let's not dismiss their cries and pleas.  Certainly, let's not punish them because #theydidnot report.   Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for all of the time, and I thank the  gentlewoman from California for all of her leadership.   It is time to vote ``no'' in order for us to move the previous  question and pass the Violence Against Women Act that is now ready to  move to the floor.    Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained and missed  rollcall No. 404. If I was present, I would have voted ``yea.''                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to thank both the  chairman and chairwoman of the full committee and all of the chairs and  ranking members for their outstanding job, particularly on bringing us  to this point, though much work needs to be done.   I am going to speak as fast as I can, but I am very grateful for the  $7.9 billion in the FEMA Disaster Relief Fund, which will include many  of us who have suffered from Hurricane Harvey in 2017, but, more  particularly, will help those who are suffering with much devastation  after Hurricane Florence.   I am grateful for the 2.6 percent raise of our military personnel,  and the $40 million for the historically Black colleges and  universities that we have worked on, and minority serving institutions  for basic research programs.   And then I worked on the issue dealing with triple-negative breast  cancer, and I am pleased with $374 million for cancer research and $130  million for breast cancer research, being a breast cancer survivor.   And particularly, though, I would have wanted the Violence Against  Women Act to be on the floor and pass the full bill. I am glad for the  $35 million for continued implementation expansion of the Sexual  Assault Special Victims Counsel Program under Defense.    And I am grateful for the death gratuities for  troops in the case of a government shutdown.   And the funds prohibited to use outside of the War Powers Resolution  in Syria and Iraq.   But, most importantly, my constituents are suffering from a lack of  healthcare because of the undermining of the Affordable Care Act that  we are still fighting for. So I am very grateful for the $39.1 billion  for the National Institutes of Health; $4.4 billion for programs that  respond to the opioid crisis; $7.9 billion for the Centers for Disease  Control, and, of course, what is so important to our constituents in  Houston and Texas is that our community health centers that are our  first line of defense to those who don't have healthcare; $678 million  for a maternal and child health block grant--we have some of the  largest numbers of maternal death in Houston among African American  women; $10 billion for Head Start; and then specifically I want to talk  about the unaccompanied children, $1.3 billion, but I am grateful for  the language that demands of this administration to tell us who is  there that has not been reunited with their families, and then the  12,000 that are in the jurisdiction of HHS. We have got to get those  individuals united with their families and we have got to be able to  have ICE arrest the sponsors. Finally, Mr. Speaker, $10.3 million for a  domestic violence hotline.   In any event, this bill speaks to education and healthcare, and I  want to ask my colleagues to recognize that more work has to be done.    Mr. Speaker, let me thank the ranking member for his  leadership and commitment to working on real voter empowerment  legislation. Let me acknowledge and thank the chairman of the full  committee, Mr. Goodlatte, and seek an opportunity to really work on  legislation that addresses the question.   I have looked at it, and I have no doubt that my friends on the other  side of the aisle are sincere. I read the resolution, and I noted that  one particular example was utilized, Mr. Speaker. The example happens  to be in San Francisco, California.   I live in Houston and my colleague lives in New York. I know that if  this was a moment of crisis, we would see Members from the 50 States-- at least 20 States, 35 States--bringing this to the attention of the  Judiciary Committee. To date, I have had no complaint from Houston or  the State of Texas.   But I do know, when I engage in dialogue with my constituents, they  are all aware of the Russian interference in the 2016 election and the  constant pounding of emails and the leaks that occurred and the attack  on the DNC. Everybody is aware of that.   To my knowledge--help me, those of my colleagues who are on the  floor--we have not passed one single legislative initiative or crime  bill that addresses the question of preventing Russian interference. We  are now at the end of the first crunch of this year of legislation.   So I would ask my colleagues, if they are so concerned about voting,  would they help us add back to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, in which  Dr. King marched and our colleague,  John Lewis, was beaten almost to  his death, bleeding on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, and restore section 5?   Section 5 might even help with this issue, because section 5 provides  preclearance to any voting procedure that any State may have that would  be unfair and discriminatory. If my colleagues want to argue anything,  they can argue that the main bill that they should be putting forward  is a restoration of section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.  [[Page H9050]]    We have found throughout the States that we do have violations. We  have voter ID laws that are discriminatory. We have voter suppression.  We have people being purged off of lists. Interestingly enough, they  happen to be poor people, African Americans and Hispanic citizens.   Mr. Speaker, I am opposed to this legislation. I don't like  legislation that is ``gotcha'' legislation. I have great respect for my  friend from California. I, frankly, believe it is a State matter--it is  really a city matter--that could be handled by those who are concerned.    Mr. Speaker, I see that, for the national question  of voter empowerment, there is a litany of laws still waiting for this  body to pass: voter security, the ballot security, the question of our  voting machines, the question of the individuals with the hanging  chads, the right kind of voting machines and equipment, and, again, to  protect people against purging legitimate registered voters off the  registration list. I have faced that in Texas.   I have the Justice Department on notice. I would like to say  publicly: Department of Justice, get back to me on that request that I  made about being purged in Texas.   For all these reasons, I think we are going in the wrong direction,  Mr. Speaker, and I would like us to put back on the floor section 5 of  the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
