(b) Map and Description.--        (1) In general.--As soon as practicable after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall file a map and a       legal description of each wilderness area designated by this       Act with--        (A) the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of       Representatives; and        (B) the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the       Senate.

There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 3058         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Foreign Medical School       Accountability Fairness Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. PURPOSE.         To establish consistent eligibility requirements for       graduate medical schools operating outside of the United       States and Canada in order to increase accountability and       protect American students and taxpayer dollars.       SEC. 3. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Three for-profit schools in the Caribbean have       historically received nearly \3/4\ of all Federal funding       under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C.       1070 et seq.) that goes to students enrolled at foreign       graduate medical schools, despite those three schools being       exempt from meeting the same eligibility requirements as the       majority of graduate medical schools located outside of the       United States and Canada.        (2) The National Committee on Foreign Medical Education and       Accreditation and the Department of Education recommend that       all foreign graduate medical schools should be required to       meet the same eligibility requirements to participate in       Federal funding under title IV of the Higher Education Act of       1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq.).        (3) The attrition rate at United States medical schools       averaged 3.3 percent between 1993 and 2013, while rates at       for-profit Caribbean medical schools have been known to reach       30 percent.        (4) In 2019, residency match rates for foreign trained       graduates averaged 59 percent compared to 94 percent for       graduates of allopathic medical schools in the United States.        (5) On average, students at for-profit medical schools       operating outside of the United States and Canada amass more       student debt than those at medical schools in the United       States.       SEC. 4. REPEAL GRANDFATHER PROVISIONS.         Section 102(a)(2) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20       U.S.C. 1002(a)(2)) is amended--        (1) in subparagraph (A), by striking clause (i) and       inserting the following:        ``(i) in the case of a graduate medical school located       outside the United States--         ``(I) at least 60 percent of those enrolled in, and at       least 60 percent of the graduates of, the graduate medical       school outside the United States were not persons described       in section 484(a)(5) in the year preceding the year for which       a student is seeking a loan under part D of title IV; and        ``(II) at least 75 percent of the individuals who were       students or graduates of the graduate medical school outside       the United States or Canada (both nationals of the United       States and others) taking the examinations administered by       the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates       received a passing score in the year preceding the year for       which a student is seeking a loan under part D of title       IV;''; and         (2) in subparagraph (B)(iii), by adding at the end the       following:         ``(V) Expiration of authority.--The authority of a graduate       medical school described in subclause (I) to qualify for       participation in the loan programs under part D of title IV       pursuant to this clause shall expire beginning on the first       July 1 following the date of enactment of the Foreign Medical       School Accountability Fairness Act of 2019.''.       SEC. 5. LOSS OF ELIGIBILITY.         If a graduate medical school loses eligibility to       participate in the loan programs under part D of title IV of       the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1087a et seq.)       due to the enactment of the amendments made by section 4,       then a student enrolled at such graduate medical school on or       before the date of enactment of this Act may, notwithstanding       such loss of eligibility, continue to be eligible to receive       a loan under such part D while attending such graduate       medical school in which the student was enrolled upon the       date of enactment of this Act, subject to the student       continuing to meet all applicable requirements for       satisfactory academic progress, until the earliest of--        (1) withdrawal by the student from the graduate medical       school;        (2) completion of the program of study by the student at       the graduate medical school; or        (3) the fourth June 30 after such loss of eligibility.                            ____________________
