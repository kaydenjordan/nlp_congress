 Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   First of all, let me thank the Speaker for coming down on the floor  to give her personal remarks. I know she has a busy schedule, but this  really honors and shows her commitment to human rights in Hong Kong and  all around the world.   Mr. Speaker, I was proud to join the chairman in leading this measure  to condemn the egregious violations of Hong Kong's freedoms. The  Chinese Communist Party's relentless oppression of the people of Hong  Kong is not a Republican or Democratic issue. We are united as  Americans in standing with Hong Kongers.   Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement has inspired people around the  world to fight for liberty over tyranny. But in June of last year, the  Chinese Communist Party used its sham legislature to enforce a  dystopian national security law on Hong Kong. This law criminalizes  basic civil liberties, it violated China's treaty commitments, it  destroyed the ``one country, two systems'' model of autonomy, and it  inserted the CCP's police state into Hong Kong to crush dissent.   Since it passed, the CCP has purged pro-democracy lawmakers from the  government while arresting the CCP's political enemies.   Unfortunately, the CCP's human rights abuses in Hong Kong are far  from over. Chairman Meeks' resolution continues our bipartisan work to  call out the CCP's abuses and to stand with the people of Hong Kong,  and I urge my colleagues' support for this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Smith), who is the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee  on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International  Organizations and has been a champion for human rights more than most  people have been in this Congress maybe combined.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Meijer), who is a member of the Committee on Foreign  Affairs.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself  the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, sadly, we no longer see American flags waving over  thousands of peaceful protesters in the streets of Hong Kong.  Displaying our symbol of liberty has become a criminal act punishable  by life in prison. But even though the freedom-loving people of Hong  Kong can no longer publicly ask for our support, we still hear these  pleas. Congress hears them, the American people hear them, and it is  now  [[Page H1930]]  more important than ever that we continue to stand with the people of  Hong Kong.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Meeks for bringing this  resolution which I was proud to join as a lead cosponsor, and I yield  back the balance of my time.                                time  1745     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased the House is considering the Cyber  Diplomacy Act that I reintroduced this Congress with Chairman Meeks and  a strong roster of bipartisan cosponsors. I also want to thank my good  friend from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin), my co-chair on the  Congressional Cybersecurity Caucus. Over the past decade, he and I have  worked very hard to advance critical cyber legislation like the law  that set up the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency at the  Department of Homeland Security.   With today's bill, we are taking the protection provided by CISA to  the United States to the international stage and, as the chairman  mentioned, providing rules of the road, which we do not have today.   The United States has strategic and economic interests in ensuring  the internet remains open, reliable, and secure around the world.  Unfortunately, not all governments agree.   For example, Russia and China are aggressively promoting their vision  of ``cyber sovereignty,'' which emphasizes state control over  cyberspace and tramples individual freedoms. That is why the United  States and our allies must be prepared to advance our own vision for  cyberspace.   The Cyber Diplomacy Act gives the State Department the necessary  tools to work with our allies and partners to stop the spread of  misinformation, to stop the cyberattacks, and to stop the imposition of  their so-called cyber security.   Madam Speaker, a new ambassador will be given the authority to  establish critical cyber norms and standards that do not exist today to  help define what is good behavior and what is bad.   Let me say that when the SolarWinds attack occurred, in the past,  there were no consequences to bad behavior with the Russians or the  Chinese, and I was very supportive and proud that President Biden  struck back with sanctions against Russia for this bad behavior. That  is what this office is really all about.    Without these clear guidelines, it is not possible to mount a strong  response to our adversaries' destructive behavior. This bill is long  overdue. To me, it is the last piece in terms of our cyber role in the  Federal Government, now taking it to the international stage with our  allies around the world.   Madam Speaker, again, I want to thank Chairman Meeks, Mr. Langevin,  and all of the bipartisan cosponsors. The recent high-profile attacks  remind us that what happens in cyberspace is vitally important to the  United States and our allies and partners around the world. This act  will enhance our ability to protect and promote our national security,  our ability to compete, and the freedoms and ideals America represents  to the world.   A decade ago, we had to determine what is the cyber role--or maybe  even 15--what the role is of the Federal Government. We knew the  Department of Defense and NSA had great offensive capabilities. We  needed a civilian agency to work with the private sector to share  threat information, and that became the beginning of the cybersecurity  agency at the Department of Homeland Security. And, of course, the FBI  investigates. But we have never had any international norms or  standards or, as the chairman said, the rules of the road.   This bill, as I said, is long overdue. The Russians influenced our  elections. There are, finally, sanctions against them. But before that,  few consequences occurred. When the Chinese stole 23 million security  clearances, including my own, there was zero response from the United  States of America.   When these attacks occurred, and when our intellectual property has  been stolen, so much so that Keith Alexander, the NSA Director, said it  was the ``greatest transfer of wealth in human history,'' with no  consequence, we finally shut down the Chinese consulate in Houston  because of the tremendous theft of intellectual property through the  Texas Medical Center in my home State, including research and  development on the vaccine. Then there was a Texas A&M professor being  indicted for espionage for giving NASA data to the Chinese. This has to  stop.   This act, this cyber diplomacy bill, will ensure that, at the  international level, the United States is respected and that we are  going to work with our allies to provide the norms and standards that  are so desperately needed to better protect our interests and the  interests of our allies.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I am honored to join my colleagues today to express  our support for the people of Belarus and their democratic aspirations.   There is no question that Alyaksandr Lukashenka rigged the  presidential election in Belarus this past August. He is an  illegitimate leader who will never be recognized by the community of  democratic nations. The scale of the electoral fraud was unprecedented,  as was the violent crackdown by Lukashenka's cronies afterwards.   The reports of peaceful protestors being beaten, tortured, and  arbitrarily detained and killed are appalling. In a cowardly attempt to  conceal their heinous crimes, the regime has repressed independent  media, disrupted internet access, and expelled and detained countless  journalists.   Given this despicable human rights situation in Belarus, I commend  the Biden administration's decision today to renew sanctions against  nine Belarusian state-owned enterprises.   Despite the terror inflicted upon them, the Belarusian people have  refused to relent. They continue to demand a free and fair vote. Their  courage is truly inspiring.   This resolution reminds the corrupt Lukashenka regime that the United  States Congress supports the people of Belarus. We echo their calls for  the immediate release of more than 300 political prisoners and all of  those unlawfully detained by the regime. We also join them in demanding  new, free, and fair elections to be held in Belarus.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this measure,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Smith), the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs  Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, and Global Human Rights; and  also the author of the Belarus Democracy, Human Rights, and Sovereignty  Act that was signed into law last year.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Meijer), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close and I yield myself  the balance of my time.   Today, the people of Belarus know that they are not alone, that they  have the support of the United States Congress and the American people.   Madam Speaker, I urge passage, and I yield back the balance of my  time.                                time  1815
