 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for  yielding and for his leadership on this bill.   We know the health effects of PFAS exposure can be severe: cancer,  thyroid problems, birth defects, and immune system disruptions, amongst  others. Sadly, there are many communities and individuals across our  great country who are suffering these health consequences.   Despite knowing the dangers of these forever chemicals, the Federal  Government has been slow to act. I say enough is enough.   The PFAS Action Act would require significant steps to ensure that  our Federal Government is responding comprehensively and reducing the  risk of exposure through our air, water, and consumer products.   It includes actions under numerous environmental statutes, including  designating the two most well-studied PFAS, PFOA and PFOS, as hazardous  substances and setting a deadline for a national drinking water  standard to, at a minimum, ensure vulnerable groups, including pregnant  women, infants, and children, are protected.   The bill includes other critical provisions to reduce exposure,  empower consumers, and expedite cleanups.    Despite what some may want to suggest, designating PFOA and PFOS as  hazardous substances under CERCLA is not a ban. There are literally  hundreds of hazardous substances that continue to be used in  manufacturing processes and commerce broadly.   What it will do is ensure that polluters are held accountable to  clean up their messes when toxic releases occur and ensure that  remediation is done to an acceptable level.   We have waited far too long already for action. Despite promising  initial steps from the Biden administration, I fear the EPA will not  adequately address PFAS without clear direction from Congress. As the  administration recognized, this bill supports the commitment across the  branches of government to take on this challenge.   This is the bill our constituents and those living with PFAS in their  communities need.   I thank Representatives Dingell and Upton for their commitment to  addressing these dangerous forever chemicals, and I encourage Members  to support this bill.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 535, I rise to  offer amendments en bloc.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this en bloc of 10 amendments. As  was done in the 116th Congress, the PFAS Action Act was subject to a  subcommittee markup, a full committee markup, and debate and amendment  on the House floor.   During these processes in the 116th and 117th Congresses, there has  been an effort to continue to strengthen the proposal at each and every  stage. The ten amendments included in this en bloc, which includes  several bipartisan amendments, would build upon this past work and make  further improvements to the underlying bill.   Several of the amendments help protect Americans from PFAS in their  drinking water, especially those relying upon private wells, which  would not be subject to the national drinking water standard required  to be developed by this bill.   We know communicating the risks of PFAS is challenging: What are safe  levels? What is a reliable testing technique? And what do you do if  your water is contaminated?   These amendments would help ensure people have better, clearer, and  more accessible information on this and other issues. This en bloc also  includes amendments that would increase grant funding to community  water systems and ensure all communities dealing with PFAS  contamination can access these funds, including insular territories.  And it would establish a new grant program to support PFAS testing and  filtration at schools.   We know the cost of PFAS remediation can be significant. Ensuring  these costs do not fall squarely upon the households that rely upon  these water systems, who are not responsible for the contaminations,  should be a high priority of this effort. More Federal funding can help  in this regard.   Finally, the en bloc would expand the PFAS-free labeling program to  cover food package material, luggage, and cleaning products. This will  allow Americans to make certain that they have more informed choices on  the products they choose to purchase. Overall, these are good  improvements to the bill, and I do not believe they should be  controversial.   Madam Speaker, I encourage Members to support the en bloc, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes), who has been outspoken on this issue.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Ms. Tlaib), who, along with Mrs. Dingell, has really brought  great focus to this issue in committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New Mexico (Ms. Leger Fernandez), who has great concern for this issue.    Madam Speaker, I stand, again, in strong support of the en  bloc amendment and, certainly, the measure to which we are amending.   Basically, we have here an opportunity to address ills that we see  across America, contaminants, forever dangerous elements that cause all  sorts of diseases and destruction, and it is important for us to move  forward, I think, to take responsibility and make certain that these  forever chemicals that don't break down, that cause cancer and other  diseases, are addressed.   We move forward with the opportunity here, assigning the great  responsibilities to EPA so that we have a strong outcome. I think the  amendment makes the bill even stronger. I have seen situations in my  given region of Upstate New York where communities have been impacted.   Madam Speaker, I encourage everyone to support the amendment and the  bill at hand, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that, in the  engrossment of H.R. 2467, the Clerk be authorized to correct section  numbers, punctuation, spelling, and cross-references, and to make such  other technical and conforming changes as may be necessary to reflect  the actions of the House, including striking lines 13 through 23 on  page 20.    Madam Speaker, I rise to join you in marking 200 days  since the start of the 117th Congress, and a productive 200 days it has  been. Our majority in the House has risen to this challenge, delivering  lifelines to millions of Americans, putting shots in arms and saving  countless lives, and sustaining thousands of businesses, and helping  our State and local governments keep our communities going.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        July 21, 2021, on page H3792, the following appeared: Madam  Speaker, I rise to join you in      The online version has been corrected to read:  Madam  Speaker, I rise to join you in    ========================= END NOTE =========================      We built on that momentum with legislation to establish paycheck  fairness and universal background checks on gun sales, build greater  justice into our policing and our economy, stop voter  disenfranchisement, and restoring the principle of one person, one  vote, and protecting Americans from the devastating effects of PFAS.   Just in the past several weeks, millions of families started  receiving the improved child tax credit expected to lift one-half of  America's poorest children out of poverty.   Madam Speaker, before I close, let me recognize one other milestone;  The 1 year anniversary of the passing of my dear friend, and a hero and  a friend to many, Congressman John Lewis.   I hope that he smiles down upon us favorably for this work, much of  it building on a legacy he carried on his mighty shoulders throughout  his life.   Brother John, we do miss you. Even as we work in your mighty shadow,  may we always be guided by your light.                            ____________________
