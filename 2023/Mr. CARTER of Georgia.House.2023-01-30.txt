 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  honor the life of Dick Flood, or as many residents of the First  District knew him, ``Okefenokee Joe.''   Flood was a singer, songwriter, entertainer, environmentalist, and in  the south of Georgia, a local legend.   Okefenokee Joe lived in the Okefenokee Swamp for 10 years, learning  firsthand about plants and animals in the area. He was well known to  Georgia public broadcast viewers for his 1988 documentary, ``The Joy of  Snakes.''   Flood also hosted the Emmy Award-winning Georgia Public Broadcast  Television documentary, ``Swampwise.''   In the 1950s and 1960s, he wrote numerous songs for popular country  music musicians.   This loss will be felt by all of us in the First District, and  particularly for those that live in and around the Okefenokee Swamp.   On a personal note, when I was dating my wife, we went to see  Okefenokee Joe at the Okefenokee Swamp, and I will never forget that.   Our thoughts and prayers are with Mr. Flood's family.                            ____________________
