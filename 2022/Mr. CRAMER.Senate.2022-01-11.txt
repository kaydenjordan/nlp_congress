 Mr. President, I thank Senator Hoeven. I just want to  fully associate myself with every word of Senator Hoeven and every  thought you just heard. John Hoeven is not just a Senator who  represents the State that the Bison play in; he is a fan. To say the  least, he is a fan.   Senator Hoeven did a great job, as have ESPN and everybody else, in  highlighting the legacy of the Bison Nation. There has been 9 out of 11  national championships.   One of the things I really appreciate about Coach Matt Entz--who, by  the way, was named this year again the FCS Coach of the Year. That is  the second FCS National Coach of the Year in the last 3 years. He has  been the coach for 3 years.   But, as he likes to point out, while it is, in fact, the ninth  national championship in 11 seasons for the Bison, it is the first one  for this team--a fact that we sometimes forget. Excellence over time  requires one excellent team after another. So I want to focus just a  little bit not so much on the legacy but on this particular team.   Remember, as Senator Hoeven said, they beat the Bobcats 38 to 10. It  became 38 to 10 after they had been ahead 35 to 0. That is not a minor  thing in collegiate football. But the 38-to-10 victory tied with the  fourth largest margin of victory in FCS championship game history.  After that is NDSU's 28-point victory over Towson to cap the 2013  season. It was the fourth time NDSU has won the FCS championship by 26  or more points.   North Dakota State's 108 rushing yards in the first quarter and 160  in the second quarter marked the third and fourth times in the 2021 FCS  playoffs that the Bison ran for 100 yards in a quarter. Imagine that.  Twice they did it in the same game--103 in the first quarter and 116 in  the second quarter of NDSU's second-round win over Southern Illinois.   Now, NDSU's 28-to-0 halftime lead was the largest halftime margin in  FCS championship history, passing the 24-to-0 Bison lead over  Jacksonville State in 2015. In other words, this team, this one team,  is excellent among excellence. They had 378 yards rushing and 540 yards  of total offense. That was the most by the Bison in FCS championship  game history, surpassing a 300-yard rushing performance against Sam  Houston State in 2012 and 488 total yards against Eastern Washington in  the 2018 season.   We have to talk a little bit about fullback Hunter Luepke, who was  voted the Most Outstanding Player of the championship game. He tied a  career-high with three rushing touchdowns--the first three of the game,  one shy of the FCS championship game record of four rushing touchdowns  by Furman's John Bagwell in 1985.   This team, this one excellent team out of dozens of excellent teams  over the years, and this one excellent player obviously stand out,  along with their one excellent coach, as I said earlier, Matt Entz, the  FCS National Coach of the Year.   I love that Senator Hoeven consistently refers to these players as  student athletes because, remember, before they are football players,  they are students, and I think it is worth noting what exceptional  students they are.   NDSU's Cole Wisniewski was the winner of the NCAA Elite 90 Award. The  Elite 90 is presented to the student athlete with the highest  cumulative grade point average participating at the finals site for  each of the NCAA's championships. But he is one among many. Five  student athletes were named to the football all-academic team. NDSU  linebacker Jackson Hankey headlines this group of five student athletes  named to the Missouri Valley Football Conference All-Academic Team on  December 14.   I think it is important to highlight and be specific about these  guys. Hankey is a senior from Park River, ND. John and I know Park  River. It is a pretty small place. He has an undergraduate degree not  in underwater basket weaving and not even in physical education,  although there is nothing wrong with that, but, rather, in agricultural  economics. He was selected to the first team with a 3.636 grade point  average.   Here are the other four besides him: Hunter Luepke, the outstanding  player of the game, has a 3.42 GPA in finance. Sophomore defensive  tackle Eli Mostaert has a 3.733 GPA in finance. Kicker Jake Reinholz  has a 4.00 GPA in the master's degree program in mechanical  engineering. The senior defensive tackle, Lane Tucker, has a 3.857 GPA  in the MBA program. Great athletes are smart athletes. Great athletes  are smart athletes.   All right. To continue that, this is a tribute. Well, while they take  the stage on ESPN and on game day and the various programs, it is  important to point out that North Dakota State University's athletic  teams achieved a remarkable--remarkable--semester last fall with a  3.418 grade point average among all 427 student athletes. Three Bison  teams earned the highest ever GPA. The statistics are incredible. They  are incredible in terms of academic achievements of these outstanding  athletes throughout all of the sports at North Dakota State University,  not just football. But they definitely lead the charts.   So, to wrap up, in talking again a little bit about the dynasty, one  of my favorite quotes--and I refer to it a lot; I use it a lot when I  talk about Bison football--is Aristotle, who said:         We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, [therefore], is       not an act, but a habit.    It is not an act. It is a habit.   There are 9 out of 11 national championships in the FCS alone. Before  that, as Division II, they won several national championships. They  never lost a national championship. In other words, they repeatedly win  national championships. That makes winning habitual. It is habitual.   They made their ninth appearance, as I said, in the championship  game--the most of any FCS team. They won them all, as we know. They now  have 17 football national championships in history. They won their last  13 title game appearances. I mean, it is kind of remarkable. They  improved to 41 and 3--imagine this, Senator Hoeven--41 and 3 in FCS  playoffs since 2010.   We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a  habit.   I, as well, salute Dean Bresciani, the president; Matt Entz, the head  coach; the entire coaching staff; the entire faculty; every student  athlete; and every parent who got these student athletes to college.   It is just a remarkable thing to be able to represent this level of  excellence, and I join Senator Hoeven in saying: ``Horns up! Go Bison!  Go Bison!''   I yield the floor.
