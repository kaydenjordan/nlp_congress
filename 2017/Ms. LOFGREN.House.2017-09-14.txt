 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3697. Gang members and  serious criminals should not be granted admission to the United States.  That is not a controversial position. I think almost every Member of  Congress, Democrat or Republican, agrees with that. It is our highest  priority to protect the safety of the American people. That is a duty I  think we all take seriously, but this bill does something other than  that.   The title of the bill is the Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act,  and, as we have seen in the past, there are times when the name of a  bill is not always reflected in the actual proposed language of the  statute, and that is true in this case.   First, section 2(a) of the bill defines criminal gang as ``an ongoing  group, club, organization, or association of five or more persons that  has as one of its primary purposes the commission of one or more'' of a  wide range of offenses. This may seem reasonable until you look at the  offenses listed.   These offenses could sweep in many people that no reasonable person  would think of as a gang member--for example, one of the offenses  relates to the harboring of undocumented immigrants. This statute  includes people who give shelter to, transport, or provide other kinds  of aid to undocumented immigrants. That means that,  [[Page H7390]]  under this bill, a religious organization that aids undocumented  immigrants could be a criminal gang.   This isn't just theoretical. During the 1980s, members of the faith  community were repeatedly criminally prosecuted for providing  transportation to undocumented immigrants. In one case, the FBI even  infiltrated a Bible study group to learn about the group's plan to  support undocumented immigrants. Under this bill, DHS would have  expanded authority to go after all such groups as criminal gangs. In  one fell swoop, it could turn nuns into gang members.   The bill also refers to felony drug offense, which would include the  repeated possession of marijuana. In California, my State, along with  several other States, voters decided to decriminalize marijuana--first,  for medical uses, then later for broader uses. Under this bill, a group  that regularly gets together to use marijuana that is legal under State  law would still be committing a felony under Federal law and would be a  criminal gang. That could include groups of people who are using  marijuana for medicinal purposes to treat epilepsy or cancer who are  taking marijuana consistent with State law.   Second, the bill authorizes DHS to deny admission or to deport any  immigrant, including one who has no criminal history or gang  affiliation whatsoever, so long as DHS merely believes the person is  associated with such a group.   Sections 2(b) and 2(c) of the bill expressly authorize DHS officers  and immigration judges to deport an immigrant on nothing more than a  reason to believe that the individual has been a member of a gang or  has participated in the activities of a gang as defined under these  rather broad provisions. There is no need for conviction or even an  arrest. All DHS needs is a belief that the individual has assisted any  group of five or more people that DHS believes has committed one of  these long list of offenses.   This belief could be as minimal as the color of a person's shirt, the  neighborhood they live in, or the individuals in their family. This is  not just unreasonable, it is probably unconstitutional. Chairman  Goodlatte had a self-actualizing amendment when the rule was adopted to  change the evidentiary standard. I think it recognizes the problem with  the bill.   The amendment really doesn't cure the problem with the breadth of the  criminal gang definition, and it doesn't change the standard that  applies to people seeking admission to the country, including those who  are seeking to reunite with U.S. citizen spouses, parents, and  children.   Just this week, I met with actual police officers who asked me to do  what I could to defeat this unwise bill. They know, because they are  out on the front lines, that gangs are a real problem, and they told me  that bills like this, which could turn religious individuals, nuns,  cancer victims into targets, is just going to get in their way as  police officers.   If we want to keep America safe and admit immigrants who do not have  a felony record, I would suggest that we consider the bipartisan Dream  Act, H.R. 3440. This bill would provide a path to legal permanent  residence for 800,000 young people who were raised in America, who  consider this to be their home, who represent the very best of our  country.   Instead of debating whether we should allow ICE officers to target  religious workers, we should focus on what really makes this country  great.   I would like to note that there has been much discussion about the  drafting of this bill, and at the Rules Committee just last night,  Republicans defended the bill by asserting that the broad provisions  would not be abused by ICE officers. Even if they could target the  nuns, they wouldn't do that. Even if they could target the cancer  victims or the teenagers smoking marijuana after school as gang  members, they wouldn't do that.                                time  0930    Now, I am not suggesting that the teenagers smoking marijuana after  school is a good thing. But it is not MS-13. And that is what we are  trying to make a distinction here between, a gang abatement bill and  garden-variety activity that we may not like.   One really very good and very thoughtful Member on the other side of  the aisle suggested that, if there is a problem with the bill, we will  just come back and fix it. Here is why that is a problem: We know that  when we draft something in a poor manner, it often goes on to be  enforced and we never get around to fixing it.   I will give an example. We passed years ago, and I objected at the  time--Henry Hyde was chairman of the committee--a provision that barred  people from gaining status if they provided material support to  terrorists.   Well, that sounds like a good idea, but what does it mean?   It turns out that material support--which was never qualified to  include support given under duress or given in the ordinary course of a  commercial activity--has now been used to bar people who are not  terrorists, who didn't give material support.   I will give you an example. A group of women called the Tortilla  Terrorists are women who were threatened with their lives and made  tortillas because they were threatened with death by guerrilla actors.  Now, they were denied asylum because of the tortillas, hence the name  the Tortilla Terrorists.   I think most of us would agree that is not terrorism. Yet, we drafted  the bill in such a way that the Department felt that they had to  enforce it in that way, and we have never gone back to it.   So to think that somehow if we write a law poorly, it is going to be  fixed in the administration, that is just wrong. We should step back  from this. We should work together. This was just introduced last week.   Now, I know the SAFE Act had hearings years ago, but I think we would  be better off if we sat down together, if we reasoned together, if we  worked through the defects in this draft, and came up with a bill that  really targeted MS-13 members, something that we could all support and  that well-served our country.   I will just say that Sister Simone Campbell, one of the leading nuns  in America, explained her opposition to this bill. She said:         The bill's harboring provisions under INA 274 are so       sweeping that religious workers who provide shelter,       transportation, or support to undocumented immigrants could       be found liable of criminal activity. This statute has been       used against religious workers in the past, and the bill       tries to make it a weapon for the future.    Let's listen to the nuns like we did in school, and step back,  redraft this bill, and oppose this poorly crafted measure today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Nadler), my colleague on the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I would just note that this bill was indeed  part of the Davis-Oliver Act which did go through the Judiciary  Committee. But that bill was over 200 pages long. It had many problems.  It was impossible to address all the problems. We would be there for a  month if we had gone through line by line. It was not a good process.  If it had been perfect, I would note that Chairman Goodlatte would not  have had to have his amendment to remove the reason-to-believe standard  that was in the bill that was part of the Davis-Oliver Act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee), who is my colleague on the Judiciary Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record an analysis entitled:  ``Harboring: Overview of the Law,'' prepared by the Catholic Legal  Immigration Network, Inc.            [From the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, Inc.]                       Harboring: Overview of the Law         The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) prohibits       individuals from concealing, shielding, or harboring       unauthorized individuals who come into and remain in the       United States. Under the law it is a criminal offense       punishable by a fine or imprisonment for any person who:        knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact than an alien       has come to, entered, or remains in the United States in       violation of law, conceals, harbors, or shields from       detection, or attempts to conceal, harbor, or shield from       detection, such alien in any place, including any building or       any means of transportation. INA Sec. 274(a)(1)(A)(iii), 8       U.S.C. 1324(a)(1)(A)(iii) [hereinafter the ``harboring       provision'' or ``Section 1324 (a)''].                The Harboring Prohibition Applies to Everyone         The harboring prohibition is not restricted to those       individuals who are in the business of smuggling undocumented       immigrants into the United States or who employ undocumented       immigrants in sweatshop-like conditions. As interpreted by       the courts, harboring can apply to any person who knowingly       harbors an undocumented immigrant. See, e.g., United States       v. Shum, 496 F.3d 390 (5th Cir. 2007); United States v.       Zheng, 306 F.3d 1080, 1085 (11th Cir. 2002), cert denied, 538       U.S. 925 (2003); United States v. Kim, 193 F.3d 567, 573-74       (2d Cir. 1999); United States v. Rubio-Gonzalez, 674 F.2d       1067, 1073 (5th Cir. 1982); United States v. Cantu, 557 F.2d       1173, 1180 (5th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1063       (1978).                     What Are the Elements of Harboring?         To establish a violation of the harboring provision, the       government must prove the following in most jurisdictions       ``(1) the alien entered or remained in the United States in       violation of the law, (2) the defendant concealed, harbored,       or sheltered the alien in the United States, (3) the       defendant knew or recklessly disregarded that the alien       entered or remained in the United States in violation of the       law, and (4) the defendant's conduct tended to substantially       facilitate the alien remaining in the United States       illegally.'' Shum, 496 F.3d at 391-392 (quoting United States       v. De Jesus-Batres, 410 F 3d 154, 160 (5th Cir. 2005), cert       denied, 546 U.S. 1097 (2006)). The U.S. Court of Appeals for       the Seventh Circuit has rejected the fourth element asserting       that the phrase ``conduct tending substantially to       facilitate'' is a judicial addition to the statute that is       unnecessary for a conviction because the statute requires no       specific degree of assistance. United States v. Xiang Hui Ye,       588 F.3d 411, 415-416 (7th Cir. 2009).                      What Actions Constitute Harboring?         Although Congress passed legislation to prohibit and punish       the ``harboring'' of undocumented individuals, it never       defined the term. The work of defining what constitutes       ``harboring'' has been left to the courts. As shown below,       the federal courts have not settled on one uniform       definition, but rather many of the circuit courts have       adopted their own definition of ``harboring.''        Harboring is conduct that substantially facilitates an       immigrant's remaining in the U.S. illegally and that prevents       the authorities from detecting the individual's unlawful       presence (U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit)        Harboring includes affirmative conduct such as providing       shelter, transportation, direction about how to obtain false       documentation, or warnings about impending investigations       that facilitates a person's continuing illegal presence in       the United States. (U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third       Circuit)        Harboring is conduct tending to substantially facilitate an       immigrant's remaining in the U.S. illegally (U.S. Courts of       Appeals for the Fifth Circuit)        Harboring is conduct that clandestinely shelters, succors,       and protects improperly admitted immigrants. (U.S. Court of       Appeals for the Sixth Circuit)        Harboring is conduct that provides or offers a known       undocumented individual a secure haven, a refuge, a place to       stay in which authorities are unlikely to be seeking him.       (U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit)        Harboring is conduct that affords shelter to undocumented       individuals. (U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit)                  Explanation of Harboring Through Case Law       U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit        In the influential case, United States v. Lopez, the U.S.       Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit went through the       legislative history of the harboring provision and stated       that the term harbor ``was intended to encompass conduct       tending substantially to facilitate an alien's `remaining in       the United States illegally,' provided that the person       charged has knowledge of the immigrant's unlawful status.''       521 F.2d 437, 441 (2d Cir 1975), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 995       (1975).        In this case, Mr. Lopez owned at least six homes in Nassau       County, New York, where he operated safe havens for       undocumented individuals. Mr. Lopez knew that the people       staying in his homes were undocumented. Each person paid Mr.       Lopez $15 per week to live in his houses. In many cases,       people received the address for a particular house before       they left their home countries, and, upon crossing the border       illegally, they proceeded directly to the house. Mr. Lopez       also helped these individuals obtain jobs by completing work       applications and transporting them to and from work. He       arranged sham marriages for many so that they could appear to       be in the U.S. in lawful status. With a warrant, immigration       authorities searched six of Lopez's homes and found twenty-      seven undocumented individuals. He was charged with harboring       illegal immigrants.        Mr. Lopez argued that the mere providing of shelter to       undocumented immigrants does not constitute harboring. Id. at       439. He argued that to constitute harboring the conduct must       be part of the process of smuggling immigrants into the U.S.       or facilitating the immigrants' illegal entry into the U.S.       Id. The circuit court noted that he essentially argued that       to constitute harboring the sheltering would have to be       provided either clandestinely or for the purposes of       sheltering the immigrants from the authorities. Id.        The Second Circuit rejected these arguments. It held that       the statute criminalizes conduct that tends substantially to       facilitate an alien's remaining in the United States       illegally. Id. at 441. The circuit court found that Mr.       Lopez's conduct did just that. It pointed out that Mr. Lopez       had a large number of undocumented immigrants living at his       houses; they obtained the addresses and, upon entering the       U.S., proceeded to those houses; Mr. Lopez provided       transportation for them to and from work; and, he helped       arrange sham marriages. Id.  The Second Circuit did not       require that Mr. Lopez provide the shelter clandestinely nor       that he shield the illegal immigrants from detection by       immigration authorities Id.        The case of United States v. Kim also is instructive on the       meaning of harboring. 193 F.3d 567 (2d Cu 1999). It states       that harboring within the meaning of Section 1324(a)       ``encompasses conduct tending substantially to facilitate an       alien's remaining in the U.S. illegally and to prevent       government authorities from detecting [the immigrant's]       unlawful presence.'' Id. at 574. In this case, Mr. Myung Ho       Kim owned and operated a garment-manufacturing business       called ``Sewing Masters'' in New York City. He employed a       number of undocumented workers, including Nancy Fanfar.       During the course of her employment, Mr. Kim instructed Ms.       Fanfar to bring in new papers with a different name that       would indicate that she had work authorization. He instructed       Ms. Fanfar to change her name and remain in his employ a       second time, even while he was being investigated by       immigration authorities.        According to the circuit court, Mr. Kim's actions       constituted harboring, for they were designed to help Ms.       Fanfar remain in his employ and to prevent her continued       presence from being detected by the authorities. Thus, his       conduct substantially facilitated her ability to remain in       the U.S. illegally in prohibition of the harboring provision.       Id. at 574-575.  [[Page H7397]]           U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit        The Third Circuit also has considered what conduct       constitutes ``shielding,'' ``harboring,'' and ``concealing''       within the meaning of Section 1324(a). Like the Second       Circuit, it determined that these terms encompass conduct       ``tending to substantially facilitate an alien's remaining in       the U.S. illegally'' and [that] prevent[s] government       authorities from detecting the alien's unlawful presence.       ``U.S. v. Ozcelik, 527 F.3d 88, 100 (3d Cir. 2008); see also       Delno-Mocci v. Connolly Props, 672 F.3d 241, 246 (3d Cir.       2012), U.S. v. Cuevas-Reyes, 572 F.3d 119, 122 (3d Cir.       2009); U.S. v. Silveus, 542 F.3d 993, 1003 (3d Cir. 2008).        In United States v. Ozcelik, the defendant knew that the       individual remained in the U.S. illegally and advised him to       ``lay low'' and ``stay away'' from the address he had on file       with the government. 527 F.3d at 100. However, Mr. Ozcelik       did not actively attempt to intervene or delay an impending       immigration investigation and the Third Circuit held that       advising an individual without legal status to stay out of       trouble and to keep a low profile does not tend substantially       to facilitate their remaining in the country. Id. at 100-01.       The circuit court reasserted that shielding or harboring a       person without status ordinarily includes affirmative conduct       such as providing shelter, transportation, direction about       how to obtain false documentation, or warnings about       impending investigations that facilitates a person's       continuing illegal presence in the United States. See Id. at       99.        In United States v. Silveus, the Third Circuit held that       cohabitation, along with reasonable control of premises       during an immigration agent's inquiry regarding the       whereabouts of the suspected undocumented individual, does       not constitute harboring without sufficient evidence that a       defendant's conduct substantially facilitated the       individual's remaining in the U.S. illegally and prevented       authorities from detecting his/her unlawful presence. 542       F.3d at 1002-04. In this case, the agent never saw the       suspected undocumented individual, but only heard the       apartment door slam, heard some bushes break, and as he       approached, saw the defendant shut her front door. Id. at       1002. The defendant spoke to the agent through her window and       when asked if anybody had run out of her apartment, she said       ``I don't know.'' Id. at 1003. The circuit court determined       that the act of shutting a door as an agent rounded the       corner and her subsequent reply to the agent's question did       not establish ``harboring'' under Section 1324(a) because it       only led to speculation as to the suspect's presence. Id. at       1004.        In United States v. Cuevas-Reyes, the Third Circuit       reaffirmed that shielding an undocumented person includes       affirmative conduct (such as providing shelter,       transportation, direction about how to obtain false       documents, or warnings about impending investigations) that       facilitates the person's continuing illegal presence in the       U.S. 572 F.3d at 122. The circuit court held that the       defendant's actions (taking undocumented people from the U.S.       to the Dominican Republic in his private plane) were       undertaken for the purpose of removing them from the U.S.,       not helping them remain in the U.S. Id. It noted that the       goal of Section 1324 is to prevent undocumented individuals       from entering or remaining illegally in the U.S. by punishing       those that shield or harbor. Id. It asserted that punishing a       defendant for helping individuals without legal status leave       the U.S. would be contrary to that goal. Id.        More recently, the Third Circuit reiterated that       ``harboring'' requires some act that obstructs the       government's ability to discover the undocumented person and       that it is highly unlikely that landlords renting apartments       to people lacking lawful status could, without more, satisfy       the court's definition of harboring. Delrio-Mocci, 672 F.3d       at 246 (citing Lozano v. City of Hazleton, 620 F.3d 170, 223       (3d Cir 2010)). The circuit court reiterated that ``[r]enting       an apartment in the normal course of business is not in and       of itself conduct that prevents the government from detecting       an alien's presence.'' Id.      U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit        The Fifth Circuit's definition of harboring is broader than       the Second and Third Circuits. It rejects the notion that to       be convicted of harboring a defendant's conduct must be part       of a smuggling operation or involve actions that hide       immigrants from law enforcement authorities. See De Jesus-      Batres, 410 F.3d at 162 (specific intent is not an element of       the offense of harboring). An early Fifth Circuit decision,       U.S. v. Cantu, 557 F.2d 1173 (5th Cir. 1977), remains       informative.        In Cantu, immigration agents visited the restaurant owned       by Mr. Cantu because they received information that he was       employing undocumented workers. The agents wanted to question       the employees. Mr. Cantu refused admission to his restaurant       until they could provide a warrant.        While the immigration authorities waited outside for the       warrant, Mr. Cantu made arrangements with at least two of his       patrons to drive some of his undocumented employees into       town. Mr. Cantu also arranged for his employees to sit in the       restaurant and then leave the restaurant like customers. As       the employees left the restaurant, the immigration agents       approached them and questioned them about their immigration       status. The agents determined their illegal status and       arrested them.        Mr. Cantu argued that, because he did not instruct his       employees to ``hide,'' and because the employees left the       restaurant in full view of the officers, he could not be       charged with shielding immigrants from detection. He also       argued that his actions were not connected to any smuggling       activity. The Fifth Circuit, relying on the Second Circuit's       Lopez decision, rejected these arguments, and determined that       Mr. Cantu's actions--instructing the employees to act like       customers so they could evade arrest--tended to facilitate       the immigrants remaining in the U.S. illegally. Id. at 1180.        In another Fifth Circuit case, United States v. Varkonyi,       645 F.2d 453 (5th Cir. 1981), the court cited to Lopez to       assert that the harboring statute prohibits ``any conduct       which tends to substantially facilitate an alien's remaining       in the U.S. illegally.'' Id. at 459. Mr. Varkonyi provided a       group of undocumented immigrants with steady employment at       his scrap metal yard six days a week as well as lodging at       his warehouse. On previous occasions, he had instructed and       aided the men in avoiding detection and apprehension. On the       day of their detention, Mr. Varkonyi interfered with Customs       and Border Protection agents' actions by forcibly denying       them entry to his property through physical force.        Here, the circuit court found that Mr. Varkonyi's conduct       went well beyond mere employment and thus constituted       harboring. Id. at 459. In this case, the court pointed out       that Mr. Varkonyi knew of the immigrants' undocumented       status, he had instructed the immigrants on avoiding       detection on a prior occasion; he was providing the       immigrants with employment and lodging, he interfered with       immigration agents to protect the immigrants from       apprehension; and he was partly responsible for the escape of       one of the immigrants from custody. Id. Given these facts,       the circuit court found that Mr. Varkonyi's conduct, both       before and after the detention of the immigrants, was       calculated to facilitate the immigrants remaining in the U.S.       unlawfully. Id. at 460.        In 2007, the Fifth Circuit ruled in another employment       harboring case that ``substantially facilitate'' means to       make an individual's illegal presence in the United States       substantially ``easier or less difficult.'' United States v.       Shum, 496 F.3d 390, 392 (5th Cir. 2007) (citations and       quotation marks omitted). The court noted that Section       1324(a) was enacted to deter employers from hiring       unauthorized individuals and it refused to adopt a narrow       definition of ``substantially facilitate'' that undermines       Congress's purpose. Id.        In this case, Mr. Shum was vice-president of an office-      cleaning company and he employed janitors without legal       status. According to witnesses, he provided false       identifications to the workers to facilitate background       checks so that the workers could clean government office       buildings.     In this legal analysis by the Catholic Legal Immigration  Network, Inc., it does point out that religious persons have been  prosecuted and convicted for providing sanctuary. Opinions may differ  on whether that is a good idea or bad idea, but to say that that is an  MS-13 activity, I think we would all agree that is just crazy. That is  what this bill would do.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida  (Mrs. Demings), a freshman Member of the House whom we are so fortunate  to have. Just last year, as the chief of police, she was on the front  line in the fight against gangs.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  [[Page H7398]]    Madam Speaker, I just want to make a couple of closing comments on  this bill.   I think it is a given that every Member of this body wants to do  something about gangs. I have gangs in my district. I think I heard Mr.  King speak so passionately about the problem in his district. It is a  pervasive problem.   The concern is that this bill goes far beyond targeting those gangs.  That is why we, with great reluctance, have to say we can't do this. We  can't do this.   If we wanted to target just the gangs, we wouldn't have included  language that would allow charging people who are not gang members as  gang members. We wouldn't have included provisions that the victims of  gangs would be denied asylum. Section 2(f) of the bill denies  individuals who are suspected of alleged gang membership the  opportunity to apply for asylum.   Here is the problem. In certain parts of Central America, you have  rampant gang activity. Women and girls are terribly abused. They are  beaten, turned into sex slaves, tattooed, and they escape. If that  young girl who has been the victim of that violence from gangs comes  with the tattoos, the brand that that gang put on her, and if she, as a  consequence, is reasonably suspected of being a member of the gang, she  can't get asylum. That is not what we want in the fight against MS-13.   The bill is not drafted adequately.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains on  each side?    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   It has been mentioned that there are terrible activities being  undertaken by gang members. I don't think there is any dispute in this  body about that. Our obligation is to craft bills that will allow for  remedies for that problem in a specific, targeted, and effective way. I  think this bill falls far short in that regard.   We had mentioned earlier the great concern that has been expressed to  us by religious people across the United States about the provisions  relative to harboring. Five nuns on a religious worker visa who help  provide sanctuary for an undocumented person is a gang under this bill.  They are not MS-13.    We could craft a measure that avoids that outcome while still going  after MS-13. We didn't do that. For one thing, we didn't actually sit  down, both sides of the aisle, to work together, to reason together, to  make that happen.   I would like to note that the smuggling issue is a big problem. We  have unanimous agreement on the smuggling issue. We have worked  together, actually, with the Wilberforce Act and other acts in a  bipartisan way to deal with that. But we didn't bifurcate smuggling  from harboring in this bill. That is why the nuns and the Catholic  bishops have contacted us asking us not to support this bill.   I would like to note, just finally, that the first obligation that we  have is to keep America safe. We fail to do that if we craft language  that really is just part of a broad deportation agenda under the guise  of an antigang bill. There is great concern that is what has happened  here.   One of the elements that is referenced as a predicate for gang  activity--the five people who are working together--is that documents  are false. A lot of people are highly agitated when undocumented people  have false documents. Opinions differ. Almost every undocumented person  in the United States who works has a fake ID; otherwise, they can't get  a job.   You can agree with that, you can think it is terrible, you can think  it is maybe not so terrible. I think most of us would agree it is not  MS-13. Why would we craft this in such a way to treat that activity as  an MS-13 activity and to blow up all the procedures we have in place to  make sure that justice is done?   I hope that Members will vote against this bill. Despite the name, it  goes far beyond attacking gangs. It would drift into allowing for the  deportation of religious people and others who have done nothing  related to gang activity.   I hope that, if this bill is defeated, we can sit down, as we often  have on various items and worked collaboratively on patent reform and  other issues, and do the same on this. I hope, if this bill is  defeated, we will take the opportunity to do that.   I, for one, pledge my best efforts to come up with a measure that is  targeted and effective. This bill, unfortunately, is not.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.                            Parliamentary Inquiry
