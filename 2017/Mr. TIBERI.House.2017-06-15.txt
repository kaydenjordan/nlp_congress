 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 379, I call up  the bill (H.R. 2579) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to  allow the premium tax credit with respect to unsubsidized COBRA  continuation coverage, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I, too, want to add my thoughts and prayers for our  colleague and friend, Congressman Steve Scalise, and the victims of  yesterday's shooting. May God be with them during this time.   Mr. Speaker, my bill, Broader Options for Americans Act, is before us  today.   We have all heard about COBRA continuation coverage, which allows  someone with group health insurance who experiences a qualifying life  event to keep their job-based coverage when they no longer have a job  and, most importantly, their plan's networks of providers--doctors,  hospitals, et cetera--for a certain amount of time.   Currently, consumers with COBRA coverage, who could face a cost of up  to 102 percent of plan costs, are not eligible for ObamaCare's Federal  subsidies. My bill allows individuals who pay for the full cost of such  continuation of coverage to qualify for the tax credit established  under the American Health Care Act.   This allows those consumers, including clergy, church lay workers,  and their dependents who are experiencing similar circumstances and who  get their coverage through church plans, who have been affected by  sudden life changes to receive assistance to pay for their unsubsidized  health premiums.   This bill represents another step forward in our continuing work to  help Americans access more options for true patient-centered  healthcare.   Mr. Speaker, this hits close to home for me. As a high school  student, my dad lost his job of 25 years. I think the gentleman from  Massachusetts has heard that story before. We, as a family, lost our  healthcare and went into COBRA coverage.   This is a solution that impacts people across America, and I urge my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass this legislation today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, on a personal basis, I have a tremendous amount of love  and respect for Mr. Neal.   We, obviously, have a disagreement. I tell my daughters about how a  bill becomes law, and I don't need to tell the gentleman from  Massachusetts how a bill becomes law, but we certainly, I think,  believe that there are opportunities to not only improve what you say  is the Affordable Care Act but the bill that we passed. That is what we  are doing today.   I hope to work with him to continue to do that, as the Senate passes  its own bill, and, hopefully, go to a conference committee. Hopefully,  the gentleman will be on that conference committee.    I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts.    Reclaiming my time, not lately. Two years ago.   One of the frustrations about the CBO report that never gets reported  is the fact that millions of people will choose not to have healthcare.  That is what the CBO says.   It is not often repeated in the national media or on the floor here,  but I would just kind of remind everybody that, often, the other side  of the aisle speaks a lot about choice and the freedom to choose. And  with respect to healthcare, that is what millions of people will do,  according to CBO.   I would also like to remind my friend--and I do mean that--that there  are millions of Americans in my State alone who have insurance but  don't have the choice of provider they once had or the choice of a  hospital they once had. That is pretty traumatic.   There are people who have insurance, but premiums have doubled and  tripled in the last several years and out-of-pocket expenses for those  who are not subsidized have gone to levels that are unprecedented.   I surely appreciate and would remind the gentleman from Massachusetts  that this bill before us today simply says that we expand choices, we  expand options for Americans by allowing them for the very first time  to receive financial assistance if they lose their healthcare  insurance.   I know it is not perfect, but it is good. I hope that we can improve  on all these aspects that the gentleman and I have talked about today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
