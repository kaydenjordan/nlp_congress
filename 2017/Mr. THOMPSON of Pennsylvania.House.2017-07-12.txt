 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  16 individuals from Pennsylvania's Fifth Congressional District who  have received prestigious Fulbright awards during the 2016-2017 school  year.   Congress established the Fulbright Program in 1946. It promotes  friendly and peaceful relations between Americans and people of other  countries through international educational exchange. Each year, more  than 3,000 U.S. students, scholars, artists, and professionals in more  than 100 different fields of study are offered Fulbright Program grants  to lecture, study, teach English, and conduct research in more than 140  countries.   Today, it is my privilege to recognize the following 16 individuals:   Dr. Farshid Ahrestani of State College, Pennsylvania, a scholar of  biology, whose host country was India;   Dr. Luis Ayala Hernandez of State College, Pennsylvania, a scholar of  engineering, whose host country was Colombia;   Ms. Maria Barboza of Clarion, Pennsylvania, a student with an English  teaching apprenticeship, whose host country is Brazil;   Dr. Samuel Bufford of State College, Pennsylvania, a scholar of law,  whose host country was Romania;   Ms. Alice Chen of Bradford, Pennsylvania, a student with an English  teaching apprenticeship, whose host country was Taiwan;   Ms. Talia Cowen of State College, Pennsylvania, a student with an  English teaching apprenticeship, whose host country is South Korea;   Dr. Zuleima Karpyn of State College, Pennsylvania, a scholar of  engineering, whose host country was Colombia;   Ms. Lauren Knoth of State College, Pennsylvania, a student of  sociology, whose host country was Finland;   Dr. Gerald LeTendre of Furnace, Pennsylvania, a scholar of education,  whose host country was Japan;   Dr. Anthony Robinson of State College, Pennsylvania, a scholar of  geology, whose host country was Austria;   Dr. Robert Roeser of State College, Pennsylvania, a scholar of  psychology, whose host country is India;   Dr. Heather Snyder of Waterford, Pennsylvania, a scholar of  psychology, whose host country was the United Kingdom;   Dr. Jacqueline Stefkovich of State College, Pennsylvania, a scholar  of education, whose host country was Croatia;   Ms. Ann Tarantino of State College, Pennsylvania, a scholar of the  arts, whose host country was Brazil;   Dr. Andrea Wyman of Edinboro, Pennsylvania, a scholar of library  science, whose host country was Azerbaijan; and   Dr. Karl Zimmerer of State College, Pennsylvania, a scholar of  geography, whose host country is Spain.   Congratulations to each and every one of you. You have earned this  national recognition with your years of study, leadership, and service,  and our community is proud of you.   Mr. Speaker, the Fulbright Program is one of the most sought-after  exchange programs in the world. It encourages applications from  individuals of academic and professional achievement who are current  and future leaders in their respective fields. Selected through open,  merit-based competition, Fulbrighters represent the excellence and  diversity of their societies around the world and in the United States.   Since 1946, more than 370,000 individuals from the United States and  180 countries have participated in the program, including 37 heads of  state, 57 Nobel Laureates, 82 Pulitzer Prize winners, and 70 MacArthur  Foundation Fellows.   These relationships form a foundation of trust on which the United  States may advance global peace and security. I know that the memorable  learning experiences individuals encounter through the program will  never be forgotten.   I thank all the Fulbrighters, especially the 16 from Pennsylvania's  Fifth Congressional District. We are grateful  [[Page H5438]]  for your contributions and most proud of your achievements.   Congratulations.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, for the past 100 years,  people in St. Marys, Pennsylvania, have been producing light for the  world.
