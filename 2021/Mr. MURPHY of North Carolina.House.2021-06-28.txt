 Madam Speaker, today I rise to speak on  the recent ruling by the Secretary of Veterans' Affairs to allow  taxpayer dollars to be spent to provide sex reassignment surgeries. I  have been a board certified urologist for 30 years, so I am quite  knowledgeable about patients who suffer from gender dysphoria. Those  who experience this mental and physical ambiguity may seek care that  involves years of psychological and psychiatric evaluation counseling,  years of hormonal manipulation, and then multiple cosmetic surgeries.  The cost of these interventions may easily run into the hundreds and  thousands of dollars.   Recent numbers cited by the National Center for Transgender Equality  stated there were an estimated 134,000 transgender veterans in our  Nation. However, using the American Psychiatric Association's  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders data from 2019,  that calculated number appears to be far less. Regardless, the new  Secretary has mandated that sex reassignment surgery be covered by the  VA.   Again, I am very empathetic to the challenges that these patients  face, but as a surgeon and a Member of Congress, I must question the  surgical priorities here. The VA is already understaffed and  overburdened, and now requiring a competing array of treatments may  lead to a delay in diagnosis for serious life-threatening disorders. It  is an issue of resources and priorities.   There is actually a much heated debate on whether this sex  reassignment surgery is truly appropriate or beneficial. In fact, in  2016 the Obama administration came to the conclusion that it was not.  In 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services revisited the  question of whether sex reassignment surgery would be covered by  Medicare plans. Despite receiving a request that its coverage be  mandated, it refused. It refused to cover it on the grounds that we  lack evidence that it truly benefits patients.   It is well documented that up to 40 percent of the transgender  population will attempt suicide at some point. There is no clear  evidence that this tragic statistic changes anything after having sex  reassignment surgery. In fact, as recent as August of 2020 in the  American Journal of Psychiatry, it states that comparing those with  gender dysphoria who had sex change surgery with those who did not,  that the results demonstrated no advantage of surgery in relation to  subsequent mood or anxiety disorder-related healthcare visits or  prescriptions or hospitalizations following suicide attempts in that  comparison. I could go on with the medical statistics, but suffice it  to say, there is no clear consensus regarding surgical intervention in  this population.   Madam Speaker, I represent the sixth largest number of veterans in  any congressional district in the country. These surgeries that are  required require complex surgical intervention by highly trained  surgical specialists that the VA does not have, nor has any prospect of  employing in the future.   The Nation is already suffering a severe shortage of surgeons. The  American College of Surgeons cites severe shortages of general  surgeons, urologists, and plastic surgeons. Those that we have are  needed to take care of cancer, bowel obstructions, and limb  reconstructions following battlefield injuries, real life and death  issues. They are not going to jump ship to be paid less in a  bureaucratic Government-run healthcare system.   We already know the VA is short-staffed. They need mental health  treatment individuals for PTSD and traumatic brain injury from injuries  sustained by veterans in battle. We already have 17 veterans dying a  day from service-connected psychiatric issues. They do not need to  compete for resources with those who are suffering from issues that  have nothing to do with being a member of the military.   We do not have enough psychiatrists or psychologists to deal with the  trauma that our veterans have faced in their fight to keep this Nation  free. Is it right to divert resources away from those who require years  of therapy for nonservice-connected issues? The answer, I submit, is  no.   Further, gender dysphoria requires years of hormonal transitioning,  needless to say requiring medications for anxiety and depression. This  increase of pharmaceutical needs will further strain the VA pharmacy  system that is already overtaxed.   But now the Secretary in an effort to appease the far left wants to  stress the  [[Page H3162]]  system more. What are his priorities? Secretary Denis McDonough was  supposed to fix the VA. So what is his first major action? Spending  millions in diverting resources from our service-connected veterans for  nonservice-connected issues. We are bankrupting this Nation chasing the  far left progressive wish list.   Again, I will say, as a physician, I am very sympathetic to those  that deal with gender dysphoria. I truly do. They face many challenges  in life, but cosmetic surgical interventions on the backs of taxpayers  is not the answer. Congressional duties are about setting priorities. I  ask the Biden administration to reassess their priorities.                            ____________________
