 Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment, which cuts programs in this bill by an additional 16  percent, and for not all of these programs do local governments or  entities have a taxing authority to pay for them.   The underlying bill provides $25.4 billion in new nondefense  discretionary spending which is $13.4 billion, 35 percent below the  fiscal year 2023 level. The bill also rescinds $9.4 billion in funding  provided to the EPA, The Presidio Trust and the Council on  Environmental Quality through Inflation Reduction Act.   In drafting this bill, we worked really hard to rein in Federal  spending. One thing that all Republicans agree on is that we have to  reduce spending. The debate occurs on how much and how fast.   In drafting this bill, as I said, we worked very hard to rein in  Federal spending while prioritizing critical needs within our reduced  allocation.   Unfortunately, this is kind of a sledgehammer approach when we just  want to reduce the bill across the board by 16 percent.   We would be reducing wildfire fighting. We have done everything we  can to protect wildfire fighting, which is devastating, particularly in  the West where I live.   We have also done everything we can to protect the Indian Health  Service. That is something that is vital here. We don't actually do a  very good job of supporting the Indian Health Service overall.   Mr. Chairman, if you look at the amount of money per patient that the  [[Page H5387]]  VA spends and the amount that average Americans spend, and then how  much we spend per person on the Indian Health Service, it is about one- half of what we spend on other healthcare needs. So we are trying  everything we can over the years in a bipartisan way to bring up the  Indian Health Service and improve their health, but they don't have a  separate taxing authority to be able to do that. That is the Federal  Government.   This sledgehammer approach which would just reduce every budget in  this bill by 16 percent that is not mandatory spending, I think is  inappropriate, and I don't think it is the proper way to go.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  0945     Mr. Chair, I sympathize with what the gentleman is  saying. I agree with him. It is a huge problem, and it is a math  problem. He mentioned something that is really important.   We used to spend about 70 percent of the budget on discretionary  spending--that is the money we appropriate through these appropriations  bills--and about 30 percent was spent on mandatory spending. That has  been reversed, where it is about 70 percent mandatory spending today  and only 30 percent in discretionary spending.   Consequently, we have to address mandatory spending. That is  difficult to do because anytime you say we have to reform Social  Security if we are going to save it, all of a sudden, the commercials  are going: Oh, they are going to take away your Social Security.   It is a political football that Republicans and Democrats have to get  together and address. That is why the Speaker has said we are going to  create a debt commission to look at how we can reduce this debt that we  are facing.   I agree with the gentleman. It is horrible what is going on. As I  said earlier, the debate is not really whether to cut spending, it is  how much and how fast. I guess the gentleman said it best when he  called it a small nuclear weapon in this, but I agree with what he is  saying in general. It is how we go about it that is the challenge.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Clerk be  authorized to make technical corrections in the engrossment of H.R.  4821, to include corrections in spelling, punctuation, section  numbering and cross-referencing, and the insertion of appropriate  headings.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet on Monday next, November 6, 2023,  when it shall convene at noon for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for  legislative business.
