 Madam President, today I would like to honor the  life and service of a distinguished Montanan and World War II veteran,  Mr. Harry A. Arvidson.   Harry was a proud patriot who loved his country. Never one to shy  away from service or sacrifice, he answered the call to duty during  World War II following the attack on Pearl Harbor. He enlisted in the  U.S. Navy submarine service in 1942 and left high school before  graduation to serve.   During his time in uniform, Harry served as a ship cook third class  for his regular duty and radar observer for his battle station post.  His first assignment was on the USS Pollack, where he was a member of  the Pollack's ninth war patrol, a patrol that sunk and damaged more  ships than any of the other Pollack patrols conducted in the Pacific.  At the end of the war, Harry was assigned to a 40-man prize crew which  boarded and seized a surrendering Japanese I-400 submarine. Harry and  the prize crew sailed submarines into Tokyo Bay for the surrender  ceremonies.   After being honorably discharged from the Navy in 1946, Harry  returned to civilian life, married his wife Lola, and had two children,  Lynda and Scott. While Harry was deployed during the war, Lola also  contributed to the wartime effort as a member of the Rosie the  Riveters, working on airplane gliders.   In 1956, Harry and Lola moved to Conrad, MT, where they established  the Home Cafe on Main Street in Conrad. Harry and Lola ran the Home  Cafe  [[Page S1416]]  until 1982, when they retired and passed the torch over to Scott and  their daughter-in-law, who continue to run the family business today.  Soon after, Harry and Lola moved to Lincoln, where they spent the  remainder of their lives.   Harry was immensely proud of his service to the Nation. Since 1972,  he was a member the U.S. Submarine Veterans of WWII organization, even  serving as the Montana State commander for many years. In that role, he  helped host the 53rd national convention in Billings alongside his  family. He was also a member of the American Legion Post 9 in Lincoln  and a member of the Montana Honor Flight that traveled to Washington,  DC, in 2012.   On October 18, 2022, Harry passed away at the age of 97 at the Fort  Harrison VA Hospital, joining Lola--his wife of 72 years--who passed in  2019. Today, it is my honor to commemorate his service and legacy.  Harry's exemplary service and that of the entire Greatest Generation is  what makes our country the greatest in the world. He is a true patriot  who made Montana proud, and he will be sorely missed.                             ____________________
