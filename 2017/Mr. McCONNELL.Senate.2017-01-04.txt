 Mr. President, 2 years ago the American people sent a  new majority to the Senate. They called for a change in direction. They  called for the Senate to get to work. So we got committees functioning  again, we gave Members of both parties a say again, and we put the  Senate back to work again and back on the side of the American people.   Because we did, we were able to get important things done with a  President of a different party. We put an end to the number of  Washington artificial cliffs and punts. We helped make our  infrastructure stronger. We helped make our communities healthier and  our country safer. We gave our children more opportunities to succeed  in school, and we helped ensure that those who suffer exploitation and  abuse--whether veterans or the victims of human trafficking--can know  more of the justice, hope, and care they deserve.   I am proud of what we were able to achieve in a time of divided  government, just as I am excited about the possibilities that lie  ahead.   We now stand on the horizon of a new era. We seated a new Congress  yesterday. We will inaugurate a new President later this month. The  challenges ahead are great, and the work to come will be hard, but just  as we heard the voices of the American people in 2014, we heard their  message this last election as well. Americans called for change from  the last 8 years and for hope, at long last. Each of us, regardless of  party, has a mandate to help and to play a role.   The first way to begin realizing that hope, in my view, is to remove  the things that are hurting families right now. The President-elect  will have an important role to play there, especially in addressing  overbearing, ideologically driven regulations.   Congress will have its role too. In terms of what we can do here most  immediately, ObamaCare is at the top of the list. It is the very first  item we will consider this session. We will continue to devote  significant time to it as well.   I know some of our Democratic friends would prefer we didn't act-- that we just sit on our hands as premiums jump higher, as more  Americans lose plans, and as others continue to struggle with insurance  too costly to actually use. That is essentially the message the  outgoing President came this morning to deliver. The incoming Vice  President came this morning, too, and delivered an entirely different  message.   But repeal is just the first step. We know it will take time to undo  the damage of this partisan law. We want--and we will need--the  contributions of all colleagues as we turn to the development of a  lasting, durable reform.   The same is true of our economy. We know the economy over the last 8  years hasn't lived up to its potential--not for working people, not for  small businesses, and certainly not for the next generation. We will  have disagreements about the best way forward. That is entirely  natural. But, if we look, we will continue to find areas of agreement  too. There are important contributions for each of us to make. That is  the lesson of the 114th Congress.   A more open Senate is a more empowering Senate, but it is also a more  demanding Senate. It gives each of us more of a say in the development  of legislation, just as it requires more of a responsibility in  cooperating. In short, it gives the minority party a stake in governing  and thus the obligations that come along with that.   I welcome our colleague from New York in his new role as Democratic  leader. The role of leading a party is never easy. He has a tough job  ahead of him. I respect him for that. While I know we will often  disagree, I am also reminded of his words just before the election.  ``We have a moral obligation,'' the Democratic leader said just before  the election, ``even beyond the economy and politics, to avoid gridlock  and get the country to work again.''   ``We have to get things done,'' he said.  [[Page S30]]    If that is our guiding principle, then I know we can make this  session a success. It is what will allow us to get the appropriations  process moving, for example. We can set the pace now by working toward  a smooth nomination process.   I ask our Democratic friends to remember the consideration we showed  President-Elect Obama's nominees in 2009. We approved seven--seven-- members of his Cabinet unanimously within hours of his inauguration.  Seven nominees for President Obama's Cabinet were approved unanimously  within hours of his inauguration.   Now, some nominations will be more contentious. I am sure that will  be true, of course, of the Supreme Court. It has been clear throughout  that the next President would name the next Supreme Court Justice. I  maintained that position even when many thought a President of a  different party would be taking the oath this month. Now the President  who won the election will make the nomination, and the Senate that the  American people just reelected will consider that nomination.   But not everything need become so contentious. We will have many  opportunities to cooperate. I have mentioned several already. We will  see many more in committee. Shortly, we hope to see an example of that  in the Intelligence Committee, where Chairman Burr will lead Members of  both parties in a serious, comprehensive, and responsible review of any  Russian involvement in our elections. Leader Schumer will join the  committee as an ex-officio member and will be able to review the  reports of the intelligence community. The Armed Services Committee  will review how best to tie our cyber capabilities to our warfighting  doctrine.   It is just this type of issue--something both parties say is too  important to become a partisan football--where we often see the hard  work of legislating and oversight transcend party. We saw it last  Congress when, for instance, Members of both parties came together--and  held together--on highways, on efforts to cure incurable diseases, and  on providing TPA authority to both the current President and the next  one. I hope we will see similar cooperation on many issues to come.   The American people are watching us. They are hurting. They are  calling for a change in direction. It is now our united responsibility  to move forward with their needs and their priorities as our guide.   Let me again welcome every new Member of the Senate. I want again to  congratulate the Democratic leader, and let me again acknowledge  President-Elect Trump for an impressive victory. He heard the voices of  Americans in every part of the country in ways others have not. He now  carries a heavy burden.   We will work with him to help the American people feel confident  again--confident in themselves and confident in their futures.   We look forward to the inauguration in just over 2 weeks. There is  now much serious work to be done. I look forward to working with each  of you to achieve it.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote  on the motion to proceed to S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, for the first time in three decades,  the Kentucky General Assembly began their regular session this month  without the fiery voice and passionate character of State  Representative Larry Clark. After an impressive career, Representative  Clark started a new adventure: retirement. He will be remembered for  many accomplishments in Frankfort, among them that he never missed a  single floor vote.   Despite our differences, Representative Clark and I both care deeply  for Kentucky. As speaker pro tempore of the house, he championed the  merger of the Louisville and Jefferson County governments, an issue I  fought for when I was the county judge/executive. We also share a  passion for the University of Louisville, and Representative Clark has  a record of achievements on behalf of the school.   I join the Kentucky General Assembly in congratulating Representative  Clark on his career of public service. He dedicated many years to  Kentucky, and I wish him well in retirement.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate a  distinguished Kentuckian and a friend. Robert L. Hendrickson has been  the Publisher of the Ledger Independent in Maysville, KY, since 1993.  When Bob announced that he would retire at the end of last year, I knew  that the paper was not only losing a great journalist, but it also was  losing a great man.   Bob graduated from the University of Georgia's Henry Grady School of  Journalism. Afterward, he moved back to Kentucky to work on his dad's  dairy farm. However, a pair of harsh winters in 1977 and 1978 convinced  him, in his own words, ``to put my journalism degree to work.'' He got  hired by the Ledger Independent and has served his community ever  since.   The Ledger Independent newspaper serves seven counties in northern  Kentucky and southern Ohio. Through a series of owners and publishers,  the paper continues a 150-year tradition of a local, independent, daily  newspaper in Maysville.   Bob became editor of the paper in 1985, calling it ``the best job in  the world.'' In 1993, he was promoted to publisher. He oversaw the  entire operation and guided the paper into the internet age with the  unveiling of Maysville Online. While working full time at the paper,  Bob also did postgraduate work at Northwestern University.   Bob and Missy Mann have never stopped working for their neighbors.  Bob further dedicates himself to his community, both through his  service on the board of directors of the Maysville Chamber of Commerce,  and as the moderator of several important political debates in his  area.   Bob is a great man and a pillar of his community, and I am honored to  call him a friend. I wish him and Missy well in retirement, and I join  with countless Kentuckians on thanking him for his service to  Maysville.  [[Page S46]]                                ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to offer my  congratulations to an outstanding young man and athlete, the University  of Louisville Cardinals' quarterback, Lamar Jackson. On December 10 of  last year, Cards fans watched with excitement as Jackson was awarded  the Heisman Memorial Trophy, the first in the history of my alma mater.  The award is given to the most outstanding player in college football,  and Jackson surely has earned it.   We have known for quite some time that Lamar Jackson would be  breaking many records. Here are just a few. Jackson was the first  player in NCAA Division I history to pass for 3,300 yards and run for  1,500 yards in one season. He holds the Atlantic Coastal Conference,  ACC, record for most touchdowns in a single season with 51. Only a  sophomore, Jackson is the youngest player ever to win the Heisman  Trophy at 19 years old, and he is the University of Louisville's first  ever Heisman Trophy finalist. The impressive list goes on and on.   It is clear that Lamar Jackson is a truly spectacular athlete. He has  earned his spot in the pantheon of college football greats. It is easy  to cheer when the quarterback hurdles a defender to score or runs  between some of the best defenses in the Nation. His drive and  dedication are traits we all admire, and just wait until you hear where  it all started.   In an interview, Jackson said ``[e]verything I do, I do for my  mother.'' At an early age, Jackson's mother, Felicia Jones, sparked his  interest in football, and she pushed him to be his best ever since.  When Lamar and his younger brother were just learning the game, their  mom would put on pads in the backyard and run plays with them. She  became an active part of all of his teams, all the way to the  University of Louisville. He said, ``She would tell me the bad things I  did. She wouldn't really tell me the good things I did. And I'd say  `All right, Mom. I've got to go fix it.'''   Lamar Jackson's story is just beginning. Under the guidance of some  of the best coaches in all of college sports and an athletic director  with a strategic vision for the future, the Cardinals are positioned to  make a real impact in college football. With the Heisman Trophy already  on the shelf, we can only wait and see what Lamar Jackson does next  year. As an avid fan of UofL football, I know I can hardly wait.   I would like to join with Cards fans across the Nation to  congratulate the entire University of Louisville Cardinals football  team and staff on an exciting season and especially congratulate the  2016 Heisman Trophy winner, Lamar Jackson. He has truly made it great  to be a Louisville Cardinal.                            ____________________     Mr. President, at the beginning of this year, one of  Louisville's foremost community servants began his much-deserved  retirement. I rise today to congratulate Joseph Tolan, a man of  distinction who dedicated his life to the people of Louisville and  Kentucky.   Many years ago, I had the pleasure of working alongside Joe. When I  served as the judge/executive of Jefferson County, Joe led the county  department for human services. I particularly remember his passion for  helping those around him, and that passion has been the driving force  of his career. And believe me, I can tell you, from firsthand  experience, that passion is contagious.   For the last 30 years, Joe has committed himself to the Metro United  Way, a Louisville organization that raises and distributes funds to  worthy causes around the region. Spending the last 15 years as  president and CEO, Joe led the effort to raise nearly $30 million every  year to support approximately 100 organizations. The community support  that Joe inspired has led Metro United Way to be ranked in the top 25  markets nationwide.   However, organizations like Metro United Way are measured by so much  more than just the donations they raise. True success is counted by the  lives impacted and the good work done. With a focus on education,  financial stability, and healthy living, Metro United Way impacts  thousands of families across the region every single day.   Since joining Metro United Way, Joe has been a major player in the  transformation of the city of Louisville and the entire region.  Although the organization is over 100 years old, it is constantly  adapting to meet today's challenges in the most effective ways  possible. With this commitment to excellence and a growing network of  strategic partnerships, Metro United Way proved to be a lasting force  for good in the community. During his tenure as president and CEO, Joe  hasn't just been a part of this innovation, he has been its leader.   Joe has surely earned his retirement, but I know many of us are very  sorry to see him go. He leaves behind an impressive list of  accomplishments and an organization well positioned to continue his  work. I want to extend my congratulations to Joe on such a successful  career of dedicated leadership always with a vision to help everyone  reach their fullest potential.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Thursday, January 5; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, and the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use  later in the day; finally, that following leader remarks, the Senate  resume consideration of S. Con. Res. 3.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:45 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, January 5, 2017, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
