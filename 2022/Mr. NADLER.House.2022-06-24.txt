 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1204, I call up  the bill (S. 2938) to designate the United States Courthouse and  Federal Building located at 111 North Adams Street in Tallahassee,  Florida, as the ``Joseph Woodrow Hatchett United States Courthouse and  Federal Building'', and for other purposes, with the Senate amendments  to the House amendment thereto, and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on S. 2938.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I did not comment on the decision  of the Supreme Court, just minutes ago, to revoke the constitutional  right to abortion, a right that millions of Americans have relied upon  for half a century.   Worse, Justice Thomas has indicated that this is merely the beginning  of a radical, rightwing effort to roll back other rights, including the  right to contraception, the right to marry whomever we choose, and the  fundamental right to privacy.   We should observe that the same Justices telling us today that  questions about reproductive rights must be left to the States, told us  just yesterday that the States cannot be trusted to regulate modern  firearms, weapons that were never dreamed of by the Framers of the  Second Amendment. History will prove these activists wrong on both  counts.   But today, Mr. Speaker, we take a historic first step toward ending  the epidemic of gun violence in this Nation, the only developed Nation  with this problem.   We come to this moment after the tragic loss of so many innocent  lives: 10 African Americans in Buffalo, targeted because of their race;  19 young students and 2 teachers in Uvalde, just a few days short of  their summer vacations; scores more lost in other mass shootings too  numerous to mention; and over 100 more Americans killed every day in  gun violence that never makes the headlines.   No piece of legislation can ever bring these lives back. No  legislation can make their families or their communities whole. But we  can act to keep others from facing the same trauma they have endured.   A few weeks ago, I was proud to bring forth the Protecting Our Kids  Act,  [[Page H5904]]  which took a bipartisan and comprehensive approach to ending gun  violence. I am pleased that the Senate incorporated portions of that  bill into their own legislation.   I wish there was more. I wish we could say we were doing everything  we could to prevent another parent from losing their child to gun  violence, but I am proud to be making an important start today.   This cannot be the last step, but we also cannot let another day go  by without taking action to make our communities safer and to keep even  one more family whole.   Recently, I have turned to a particular teaching in the Talmud:         Whoever takes one life, it is as if he kills the entire       world; and whoever saves one life, it is as if he saves the       entire world.    This legislation includes provisions that will save many lives. Like  the Protecting Our Kids Act, it includes funding to implement extreme  risk protection laws and the prohibition on straw purchasing. It also  strengthens background checks for those under 21, makes more sellers  responsible for conducting background checks, takes steps to address  the boyfriend loophole, and provides significant funding for programs  that will make our communities safer.   Today, we will send legislation to the President's desk, for the  first time in decades, that will make progress toward ending the  scourge of gun violence.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the  Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1130     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the distinguished Speaker of the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a member of the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lofgren), a member of the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished majority leader of the House.    Mr. Speaker, when the previous speaker refers to using  guns to protect tyranny, he is talking--whether he realizes it or not-- about stopping tyranny by turning those weapons against American  troops.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the distinguished gentleman  from California (Mr. Thompson), who is the chairman of the Gun Violence  Task Force.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Deutch).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from California (Mr. Lieu), who is a member of the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from California (Mr. Correa), who is a member of the  Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Crow).    Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time remains on each  side.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Michigan.  [[Page H5910]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Kelly).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from New Jersey (Ms. Sherrill).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from New Jersey.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Horsford).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Nevada.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New  York (Ms. Clarke), from the great Empire State.    Mr. Speaker, how much time remains on each side, please?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from New York (Mr. Meeks).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Leger Fernandez).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from New York (Mr. Higgins).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Foster).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from California (Mr. Gomez).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Perlmutter).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Chu).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, the difference between this country and other countries  is only that in this country do we have mass shootings and mass murders  of children. No other country has them.   We know from the experience in New Jersey, as Ms. Sherrill told us,  that when we pass strong gun control legislation, we can greatly reduce  the number of children and adults shot.   We hear from the other side of the aisle, ``No, we don't want to do  that.'' They are right: This legislation is the beginning.   This legislation is not perfect. It is a bipartisan compromise. It is  not nearly what we should do. It is not nearly what the House did, but  it is a beginning. It is a beginning in saving lives in this country.  [[Page H5914]]    Anyone who stands in its way is standing in the way of saving lives  in this country. I will not allow myself or anyone I associate with to  stand in the way of saving lives, many lives.   Again, I remind you, this is the only country that has it, and it is  not because we have more mentally ill than other countries. It is  because we do not have the gun control laws that other countries do.   Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to vote for this bill as a good  beginning, and I yield back the balance of my time.
