 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, we have all gotten robocalls. They are annoying,  disrupting, and actually can be dangerous.   Oftentimes, robocalls prey on our communities' most vulnerable  populations in hopes of capitalizing on their personal and private  information. Unfortunately, this problem is growing.   H.R. 3375, the Stopping Bad Robocalls Act, is a bipartisan solution,  ensuring that calls consumers receive are verified as legitimate.   I am also pleased that the legislation includes a bill that I was an  original cosponsor of called the Locking Up Robocallers Act. It  requires the Federal Communications Commission to report particularly  malicious robocall schemes to the Justice Department so that Federal  resources may continue to be properly leveraged to stop these schemes.  [[Page H7301]]    As a former U.S. attorney, I am really proud that the Justice  Department, working with the FTC and local law enforcement, has already  taken enforcement actions in over 94 cases, which has yielded blocking  of more than 1 billion robocalls so far.   Madam Speaker, I am reassured that with this bill, they will be able  to more efficiently and consistently pursue robocaller abusers. For  these reasons and many more, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
