 Mr. Speaker, we have three crises in our country right  now: We have a humanitarian crisis at the southern border. We could  talk about the dynamics of that, but let's be honest about it--we truly  do. We need to secure our Nation's borders, and we need to reopen our  government and pay our Federal workers, something I have been committed  to since I joined Congress.   So far, we have wasted more than 338 hours working on dead-end bills  that will not pass the Senate, the President won't sign, because my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle, or their leadership, won't  get in a room and negotiate with the President, with Mitch McConnell,  with the majority leader, with the minority leader--all in the same  room--and negotiate on the package that the President has put forward.   I spoke on that package last week. I held up this letter, which was a  January 6 letter from the President, from the administration, to the  chair of the Appropriations Committee and all the members. The other  side of the aisle was astonished. They didn't know what this letter  was.   That is a little bit demoralizing, if you think about it, why the  letter wasn't shared with all Members on the other side of the aisle.   You see, compromise means you don't get 100 percent of what you want,  but you move the ball forward. You move the ball down the road, and you  keep making progress.   Those same people who are calling it a border wall or a barrier or  whatever you want to call it--I do stress to my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle, call it about anything you want, short of a moat. If  you make progress, we move forward.   These same people who are now calling it immoral voted for border  security, border barriers, when there was a different President. Now  that it has President Trump's name on it, suddenly it has become evil.   Since January 3, President Trump has made two detailed proposals to  Congress on how to solve this problem--it shows that the President is  prepared to negotiate on it--a package of things that include border  security, technology at the border, strengthening our points of entry,  humanitarian aid, additional immigration judges, and, let me stress  this, providing assistance for people to apply for asylum from their  home countries rather than take that dangerous and treacherous journey  to the Mexican border.   Doctors Without Borders says that 31 percent of the women who make  that journey are sexually assaulted. The President wants to address  that. Neither of those proposals have even gotten a moment of  discussion from the other side of the aisle.   Anyone who spent 35 years in business, or even a few years in  business, as I have, would know that compromise means you deal with the  entirety of the problem. You negotiate the problem, and you get an  answer that moves it forward rather than say: Some things are out of  bounds; we are not going to talk about that.   The part I like now, lately, is: We will talk about it later; we  promise we will.   There is a song about that. It is called, ``Tomorrow, Tomorrow.''   Sorry. Now is the time to deal with it. Now is the time. And I agree:  Having people not paid--my dad was an autoworker. He was laid off  multiple times. Missing two paychecks is brutal. There is an answer to  that. It is called negotiate.   It is important that Members of the House and Senate and the  leadership take seriously the President's proposals, go to a room,  close the door, and negotiate rather than say, as has been said by the  current Speaker: zero dollars for the wall, maybe a dollar.    I don't care if you call it a wall. I don't care if you call it a  steel slat. I don't care if you call it a barrier. But we need security  at the southern border. Why is it we can't have that now?   Further, we have to end this and pay our Federal workers. We must end  this crisis and pay the workers. There is a route there.   Rather than spend 338 hours on the floor--in this whole posturing,  this whole profiling--sit in a room and spend 10 percent of that time,  33 hours, in one room. My guess is you would come to an answer on the  problem.   Why are we not doing that? Why are we not doing that? Our Democrats  on the other side of the aisle obstruct people being paid.   Last week, we proposed an amendment that would have, in fact,  retroactively opened the government to pay Federal employees. Six  Democrats joined us in that--only six--and it was defeated.   Again, if you want to pay the employees, pay them; don't use them as  hostages, as you have.   A couple summaries I wish to make: First, these are not the same  bills that you claim were bipartisan bills that passed appropriations.  As my colleague has noted, significant items have been pulled out of  that--life protections. I will go through a list. So they are not the  same bills.   Let's be honest on the floor and at least call them what they are.  They are Democratic versions of the previous bills that they put  through.    One of the questions I posed for my colleagues: Why is  it okay to begin running reelection campaigns now for an election to go  2 years from now? Why is it okay for the Presidential campaigns to  start on the backs of these workers and the southern border?   Someone answer that question for me, because that is what is  happening. That is what is happening all over the country. That is what  is happening on TV.                                time  1300    This is now the cause for which people are going to run campaigns.  And, frankly, as a result, yeah, we have government by blackmail, but  the blackmail is going on by the other side of the aisle that insists  they will only talk about certain components of this, but not all of  it, because they have now decided it is not politically expedient as  they are getting ready to run for office--some getting ready,  apparently, to run for President--and they want to use this as  leverage.   We can solve this problem in 1 day. I encourage my colleagues to do  so. Get the Speaker of the House, the minority leader, majority leader  of the Senate, the minority leader of the Senate, and the President in  a room, close the door, and don't come out until you have an answer  that they all agree to. How hard is it to understand that concept?
