 Mr. President, we have just heard a discussion of the  issue of tax reform, and my colleague across the aisle has said there  should be no corporate minimum tax on corporations, and yet Americans  know that billionaire companies one after the other--some of the most  profitable companies in our entire country, companies like Amazon-- don't pay a single cent in tax.   They use our legal system. They use our road system. They use our  education system. They use it all in vast quantities and don't  contribute a single dime. One single ordinary worker does more to pay  for all of the infrastructure these massive companies utilize than the  company does.   It is about time corporations that make massive profits pay  something, and 15 percent isn't even their fair share. And it is part  of a global agreement to hold corporations accountable, so they don't  skip from one country to another, to another, to another, evading  everyone everywhere.   My colleague also said a lot about why we should not put a 1 percent  tax on stock buybacks. Let's understand what stock buybacks are. First  of all, a president of a company works to get a board, and that board  is compensated, and then that board makes lots of decisions about,  well, the welfare of the top executives. They set the salaries for the  top executives, and then they give them stock options.   Now, if you have a stock option and then your company buys back  stock, every share gets more valuable; you make a massive amount of  money. This is a corrupt system. It does nothing to further the  investment of the company and the productivity of America. It does  nothing to increase the R&D--research and development--that goes into  new products. It does nothing to make their product more price  competitive.   It is ``enrich the rich'' scheme, and putting a 1 percent fee on that  to help pay for all of the infrastructure the companies use is  certainly more than appropriate. In fact, we should simply ban the  stock buybacks. This is a very, very modest reform in the right  direction.   It is the case that in this Chamber, under the Republican stock  provisions,  [[Page S4170]]  1 year after another under their tax provisions, they have basically  enabled the billionaires and corporations to escape any contribution to  the welfare of our country. That is wrong. These tax reforms are right,  and the healthcare provisions will help.   They are not nearly as powerful as I would like to see, certainly. I  want to negotiate every single drug, the way the Veterans'  Administration does, the way every foreign country does, every  developed country does. We should get the best prices, not the worst in  the developed world.   And in climate, while this, again, doesn't do everything I want, the  investments in solar and wind will drive a bold, determined transition  from fossil fuel energy to renewable energy.   We have to electrify everything with renewable energy. If we do that,  set that example for the world and work with the world, we have some  chance of humanity tackling this massive problem of climate chaos that  is causing so much trouble across our land--from the massive floods in  Kentucky to the forest fires of the Pacific Northwest, town after town  being burned down. It is really America that has to lead the way.   There is a lot more I would like to see in this bill, just as my  colleague from Ohio has a whole series of ideas.   I filed a lot of amendments, but I can't pull them up tonight. I  can't ask for a vote on them because under the structure that we are  dealing with now, anything that changes may result in this bill never  passing, and so this is why, when we come back in the next session of  Congress, we have to reform this Senate so we can do legitimate  amendments like my colleague from Ohio suggested in a process where  they get due consideration and don't torpedo the bill under which we  are discussing them.   Those reforms are so essential because the arc of this Chamber has  been one in which individual amendments have been incredibly  suppressed. It is unacceptable. We are all so frustrated with the fact  that deals are made by basically four individuals leading the two  Chambers off this floor rather than determined and responsible debate-- public, transparent debate--on the floor of this Chamber.   So the right answer is to come back and make this place work so that  all ideas--as my colleague from Ohio listed his, I have my list. I want  to add in affordable housing. I want to stop all the drilling. I want  to fund the community colleges. I want preschool to be counted. I want  to fix so that we can take the electric vehicle tax credits and do even  better with them. I want to include the two-wheel and the three-wheel  vehicles. I want to put in the summer benefit for food that has been so  effective in helping so many children make it through the summer. But I  can't do these things.   Let's fix this Senate. Let's have the types of debates we should  have, and tonight, let's pass this bill for the right steps in the  right direction on tax reform, on healthcare, and on climate.    Mr. President, this amendment does require that the  Secretary of the Interior grant leases for coal mining, but granting  more leases for coal mining is going to do nothing for our coal miners  today because we are in the situation where the existing coal mines are  looking for more customers. That is the challenge; not more leases.   So I know that if this was something that would help the coal miners,  that it would already be in this bill, given the knowledge and  understanding of my colleague from West Virginia.   So jeopardizing the employment of existing coal miners is certainly  not in the interest of any of us, and I urge my colleagues to vote no  on this amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 5418
