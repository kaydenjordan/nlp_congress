 Madam President, I rise today to celebrate the  duel between two titans and legends of Mexican soccer at el Super  Clasico, the Club Deportivo de Guadalajara ``Chivas'' and Club  America--a duel that will be celebrated in my home city of Atlanta, GA,  on September 25, 2022.   The city of Atlanta and the State of Georgia are home to rich,  vibrant, and celebrated Latino communities. I am thrilled to honor the  contributions of the Hispanic community in Georgia during Hispanic  Heritage Month by hosting these soccer legends in what will go down in  history as one of the greatest games our continent has ever seen.   This world-renowned match has brought thousands of soccer fans in  Mexico and the United States together for almost 80 years to celebrate  the history and unmatched rivalry of these soccer titans, a passion  that unites us.   Founded 103 years ago, Club America has won a total of 35 official  national and international titles. Club Deportivo Chivas de Guadalajara  has obtained a total of 26 national and international championships. In  the last 5 years, the Chivas and America have played for sold-out  crowds in Los Angeles, Chicago, and Dallas. And this year in Atlanta  will not be different.   I join with our community to witness the legacy of this beautiful  game that reminds us of the unbreakable bond we share.   May tradition, history, and legacy guide our continued commitment to  celebrate what unites us.                            ____________________
