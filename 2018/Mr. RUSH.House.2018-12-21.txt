 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 3191, the Civil  Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act of 2018. I was delighted when  Senator Jones introduced companion legislation to my bill, H.R. 1272,  and I am even more excited to see that his bill has passed the Senate  by unanimous consent and is now before the House.   Mr. Speaker, with the passage of this legislation, families and  communities that have waited too long for answers about the loss of  loved ones during the tumultuous Civil Rights Era may finally have the  chance for closure.   Mr. Speaker, this bill came to fruition because of the hard work of a  group of students from Hightstown High School in New Jersey and their  teacher, Mr. Stuart Wexler. These dedicated students learned firsthand  the legislative process, from drafting to markup, to where we stand  today, floor passage. I thank them for their dedication to this cause  and applaud them for their diligence.
