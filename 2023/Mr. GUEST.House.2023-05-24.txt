 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Kelle Strickland, who  is retiring after 20 years of service to the House of Representatives.   Kelle is currently serving as my counsel on the Committee on Ethics  and has spent two decades providing invaluable advice to Members and  staff.   A native Alabamian, Kelle started her career on the Hill as an  intern. She was quickly recognized as a leader and served for 6 years  as the legislative director to former Congressman Jo Bonner. She served  5 years as chief of staff to Congressman   Michael Burgess, 3 years as  chief of staff in the Office of House Sergeant at Arms, and the last  several years in her role as counsel to the ranking member and later  chairman of the House Committee of Ethics.   I could not have been able to make the transition into my role at the  Committee on Ethics without Kelle's guidance. She has served as a  wealth of institutional knowledge and a trusted adviser to me since  last August.   Kelle's presence in the House will be missed, but she will not go  far. Kelle will continue to be a resource to the institution at the  helm of the Congressional Institute, where she will undoubtedly enjoy  continued success.   Mr. Speaker, I ask the House to join me in congratulating Kelle and  thanking her for her many years of service.                            ____________________
