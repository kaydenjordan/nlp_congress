 Mr. Speaker, I rise on this day in opposition  to the continuing resolution, which includes the Republican extreme and  restrictive immigration and border security legislation, H.R. 2.   This cruel legislation would force draconian restrictions and  punishments on migrants and asylum seekers and set America's  immigration priorities back decades. This bill would damage the asylum  system, a process millions upon millions of vulnerable and desperate  people and families have long depended on for their safety and future.   Instead of putting forth legislation that can pass the Senate and  avert a government shutdown, extreme Republicans would rather hold the  economy and border security hostage, throwing millions of lives into a  tailspin.   Let's be clear. Any bill that would allow vulnerable migrant children  to be inhumanely detained by Border Patrol for up to a month, to be  ripped from their families and locked up from the world, is  unacceptable. It is fundamentally un-American.   To treat innocent people who are looking for a better life in our  Nation with such contempt, such vitriol, such callousness, while also  making American families vulnerable in putting food on their tables,  that is not leadership. It is called cowardice.   Every American, no matter how long their families have called this  country their own, should be outraged at the GOP embracing the Trump  administration's failed and immoral border policies to keep the  government open.
