 Mr. Speaker, right now, we are witnessing  the violent acts of a Russian dictator in Eastern Europe. Vladimir  Putin is attempting to rehang the Iron Curtain, murdering innocent  women and children who stand in his path.   To help put an end to the war, America must stand united with the  free people of Ukraine and continue to provide them with the lethal aid  that they need to defend themselves.   It is time for the United States to stop the flow of Russian oil to  the rest of the world and impose harsh sanctions against Russia and its  leaders. Vladimir Putin and corrupt Russian oligarchs must know that  they will pay a steep price for their unwarranted aggression. It is  time for President Biden to allow for America to become energy  independent again and share our resources across the world.   Energy independence means national security. Now is the time to  promote American energy, and now is the time to stand with the  Ukrainian people.                            ____________________
