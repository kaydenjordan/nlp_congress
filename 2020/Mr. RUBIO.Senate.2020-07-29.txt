 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Committee  on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize a small  business that exemplifies the American entrepreneurial spirit at the  heart of our country. It is my privilege to recognize a woman-owned  small business known for its excellence in industry and environmental  stewardship. This week, it is my pleasure to honor Hydra Engineering  and Construction, LLC, of Crawfordville, FL, as the Senate Small  Business of the Week.   In 2008, Leslie Hope established Hydra Engineering after she left her  position as a partner in an engineering firm to pursue her dream of  being a small business owner. After graduating from the University of  South Florida, Leslie started planning how to open her own engineering  company. Leslie turned to her local Small Business Development Center  where she enrolled Hydra Engineering in the U.S. Small Business  Administration's 8(a) business development program. This program  provides resources, mentorship, and training to help small businesses  owned by socially and economically disadvantaged persons compete for  government contracts.   Over the next 12 years, Leslie rebranded her enterprise as Hydra  Engineering and Construction to reflect its growth and expansion. She  completed the 8(a) program, was certified by the State of Florida as a  Minority Business Enterprise and as a Disadvantaged Business Enterprise  by the U.S. Department of Transportation.   Hydra Engineering has worked for several Florida private companies  and  [[Page S4581]]  agencies, including the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation  Commission. They have completed projects in 16 other States, working  for the National Park Service, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and  the U.S. Forest Service.   For their entrepreneurship, innovation and environmental stewardship,  Hydra Engineering has been recognized by local, State, and industry  organizations. In 2018, they were nominated as a GrowFL Florida Company  to Watch, recognizing their status as a Floridian second-stage company  demonstrating high marketplace performance and innovation. As one of  the world's fastest growing USF-alumni owned or led businesses, Hydra  Engineering earned the USF Fast 56 Award in 2016 and 2018.  Additionally, Leslie was nominated as the 2011 SBA North Florida Region  Small Business Person of the Year. She also sits on the Florida  Agricultural and Mechanical University-Florida State University  Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering Advisory Board.   Like many small businesses across Florida, Hydra was impacted by the  coronavirus pandemic. When the U.S. Small Business Administration  launched the Paycheck Protection Program, Leslie applied for funding.  The PPP provides forgivable loans to impacted small businesses and  nonprofits who maintain their payroll during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Thanks to the PPP, Hydra Engineering is able to support its employees,  many who work and reside in Wakulla County.   Hydra Engineering and Construction demonstrates how small firms use  SBA resources to grow. I applaud their commitment to excellence and  unique role in supporting Florida's critical infrastructure.   Congratulations to Leslie and the entire team, I look forward to  watching your continued growth and success in Florida.                            ____________________
