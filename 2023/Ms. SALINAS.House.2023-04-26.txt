 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the default on  America act. This dangerous bill is nothing more than an attempt to  extract extreme concessions that will benefit big corporations, poison  our environment, and hurt working families.   To extract those concessions, House Republicans are threatening to  default on our debt, something that could push us headlong into a  recession.   If we were to default on our debt, 84,000 families in Oregon's Sixth  District alone would have their Social Security payments jeopardized.   Mr. Speaker, 278,000 members of my community could lose their  healthcare benefits, and small businesses in Oregon's Sixth District  could be forced to pay an additional $2,500 in total loan payments.   This bill is DOA in the Senate, which gives my colleagues the chance  to go back to the drawing board and present a clean debt ceiling bill.   I urge them to take this opportunity to do right by the American  people.                            ____________________
