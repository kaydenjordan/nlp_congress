 Mr. President, along with Senator Collins, I am  reintroducing legislation that would eliminate the sunset date for the  United States Interagency Council on Homelessness (the Council) so that  this agency can further build upon its success in helping to prevent  and end homelessness.   The Council was launched under the Reagan Administration as part of  the landmark McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act of 1987. Since  then, it has worked across the Federal government and private sector to  coordinate homeless assistance nationally. In 2009, the Homeless  Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing, or HEARTH Act,  which I introduced along with Senator Collins and others, expanded the  Council's role to work with stakeholders to develop a national  strategic plan to end homelessness, which has guided its work to  develop effective strategies to prevent and end homelessness.   Since 2010 when this national strategic plan was first developed, the  U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) reports that  overall homelessness has decreased by 13%, chronic homelessness by 16%,  and family homelessness by 25%. In addition, we have seen veterans'  homelessness drop by 49%. This progress is not only a result of the  more than $600 million federal investment in housing and supportive  services through programs like HUD-VASH, but is also because of the  direction the Council provides to the Department of Veterans Affairs  (VA) and HUD, as well as public housing agencies administering  assistance at the local level. Specifically, the Council helps diverse  partners align their resources, efforts, goals, and measures of success  for serving homeless veterans. According to the Council, it ``has led a  process to confirm that 78 communities and 3 entire states have  effectively ended Veteran homelessness. 35 states now have at least one  community that has ended Veteran homelessness. Some recent  confirmations include: Abilene, Texas, Lexington, Kentucky, Little  Rock, Arkansas, Poplar Bluff, Missouri, and the 71 counties in  Mississippi that make up the Mississippi Balance of State Continuum of  Care.'' In order to further these efforts and also tackle veterans'  homelessness on the front end, the Senate's fiscal year 2020  Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies  (THUD) Appropriations bill includes language I authored directing the  Council to improve the coordination between the Department of Defense,  the VA, the Department of Labor, and HUD in order to prevent  servicemembers from being discharged into homelessness.   In addition to addressing homelessness in our communities, the  Council has also helped to save money. We know that people experiencing  homelessness are more likely to use expensive health care services and  spend more time in incarceration--which are extremely costly to  taxpayers, States, and local governments. According to the National  Alliance to End Homelessness, ``based on 22 different studies from  across the nation providing permanent supportive housing to chronically  homeless people creates net savings of $4,800 per person per year,  through reduced spending on jails, hospitals, shelters, and other  emergency services.''   The Council has extended these estimated savings by identifying and  tailoring cost-effective solutions that reduce the use of health care  services, as well as recidivism, for individuals experiencing chronic  homelessness. In fiscal year 2019 alone, the Council's modest $3.6  million budget catalyzed more than $6 billion in combined Federal  resources that aim to address homelessness. The Council develops  national strategies that inform the work and improve the cost- effectiveness of programs administered by 19 Federal agencies, and as a  result, communities and States are able to utilize housing, health,  education, and labor funding more strategically and effectively.   In our current budgetary environment we must have a wise and creative  arm that helps our communities maximize resources and opportunities  where possible, ensuring we are actually addressing homelessness, and  not contributing to it. The Council is proof that the government can  work and save money in the process, and our bipartisan legislation  ensures that the Council's doors remain open until there truly is an  end to homelessness nationwide.
