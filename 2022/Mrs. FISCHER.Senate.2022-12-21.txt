 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, this is       one of those election takeover bills.        Last January, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle tried to       break Senate rules to ram this bill through Congress. The American       people do not want the Federal takeover of anything, and our Founders       understood that. That is why anything not enumerated in the       Constitution goes to State and local government--the institutions that       are closest to the people that they represent. That is transparency.       That is fairness.        The best election laws are the ones that make it easy to vote but       hard to cheat. And we already know that this is possible. With       Georgia's new law in place, the State set a new record for most ballots       ever cast in a midterm election. Both early voting and mail-in voting       broke the alltime midterm records. These Republican-led States--they       got it right. Their critics got it wrong.        This election takeover bill, which the Senate has already rejected,       is not going to be passed today.        Therefore, I object.
