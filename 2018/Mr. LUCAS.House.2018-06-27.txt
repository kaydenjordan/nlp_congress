Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous material on H.R. 5906, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5906, the ARPA-E Act of 2018.  This legislation requires the Department to refocus ARPA-E towards  developing transformative science and technology solutions to address  energy, environment, economic, and national security issues.   ARPA-E was created to ensure that the U.S. energy sector maintained a  competitiveness in developing emerging energy technologies. The program  was established to help develop high-potential, high-impact energy  technologies that were too early stage to attract private sector  investment.   ARPA-E was designed to bring this finite R&D funding for a limited  time, with the intention to make quick, notable impact on the  development of new energy technologies.   In order to accomplish this goal, ARPA-E was given a unique  management structure, with flexibility to start and stop research  projects that are no longer achieving individual goals, expedited  hiring and firing authority to make sure that ARPA-E staff could  adequately select and support projects, and the tools to identify  market challenges that could affect the advancement in project  technologies.   However, we have all heard of the concerns with ARPA-E. The first is  the worry that this is just one more of the same from DOE. With the  Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy program office funded at over  $2.3 billion, it is easy to see why some would ask if we need another  clean energy program.   Second, we have all heard of concerns over the years that ARPA-E  wasn't meeting its intended goal--to fund the kind of technologies that  are so innovative they would never attract private sector investment-- but was instead provided funding to big companies with  [[Page H5780]]  access to market capital, or funding research that was already under  way in other Federal agencies or in the private sector.   The Science, Space and Technology Committee on which I serve as vice  chairman particularly explored these concerns under the Obama  administration. I believe there were valid concerns that must be  addressed for the program to continue.   ARPA-E is a program that can have tremendous impact on the  development of new energy technologies, but we can't have another  agency playing favorites or handing out grants that distort our energy  markets.   The bill we will consider today will address these concerns and  enable ARPA-E to apply its innovative approach to a more appropriate  set of technology challenges within the DOE mission, as the Trump  administration sees it.   It does not--I repeat, this bill does not--authorize new spending or  expand the size of the program. H.R. 5906 will refocus the mission of  ARPA-E to mirror the full DOE mission and empower the Agency to promote  science and technology-driven solutions.   My bill will allow the Agency to solve big challenges, like nuclear  waste management and cleanup and improving the reliability, resiliency,  and security of the electric grid.   The ARPA-E Act also provides important steps to prevent the  duplication of research across DEO and to require applicants to  indicate they have attempted to find private sector financing for a  particular technology.   This is a good-government reform that is vital to ensuring that ARPA- E can't be abused for crony capitalism purposes in the future. We can't  afford to spend limited taxpayer dollars competing with the private  sector.   H.R. 5906 will align ARPA-E's innovative approach with the right  mission goals and management. It will build on the basic science and  early-stage research of the Department and help fast-track new  technologies that will grow our economy.   I want to thank Chairman Lamar Smith and Ranking Member Johnson for  cosponsoring this important legislation and for their leadership in  advocating the reformed Agency functions within the Department of  Energy's missions and goals. I am grateful for the opportunity to work  alongside the other members of the committee to craft a bipartisan bill  that will improve--yes, improve--a DOE research program but that still  allows Congress the opportunity to reduce funding for the program as  appropriate.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Smith), the chairman of the Committee on Science, Space, and  Technology.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, reforming the mission and the goals of ARPA-E will  transform the Agency to do what the DOE does best: develop innovative  technology solutions to complex science, energy, and national security  challenges.   I again want to thank my nine colleagues on the Science, Space, and  Technology Committee who cosponsored H.R. 5906, including Chairman  Smith and Ranking Member Johnson. I want to thank the new leadership  staff at ARPA-E and the Department of Energy, who provided technical  comments and policy recommendations as we developed this legislation.   I urge the adoption of this bipartisan, good-government legislation,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
