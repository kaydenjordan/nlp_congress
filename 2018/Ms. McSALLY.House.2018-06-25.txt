 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5206) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to  establish the Office of Biometric Identity Management, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5206         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Office of Biometric Identity       Management Authorization Act of 2018'' or the ``OBIM       Authorization Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE OFFICE OF BIOMETRIC IDENTITY                     MANAGEMENT.         (a) In General.--Title VII of the Homeland Security Act of       2002 (6 U.S.C. 341 et. seq.) is amended by adding at the end       the following new section:       ``SEC. 710. OFFICE OF BIOMETRIC IDENTITY MANAGEMENT.         ``(a) Establishment.--The Office of Biometric Identity       Management is established within the Management Directorate       of the Department.        ``(b) Director.--        ``(1) In general.--The Office of Biometric Identity       Management shall be administered by the Director of the       Office of Biometric Identity Management (in this section       referred to as the `Director') who shall report to the       Secretary, or to another official of the Department, as the       Secretary may direct.        ``(2) Qualifications and duties.--The Director shall--        ``(A) have significant professional management experience,       as well as experience in the field of biometrics and identity       management;        ``(B) lead the Department's biometric identity services to       support anti-terrorism, counter-terrorism, border security,       credentialing, national security, and public safety;        ``(C) enable operational missions across the Department by       receiving, matching, storing, sharing, and analyzing       biometric and associated biographic and encounter data;        ``(D) deliver biometric identity information and analysis       capabilities to--        ``(i) the Department and its components;        ``(ii) appropriate Federal, State, local, and tribal       agencies;        ``(iii) appropriate foreign governments; and        ``(iv) appropriate private sector entities;        ``(E) support the law enforcement, public safety, national       security, and homeland security missions of other Federal,       State, local, and tribal agencies, as appropriate;        ``(F) manage the operation of the Department's primary       biometric repository and identification system;        ``(G) manage Biometric Support Centers to provide biometric       identification and verification analysis and services to the       Department, appropriate Federal, State, local, and tribal       agencies, appropriate foreign governments, and appropriate       private sector entities;        ``(H) oversee the implementation of Department-wide       standards for biometric conformity, and work to make such       standards Government-wide;        ``(I) in coordination with the Department's Office of       Policy, and in consultation with relevant component offices       and headquarters offices, enter into data sharing agreements       with appropriate Federal, State, local, and foreign agencies       to support immigration, law enforcement, national security,       and public safety missions;        ``(J) maximize interoperability with other Federal, State,       local, and foreign biometric systems, as appropriate;        ``(K) ensure the activities of the Office of Biometric       Identity Management are carried out in compliance with the       policies and procedures established by the Privacy Officer       appointed under section 222; and        ``(L) carry out other duties and powers prescribed by law       or delegated by the Secretary.        ``(c) Deputy Director.--There shall be in the Office of       Biometric Identity Management a Deputy Director, who shall       assist the Director in the management of the Office.        ``(d) Other Authorities.--        ``(1) In general.--The Director may establish such other       offices within the Office of Biometric Identity Management as       the Director determines necessary to carry out the missions,       duties, functions, and authorities of the Office.        ``(2) Notification.--If the Director exercises the       authority provided by paragraph (1), the Director shall       notify the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and       Governmental Affairs of the Senate not later than 30 days       before exercising such authority.''.        (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents in section       1(b) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended by       adding after the item relating to section 709 the following       new item:  ``Sec. 710. Office of Biometric Identity Management.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Terrorists, transnational criminal organizations, and others seeking  to do this Nation harm are constantly coming up with new ways to cross  our borders.   We used to rely on biographic information, such as names and  birthdays, to identify and prevent these threats from entering our  country. But the development of biometric identity-matching technology  allows us to more quickly and effectively confirm people that they are  who they say they are.   The use of biometric technology to positively identify individuals  who seek entry into the United States is a 21st century solution to  multiple homeland security problems. The technology enhances the  security of our citizens, facilitates legitimate travel and trade, and  bolsters the integrity of our immigration system.   My bill authorizes the Office of Biometric Identity Management, or  OBIM, the primary biometric repository for DHS and other Federal  agencies that are vital to our national security. OBIM operates a  database of more than 225 million unique identities that include  fingerprint-based biometrics, as well as face and iris holdings that  allow it to provide biometric matching, storing, and sharing services  across the U.S. Government.   It processes more than 300,000 daily biometric transactions,  reviewing more than 360 known or suspected terrorist records for  resolution on a daily basis.   OBIM also supports DHS's efforts to complete a biometric exit  program. Putting this biometric exit system in place is, as the 9/11  Commission noted, ``an essential investment in our national security.''  More than 15 years later, large numbers of foreign nationals continue  to overstay their visas or disappear into the United States, just as  four of the 9/11 hijackers did.   Congress has passed multiple laws since 2004 mandating the creation  of the biometric exit system, though we are still waiting for it to  come to fruition.   OBIM is responsible for a key element of our national security, but  has not been authorized by statute. This bill, the Office of Biometric  Identity Management Authorization Act of 2018, will finally codify this  into law.   In the current high-risk threat environment, it is vital that we  place greater emphasis on biometric identity technology as a  counterterrorism tool and provide OBIM with the resources necessary to  further protect the homeland in the face of an evolving threat.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join  me in supporting this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague from Rhode Island's support on  this bill and our longstanding relationship that we had since we grew  up in a similar neighborhood before I fell in love with Arizona and  never wanted to see another winter again. But anyway, I digress.   Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5207) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to  establish the immigration advisory program, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5207         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Immigration Advisory Program       Authorization Act of 2018'' or the ``IAP Authorization Act of       2018''.       SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION OF THE IMMIGRATION ADVISORY PROGRAM.

IMMIGRATION ADVISORY PROGRAM.         ``(a) In General.--There is authorized within U.S. Customs       and Border Protection an immigration advisory program (in       this section referred to as the `program') for U.S. Customs       and Border Protection officers, pursuant to an agreement with       a host country, to assist air carriers and security employees       at foreign airports with review of traveler information       during the processing of flights bound for the United States.        ``(b) Activities.--In carrying out the program, U.S.       Customs and Border Protection officers may--        ``(1) be present during processing of flights bound for the       United States;        ``(2) assist air carriers and security employees with       document examination and traveler security assessments;        ``(3) provide relevant training to air carriers, security       employees, and host-country authorities;        ``(4) analyze electronic passenger information and       passenger reservation data to identify potential threats;        ``(5) engage air carriers and travelers to confirm       potential terrorist watchlist matches;        ``(6) make recommendations to air carriers to deny       potentially inadmissable passengers  [[Page H5634]]       boarding flights bound for the United States; and        ``(7) conduct other activities to secure flights bound for       the United States, as directed by the Commissioner of U.S.       Customs and Border Protection.        ``(c) Notification to Congress.--Not later than 60 days       before an agreement with the government of a host country       pursuant to the program described in this section enters into       force, the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection       shall provide the Committee on Homeland Security of the House       of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and       Governmental Affairs of the Senate with--        ``(1) a copy of such agreement, which shall include--        ``(A) the identification of the host country with which       U.S. Customs and Border Protection intends to enter into such       agreement;        ``(B) the location at which activities described in       subsection (b) will be conducted pursuant to such agreement;       and        ``(C) the terms and conditions for U.S. Customs and Border       Protection personnel operating at such location;        ``(2) country-specific information on the anticipated       homeland security benefits associated with such agreement;        ``(3) an assessment of the impacts such agreement will have       on U.S. Customs and Border Protection domestic port of entry       staffing;        ``(4) information on the anticipated costs over the five       fiscal years after such agreement enters into force       associated with carrying out such agreement;        ``(5) details on information sharing mechanisms to ensure       that U.S. Customs and Border Protection has current       information to prevent terrorist and criminal travel; and        ``(6) other factors that the Commissioner determines       necessary for Congress to comprehensively assess the       appropriateness of carrying out the program.        ``(d) Amendment of Existing Agreements.--Not later than 30       days before a substantially amended program agreement with       the government of a host country in effect as of the date of       the enactment of this section enters into force, the       Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection shall       provide to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and       Governmental Affairs of the Senate--        ``(1) a copy of such agreement, as amended; and        ``(2) the justification for such amendment.        ``(e) Definitions.--In this section, the terms `air       carrier' and `foreign air carrier' have the meanings given       such terms in section 40102 of title 49, United States       Code.''.        (b) Conforming Amendment.--Subsection (c) of section 411 of       the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 211) is amended--        (1) in paragraph (18), by striking ``and'' after the       semicolon at the end;        (2) by redesignating paragraph (19) as paragraph (20); and        (3) by inserting after paragraph (18) the following new       paragraph:        ``(19) carry out section 419, relating to the immigration       advisory program; and''.        (c) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents in section       1(b) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended by       inserting after the item relating to section 418 the       following new item:  ``Sec. 419. Immigration advisory program.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, a major part of keeping the homeland safe is making sure  we prevent bad actors from ever reaching our shores. In order to do  this, we must continue to push out our borders with programs that  utilize a combination of vetting and interviews conducted by  experienced law enforcement agents.   The Customs and Border Protection Immigration Advisory Program, or  IAP, accomplishes just that. The IAP program deploys specially trained  CBP officers to major last-point-of-departure airports that offer  direct flights to the United States. It is the responsibility of these  officers to recommend that airlines do not allow foreign nationals who  would be deemed inadmissible upon arrival or present a significant  security threat to board an airplane bound for the United States.   This program enhances our national security by preventing high-risk  individuals from boarding an airplane bound for our homeland. In fiscal  year 2017, there were a total of 4,328 no-board recommendations made  across 12 different IAP airport locations. IAP is especially important  in countries with significant terrorist screening database hits.   The IAP program is not currently authorized by statute, but H.R.  5207, the Immigration Advisory Program Authorization Act of 2018, will  finally codify this important safety and security program into law. I  ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to please join me in  supporting this commonsense legislation, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Rhode Island for his support  on this bipartisan legislation. I urge my colleagues to support this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
