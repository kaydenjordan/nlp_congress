 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize a  family-owned small business and second-chance employment opportunity,  DV8 Kitchen of Lexington, KY, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.   In 2017, Rob and Diane Perez opened DV8 Kitchen in Lexington, KY. The  couple, who met while working in the restaurant industry, ran a  successful restaurant in town. In 2013, Rob and Diane were dismayed to  discover that they had lost 13 employees to addiction over 10 years and  that half the cases were related to opioid drugs. Rob, who had overcome  alcoholism when he was young, understood firsthand the challenges of  recovery. Together, Rob and Diane decided to pursue a business venture  that would provide dignified work and validate those in recovery. After  a 2-year planning process, DV8 Kitchen came together in just 4 and half  months. There was an outpouring of support from local families and  businesses, ranging from monetary investments to local professionals  donating their services to the project. In September 2017, DV8 Kitchen  began touching lives in Lexington, one meal at a time.   Today, DV8 Kitchen continues their transformative work as a second- chance employment opportunity. The restaurant provides hearty, home- cooked Southern fare and is known for its homemade baked goods and  bread, which it sells wholesale to other restaurants. Rob and Diane  partner with local organizations and treatment centers, like Shepard's  House, to identify and hire individuals in recovery. Beyond employment,  DV8 Kitchen provides community, purpose, and job skills. Through  volunteer-taught workshops and mentoring, employees are equipped to  continue rebuilding their lives. Despite the challenges of the COVID-19  pandemic, Rob and Diane were able to keep DV8 Kitchen running and  continue their critical mission of supporting individuals in recovery.  Additionally, in fall 2021, DV8 Kitchen opened a second location with a  larger bakery, right on Lexington's Third Street.   Beyond DV8 Kitchen, Rob and Diane are committed enabling small  businesses to support workers in recovery. Through Soulfull Enterprise,  an immersive training experience, local nonprofits, small businesses,  and corporations are equipped to hire and integrate second-chance  employees into their organizations. Additionally, the DV8 Kitchen  Vocational Training Foundation, Inc., trains and equips individuals in  recovery to work in the restaurant industry. DV8 Kitchen's remarkable  mission and success has been recognized at the local, regional, and  national level. Their work has been profiled by local media, including  WTVQ, WKYT, and Lex 18, and in national outlets like the New York  Times, NBC News, and Oprah Magazine. In addition to its social impact,  DV8 Kitchen has earned accolades for its food, including being  recognized by Yelp as one of the Top 100 Places to Eat in the U.S. in  2019.   DV8 Kitchen is a remarkable example of the critical role small  businesses play in uplifting and building community. Family-owned small  businesses like DV8 Kitchen form the heart of towns across Kentucky,  regularly stepping up to support their communities and transform lives.  Congratulations to Rob, Diane, and the entire team at DV8 Kitchen. I  wish them the best of luck and look forward to watching their continued  growth and success in Kentucky.                            ____________________
