 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the  South Asian Heart Health Awareness and Research Act.   This bipartisan measure will raise awareness in the South Asian  community about alarming increases in heart disease and invest in ways  to reverse this trend.   South Asians in the United States are those who immigrated or whose  families immigrated from countries including India, Pakistan,  Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Nepal. South Asians represent the sixth  largest and fastest-growing ethnic group in our nation.   Despite a traditional diet high in lentils, vegetables, grains and  spices, heart disease is on the rise in these communities. A Stanford  study found that South Asians' risk of having a heart attack before 50  is four times greater than the general population's.   South Asians also have the highest prevalence of Type 2 diabetes. As  diabetes is one of the most serious drivers of heart disease, stats  underscore the urgent need for action.   The tools and research this bill promotes will give us the insight  needed to save lives not just in the South Asian community, but the  greater public, too.   I thank Congresswoman Jayapal for her vision in developing this bill  and urge my colleagues to support it.
