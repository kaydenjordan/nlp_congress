 Mr. Speaker, 44 years ago this week, the Supreme Court  ruled in Roe v. Wade in favor of a woman's right to make her own  decisions about her own body. It is outrageous that today, more than  four decades later, President Trump and my Republican colleagues have  made restricting choice their first order of business.   Yesterday, President Trump signed an executive order banning health  organizations that receive U.S. funding from even mentioning abortion  as a medical option for their patients. And today, this House is  launching a radical assault on women's health care that penalizes women  and small businesses that choose private health insurance plans that  cover abortion services.   The effect of these unprecedented restrictions is clear: restricting  the comprehensive health coverage available for women.   Terminating a pregnancy is a personal choice that should be a woman's  alone, made in consultation with her family and her physician.  Politicians have no role in this process.   I urge my colleagues to end this backward attack on women's rights  and start tackling the real challenges voters sent us here to address.                            ____________________
