 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  student athletes from the University of Virginia for their success in  winning the 2022 NCAA Division I Men's Tennis National Championship.   Each year the NCAA supports student athletes from roughly 1,100  institutions of higher learning sponsoring 90 championships in 24  sports. Over half a million student athletes from across the United  States compete each year for a national championship.   Winning an NCAA championship is truly a remarkable achievement and  something deserving of celebration.   On Sunday, May 22, 2022, the many years of hard work and perseverance  of these UVA student athletes paid off. They defeated Kentucky 4-0,  securing the program's fifth NCAA Division I Men's Tennis National  Championship, all coming in the last 10 years.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to rise today to congratulate these student  athletes and the University of Virginia for this great achievement.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, one of the most fundamental,  God-given rights that we possess, which is uniquely protected in our  American Constitution, is the right to keep and bear arms for self- defense and to ensure that we remain a free people.   We have seen under this administration, supported by the Democrat  majority in this Congress, an unprecedented trampling on the basic  rights of American citizens over the past 2 years. Our most precious  freedoms to assemble together, to go where you want, to worship as you  choose, to earn a living or operate your business, to keep your job or  your employees, what you have to wear on your face, and whether or not  you are required to receive a vaccine that you may not want or may not  need all trampled upon by Democrats in power.   Democrats simply do not believe in the inalienable rights of American  citizens to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. They believe  that your rights come from government, and they, therefore, have the  right to take them away.    The guarantee provided by our Founders to ensure we remain free from  foreign invasion and, yes, as our Founders clearly warned us, from an  oppressive government like we see in Canada, Australia, and the  Democrats' beloved Communist China is the constitutional right of law- abiding citizens to be armed as they choose.   Over and over, the Founders affirmed and reiterated that Congress has  no power--no power--to limit the right of lawful citizens to arm  themselves. H.R. 2377 would create a nationwide system of red flag  laws, undermining the constitutional guarantee of due process, which is  required before depriving any American of their Second Amendment right.
