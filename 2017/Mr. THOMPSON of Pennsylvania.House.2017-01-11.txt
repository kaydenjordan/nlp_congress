 Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate an  industry that allows Americans to have access to affordable, high- quality, and safe food--the agriculture industry: our farmers, our  ranchers, farm families. Without food security, we do not have national  security; so I am here today to recognize all of those who work so hard  in that industry.   Over the weekend, some members of the House Agriculture Committee  were able to join me in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, our State capital, to  attend the 101st annual Pennsylvania Farm Show. This event has been  widely attended for generations, and it is the largest indoor  agriculture expo in the country. It showcases 300 commercial exhibits,  6,000 heads of animal, 10,000 competitive exhibits, and more than a  half a million visitors.   On Saturday, Agriculture Committee Chairman Mike Conaway and I hosted  a public listening session. We wanted Members of Congress to hear  directly from farmers and ranchers, from FFA members, from kids in 4- H--the future of agriculture--on how agriculture policy impacts them.   I thank the following Members who were able to join us at the farm  show: Congressman Mark Amodei, Congressman Lou Barletta, Congressman  Tom Marino, Congressman Dan Newhouse, and Congressman Ted Yoho.   We covered a range of topics, Mr. Speaker, during our public forum,  from raising awareness about agriculture education, to hearing very  real concerns from our dairy farmers, to receiving an update from our  forest industry about the best ways to strengthen forest management. As  chairman of the Agriculture Subcommittee on Conservation and Forestry,  this was of particular interest to me.   The Pennsylvania Farm Show, which continues throughout this week,  brings together so many different farmers and growers and ranchers, all  with unique issues. This, truly, is an event like no other. The Farm  Show Complex and Expo Center houses 24 acres under one roof, spread  throughout 11 buildings, including three arenas. There is no admission  fee. It is a great event for the entire family, and there are numerous  educational shows that are, obviously, all free of charge.   This year's theme is ``Our Commonwealth's Blue Ribbon Experience.''  It reminds us that there really is something for everyone, farmers and  nonfarmers alike. The Pennsylvania Farm Show provides an atmosphere for  everyone to walk through, observe, and educate themselves about  different areas of agriculture and to be able to reconnect with the  farm--the Commonwealth's largest industry, which brings in nearly $6.9  billion annually in agricultural cash receipts. Almost a half million  jobs are tied to the industry, which positively impacts all  Pennsylvanians.   Undoubtedly, one of the most popular attractions at the Pennsylvania  Farm Show is the food court, which is located in the complex. The food  court offers visitors a variety of Pennsylvania preferred products, and  it generates income to support the nonprofit Pennsylvania Agricultural  Commodity Organizations. There is where you will find the famous Farm  Show baked potatoes.   The Pennsylvania Cooperative Potato Growers, Inc., is the oldest in  the United States, chartered in 1922. The money raised during the week  helps to support the marketing and the promotion of Pennsylvania  potatoes. Money is also used to pay the dues for Pennsylvania growers  to belong to national potato organizations, fund research projects, and  promotional opportunities for Pennsylvania's growers. Our delegation  was able to stop by and sample some of the well-known potato doughnuts.    The Pennsylvania Dairymen's Association is also on hand at the expo.  This service organization provides scholarships, youth programs, and  agricultural education programs across the Commonwealth. It also  maintains the milk house facilities that are located in the farm show  complex. The Dairymen rely on the revenues that are generated during  the farm show to fund their activities, including a statewide fresh  milk program, called Fill a Glass with Hope. All of their activities  are bolstered with the sales of milkshakes, milk and chocolate milk,  ice cream sundaes, grilled cheese sandwiches, ice cream cones, and my  favorite--fried cheese cubes.   Over a century ago, the first Pennsylvania Farm Show was a 3-day  exhibit. Today, the event is a weeklong celebration of how the  agriculture industry touches our lives every day. If you pick up a  fork, a spoon, or a knife, you are touched by agriculture. Proudly,  this event draws visitors from across the country to highlight  everything our State has to offer when it comes to agriculture.   As the 115th Congress begins to address the next farm bill, listening  sessions like the one that we hosted Saturday will continue to be  critically important. Policy that is based on discussion within the  vacuum--the beltway--of Washington usually fails and falters. When we  open it up to the people who are impacted, we get the best policy. If  you are looking for the best agriculture expo in the country, head to  Harrisburg this week.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend  the efforts of People for Life, a nonprofit in Erie County,  Pennsylvania, that is dedicated to educating and promoting right-to- life causes in northwestern Pennsylvania.   This organization hosts several events throughout the year to bring  together people of the pro-life community. People for Life organizes an  annual bus trip to participate in the national March for Life in  Washington, D.C., and it also hosts its own March for Life in Erie.   For nearly four decades, People for Life has hosted a Pro-Life  Breakfast that highlights the sanctity of human life in all phases and  conditions. Attendees can hear stories of love, courage, and victory  through God's mercy and grace.   I thank People for Life for all the work it has done in Erie and  northwestern Pennsylvania on this topic of such great importance. They  work to save lives through education and love. They recognize how  sacred each human life is and fully understand the need to protect the  most vulnerable. They are a voice for the voiceless. I am deeply  grateful for their work.                            ____________________
