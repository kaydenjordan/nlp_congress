 BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, it is interesting  that after 6 years of the mantra of repeal and replace, here we are.  And we have repeal and maybe replace at some point when we get around  to it; although, that shouldn't be very surprising, considering.   What is ObamaCare?   More than 20 years ago, Senator Bob Dole, then the Republican leader  of the Senate, and a group of his colleagues introduced the Republican  alternative to the then-Democratic plan to expand health insurance to  some 40 million Americans who didn't have it. The Republican plan  hatched at the Heritage Foundation was, instead of expanding Medicare  for all, let's instead create a system of taxes and tax credits where  we pool all the uninsured together and we enable them to buy private  health insurance on a marketplace.   Fast-forward about two decades. Barack Obama comes to the White House  wanting to compromise, wanting to create a system that would disrupt  the existing healthcare system as little as possible, and decides to go  in this direction. Then suddenly, all of those on the other side who  supported that idea for two decades decided it was socialism and could  not possibly be the healthcare law.   So the reason why they don't have an alternative to ObamaCare is  because this is the market solution. This was the more moderate  approach. This actually isn't a Big Government-run plan.   So I am extending a hand to the other side. If they really want to  come up with a way to improve the Affordable Care Act, there are many  of us on this side who genuinely want to work on that. I have already  voted, as a Member only here 2 years, on ways we can improve the  Affordable Care Act and make some modifications, the same way we have  made modifications to Medicare and Medicaid many times since 1965.   Mr. Chairman, if the real intent of the other side is just to strip  away health insurance to 22 million Americans, we will say ``no'' and  continue to fight it.                                time  1345     BOYLE of Pennsylvania (for himself,               Mr. Jones, and Mr. Nolan):        H.R. 528.
