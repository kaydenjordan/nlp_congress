 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for doing an  outstanding job this year passing all 12 appropriations bills.   Mr. Speaker, I support passage of this CR which includes three  provisions of mine. It will reauthorize the Community Health Center  program, providing $3.6 billion per year for the next 2 years.   Community health centers have a proven track record of providing  high-quality, cost-efficient healthcare to approximately 25 million  Americans and have long enjoyed bipartisan support because they are a  prime example of what is working in our healthcare system.   The CR updates the civil and criminal penalties in the Medicare and  Medicaid programs. Many haven't been updated in over 20 years.   It also repeals the Medicare therapy cap. This will ensure that  patients who need physical, speech, or occupational therapy services  can receive them without fear of losing their benefits if they hit an  arbitrary cap. This is so important to our seniors, Mr. Speaker.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.
