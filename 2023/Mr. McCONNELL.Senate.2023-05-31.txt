 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I wanted to start this morning by  expressing my condolences to my chief of staff, Sharon Soderstrom, who  lost her father a few days ago. Here is what she had to say about him.   She said:         My dad truly was one of the great good gifts of my life. I       hope to be back tomorrow.    I think Sharon pretty well summed it up. Her dad was a special,  special person, and our thoughts and prayers are with Sharon and her  family this week.    Mr. President, as a polio survivor, I have a special  appreciation for organizations that help those with conditions often  overlooked in our society. The Kentucky School for the Deaf--KSD--in  Danville, KY, is a remarkable example of such an organization, having  dedicated itself to serving the deaf and hard of hearing for over two  centuries. Today, I would like to recognize this institution for its  outstanding work, as its students and faculty celebrate the school's  bicentennial.   In a hearing world, it can be hard to imagine the life of the deaf.  Nowhere was this misunderstanding more pronounced than throughout early  human history. For centuries, the deaf were relegated to the outskirts  of society, frequently sent to asylums for the insane, or otherwise  forgotten. Many contended with Aristotle's opinion that the deaf were  ``incapable of education'' due to their inability to hear. This was,  unfortunately, the standing belief on deaf education for hundreds of  years.   Gradual shifts in cultural attitudes and educational techniques led  to slow but steady progress over time. The early days of deaf education  were typically born from the philanthropic efforts of wealthy citizens,  while schools were privately held and operated out of the country's  east coast.   In the early 19th century, General Elias Barbee, then a member of the  Kentucky State Senate, hoped to change that. Senator Barbee launched an  effort to establish the first State-supported school for the deaf in  the United States. In 1822, legislation was signed into law, bringing  deaf schooling west of the Alleghenies for the first time in American  history. Shortly thereafter, Barbee's daughter, who had been deaf since  childhood, enrolled as the first of three students at the Kentucky  school.   From the start, the institution intended to educate the whole person,  preparing the deaf and hard of hearing for success in both academic and  real-world settings. The school secured two Federal land grants, with  the help of Kentucky's illustrious statesman Henry Clay, that were used  to fund the construction of KSD's campus.   The board of trustees faced their first great hurdle early on:  finding faculty to lead the fledgling school. They soon took up the  training of John A. Jacobs, a young student at Centre College. Jacobs,  often described as the ``founding father'' of the institution, would go  on to serve as faculty for over 40 years and was integral to the  school's success throughout its infancy. Under his leadership, the  school prevailed through some of the most perilous periods of our  Nation's history, even resisting three attempts from Confederate  soldiers to occupy the school during the Civil War.   In recent history, the school has seen its campus and its student  population flourish and expand. Meanwhile, opportunities for deaf  children in public schools also became more widespread. In 1975, the  Education for All Handicapped Children Act was signed into law by  President Ford. This landmark legislation ensured equal access to  education for every child, regardless of their disability, and marked a  major turning point for deaf education in the United States.   Today, KSD remains a leading institution for deaf education  throughout the country. It promises an academic experience uniquely  suited to the needs of the deaf and hard of hearing and affords its  students a rare opportunity to learn as the hearing do: directly  communicating and connecting with their peers.   Through English and sign language, students freely exchange ideas in  the classroom, participate in afterschool activities, and learn the  skills needed to succeed on their own after graduation.   For over 200 years, KSD has empowered deaf and hard-of-hearing  individuals to lead a life of dignity and self-sufficiency when many  thought it impossible. This Kentucky institution has made an indelible  impact on the history of deaf education and the thousands of students  who have called it home.   I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in recognizing the Kentucky  School for the Deaf for their tireless dedication to educating and  enriching the lives of America's deaf and hard of hearing. Thank you  for 200 years of remarkable service to the Commonwealth of Kentucky.                            ____________________
