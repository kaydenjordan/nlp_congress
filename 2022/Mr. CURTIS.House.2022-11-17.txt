 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of one of my  constituents, Ashley Rees, who has been awarded the American Fork High  School Visual Arts Sterling Scholar Award.   The Sterling Scholar Award recognizes the talent of students gifted  in the arts and sciences in my home State of Utah. This is an  impressive award, and I can only think of a few who are as worthy of  this award as Ashley.   I have been personally impressed with Ashley's artwork, but also her  hard work and her dedication to her growth as an artist. I am thankful  to have such young, talented artists like Ashley in my district.   As the Representative for the youngest congressional district in the  United States, few things make me prouder than seeing the talent of  some of these young constituents.   Congratulations, Ashley. I look forward to seeing you flourish more  and more.                            ____________________
