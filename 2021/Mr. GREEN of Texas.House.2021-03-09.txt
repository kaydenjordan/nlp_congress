 Madam Speaker, and still I rise, a proud,  liberated Democrat unbought and unbossed.   I rise today to address the question of life and death, the question  associated with the Governor of the State of Texas indicating that on  tomorrow people may go out into the public and to public venues without  a mask. He is leaving it to the public to make decisions associated  with life and death. Life and death in Texas because the 7-day average  for hospitalizations is 6,000. The number of people that died on last  Sunday was 65. Life and death. And he leaves it in the hands of people  who may somehow believe that he is risking his life. Not so. Not to the  extent that the public will be, those who haven't been vaccinated  because on December 22 of last year the Governor was vaccinated.   The Governor has resources. If by chance he should contract the  virus, the Governor will have access to the finest medical care in the  world. The Governor will get to the hospital expeditiously either by  some car that will have some officer driving at a high rate of speed  because the road will be cleared for him or he will pursue his needs by  way of helicopter. The Governor has resources.   Better example. The former President, who called the virus a hoax,  when he contracted the virus, he went to the finest medical center,  received the finest medical care, and he survived.   His friend, who attended one of his rallies and 9 days later  contracted the virus, died. This is a matter of life and death. The  virus has not dissipated. It has not gone away.   So to the people of Texas, I love you, but I say this to you: If you  don't have the resources that the Governor has, if you don't have a  helicopter, if you don't have access to the best medical care in the  world, if you don't have a doctor that will be waiting on you when you  get to the hospital, if you have to go to the emergency room--the  Governor won't go to the emergency room, he will bypass that.   So if you can bypass the emergency room and you can have the finest  medical care in the world, maybe you should consider going into public  venues without a mask. But if not, remember, it is a question of life  and death, and the life you save may very well be your own.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, and still I rise. And I thank the  Honorable  Bobby Scott for the opportunity to be heard. I will be  terse.   Madam Speaker, unions protect people. Unions protect people because  those workers will organize and make sure that there is a safe work  environment.   This is important because if not but for the union, many companies  would simply build into the cost of doing business the injuries that  may be sustained. I am a member of Local 1550 of AFSCME and proud to  say it.   Madam Speaker, I support this legislation because it will save lives.
