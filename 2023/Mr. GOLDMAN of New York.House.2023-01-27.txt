 Mr. Speaker, we often say the words ``never  forget.'' Never forget the worst genocide in history, we say.   Today, on International Holocaust Remembrance Day, we must  acknowledge the uncomfortable reality that we as a country are not  adequately passing the critical lessons from the Holocaust on to the  next generations.   As the Representative of Borough Park in Brooklyn, with the largest  population of Holocaust survivors and their families in the country,  and as a proud American Jew from New York State, this is deeply  personal to me and my constituents.   We must continue to educate the next generations of Americans to  understand the importance of the Holocaust so that it is not lost and  that we never forget.   I would like to stand here and read the names of my neighbors, those  in my community who lost family and other loved ones in the Holocaust,  but that list is just far too long.   Instead, I ask that each of us take a moment to reflect today, to  confront our past, and to acknowledge the work that must be done in the  future to make sure that we truly never forget.                            ____________________
