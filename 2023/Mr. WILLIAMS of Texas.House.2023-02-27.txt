 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I  demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the  ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a  quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, I stand today to honor Texas  Christian University's 150th anniversary.   In 1873, the Randolph and Addison Clark brothers had a bold vision to  create a university that would educate individuals to be leaders for  the future with the highest levels of character and responsibility.   Over the years, TCU delivered on that mission and has been a beacon  of strong educational values for the world to see. The staff and  leaders throughout the years have been instrumental in building a  brighter and better future for all Horned Frogs.   As a proud alumnus of the university, I can speak to how vital my  experience at TCU was to the rest of my life. TCU may look different  now than when I was there in the 1960s and 1970s, but the spirit of  innovation, achievement, and a shared sense of purpose have remained  the same.   TCU has always embraced our rich history while also looking to what  is next. Whether it be campus transformation, expanding our excellent  academic programs, or bringing our sports teams to new levels of  victory, TCU has always embraced a bold vision for the future.    Today, TCU stands as a world-class university. As the student and  alumni community come together to remember our special heritage, may we  recommit ourselves to the original mission of TCU and continue to  deliver on our success, guided by our faith and passion for the  fighting TCU Horned Frogs.   I have no doubt TCU will continue to lead on for the next 150 years.   Riff, ram, bah, zoo. Go Frogs. In God we trust.                            ____________________
