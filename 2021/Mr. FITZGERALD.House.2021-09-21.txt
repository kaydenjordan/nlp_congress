 Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute and  celebrate the life of Steve Hepp, who passed away after a hard-fought  battle with cancer.   Steve dedicated almost his entire life to public service. He enlisted  in the United States Marine Corps after he graduated from high school,  where he served proudly from 1972 until 1976. This was just the  beginning of his lifetime of dedicated public service.   Steve continued to serve the Watertown community in southeastern  Wisconsin in plentiful and meaningful ways on numerous city committees.  But I would be remiss if I didn't mention what he is remembered most  fondly for, and that is being a small businessman, and the Silver Eagle  Saloon, which remains in Watertown and is operated by his family.   I invite the Watertown community to raise a glass to celebrate the  life and legacy of Steve Hepp for his resolute patriotism, his  unparalleled contributions to those around him, and his undying love  for his wife Sue, his daughters Shae and Summer, and his grandchildren  Carlos and Jocelyn.   Madam Speaker, I offer my heartfelt condolences to his family and to  anyone who called Steve their friend. He will be sorely missed.                            ____________________
