 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania for  organizing this event this evening and yielding.   For the last 8 months, America's energy employers and the individuals  they employ are suffering a barrage of attacks from the Biden White  House, all because this administration is fixated on dismantling  America's energy independence and replacing it with a radical pipe  dream called the Green New Deal.   In Pennsylvania and across America, it is not just the energy  producers and their workers who are feeling the impacts of President  Biden's attack on American energy. Our schools, hospitals, local  governments, and downstream job creators are also suffering.   Pennsylvania's natural gas industry has created incredible  partnerships that are working to ensure we can meet America's energy  needs right here at home.   The School of Petroleum and Natural Gas at Lackawanna College's  Tunkhannock Center is introducing students to career opportunities in  the oil and natural gas industry. The Susquehanna County Career &  Technology Center is working to retain local talent by offering a CDL  training program that offers students the chance to jump into an in- demand career.   When President Biden dismantles American energy, these are the  organizations and people who suffer. He is dismantling American dreams.   Higher prices at the pump, energy shortages, and increased costs to  fuel our businesses and homes are a clear sign that we must embrace  American energy, not abandon it. We must invest in pipelines and  refineries, harden our grid from cyberattacks, and cultivate innovation  to ensure future success.   If President Biden is serious about building back better, he should  not be trying to destroy the domestic energy industry that will lead us  to a better tomorrow.
