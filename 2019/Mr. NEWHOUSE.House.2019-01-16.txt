 Madam Speaker, Mel Stottlemyre is a household name for  baseball fans across the country, but to us in central Washington, he  is a hometown hero.   Hailing from the small town of Mabton in the Yakima Valley, Mel's  career skyrocketed to the heights of becoming a star pitcher for the  New York Yankees and one of the most impressive pitching coaches in all  of baseball.   Mel shared his passion for baseball with all of those around him,  from his sons, who followed in their father's footsteps to pitch in the  major leagues, to the young players he coached at baseball camps in  Yakima and in Ellensburg.   Throughout his career, he pitched for five All-Star teams. He went on  to secure five World Series rings as a pitching coach before returning  to his home State to coach for the Seattle Mariners.   Mel passed away on January 13 after a long battle with cancer, but  his spirit, perseverance, and compassion will not be forgotten.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in celebrating Mel  Stottlemyre and the legacy he leaves. My prayers go out for his wife,  Jean, and his sons, Mel, Jr., and Todd, at this difficult time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Oklahoma for  yielding some time.   Madam Speaker, today I regretfully rise in opposition to this rule.  The base text of the legislation before us is vitally important. I will  admit that. It demonstrates bipartisan--in fact, I would say, really,  nonpartisan--efforts negotiated over months between both sides of the  aisle to provide desperately needed resources to communities ravaged by  hurricanes, typhoons, wildfires, and other disasters in 2018.   But, unfortunately, Madam Speaker, as is becoming all too familiar  under Democratic control of the people's House, Democrats are now  pulling political stunts, jeopardizing these vital  [[Page H621]]  resources from reaching communities who need them the most.   Last night, Democrats on the House Rules Committee stuck a continuing  resolution into this appropriations package, thereby sealing the fate  that it will not be taken up by the Senate nor signed into law by the  President.   Madam Speaker, I find it shameful that House Democrats are playing  partisan politics with disaster relief. It is so unfortunate and  shameful that Chairman McGovern and Rules Committee Democrats are  jeopardizing these funds from reaching the areas that so desperately  need them.   Communities pummeled by hurricanes in the Southeast, families  devastated by wildfires across the West, territories struck by typhoons  in the Pacific will now have to face the fact that help is not on the  way.   Madam Speaker, when I learned that the Rules Committee was going to  be considering this disaster relief package and allowing amendments on  the legislation, I, frankly, was looking forward to coming to the House  floor to commend Chairman McGovern for allowing a vigorous process with  amendment consideration.                                time  1300    Unfortunately, they chose to play politics with disaster aid, and not  only is it disappointing, Madam Speaker, but it is wrong.   Vote no on this rule. Let us send a message to communities devastated  by disasters that we will not play politics with the resources they so  desperately need to rebuild.
