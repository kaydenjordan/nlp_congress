 Mr. Speaker, let me begin by saying that the  constitutional right to vote is the cornerstone of our democracy, and  it is a right solely afforded to our citizens.   It is a basic concept, but the D.C. Council needs to be reminded of  this. The District of Columbia holds a unique status as a Federal  district, and the Constitution outlines that Congress is responsible  for its governance.   Without the proper oversight of Congress, it has spiraled into  crisis. Crime rates are soaring. Our public schools have suffered  significant setbacks due to the prolonged closures and numerous  buildings that stand vacant, casting a shadow of neglect over our city.   In the face of these issues, it is disheartening to witness the D.C.  Council prioritize a bill that aims to grant voting rights to  individuals who are not citizens of the United States of America.   This effort undermines the very foundation of our democracy. Consider  the potential consequences of such a law. Washington, D.C., is a hub  for various foreign organizations and embassies, some of which hold  interests that run very counter to those of the United States and are  not invested in the long-term well-being of our country.   By providing voting rights to noncitizens, we open the door for  foreign agents and adversaries to influence local elections held in our  Nation's capital. Imagine that, the D.C. Council is trying to extend  the right to vote to employees of Vladimir Putin and to employees of  President Xi and the CCP. This is a legitimate threat to the integrity  of our democratic institutions.   Granting noncitizens the right to vote in local elections sets a  dangerous precedent, especially put into context with President Biden's  illegal immigration crisis.   Allowing this law to stand would open the flood gates to noncitizens  to influence elections across the Nation. We have already seen this  policy from Democrats in New York, and I was proud to lead the fight to  successfully stop that in court. We must do the same with this policy  in D.C.   For those reasons, I was proud to support H.R. 192 in the House  Oversight Committee hearing yesterday to reverse the D.C. Council's  disastrous policy.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join us in sending a clear  message back to them that citizens' voices matter and that we are  committed to safeguarding the integrity of our democratic process for  generations to come.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, the Chinese Communist Party's actions  and ambitions directly challenge the values, interests, and security of  the United States.   As we consider this year's National Defense Authorization Act, it is  crucial that we address the threat posed by the CCP head-on.   First, this year's NDAA counters the Biden administration's efforts  to reduce the size of our Navy and instead allocates adequate funding  to build protection forces. It also prohibits the Department of Defense  from contracting with companies that do business with China, and it  accelerates the deployment of advanced radars to track threats to our  homeland, like the Chinese spy balloon.   The threat posed by the CCP is real and demands our immediate  attention. The provisions outlined in the NDAA will strengthen our  military, protect our economic interests, and safeguard our national  security.   We cannot afford to be complacent or underestimate the gravity of the  situation. The future of our great Nation depends on it.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule and  consideration of the National Defense Authorization Act.   The legislation before us today makes historic progress to reinforce  the strength of our military and to protect our national security in  the face of an aggressive, ambitious Chinese Communist Party.   First, this year's NDAA counters the Biden administration's dangerous  efforts to reduce the size of our Navy and focuses resources on  rebuilding our Armed Forces and procuring munitions.   The bill also puts a firm ban on our military from contracting with  companies that do business with the CCP, ensuring the security of our  military cannot be internally compromised by our most dangerous  adversary.   It accelerates the deployment of advanced radars to track threats to  our homeland--like the Chinese spy balloon that this administration was  so incapable of taking down.   The NDAA before us today protects our military from the Biden  administration's efforts to reduce its strength and to lull our country  into complacency while our adversaries pose a direct threat to our  national security.                                time  1245    We cannot afford to underestimate the gravity of the situation in the  [[Page H3498]]  world today. We cannot have peace through strength without staying  alert and ensuring that our men and women in uniform, who make up the  strongest and most mighty military on the face of the Earth, have the  resources and support that they deserve.   I strongly support the rule before us today, and I urge my colleagues  to come together once again for the security of our great Nation.
