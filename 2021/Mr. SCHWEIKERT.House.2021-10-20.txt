 Madam Speaker, I promise I am not trying to go for  the record of the most boring for half an hour, but if I make it, bless  us all.   Madam Speaker, over the next half hour, I am going to try to walk  through--and a lot of this is just sort of the boiling frustration that  we all go through around here. We are frustrated because I believe a  lot of our brothers and sisters on the left mean well. They say warm,  fuzzy things. They say things that actually should make you feel good.  And then you actually deal with the reality of what is happening in our  economy and around us.   We are going to blast through a bunch of these and see if I can sort  of explain our frustration as conservatives but also as Americans. So  just one quick point. Do you remember all of the rhetoric from the last  election from our Democrat colleagues about how they are going to  actually do all of these things in regard to greenhouse gases, but we  will still have a healthy economy? Well, this is the chart before  President Biden took office, and you see GDP was truly growing and  greenhouse gases had actually made quite a bend and change.   But now, we actually also have some other little facts we are going  to have to deal with. Think about this: The attacks that happened on  President Trump, but in those 4 years, my understanding is use of coal  actually fell 30 percent.   Well, I have to congratulate the Democrats. It looks like this year's  coal usage will go up 23 percent. One more time: Coal usage will now go  up almost 23 percent this year because they have so screwed up the  energy economy.   When you block pipelines, when you block the movement of natural gas,  when you block the much cleaner fuel and you need to produce ions,  called electricity, where do you go? So, congratulations to the  Democrats. They actually took a trend--where they said they wanted  this--and have absolutely reversed it.   It is sort of an amazing thought, isn't it, that the Biden  administration and Democrats did more in the last 9 months for coal  production than the previous President did in 4 years? It is a  fascinating but good example when you don't own a calculator and don't  do economics.   Let's actually walk through a couple of other things. You have also  seen the reports and the analysis of how many poor people are going to  absolutely suffer this winter. Have you seen what energy prices look  like? If your household that uses heating oil--I am sorry, for those of  us in the desert, we don't know what heating oil is, but we are told it  is getting really expensive. Have you seen the numbers of what is  predicted to be paid in cold parts of this country?   If you are angry about it, go talk to your Democrat Representative  because  [[Page H5722]]  they are the ones that basically, through their arrogance and not  owning a calculator, not understanding basic economics, have just, in  many areas of the country, will have doubled, doubled your heating bill  this winter.   But this is what crappy economics looks like. And you start to walk  through it. How about if you are in one of those neighborhoods where  crime is an issue? Well, you have to thank the Democrats once again.  You can see that homicides are up 16 percent in the first 6 months of  this year.   We chose not to use it, but if you actually look at the concentration  of where these homicides are, people of color are the victims here.   You know, once again, we hear these beautiful speeches behind these  microphones of how they are going to help and protect and do this,  except they are killing them. At some point, the math is the math. This  is sort of the Democrat destruction in just the first 9 months, 10  months of this year. And the math is the math. The facts are the facts.   The air is getting dirtier; the power bills have gone up; you are  less safe. But let's keep walking through more of the damage that is  being done to our country, the society.                                time  1845    In my State, we have a little problem. We are a border State. The  number of adult males that are crossing our border has skyrocketed. If  you actually start to walk through what that actually means--let's  actually take a look.   Oh, but what about the fentanyl and who is that killing? When you  take a look at the pounds--tonnage, actually--of dangerous narcotics,  particularly fentanyl, that is crossing my border in Arizona, thank you  for the absurd policies that have been adopted by the Democrats and  this President.   Is it that you want to kill people? I can't believe that is in your  hearts, but that is what you have allowed to happen.   Let's actually talk about the other side, the economic side, of what  the Democrats have done in regards to the border. Why some of this is  important is I need you to double it up. We are going to come back to  the inflation here in a second.   What are the two things you do in a society if you want to destroy  the working poor? You make the value of their labor less. And unlike  2018 and 2019, which we had records in this country, where if you are  part of the working poor, you are someone that didn't finish high  school and what you sell is your labor, you were getting dramatically  less poor. We know income and equality, wages, were all going the right  direction.   Now, the Democrats take over, and you flood the society with--what  was today's final number, 1.7 million, heading towards 2 million-- people of moderate to low skill, and do you understand the economic  effects of what you just did to the working poor in this country?   We have some data that we did a couple weeks ago on the floor that  showed that by the end of the decade, you will have made the working  poor poorer in this country, substantially, because of opening the  border. Now, add in inflation.   If you actually take a look at the real earnings, the real earnings,  they are negative. People in this country, the working poor, the middle  class, they are getting poorer. Do we care? Because it is the math.   It is nice to give these beautiful speeches about how we care, but  then when you so screw up the basic economics of society, when you have  now devalued their labor by flooding the market with similar skill  sets, and now you have so monetized the society that you have cash  chasing products and goods, and then you screw up the incentives to  work, what did you think was going to happen?   You wonder where is the compassion around here? The working class,  that middle class, and the working poor are getting poorer every day in  this country because of Democrat policies.   It is a level of cruelty. Can we stop the hemorrhaging? Can we stop  the cruelty to these populations? It is not enough to give pretty  speeches that you care.   When you start to look at this, when you realize the skyrocketing  inflation--yeah, it is the highest in 13 years. But if you do some of  the core goods, that if you are on that--I hate the term--lower  quartile, where substantial portions of your income go to  transportation, food, and rent, it is even higher than this.   Now, we understand from the economists, it is no longer considered  transitory. This is Democrat policies at work.   A couple weeks ago we tried to do a simple explanation of supply  side, where you use resources, whether they be tax cuts or incentives  or getting regulations right to encourage production, and by  encouraging production, you make people's labor more valuable and they  get paid more. But the society has more goods and products and services  to buy, so you don't set off inflation.   You are now living the Democrat stimulus Keynesian model of throw  lots and lots and lots of cash at it, but you did nothing to stimulate  production. We have lots of cash chasing goods now, but at the same  time, all of that cash also encourages people, saying: Hey, maybe I  don't really have to work right now.   So you have a fall in labor force participation, you have lots of  cash to go buy things, and then you wonder how the supply chains get  screwed up. You wonder how you have inflation set off.   We are reliving the 1970s. Did anyone actually buy a textbook?  Seriously. If you actually loved and cared for the working class, for  the working poor, you would have been embracing 2018 and 2019, which  were miracles of no inflation and dramatic wage growth.   Yes, the pandemic has been miserable, but much of this did not have  to happen. But it is that arrogance, once again, of Democrat policies.  And is it the darkness of, hey, if we send out lots and lots of money  in checks, if we are--as the Democrats so-called Build Back Better  plan, which is to take the majority of our society and put them on  transfer payments--maybe it is great politics. Maybe that is how you  become the majority party forever. It is really crappy economics.   So if you start to take a look at just the last 6 months--you  remember a couple months ago: This is transitory; it is going to stop?  Not stopping, not stopping. Even the Federal Reserve now has updated  their numbers. So the talking heads were saying, oh, it is transitory,  give the administration a pass. Turns out, we have so structurally  screwed up the labor markets, we have so structurally failed to provide  the incentives to produce things in our own country and massive amounts  of this liquidity are functionally now financing the rest of the world  and particularly China. So congratulations once again.   If you actually start to look--and we are going to put up all of  these slides on our website so folks can actually have a chance to sort  of dive into them--but how prices have changed in a year. When you  start to understand--that is gasoline. This is your fuel oil, as we  were just talking about; cars. But you start to go over the things that  are sort of the bare necessities for so much of our community. We are  just kicking them in the head.    Then the arrogance coming out of the White House saying, well, these  are sort of, what was it, high-class problems? Come on. Is that really  where the heads of the left are? Their excuse is, well--because the  basic economics are, if you are a person with assets, you have a house,  you have retirement accounts, you own gold, you own other things, you  are getting richer. Now, your purchasing power is eroding. But if you  don't hold assets or you are a saver, someone trying to save for  retirement, these policies are just destroying your economic future.   So let's continue down the line of misery that the Democrats have  brought us. If you actually take a look at where we were going after  the Tax Cut and Jobs Act and you started to realize what had happened  in wages, particularly for female participation, we had the highest  female labor force participation in U.S. history. It was off the  charts, and their wages had begun to skyrocket.   Do we see anything in the Democrat proposals that will ever bring us  back to that? Actually, no. It is actually just the opposite. The  University of Chicago study now makes it look like they will  incentivize those numbers to continue to go the other direction.  [[Page H5723]]    Let's actually take a look--and we started to touch on this. If you  are part of that working poor, and you start to understand that what  happens on--if you start to break out the world by education level--and  I know sometimes this is uncomfortable, because you sort of segment  your society. But the reality of it is we actually saw amazing wage  growth, just amazing wage growth in 2018, 2019--21-plus percent. And  that is the very population that the pandemic smashed into a wall. Now  the Democrat policies of inflation, opening up the borders,  incentivizing people functionally not to participate in the labor  market, they are going to destroy--as a matter of fact, they have  already begun to destroy.   Let's look also at the brilliance of the left's proposals of  functionally: Let's throw lots and lots and lots of cash at the problem  and then try to figure out why that cash functionally is on its way to  China to buy things. It was not designed to create a robust  manufacturing backbone in this country. You actually incentivize  people, saying, well, go out and buy lots of things, engage in  consumer--oh, by the way, we did nothing in those policies to have that  become the new backbone of productivity and opportunity and jobs in our  own country.   The simple proof of this is--have you seen the pictures of the  container ships lined up at the port of Long Beach? What do you think  is in those? I mean, we are living it; we are looking at it. Yet the  talking heads are incapable of trying something new around here, and  that would be tell the truth.   So let's do something that is even a little more uncomfortable to  talk about. Remember when Vice President Biden was running for  President, and repeatedly we were told how if we just had a Democrat  Presidency and Democrat unified government, we would see the deaths-- and the deaths are miserable and horrible. I have had a couple friends  die of COVID--but they would come to an end and the world would be  better.   So we have a new President. He is handed multiple vaccines. But how  is it possible? How is it possible to have vaccines available to this  administration, functionally financed and brought in policy-wise by the  previous administration, and then there are more deaths this year than  there were last year? Are the Democrats ready to stand up and say: We  lied. We made crap up. And the results of not telling the truth and the  way they have approached the American people about the vaccines? Are  they going to take responsibility for the deaths? Because they sure  beat the crap out of Republicans and the last President over this.  Should they live by their own words?   Let's talk about the Democrats' tax policy now. We need to tax the  rich, right? We have done multiple presentations here on the floor  saying maybe we should stop subsidizing the rich. We showed a couple  months ago $1.4 trillion over the next 10 years of subsidies that go to  the rich. In this case, Democrats actually have something brilliant,  saying--this is a great scam--we are going to tax the wealthy, but  wink, wink, nod, nod, we are going to actually hand it back to the  wealthy in tax credits and subsidies.   Here is a simple example of a family that makes $800,000 a year. The  Democrats' tax bill, tax proposal, will hand them $118,000 in tax  credits, if you just buy the right electric vehicle and the right solar  panels and these things.   This is absurd. You are taking the wealthy in society, you are  actually blaming them for not paying their fair share, even though you  already saw--I am sure if anyone is literate around here, you saw  today's Wall Street Journal talk about you are not actually even  getting to the super rich; you are actually attacking the high-income  earning rich, because we tax income; we don't tax wealth. But in this  case, we are going to build a tax bill saying we are going to raise  your taxes, but wink, wink, nod, nod, we are going to hand it back to  you in tax credits, as long as you buy what the Democrats tell you to  buy.   Yet, if you actually look at what the design of the Democrats' tax  plan is, you must understand by the end of the decade, we are all  poorer. The society is poorer. The working poor are poorer. The middle  class is poorer.   We now have multiple studies--and we are going to talk about these on  a number of the slides--where the size of the economy actually shrinks.  The number of people working actually shrinks. If you understand our  debt problem, if we do not have an incredibly robust economic  expansion, we are in real trouble. Yet, this is sort of the dystopian  future the Democrats are planning for my 6-year-old daughter and for  every American.   You understand, when you add in the spending proposals, in less than  10 years, we are going to be running $2.6 trillion of borrowing every  single year. So think of that. Nine years from now when we are working  on the budget, just the borrowing package--so in 9 years, the borrowing  package, just to finance the spending of baseline government, the  entitlements, and the expansion of entitlements, we will be borrowing  $2.6-plus trillion every single year. This is the healthy economy we  were promised?                                time  1900    So, understand what that means is, in less than 9 years, if the  Democrats get their way, we are at 129 percent of debt to GDP, and that  is publicly held debt.   Now, you all understand why that number is so incredibly important.  When you strip capital out of society, how does the small business get  a loan? How does the entrepreneur here get a loan? How about the person  who just has a dream and wants to start a business in their garage?  They have to compete with government.   Is there this bizarre fantasy that somehow we are going to monetize  it? Maybe the fantasy of modern monetary theory, which, as you  understand, has been tried many, many, many, many times over history,  and it has always ended up very badly.   Do you remember the inflation numbers a few boards ago? Welcome to  the dystopian future that the left is bringing us. Look, the baseline  number was already crappy. It was over 106 percent of GDP. With the  Democrats' additional proposal, it goes from about 106 to 129 percent.  This is a miserable future for this country, and this is being brought  to you by Joe Biden and our beloved Democrat friends.   I know they mean well; at least, I like to believe they do. But they  have to see these same numbers. Most of these are based on CBO  projections. You start to see other things happening in society because  of Democrat policies that really, really are starting to take effect  right now. We are seeing some numbers that we need to understand  between now and the end of the year. There are some economic numbers  from us on the Joint Economic Committee that are becoming incredibly  uncomfortable.   This is sort of an odd one that popped up the other day. It turns  out, we are having this sudden huge spike of individuals dropping out  of the labor force. But what happens when you have a substantial spike  of folks who are just saying, ``I am going to retire''?   One of the miracles of 2018, 2019 is we saw our brothers and sisters  coming back into the labor force because wages were going up, and there  were so many opportunities. How can there be a world right now where we  say we have over 10 million open jobs, yet we are seeing huge dropouts  of the labor market?   This is a chart that basically says we had, what is it, 1\1/2\  million-plus older Americans decide, ``I am going to take early  retirement.'' What is so dark about this number is a huge, huge, huge  portion of those have almost no savings.   They are taking early retirement, going to live on Social Security  instead of what we were seeing in 2018, 2019 as the economy grew. We  were actually seeing poverty of seniors falling because many of them  had taken part-time or had taken some work. Now the reverse trend has  happened.   What has happened in the psyche of Americans, of our brothers and  sisters out there? We are already seeing millions of Americans of  traditional working age disappearing from the labor pool, so they are  not counted in unemployment because they are not looking. But they are  in that baseline number we call labor force participation. I know this  is geeky, but it is really important.   You cannot have a growing, healthy, prosperous society if you build  so many disincentives in your public policy that not working or  dropping out or retiring early is where your head is at.  [[Page H5724]]    According to the University of Chicago, the Democrats' plan to expand  the child tax credit would cause a million and a half workers to exit  the labor force. On the conservative side, we have actually made  multiple proposals of how to do some creative things with the earned  income tax credit so you actually help the working poor and you make  working more valuable, more attractive.   But the Democrats' proposal is now to delink a monthly check from  participating in society, participating in the economy, building skill  sets, building an economic future for yourself, your retirement, for  your children.   And now we actually start to see the academic studies coming in that  we are going to lose a million and a half workers just on this one line  item.   It truly is almost dystopian that the left can get behind the  microphones, say these warm, fuzzy things, but the economists are  sitting there shaking in their boots, saying we tried versions of this  in the 1970s, and it did not work well. And now we are doing it in a  time where our demographics are a real headwind and our debt load is  crushing.   We actually have some proof that also demonstrates that the President  and the Democrats said a lot of things that just weren't true because  the data now is in on the States that ended the early, we will call it  the SPIF on unemployment. It turns out they represent a small portion  of this country's population because I think there was only, what, 13  States that did it, and there are like 20, 23, whatever they are, a  small percentage of the Nation's population, but they are over half the  job growth.   The data is absolutely clear. The States that actually ended the  unemployment SPIF, the enhanced unemployment, had dramatically better  economic growth, job growth.   Once again, is having a job, is economic prosperity, is economic  growth moral? Because if it is, then what the Democrats are doing is  absolutely immoral.   You start to see the Byzantine structure of all the tax hikes that  the left is proposing, and we may do some of this next week. What is so  crushing about this is to even get close to their spending  requirements, it doesn't produce enough revenues.   I keep getting asked over and over, and saying okay, the Democrats  aren't dumb. There are probably a few of them that actually do own  calculators. They have to understand that their spending proposal in  this environment will be incredibly destructive to opportunity in  society.   We have lots of charts. You need to go through these other studies  that basically show the transfer payment model the Democrats are  pushing ends social mobility in this country. If you are poor, you are  going to stay poor. If you are middle class, you stay middle class.    In this country, do you really think our societal social fabric is  going to hold when you have no opportunity to move upward and sometimes  even downward, that we are going to basically become a European  transfer payment, socialist society; that the class you are born into  is where you stay, no matter how hard you work, the schooling you go  to, because that stagnation is what every study says?   The other part that is also perverse is the Democrats have to also  understand the receipts, revenues, that would be produced by all these  taxes don't come close to covering all their spending.   It is obvious. They are setting up our country to actually have to do  other layers of taxes. Are they going to sweep retirement accounts?  Well, that is where a bunch of the cash is. Are we basically going to  move to a VAT, a value-added tax, so each step of production we tax?  Are you going to have to add some sort of tariff or border tax? Because  right now, none of this works. None of the math works.   The final slide here is a congratulations to President Biden and the  Democrats' policies because they did something none of us thought was  possible. Remember when we started this year in January, this was going  to be one of the most robust economic growth years in history? There  were discussions that we were going to be 6-plus percent GDP growth.   As of yesterday, GDP growth from the Atlanta Fed calculator is 0.5.  One-half of one percent is our economic GDP projection for this  quarter, proving at some point policies really do matter, the people  you elect really do matter, and the amount of pain this is going to  cause to so many people because the opportunity, the growth in their  wages has now been crushed by these policies.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
