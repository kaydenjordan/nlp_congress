 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 835, the Fair Investment  Opportunities for Professional Experts Act sponsored by the gentleman  from Arkansas (Mr. Hill). This bill passed the committee by voice vote.  I was there. I didn't hear a single ``no'' vote.   This bill deals with the overall process of investing in stock being  sold by the company to investors to raise  [[Page H2718]]  money. We see this happen through public offerings, and most of us one  way or another or through a pension plan are invested in publicly  traded stocks.   The process for a company to go public is an expensive one, and so  smaller companies also do private offerings.   We have a process of restricting investments in these private  offerings to those who can afford and understand the risks and those  who understand that they can't necessarily sell the security that they  have purchased readily.   We do need a framework for accredited investors who are allowed to  buy in these private offerings. Up until now, our definition of  accredited investor has focused too much on wealth or income of the  investor and not on the expertise of the investor.   This bill, I think, moves us in the right direction as far as  allowing those with expertise to invest. I also look forward to  narrowing the definition of those or eliminating those from investing  solely because they are wealthy. Just because you have a million  dollars does not mean that you have understanding or knowledge.   The accredited investor framework protects the general public from  being sold high-risk, illiquid private securities. This is because  private securities do not come with anywhere near the same level of  financial or other disclosures to investors that public securities do.  Nor do private securities come with the same legal protections for  investors and oversight from the SEC and State regulators as compared  to public securities.   Finally, they don't come with the same level of liquidity and ability  to sell or a posted price where you can be assured that there is a big  public market, and you know what the fair price is.   Both accredited investor bills being considered on suspension today  aim to return to this concept of accredited investor but focus on the  knowledge of the investor as to the high-risk nature of the  private security offering.    We all know that just because you have a million dollars does not  mean you understand the complexities of the private markets.   Conversely, you should not be prohibited from investing in these  products if you do have knowledge of the risks involved but don't  happen to have a million dollars.   This is why it is so important for the SEC to update its definition  of accredited investors to protect investors who are not sufficiently  informed while creating pathways for those who are or those who make  themselves sufficiently knowledgeable.   Mr. Hill's bill would allow individuals with certain credentials,  such as an MBA or a FINRA certification--that is a certification from  the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority that would allow one to  actually be a broker-dealer. People who meet those two qualifications  would be deemed accredited investors without reference to their income  or wealth.   I am under no illusion about the riskiness of these products. We will  all hear the stories. Every friend I have who goes to Vegas and tells  me about it, comes back saying they won everything. I have nine other  friends who go to Vegas. They never tell me how well they did.   Likewise, we all will hear about somebody who invested in Apple at  the beginning, but nobody talks about their investment in pear,  tangerine, or kumquat.   This is an opportunity to make a lot of money. It is also an  opportunity to lose a lot of money. I believe that the reforms to the  definition of accredited investors are necessary and fair, and this  bill is a reasonable expansion of the definition of people who can be  expected to have the requisite knowledge or expertise to make an  informed investment about the very risky private securities.   I support this bill. Every voice on the committee supports this bill,  and I urge my colleagues to vote for it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The accredited investor framework is in need of improvement. Today,  millions of families can be targeted to invest in high-risk, illiquid,  nontransparent financial products solely because of the inflated value  of their assets, putting at risk their ability to live comfortably in  retirement. At the same time, others who are knowledgeable are  prevented from investing.   When the accredited investor framework was first established by the  SEC in 1982, less than 2 percent of our population could be solicited  by broker-dealers or companies raising capital on the basis of their  income or on the basis of their assets.   Today, that has risen to 20 percent. That is not because investors  are more knowledgeable and it is really not because there are more  investors who can afford to take major losses. It is simply because we  have had a lot of inflation since 1982, and so you can meet the asset  requirements with real estate and your retirement nest egg.   To be clear, no one thinks that the amount you need for your  retirement in 2023 is the amount you needed in 1982. That is why the  SEC needs to revise the thresholds to better protect working families.  [[Page H2719]]    That said, Mr. Hill's bill is sensible. It would return to the  original concept of the accredited investor, focusing on investors who  are knowledgeable about the risks of private securities.   I would also point out that while we are protecting investors,  another function of our securities laws is to help companies raise  capital and, obviously, this bill will help many companies to raise the  capital they need to expand; so I believe that is a balanced bill.   I look forward to other steps to change the accredited investor  framework. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1579, and I yield  myself such time as I may consume.   The Accredited Investor Definition Review Act is, of course,  sponsored by the gentleman from Michigan. The accredited investor  definition is out of date and needs changing. A lot of these comments  relate to the comments I made on the previous bill.   The current definition is based on wealth, which is not really a  proxy for an individual's knowledge or experience. It may, in part, be  a proxy for their ability to absorb losses; but the wealth standard was  established in 1982 and hasn't been revised, so it was either wrong  then or it is wrong now.   Further, the amount of wealth required to meet the accredited  investor threshold, of course, has been eroded and, as I said speaking  of the prior bill, has gone from 2 percent of our Nation to 20 percent  of our Nation.   So we need to define who Wall Street can sell risky and illiquid  products to, and not those who have created a nest egg, which is so  much smaller than the nest egg in terms of purchasing value that we  required when these standards were developed.   The SEC may establish a definition to protect working families from  these  [[Page H2720]]  high-risk products, while allowing those who are knowledgeable to make  the investment.   Mr. Huizenga's Accredited Investor Definition Review Act reaffirms  the authority of the SEC to review the credentials that will qualify an  accredited investor and update the list of credentials. This ensures  that the definition is not stagnant and changes with the times.   As a result, more investors will have access to private markets while  ensuring that they have the adequate knowledge base to understand the  risks involved.   I would add that perhaps wealth shouldn't be an entryway to  investments. It should be exclusively based on one's knowledge. If we  did that, we would want to look not only at the knowledge of the  investor, but the knowledge of their advisers, but only if those  advisers were truly independent, because an investor being advised by  someone who earns a commission or someone who gets referrals from the  promoter is not a truly independent adviser.   So this bill moves us forward to doing something that should have  been done many years ago. We are stuck with rules drafted in 1982. This  bill requires the SEC to begin the process of revising those rules. I  urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this important bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers and I am  prepared to close. I yield myself the balance of my time.   I want to respond to the comments from the gentleman from Michigan to  some degree. I think I speak for the majority of the Democratic Caucus  that we have a balanced view. We want investor protection, and we want  investments to be made in private offerings by those who understand the  risk and understand the company they are investing in.   The idea that we would open the door to every investment and allow an  unlimited number of people with no particular expertise or meeting  other standards would mean that we wouldn't have any initial public  offerings. Every company would become a public company. We wouldn't  have an SEC. That is not where we want to go.                                time  1630    This bill is consistent with that balanced view. The gentleman from  Michigan also says he thinks the SEC is being distracted and is not  carrying out its core mission.   Just today, they went after a crypto exchange, and I can't think of  anything more essential to their core mission.   Another controversy is whether investors in public companies will be  given information about the environmental and carbon effects of the  company. Many investors want that information, and giving investors  information that many of them want is a core definition of the SEC.  [[Page H2721]]    Finally, the gentleman from Michigan puts forward a very inaccurate  view of our current law. It is not true that you can't invest in your  brother-in-law's pizzeria unless you have a million dollars in net  worth. If that were true, I couldn't get a pizza on Ventura Boulevard.   The fact is that we do allow up to 35 unaccredited investors in  private offerings, and the vast majority of what we think of as the  really small businesses, the ones up and down Ventura Boulevard--the  pizzeria, the restaurant, whatever--fit into that category.   We do have a securities law system that works pretty well. We can  improve it. This bill does that. The SEC should amend its accredited  investor definition to better protect investors and retirees from being  solicited for high-risk, unsustainable products just because they meet  an asset threshold that hasn't been revised in 40 years.   I urge the SEC to review that asset threshold as part of the periodic  review required by this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill and to support  a balanced investor protection regime, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I do have a question for the chairwoman of our  subcommittee. We are taking these bills in a different order than I was  told. We are now dealing with H.R. 2593. Will we then return to H.R.  2608 and H.R. 2610?    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Missouri.    Mr. Speaker, the one person that may be most surprised  by us going out of order is the author of this bill, Mr. Gottheimer. I  know he is on his way now to this floor, so in order for him to get  here before he would have expected to be needed, I will speak very  slowly.   Mr. Speaker, I rise slowly in support of H.R. 2593, the Senior  Security Act sponsored by the gentleman from New Jersey, who is on his  way to this floor right now.   Scams targeting seniors, which can include harassing robocalls and  phone calls impersonating the government, cost older Americans more  than $36 billion a year, according to the National Council on Aging.  According to AARP, these kinds of senior scams have more than doubled  just since 2020.   Financial scams can leave a devastating and lasting impact on our  seniors, causing significant financial loss. Recovering lost funds is a  very challenging process, and in many cases, the money is simply not  retrieved.   Scams also lead to significant emotional distress, resulting in  feelings of embarrassment, guilt, shame, and a diminished sense of  self-worth. The emotional impact can exacerbate health conditions or  lead to depression and anxiety. Once scammed, seniors might lose trust  in people, which can lead to further isolation and reluctance to seek  help.   Mr. Gottheimer's bill takes key steps to help protect older Americans  nationwide from getting scammed out of their hard-earned money by  establishing a senior investor task force within the SEC. This task  force must report on topics relating to investors over the age of 65  and make recommendations for actions to address problems encountered by  senior investors.   I will also point out that this is important for our capital markets  and for companies trying to raise money because every time a senior is  subject to one of these scams, others become less interested in  investing, and we need Americans to feel that they are protected and  not cheated when they invest in stocks, bonds, and our capital markets.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I am pleased  that the gentleman from New Jersey has arrived, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer), the author of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill passed in committee 49-0. Our seniors are  particularly vulnerable to financial scams. As Members of Congress, we  must work to find effective ways to protect seniors from scamsters and  fraudsters.   Mr. Gottheimer's bill, a bill I commend him for drafting and one  that, once again, got 49 votes to 0 in our committee--I commend him for  crafting this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2608, sponsored by the  gentleman from North Carolina.   I want to put this bill in context. The first two bills we considered  in this session dealt with private offerings, where there is very  limited investor protection and where there are requirements as to who  is allowed to invest.   We are now focusing on public companies where there is a lot of  investor protection and where anyone can invest and anyone who buys can  then freely sell it to anyone else.   Just as by way of illustration, we are talking about, in this bill,  whether there will be 2 or 3 years of audited financial statements for  certain public companies. That differs from the private offerings that  we considered in the first two bills. Private offerings are not  required to have any audited financial statements.   A special accommodation has been made to emerging growth companies,  known as EGCs, who are obligated to provide 2 years of audited  financial statements when they first provide an initial public  offering.   Other companies, on the other hand, are required to provide 3 years  of audited financial statements when they go public. In some  situations, however, an EGC must provide 3 years of audited financials,  including cases where they acquire another company.   This bill would recognize that whatever standards we have when the  company first goes public, those standards being for 2 years of audited  financials, I think are logically applied in certain other  circumstances. One of those is where the company goes to the public a  second time for a follow-on offering, and the other is when the company  uses its stock to acquire a company.   We have a rule that, for the most important gatekeeping requirement,  says 2 years of audited financials. This bill would provide that same  standard for emerging growth companies in these two other types of  situations. This will harmonize the EGC framework, making sure that  these smaller reporting companies have a scaled-down obligation but  still do provide 2 years of audited financials.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this important  bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  for closing.   This bill passed our committee by a 41-to-0 vote. In passing H.R.  2608, Congress is making sure that smaller companies have scaled-down  disclosure obligations in all instances rather than just the initial  public offering. We apply the same standard to acquisitions and follow- on offerings. This is a commonsense reform. It reduces the burden on  small companies and still provides investors with 2 years of audited  financial statements.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H2726]]    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2610, sponsored by the  gentleman from North Carolina, the chairman of the Financial Services  Committee.   Mr. Speaker, both this bill and the last bill we considered are  seeking to reduce the obligations of emerging growth companies, or  EGCs.   H.R. 2608 would allow an EGC to provide only 2 years of audited  financial statements in the case of an acquisition or a follow-on  offering. We just passed that bill on this floor by a voice vote. We  are now considering H.R. 2610, which takes that concept one step  further and allows an EGC to provide only 2 years of audited financial  statements in the case of a spinoff.   Logically, if we are going to adopt that bill, we should adopt this  bill.   A spinoff transaction is one where one company creates a new  independent company by selling new shares of its existing business.   Both H.R. 2608, which we just passed, and this bill, H.R. 2610,  reduce the obligations for EGCs by saying that they need to provide not  3 years of audited financial statements but 2 years of audited  statements.   We should keep in line what is required for EGCs, whether they are  going public, whether they are acquiring, whether they are doing an  initial public offering, or, as this bill does, whether they are doing  a spinoff.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the House, just a few minutes ago, adopted on a voice  vote, H.R. 2608. That bill had passed the committee by a vote of 41-0.  This bill is extremely similar, except it passed the committee with a  vote of 42-0.   H.R. 2610 will ensure that there is uniformity regarding EGCs'  financial disclosure obligations, in this case, in the event that an  EGC conducts a spinoff.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2793, the Encouraging Public  Offerings Act of 2023, sponsored by the gentlewoman from Missouri.   I think the gentlewoman has laid it out clearly. We are talking here  about the process by which a company goes public, and this allows the  company to do two things before they go public.   One of those is to confer with prospective investors, and the other  is to get a nonpublic review by the SEC staff of their registration  statement.   This process of allowing these things to happen has been tried with  ESG companies. The SEC has now adopted it as a policy for other  companies, and now this bill would codify that decision.   I should point out this bill came before our committee, and the vote  was 39-1. This bill codifies the recent SEC rule that allows any  issuer, not just an ESG, to submit a confidential draft of their  registration statement for nonpublic review.   This bill also allows the issuers to confer with prospective  investors; in effect, testing the waters about whether a public  offering makes sense.   By freeing all issuers to use these two methods and codifying the  SEC's administrative action, we can provide all companies with the  assurance that these tools will be available to them.   This bill codifies, as I have said, the 2019 SEC rulemaking that  allows  [[Page H2729]]  issuers to test the waters before going public.   This allows the issuer to gauge interest in their public offering by  talking to certain institutional investors without first needing to  file a registration statement.   Given the cost of going through the entire process, it only makes  sense to allow companies to talk to institutional investors before they  decide to go public and commit themselves to that large cost.   Overall, this makes it easier for companies to access our capital  markets to get the capital they need to grow their businesses.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is one that should be adopted. The vote in  committee was 39-1. I urge my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2812, the middle market IPO  underwriting study act, sponsored by the gentleman from Connecticut  (Mr. Himes), and I commend him for his work in bringing this bill to  the floor and authoring it.   This bill passed our committee by a voice vote. I don't think there  was a dissenting voice in the room.   As the gentlewoman from Missouri points out, the process of going  public and filing a registration statement is expensive. Due to that  expense, companies may choose not to go public and not raise the money  they need to expand their businesses and provide additional employment  to aid our economy. Therefore, it is in all of our interests to see  whether that cost can be reduced.   Companies in this process usually engage an underwriter or broker- dealer to help them sell the shares to prospective investors.  Underwriters are typically compensated for their services through fees  such as underwriting spreads and underwriting fees.   The underwriting spread is the difference between the price at which  the underwriter buys the security from the issuer and the price at  which those securities are sold to the public in the public offering.                                time  1730    The underwriting fee, which often constitutes the largest share of  the cost of doing an IPO, or initial public offering, is typically a  percentage of the gross proceeds of the sale of the securities. The  exact amount varies and can be negotiated between the issuer and the  underwriter. Large companies have, in recent years, been able to  negotiate lower percentages for this process, which reduces their  overall fee. At the same time, smaller companies have continued to pay  the same historic percentage for this service, which is often 7 percent  of the transaction.   Higher underwriting fees essentially increase the cost of raising  capital, allowing middlemen to pocket profits that would otherwise be  available to grow the company.   Despite technological advancements, such as digital platforms which  now allow for a quicker and wider distribution of securities,  underwriting costs for small-and medium-sized companies have remained  stagnant and uncompetitive.   The gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Himes) has brought forward a bill  to direct a study of this problem and offer concrete solutions. It will  focus on the underwriting fee. It will also look at the auditing fee,  as well.   I support this bill, which will shed light on how much small- and  medium-sized companies are paying chiefly for underwriting services  when they go public. I hope this will get the SEC to address this  behavior on Wall Street.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Himes), the author of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I think the gentleman from Connecticut said  it well: Costs should be coming down because technology is available,  yet they seem exactly stuck at a noncompetitive 7 percent. Our  investors in companies need more robust competition and fairer  underwriting practices. This bill would shed light on these practices  and help us strengthen competition in underwriting services for our  smaller and medium-sized companies.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, which passed,  I believe, on a voice vote in our committee. I know of no opposition.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
