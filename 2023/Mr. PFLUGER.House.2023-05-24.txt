 Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the HALT Fentanyl Act,  which will help end thousands of deaths from this tragic situation.   I am speaking on behalf of parents like Joe Warnick and Donna Johnson  of Odessa, Texas, who lost their son, Jackson, to fentanyl poisoning. I  am speaking up for thousands of families across the United States.   How can you oppose this? Literally, how can you oppose this?   Every day we hear more and more stories of lives ended by fentanyl.  It is our responsibility to act.   The HALT Fentanyl Act will help end the fentanyl crisis by cracking  down on criminals who are trafficking deadly fentanyl across the  southern border and into our communities. It will ensure law  enforcement has the tools they need to keep these extremely lethal and  dangerous drugs off our streets.   The moms and dads that I have talked to are tired of words. They want  action, and the HALT Fentanyl Act is the action that we need to take.  Lives are on the line.   Mr. Chair, I am very proud of my Republican Conference for proposing  this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support it.
