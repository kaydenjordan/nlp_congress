 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1084, I call  up the bill (H.R. 6756) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to  promote new business innovation, and for other purposes, and ask for  its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on H.R. 6756, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful this bill has been brought to the floor  for consideration.   I rise in support of H.R. 6756, the American Innovation Act, which  supports and encourages entrepreneurs to start new businesses.   The United States recently dropped out of Bloomberg's list of the top  10 most innovative countries in the world. New business formations in  the United States have taken a dramatic downturn since the 2008  recession.   Between 1977 and 2007, those 30 years, the economy added 120,000,  net, new businesses each year. Since 2008, however, the economy has  added only about 2,000, net, new businesses each year since.   We should all be committed to making the United States the innovation  leader of the world. The American Innovation Act is a down payment  towards reaching that goal.   The American Innovation Act encourages entrepreneurs in two ways:   First, H.R. 6756 allows new businesses to immediately deduct more of  their startup organizational expenses. It simplifies the Code and  allows businesses to deduct up to $20,000 of startup and organizational  expenses when their new business begins. This doubles the amount of the  expenses that a business may write off in its first year.   Second, the American Innovation Act helps new businesses innovate by  preserving valuable tax benefits, like the R&D credit, that are  generated from activities conducted in the business' early years.   As any entrepreneur knows, starting a new business requires hard work  and a lot of capital. During its early years, many businesses operate  at a loss, and these losses are used in later years when the business  matures and becomes more profitable. To fund their innovation and  growth, entrepreneurs and business owners may seek equity capital from  other investors.   Today, the infusion of this new investment may trigger limits on the  use of a corporation's valuable losses and credits from the business'  earlier years. Under the American Innovation Act, our country's  businesses may fund their growth and innovation with equity investments  from new shareholders without limiting the use of these valuable losses  and credits.   Mr. Speaker, the American Innovation Act supports our entrepreneurs  and innovators and facilitates the creation of new businesses. I urge  support for this important bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady), chairman of the Ways and Means  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me say to the gentleman that I am not sure how the economy works  in Vermont, but I can tell you that in terms of the tax package--the  original one and this one, 2.0--Florida is on fire, in terms of growth.  There is more energy and more excitement about the tax thing.   Ninety percent of people are getting a tax break. For families of  four in my area, it is $2,400. We have seen little or no growth for the  last 10 years. Now we are at 2 to 3 percent. We have got real growth.  It is tough to get the amount of workers that we now need in Florida,  in general. That is pushing paychecks.   So I don't know what is going on in Vermont or different parts of the  country, but I can tell you that in Florida it is making a huge  difference in terms of the confidence with a lot of startups and  entrepreneurs.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Mitchell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I just want to mention to the gentleman from Wisconsin that there  were no amendments offered on this bill, if he wants to check that.   I also have a list of groups who are supportive of this bill, such as  Associated Builders and Contractors, the Chamber of Commerce,  Biotechnology Innovation Organization, and Angel Capital Association.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record this document listing  organizations in support of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as someone who has been in business 30 years, I can just  tell you that, in the last couple of years, our economy in Florida and  I think all over America has exploded. People are excited. They are  enthusiastic.   In fact, I did a roundtable of all women in my district. Why did I do  that? Because 57 percent of startups in the next 10 years will be women  led. So why would we want to not support giving them additional  deductions? Instead of just writing off $5,000, they can write off  $20,000.   In terms of opening businesses, it is as little as 2,000 a year. It  used to be 100,000-plus new startups a year. That is where the jobs are  created.   I chaired the local chamber in Sarasota, Florida. I can tell you, out  of the 2,400 businesses, most of them were 15 employees or less, 90  percent.   I also chaired the Florida chamber. There were 126,000 businesses in  that federation, and most of them were 15 employees or less, many times  1, 2, 3 employees.   It is tough when you open a business. Usually, you have losses for a  couple of years. This bill helps to address that, especially as they  try to attract capital. They could use some of those losses to attract  capital.   This is all about pro-business and growth. We have had little or no  growth for the last 10 years. Now we are starting to take off and be  much more competitive in the world. That is what this bill is all  about.   Mr. Speaker, let me just close with this thought. For too many years,  the United States has been lagging in the creation of new businesses.  Startup businesses are vital to the American economy, because they are  significant contributors to innovation, productivity, and job creation.   Together, we should all support the legislation. This makes it easier  and less costly for hardworking Americans to realize their American  Dream of starting businesses.   The American Innovation Act does just that. It supports innovators,  entrepreneurs, workers, and the economy with commonsense policy  solutions.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
