 Madam President, I rise today to celebrate the 50th  anniversary of the Young at Heart Senior Citizens and Community Center  in Rock Springs, WY. On May 19, 2023, a gala will be held at the Young  at Heart Center to celebrate its 50th anniversary.   The Young at Heart Center has served the Sweetwater County community  since its founding in May, 1973. Founding board members were J. Garrett  Smith, Louis M Groh, Ruth Lucas, T.H. Smith, Dwight J Jones, Lyda Hium,  Elmer Halseth, Willie Heikes, and Ernest J Mecca. The center was  originally designed to serve the senior population. With the  construction of their new facility in 2009, their services expanded to  address the needs of the entire community.   The Young at Heart Center exemplifies their mission of ``a community  place for the young and the young at heart.'' The center offers 14  different programs with amenities, activities, and services for  residents of all ages. Young at Heart is a safe place for Sweetwater  County residents to gather, receive educational and nutritional  services, pursue interests, and participate in social and recreational  activities. The center is also a public-use space for meetings and  events. The center serves as a cornerstone for the senior population by  providing meals and care. Seniors participate in numerous daily  activities that include games, hobbies, exercise, and opportunities for  friendship.   Young at Heart added several home health and caregiver services for  patients 18 and older. These include skilled nursing services, personal  care services, assistance to at-home caregivers with support and  education, home-delivered meals, and the Senior Companion Program. Each  of these foster wonderful relationships within the community. Many  young people in Sweetwater County have been impacted by the Young at  Heart's Early Learning Center. The Early Learning Center focuses on  building children's self-esteem and self-worth through strong  partnerships with parents. The center provides positive guidance,  indoor and outdoor gross motor space, and technology to enhance  learning. The importance of nutrition is highlighted by the dedicated  kitchen staff who prepare breakfasts, lunches, and afternoon snacks.   The Young at Heart Center receives funding through various government  grants and private programs. They also rely on the generosity of  Sweetwater County organizations and individuals. The Young at Heart  Center would not be able to provide a safe and engaging space without  the dedication of staff and volunteers. Volunteers use their skills and  interests to help lead support groups, serve meals, assist special  events, offer companionship, and maintain the grounds.   Jamie Loredo began her career with the center as the activities  coordinator and facilities secretary. In the fall of 2022, she took  over as executive director. Her resolute dedication to the center is  notable. She has focused on gaining community involvement, helping to  advance the center's success. Jamie has made a significant difference  in the lives of Sweetwater County residents.   The wonderful staff and board members who keep the center running  are:         Jamie Loredo, Executive Director        Louise Webb, Receptionist        Brianna Romero, Early Learning Center Director        Billie Seneshale, Director of Nursing        Brandy Sellers-Mertin, In-Home Services Supervisor        Gina Randolph, Access Care Coordinator        Misty Wilson, Center Bookkeeper        Cindy Stensgard, Home Services Bookkeeper        Daphne Palmer, Kitchen Manager/Home Delivered Meals       Coordinator        Kandi Lewis, Facility Secretary/Activities Coordinator/      Outreach Coordinator        Meagan Rogers, Aging Division Coordinator/ Outreach       Coordinator         Board of Directors         Diana Jessop        Suzette Williams        Kent Porenta        Richard Vandersloot        Michelle Quiroz        Kathy Gilbert        Wanda Bobo-Ferber        Kevin Maloney        Sue Riggs         Mary Thoman, County Liaison    It is an honor for me to recognize this significant milestone for the  Young at Heart Center.
