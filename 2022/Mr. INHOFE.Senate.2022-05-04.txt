 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, much has already been said on this floor  as we express our love and admiration for our friend and former  colleague, Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah. He was not like any other  Senator. Orrin was the best of all of us, and our household is very sad  to hear of his passing.   I will never forget the time he took to answer calls from an obscure  State senator from Oklahoma. If you haven't figured it out, that was  me. He had a way about him with everyone he met, an unwavering kindness  and gentle nature that Kay and I will miss deeply. You don't see a lot  of that in the U.S. Senate. We were close long before I was even in the  House. Orrin was the one whom I would go to for wisdom. We had the same  love for Jesus and everything that we hold dear.   I will always remember his humor, but he also gave his best advice.  He was not just a friend but a confidante. Whether he was talking about  Scripture or history, he had a way of saying things that brought people  together. You don't see that today. You see people fighting each other,  and that is what people always say. When I go back home to Oklahoma,  people talk about, why don't you guys get along? Well, we do. It just  doesn't come across that way. But it did with him.   I think back fondly on everything that we did while Orrin was in  office. Despite strong opposition at the time, myself and Senators  Hatch, Chambliss, and Thune were able to pass an amendment permitting  the Air Force to enter into a multiyear procurement for a total of 60  F-22s during the 2007 NDAA. The NDAA is something we pass every year.  It is the National Defense Authorization Act. And that happened that  year. Now, that turned out to be one-third of our total force in one  effort, one NDAA effort.   The argument against the amendment at the time was that we didn't  need such an air-dominant fighter, but we knew we were making an  investment in the future of our defense. Orrin had that foresight. He  was always looking to the future. In advancing years,  [[Page S2301]]  people would joke around about it because he was looking at the next  generation. He showed that foresight always when others didn't.   Not only that, but together we worked very closely to ensure the  future of our Air Force depots. I remember the codel. A codel is a  group of Members who go someplace to examine things. I led a group  codel, along with Senator Hatch and Senator Chambliss, which toured  each one of our depots as part of the initiative to restore their  funding. This is something that we had to do at that time because our  previous administration had not done an adequate job.   Now, Orrin--you know, you think of him as always a serious person. He  wasn't. Most of the time, he was poking fun at himself. I remember  laughing often when he was around. Together, we supported funding for  these Air Force depots that continue to be vital to our home States of  Oklahoma, Utah, and Georgia, but we had fun while doing it. That was  Orrin's way of doing it. He always had fun.   For those of you who are not familiar with our Nation's depots, they  are state-of-the-art maintenance and repair facilities for the Air  Force's aircraft. We do this ourselves because we can't trust anyone  else to get them done. Simply put, our Nation would not be able to rule  the skies without the critical maintenance and repair work that is  performed on our incredibly complex aircraft.   To ensure our Nation will always have our Nation's depots, there are  laws commonly called core and 50/50 laws which preserve the depots'  maintenance. I know that a lot of people are not familiar with the term  ``depot,'' but it is critically important for our survival.   Throughout my tenure on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I  greatly appreciated the legal analysis that Senator Hatch provided my  staff and me when the executive branch would send over suggested  changes to these critical laws.   Now, there were many times when, after reading those proposals,  Senator Hatch would raise the alarm, and my colleagues on the Senate  Armed Services Committee and I would then turn to do battle, and  sometimes we had to do what was necessary, but we did it together.   After the Obama administration canceled the NASA project  Constellation, which was supposed to replace the space shuttle, there  was a real question whether the civilian solid rocket motor industry,  which employs thousands of people in Utah, was going to survive.  Obviously it did survive, and that was due to Orrin Hatch. Using his  considerable legislative skills, Senator Hatch was able to insert  language in the fiscal year 2010 National Defense Authorization Act  that directed the new heavy-lift Space Launch System be built to lift,  from inception, 130 tons--an objective which at the time could only be  accomplished by using solid rocket motors.   And he did it. He did it. He looked out into the future. This is back  when he was actually in advanced years himself. As a result, a few  weeks ago, NASA rolled the SLS out to the launch pad for testing before  it carries the astronauts to the Moon in what is projected to be 2025.   I was also very impressed by how Senator Hatch used his prominence to  promote the use of Hill Air Force Base. Whenever there was an Air Force  official within hearing distance, Senator Hatch would espouse the  strength and capabilities of the Hill, Ogden Air Logistics Complex, and  he did so very persuasively. The results were there, and he was the guy  who did it. In fact, I honestly believe that one of the reasons Hill  was chosen to receive the first three squadrons of F-35s is that Orrin  Hatch was always advocating for Hill with the Air Force senior  leadership.   Now, one of the things that I loved about Orrin Hatch was his  placement of obscure words into many of his speeches. He would say  things that were so obscure that no one would know what he was talking  about. No one in the Senate wanted to believe that they didn't  understand what he was talking about, but they didn't. He would use  words that no one really had any idea what they meant. I actually wrote  these down some time ago.   ``Bovarism.'' That was defined, by him, as having an exaggerated,  especially glamorized, estimate of oneself. I think we know what we are  talking about there.   ``Cockalorum'' is a small man with a big opinion of himself. We know  that.   ``Furphy'' is a false report or a rumor.   When asked why he insisted on using that kind of vocabulary, Senator  Hatch would beam his boyish grin and chuckle and respond:         I like confusing the Democrats.    He had a very peculiar way of trying to get to know volunteers. He  would get people who had no status in life. He would have people who  were driving cars. Many of them were young people who were escorting  him to different places just to make speeches or something. He had a  peculiar way of trying to get to know volunteers--people who no one  else paid any attention to. If they were driving him to events, without  fail, he would always compliment the volunteer about his car. It could  be an old junker car, but, nonetheless, he would talk about it because  he knew young people were proud of their cars. I am talking about the  young volunteer could have been driving a 50-year-old Yugo, with the  floor rusted through, but I can assure you that Senator Hatch would  find something nice to say about the volunteer's car.   My personal opinion is that one of the best ways to know someone is  to listen to him pray. When we address our Creator, we reveal who we  really are. Many of us waited around and listened and waited for Orrin  to give one of his prayers. He had that kind of a love that everyone  enjoyed. For those who have listened to this or who have read this  record, I want to present the genuine Orrin Hatch to you--a person whom  we all came to know and love.   In 2010, Senator Hatch was chosen to say the main prayer at the 57th  National Prayer Breakfast here in Washington. It has been going on for  60 years, and we have had our 60th now. This is something that will  last forever.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, at the  conclusion of my remarks, the full text of Senator Hatch's prayer for  peace and tranquility in front of that crowd of 4,000 people on that  February morning 12 years ago.   Today, I believe Orrin Hatch fully enjoys the peace and tranquility  that he prayed for. All of that is to say, Orrin Hatch will be missed  dearly by me and by the many friends of Orrin Hatch's. We have lost a  true hero and one of my closest personal friends. Kay and I are praying  for Elaine and their family and loved ones as they go through this  difficult time.   So today is goodbye to my friend.   God bless you, Orrin Hatch.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         ``Let us pray. As we bow our heads this morning before       Thee, we are so grateful for this great nation, and for the       nations of the world and especially for the opportunities we       have as a nation to bring peace and contentment and       tranquility throughout this world. We are grateful for our       great leaders and pray Thou will bless them. We pray that       Thou will bless our President and our Vice President and       their cabinet. And all the leaders throughout the federal       government, that they might be inspired to lead us to do the       things that are righteous in Thy sight. That we might be able       to be good followers and that we might be able to bind       together to do what is right. As Moses' father-in-law told       him, let's share the responsibility and let's work together       in the best interests of our country. Let's have       bipartisanship reborn again in this great nation. We are so       grateful for those who serve in the military, who are       represented here today and throughout this country. We are       grateful for all the sacrifices that they undertake on our       behalf. We are grateful for those who are in harm's way and       we pray Thou will pour out Thy special blessing upon them,       that they may be blessed and protected. And we pray that we       might be a nation that will help bring peace and tranquility       throughout the world. We are grateful for all the food,       clothing and shelter that Thou hast provided for us. We are       grateful for those who serve in governments throughout the       states and the respective state legislatures. And last but       not least, we are grateful for the Congress of the United       States and pray that the Congress might be able to work       together, as Democrats and Republicans and Independents, to       serve Thee and serve our country and to serve our fellow men       and women. And bring peace and content to this great nation       and throughout the world. We pray at this time for those who       are suffering in Haiti and elsewhere throughout the world and       ask you to bless them and help them and help us to do  [[Page S2302]]       our share in helping throughout this world. We are grateful       for leaders from other countries who are here and pray Thy       blessing upon them. Once again, we ask you to bless our       President and Vice President and the leaders of this country.       In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.''     I yield the floor.
