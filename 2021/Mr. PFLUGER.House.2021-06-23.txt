 Madam Speaker, I rise today to demand answers and call  for all intelligence into the origins of the COVID-19 virus to be  declassified.   The United States should not rely on the World Health Organization,  the same organization that covered for the Chinese Communist Party in  the early days of the pandemic, to deliver answers to the American  public about the origins of a virus that wrecked our economy and  tragically claimed hundreds of thousands of American lives.   In April of last year, President Trump and Secretary Pompeo raised  concerns of a COVID-19 lab leak. These concerns were completely ignored  and censored by social media companies and traditional news outlets due  to their vitriol and hatred for the former President. Now Speaker  Pelosi and House Democrats are stonewalling House Republicans' efforts  to deliver answers.   It is our responsibility to keep this country safe. If the CCP is  indeed found responsible for the leak and cover-up, they must be held  accountable for the needless loss of life and for our economy.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to immediately join Republicans  in our call for answers. The American people, and all those around the  world who have lost loved ones, deserve answers.                            ____________________
