 Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Fair  Adjudications for Immigrants Act. This legislation would ensure that  immigrants with criminal convictions do not face barriers to  naturalization and experience unfair removals after their convictions  have been dismissed, expunged, or pardoned by a Federal or State  locality.   What the bill would do. The Fair Adjudications for Immigrants Act is  important in ensuring immigrants are not unjustly treated after  receiving a criminal charge that never resulted in a conviction or  after a previous conviction no longer stands.   Specifically, this bill would ensure that immigrants whose  convictions have been overturned are not penalized when they are no  longer considered valid in the court of conviction or for sentences  that have been fully suspended by the sentencing court.   By redefining the term ``conviction'' in the Immigration and  Nationality Act, this legislation also clarifies that any adjudication  that is appealable or in which the court has issued a judicial  recommendation against removal or probation without judgment will not  count as a conviction.   The bill would apply retroactively to any conviction, adjudication,  or judgement entered before, on, or after the enactment of this bill.  Finally, it establishes that an immigrant cannot be removed on the  basis of a conviction if the sentencing court issues a recommendation  against removal to the Secretary of Homeland Security.   Why the bill is needed. Under current law, rather than having access  to many rehabilitative measures that are afforded in the criminal  justice system, immigrants with dismissed criminal charges, suspended  sentences, or criminal convictions that are no longer considered valid  in the court of conviction still face severe consequences in the  immigration court system.   Some of the immigration consequences that immigrants can face include  unjust removals, mandatory detention, and barriers to naturalization.   It is imperative that we resolve this disparity between immigration  and criminal law to prevent those immigrants with dismissed criminal  charges or with convictions that are no longer considered valid in the  court of conviction from continuing to face punitive immigration  consequences.                                  ______                                         By Mr. THUNE (for himself and Ms. Smith):   S. 2959.
