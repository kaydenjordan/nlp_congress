 Madam Speaker, reality TV. I think most of us are familiar  with reality TV. You are going to see some of that tonight. Now, when  reality TV first started, people watched that, they were enthusiastic  about it, maybe a little intoxicated at times.   I don't know how many shows you had to watch. I don't know how many  iterations you had to watch, Madam Speaker, before you figured out,  well, this really isn't reality. This isn't even real, right? The drama  was contrived, the relationships made up. I suppose it was all to make  you feel better about your own life, watching the crazy, unhinged  existence of these aberrant things on TV.   Ladies and gentlemen, you are going to see some more reality TV  tonight, on this January 6th alleged committee. I call it an alleged  committee because it is not really a committee. There is no minority.  There is no minority on the committee. I know because I am in the  minority. When you have a committee basis, you have the majority, they  pick their members, and the minority picks their members. But when the  majority picks members for the minority, they are the majority. It is  all one side. What you are going to hear is a one-sided tale.   Madam Speaker, this is not a court of law, but it is kind of like  trying to be one in front of the public, trying to act like it is a  court of law for the public to decide. It is a show trial. This is a  Soviet-style show trial.   Unfortunately, there are huge things happening in people's lives  right now. They are paying the highest prices they have ever paid to  drive back and forth to work or to daycare or to get their kids to  school or if they can even afford a vacation. If you have got a small  child, you are worrying every day, am I going to be able to get formula  to feed my child? Of course, we have got this border crisis, cost of  living, supply chain, all that stuff, and we are spending millions of  dollars.   This should actually be a campaign contribution to my friends on the  left. The FEC should make them file a report. Millions and millions of  taxpayer dollars for a show trial, a Soviet-style charade.   How do we know? We know so many ways. We know in so many ways. Like I  said, we are going to get one side of a story. The outcome has already  been determined, Madam Speaker, by the people on this so-called  committee. They issued subpoenas. But they didn't tell the people they  issued the subpoenas to; they told the press. Does that sound like how  things normally go in a court of law where due process is happening?   But this isn't a court of law. You are just supposed to believe it is  one. You are also supposed to believe there is due process. But there  isn't. You are supposed to believe that this is seeking the truth, that  this is seeking some kind of justice, that this is a fact-finding  mission for which the legislature will then promulgate laws to make  sure that mistakes made in the past never happen again.   Ladies and gentlemen, it couldn't be further from the truth.   How do I know? How do you know? Because these folks have hired the  producer from ABC for this prime time show. We could be having this  alleged hearing right now. I am here right now. My colleagues are here  right now. Madam Speaker, you are in the chair right now, but this is  being delayed until prime time with a TV producer, because it is a  show. That is all it is.   These are the same folks that if you want to call it evidence, they  took somebody's text message, and they changed it to say what they  wanted it to say. If it is evidence, they just tampered with evidence.   Madam Speaker, this is an abomination. This is an outrage. This is an  affront to our American Republic and to the order and the rule of law  and to justice.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Biggs), my  good friend, for some comments about what is going to happen, what you  are going to see tonight.    Absolutely.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Biggs).   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Nehls).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas. He is  absolutely right.   Look, I don't think it is a mystery that many of us on this side of  the aisle have no love for the FBI Director. It would be my choice to  remove him immediately and get somebody effective that would do the job  and restore the dignity of the FBI. But that having been said, he said  there was no insurrection. He said there was no collusion.   And as you already probably know--or maybe you don't--you won't find  out tonight--the President of the United States at that time ordered  20,000 troops to be authorized to come to protect the Capitol days in  advance.   And as I said the day after, on January 7, I asked: What did the  Speaker know and when did she know it? But we are not going to find  that out, Madam Speaker. We are never going to know watching this show  trial. This is something from a Third World country, where we use the  instruments of Federal power to prevail upon and against our political  adversary. That is what is happening right now.   What did the Speaker know and when did she know it? And what about  the 20,000 troops that were authorized by the President of the United  States in advance but never asked for by the Speaker of the House--and  as a matter of fact, declined by the Mayor of Washington, D.C.   Madam Speaker, this is not the Mayor's city. This is not the Mayor's  capital of the United States. This is the American people's capital.  She has a duty and she failed in that duty. And now this sham  organization called a committee here, where the Vice President is also  the ranking member--not chosen by the minority. They just made it up.  They could have chosen anybody off the street and said, that is who the  ranking member is. And that is what they did because the verdict is  already in for them.   They already know. They already know what the outcome is for them.  There is no due process here. There is no fairness here. There is no  other side of the story here. There is just a prosecution where you  stand there with your mouth taped shut. You can't call any witnesses.  You can't have your attorney. Then they would like to convict people  and send them away forever and never be heard from again. And that is  what this is; the silencing of the American people.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. Greene).    How many days had you been here, Representative Greene?    So you had been here three days.    If I could interject for just a moment, who is in charge  of security here in the House of Representatives?    Employed by?    Right. The Speaker.    Are we going to find out if they got ordered to do that by  the Speaker or by the leader in the Senate? Are we going to find that  out tonight?    I am sure we will hear about Ray Epps this evening.    No, I have not.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her comments.  Like I said, if you have ever seen reality TV, you know in just a  couple episodes it is not really reality.    Now, I don't know how many of these you will go through this evening,  and we just have a couple of minutes remaining, but I yield to the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Biggs), my good friend, to conclude with  some of his thoughts before we wrap up here this afternoon.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments. In  the remaining 40 seconds I have, I will close by saying every day  Americans wake up and they think it can't get any worse, yet somehow  every day there is something new that actually makes it worse. Tonight  is going to be no different. We are going to push the envelope to  places we have never gone, a show trial right here in the Halls of  Congress as a Supreme Court Justice is under threat.   This is literally like a Third World country, and we have leaders in  this government calling for Justice Kavanaugh--``You have released the  whirlwind.'' That is what was said. Do not let this stand.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
