 Mr. Speaker, I thank the sponsor and proponents of  this legislation. It is so startling, stunning, shocking, absurd to  even be standing here discussing the deportation of men and women who  have worn the uniform and have offered to sacrifice their lives for the  oldest democracy in the world.   Mr. Speaker, it is clearly an effort that is long overdue, and I am  stunned by my friends on the other side of the aisle--I have said that  word, stunned and shocked, that there would be any opposition to this.  We know that immigrants have served in the United States Armed Forces  in every major conflict, and there are now 45,000 immigrants serving in  the armed forces in this country.   It is important that we fix the gap, the loophole, the calls that are  gotten when immigrants are deported. This legislation, I am very  grateful to say, is about fixing this problem.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 7946, that would require or would  have DHS create and enforce a system for identifying noncitizen  veterans and require their status as a veteran to be brought into  consideration in the case of removal proceedings. Their service record  will also be brought into it. Any of us can believe it, they could be  heroic, and that doesn't even count in today's scheme.   It would also require DHS to provide the opportunity for eligible  noncitizen veterans to be granted lawful permanent residence.  Identification of their veteran status would halt any removal  proceedings, and there would be a final administrative decision on the  veterans' eligibility.                                time  1345    What I like also about it is that when you come into basic training,  we can then naturalize these individuals, these servants who have  offered themselves for training and to be part of this government by  fighting, by wearing the uniform, by fighting for democracy to become  citizens.   The Veteran Service Recognition Act is offered in response to DHS'  and the U.S. Immigration and Custom Enforcement's failure to  consistently follow its own policies regarding deportation of those.   That means that we say on the floor of the House with great  embarrassment that we have deported men and women who have served in  uniform; and, yes, we have had challenges with the same kind of--how  should I say it--detoured roads that our own veterans have had to fall  to, substance abuse, or other incidences; but they have still worn the  uniform.   Our veterans can get into the Veterans Court or get into services;  but the other veterans, who have the same defaults, if you will,  because of the conditions of war, have to be deported. That doesn't  make sense.   More than 760,000 noncitizens have enlisted over the past century,  with peaks in world wars and 9/11. There are approximately 45,000  immigrants, as I said, in active service.    Mr. Speaker, I want to make sure that my county  knows that there are 179,000 veterans who live in Harris County, and  1,567,000 veterans who live in Texas. Some of those are our immigrant  veterans, and some are not citizens.   So my point is, here today, that we must find every available way to  treat them as they treated this Nation: I am willing to die for America  and America's values.   Mr. Speaker, I must raise this. Languishing in a Russian prison is a  veteran, Paul Whelan, with bogus charges, a hostage. Alongside of him  is Brittney Griner, and it has been determined that the conditions she  is living in are just atrocious.   My point is, that any time an American needs America to fix the  problem, as a democratic nation, we must stand with those who have  stood with us; those who are citizens and those who are immigrants who  fought for us.   I ask my friends and colleagues to support H.R. 7946.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7946, the Veteran Service  Recognition Act of 2022 that would address immigration-related issues  pertaining to noncitizen military veterans.   By enacting H.R. 7946, the Department of Homeland Security would be  required to create and enforce a system for identifying noncitizen  veterans and require their status as a veteran to be brought into  consideration in the case of removal proceedings.   H.R. 7946 will also require the DHS to provide the opportunity for  eligible noncitizen veterans to be granted lawful permanent resident  status.   Identification of their veteran status would halt any removal  proceedings until there is a final administrative decision on the  veteran's eligibility.   The Veteran Service Recognition Act is offered in response to the  DHS's and the U.S. Immigration and Custom Enforcement's failure to  consistently follow its own policies regarding deportation of those who  served in our armed forces.   Immigration and Customs Enforcement already has policies that  provides special consideration to veterans in light of their service,  but has recklessly failed to follow them.   The Government Accountability Office reported that between 2013 and  2018, ICE did not consistently follow its own policies or maintain  electronic data on the number of veterans placed in removal  proceedings.   Investigators also found that a staggering 70 percent of cases  involving the deportation of noncitizen veterans did not receive a  review as required.   This means that veterans were not granted their right to due process.  As a result, we do not even have an accurate measure of the number of  veterans who have been unjustly deported.   As a nation, we should be ashamed and alarmed by this lack of  information which reflects a lack of concern for treating them fairly.   More than 760,000 noncitizens have enlisted over the past century,  with peaks during the World Wars and 9/11 attacks. Today, there are  approximately 45,000 immigrants in active service.   This issue is important to me because many of our nation's veterans  who are not US citizens are among the 29,000 veterans who live in my  district, the 179,000 who live in Harris County, and the 1,567,000 who  live in Texas, the second most of any state.   The promise of naturalization is sometimes a military recruitment  strategy that targets immigrant communities. Military service is  supposed to qualify veterans for naturalization as U.S. citizens  because honorable service satisfies the ``good moral character''  requirements, according to the 1940 Nationality Act.   But then, in 2017, a Trump administration policy restricted access to  the expedited citizenship that was promised to veterans after 9/11.  [[Page H8770]]    This policy exacerbated the persistent problem of immigrant veterans  not being given the proper guidance on how to complete the  naturalization process.   In turn, this systemic failure leads to more than half of the  eligible noncitizen veterans not completing their naturalization  process, leaving them in a permanent limbo.   When we needed them the most, hundreds of thousands of noncitizens  stepped up to fight for our wars.   And now when they needed us, our nation failed to even recognize  them, let alone protect them.   ``Leave no one behind'' is a common mantra followed by the United  States Armed Forces. We must abide by that principle in support of our  noncitizen veterans who served our country honorably, and make sure  that they, too, are never left behind again.   We must do more to help our foreign-born veterans navigate the  naturalization process. It is up to Congress to act.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Veteran's  Recognition Act.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the horrible  and despicable plight of Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan among other  hostages and United States citizens held around the world in this  particular situation by a despot who wants to use Brittney as a pawn.   This wonderful young woman, 6 feet 9 inches, an Olympian, is now  being taken to a labor camp with vicious conditions, food that is  disgraceful, conditions that are disgraceful. It is only because of the  selfish despot that wants to eliminate democracy, live in an oppressive  society, and use her as a vicious pawn.   I warn Americans: When a former President suggests they want to  suspend the Constitution, watch Iran that is killing people in the  street simply because they want freedom and democracy, and watch Russia  every day.   It has been said, oh, you made a highlight or a star out of Brittney  Griner. No. It was the outcry of her family and community that said: We  just want her home. We want Paul Whelan, a veteran, home.   Yet, this vicious and vile leader thinks that he has something he can  dangle in front of our eyes.   I demand that we get strong-handed with him. This young woman needs  to be brought home to her family, and it is a disgrace that we cannot  get her home.                            ____________________
