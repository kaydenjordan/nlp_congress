 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1, or  better known as the GOP tax scam.   This bill provides tax cuts for corporations and multimillionaires at  the expense of hardworking middle class families. Massive corporate tax  cuts do not guarantee job growth or higher wages. The only thing  guaranteed is the $2.3 trillion that this scam adds to the deficit.   Democrats are serious about passing comprehensive tax reform that is  fair and that puts a little more money in the pockets of working  Americans. This fiasco of a bill is not fair.   Corporations get a massive 15 percent tax cut, but what do working  families get? They get nickeled and dimed.   Despite student loan debts surpassing $1 trillion, this bill  eliminates the student loan interest deduction, which only allows those  earning $80,000 or less to claim it in the first place, squarely  hurting middle class Americans who are trying to pay off debt, save for  a home, or buy a new car.   Teachers will no longer be able to deduct expenses for school  supplies that they purchase with their own money for their classrooms,  yet corporations are able to deduct the cost of those same supplies  that they purchase.   Seniors and people with chronic illnesses would no longer be able to  deduct some of the cost of their treatment. At a time when many  families are feeling the pressures of affording care for their children  and their aging parents, this bill takes money right out of their  pockets.   Under this bill, 29 million households would lose their property tax  deduction. Eighty percent of middle class homeowners would lose,  compared with just 13 percent of high-income earners. Does that sound  fair?   Finally, the elimination of the State and local income tax deduction  disproportionately impacts middle-income families, especially those in  California, whose residents would see an overall net tax increase of  $12.1 billion.   The Tax Code is a reflection of our values. The Republicans have  clearly chosen who they serve--the wealthy and corporations--but I am  concerned about the 36 million Americans who will see a tax increase,  teachers and their students, and people with preexisting conditions.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this disaster of  a bill.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record two letters in opposition to  this bill, one from SEIU and one from the AFL-CIO.                                                           SEIU,                                   Washington, DC, November 6, 2017.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, House Committee on Ways & Means,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Richard Neal,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Ways & Means, Washington,           DC.        Dear Chairman Brady, Ranking Member Neal, and Members of       the House Committee on Ways & Means: On behalf of the two       million members of the Service Employees International Union       (``SEIU''), I write to strongly oppose H.R. 1, the       misleadingly named ``Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.'' H.R. 1 would       double down on the same failed trickle down policies that       have hurt working families for decades. Once again, major       legislation is being drafted behind closed doors, out of the       view of the American people and without any input from       Democratic members of Congress.        It is unconscionable that elected representatives would       mark-up and jam through a bill that significantly affects the       financial security of their constituents without appropriate       time for non-partisan analysis and for all Americans to       properly understand the real impacts on their everyday lives.       There is no need to rush legislation of this magnitude       through Congress due to artificial political timelines.       Instead, there should be an open process by which all       stakeholders including working people and not just corporate       lobbyists are able to provide input.        Although this bill pretends to benefit the middle class,       the tax cuts proposed under this bill would go overwhelmingly       to high-income households and large corporations. And this       bill would actually raise taxes for some low- and moderate-      income households, while making it harder for states to fund       healthcare, education, infrastructure and other investments.       History has shown us that these types of tax breaks never       `trickle down' to working people and will result in cuts to       healthcare, education and other programs our communities       depend on. If passed, this legislation would give       millionaires and corporations a reason to celebrate but would       hurt working Americans who are trying put food on the table,       start their first businesses, send their children to college,       or save for their retirement and buy homes.        For these reasons, SEIU urges you to oppose H.R. 1 and       instead, work in a bi-partisan  [[Page H9401]]       and transparent manner on policies that will improve the       lives of working families. If you have any questions, please       contact John Foti.            Sincerely,                                                         John Gray,      Legislative Director.                                   ____                                                          AFL-CIO,                                  Washington, DC, November 14, 2017.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the AFL-CIO, I urge you       to oppose the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (H.R. 1). H.R. 1 is not a       ``jobs bill,'' it is a job killer that gives huge tax breaks       to companies that outsource jobs. It is also the poster child       for the failed ``trickle-down'' economic theory that has       never worked and has repeatedly stuck working people with the       tab for tax giveaways for millionaires, big corporations, and       Wall Street.        The Republican leadership wants to pay for these giveaways       with drastic cuts to Medicaid, Medicare, education, and other       programs that working people depend on. The price tag of H.R.       1 is $1.5 trillion over 10 years, while the budget resolution       includes $5 trillion in budget cuts, including $1.5 trillion       from Medicaid and Medicare.        H.R 1 would waste trillions of dollars on tax breaks for       people who do not need them. According to the Joint Committee       on Taxation (JCT), 45% of the tax benefits would ultimately       go to households making over $500,000 per year; 38% of the       tax benefits would go to households making over $1 million;       and the top 1% one percent would get an average annual tax       cut of $64,720. By contrast, households making between       $20,000 and $40,000 would actually pay more in taxes.        H.R. 1 would hurt working people in many ways. It would       eliminate the deduction for state and local income and sales       taxes, punishing states that make the kind of investments       that create good jobs and starving communities of the funding       they need for education, infrastructure, and other essential       public services. H.R. 1 would repeal deductions for student       loan interest, tuition expenses, and tuition assistance and       end tax credits for students to cover college expenses,       making it harder for students and their families to afford       higher education at a time when tuition prices are at an all-      time high. Under this bill, corporations could still deduct       their payments to lawyers to fight unions, but union members       could no longer deduct union dues and educators could no       longer deduct their out-of-pocket expenses.        On the corporate side, H.R. 1 would give a giant tax cut to       big corporations that outsource jobs. Under this bill, a       business that creates jobs on Main Street USA would pay U.S.       taxes on its profits at a rate of 20%, while a big       corporation that outsources those same jobs to Ireland or       Switzerland would pay no U.S. taxes on the profits it earns       from outsourcing. Currently, the United States taxes all       profits of U.S. corporations, whether earned in the United       States or in a foreign country, at the same rate of 35%       (though a corporation that earns profits in a foreign country       does not have to pay U.S. taxes on those earnings until it       repatriates them to the United States). H.R. 1 changes this       system so a U.S. corporation never pays any U.S. income taxes       on the profits it earns from active operations in a foreign       country (as opposed to domestic profits that the company       disguises as foreign profits through the use of accounting       gimmicks). Reducing the U.S. tax rate on offshore profits       from 35% to 0%--basically a subsidy to companies that       outsource jobs--would cost $208 billion over 10 years. Even       worse, the bill would encourage foreign countries that want       to attract offshore investment to lower their corporate tax       rate. The more foreign countries lower their corporate tax       rates to attract offshore investment, the bigger the tax       subsidy for offshoring this bill will provide. The GOP tax       bill creates a powerful incentive for big companies to       outsource jobs, and it is an incentive that will grow over       time.        With regard to past profits, the Institute on Taxation and       Economic Policy (ITEP) estimates that H.R. 1 would give       multinational corporations a tax windfall of $529 billion,       allowing them to get away with paying just $223 billion of       the $752 billion they owe on accumulated offshore earnings.       There is no economic case for discounted tax rates on profits       already earned. The last time we gave companies a break on       the profits they booked offshore, they used that money for       executive bonuses and dividends. They did not use the money       for creating new jobs, raises for workers, or investments in       new factories or equipment. The top 15 companies to take       advantage of the so-called ``tax holiday'' in 2004 laid off       20,000 workers in the subsequent two years. There is no       reason to believe this time will be different. JPMorgan says,       ``We expect little economic effect from firms repatriating       funds to the U.S.''        The AFL-CIO urges you to oppose the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act       (H.R. 1), which gives huge tax breaks to companies that       outsource jobs and makes working people pay the price for tax       giveaways to millionaires, big corporations, and Wall Street.            Sincerely,                                                    William Samuel,                           Director, Government Affairs Department.
