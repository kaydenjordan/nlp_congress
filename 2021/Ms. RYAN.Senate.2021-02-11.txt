 Personally, I do not feel a sense of shame or       guilt from my heart for what I was doing. I thought I was       following my President. I thought I was following what we       were called to do. He asked us to fly there. He asked us to       be there. So I was doing what he asked us to do.        Ultimately, yes, we were going in solidarity with President       Trump. President Trump requested that we be in DC on the 6th,       so this was our way of going and stopping the steal.        If it comes down to work--guess what--I'm going to be       there. We're all going to be up  [[Page S647]]       here, and we're going to be breaking those windows.    Yet another Trump supporter who was arrested after breaching the  Capitol, Douglas Sweet, explained in a media interview why he did it.  Referring to Donald Trump, Mr. Sweet said:         He said, ``Hey, I need my digital soldiers to show up on       January 6.'' And we all did.    Some of these individuals who joined in the attack on our Capitol did  so as part of violent, racist groups, which have been officially  condemned by our government. Daniel Goodwyn is a self-proclaimed member  of the Proud Boys. He was one of many. On November 7, Goodwyn tweeted a  picture showing a Proud Boys logo surrounded by ``Stand Back'' and  ``Stand By'' and, again, ``Stand back and stand by!'' and ``Await  orders from our Commander in Chief.''   Look closely at this slide. You are looking at an image of Goodwyn's  own tweet. He was such a loyal follower of President Trump that he used  the President's photo as his own profile picture on Twitter.   Now, remember, President Trump told them to ``Stand back and stand  by'' at the debate. They took it as a call to arms. And when he called  them to arms, they were all ready to act. They were waiting for their  orders, which they got on January 6.   And Goodwyn followed those orders. He stood ready as others broke  into the windows of the Capitol and climbed inside. Here he is on  another of the insurrectionist live streams in one of the first floor  hallways of the building.   When it became clear that Donald Trump was not going to save these  folks from prosecution, when it became clear that the Commander in  Chief had given false commands that went against this country, some of  his supporters even expressed regret, and they said they felt duped.   Here is Jacob Chansley again, whom we saw in a video claiming victory  after the President told the rioters to go home. Earlier in the  afternoon, as you will recall, Chansley carried a spear as he breached  the Capitol, entered the Senate through the Gallery, and went right  here, onto the Senate floor.   Chansley left a threatening note for Vice President Pence, right  there on the Senate dais. It read:         It's only a matter of time. Justice is coming.    On January 7, Chansley spoke to the FBI, and he said that he came as  part of a group effort with other ``patriots'' from Arizona at the  request of the President that all ``patriots'' come to DC on January 6,  2021.   On January 14, Chansley's lawyer gave an interview to Chris Cuomo, in  which he said that Chansley was there ``at the invitation of our  President, who said [he would] wal down Pennsylvania Avenue with him.''  In fact, Chansley's lawyer now says that Chansley felt duped by the  President, and he regrets what the President brought him to do.    This man, who ran through our halls, who ran into this Chamber, who  sat right there on the dais, and who wrote a note for Vice President  Pence that he was coming for him--he and those with him declared they  would remove us from office if we went against Donald Trump. Now he is  saying he would not have done any of that if Mr. Trump had told him not  to.   Chansley is not alone in his postarrest confession that he was  following the directions of Donald Trump. As more and more of these  people have been charged, the confession and the regret simply  cascades. More and more insurrectionists are admitting that they came  at Trump's direction.   When Riley June Williams, known for allegedly helping steal a laptop  from Speaker Pelosi's office, appeared in court on January 21, her  lawyer said to the judge: ``It is regrettable that Ms. Williams took  the President's bait and went inside the Capitol.''   Troy Smocks, who was in the Capitol riot on January 6, posted online  that day: ``[T]oday President Trump told Us to `fight like hell.''' He  also posted that the President ``said that Our cause was a matter of  national security.''   Samuel Fisher was charged with disorderly conduct and illegally being  in the Capitol on January 6. That day, before the attack on this  building, he wrote on his website: ``Trump just needs to fire the bat  signal . . . '' and ``then the pain comes.''   The lawyer for Dominic Pezzola, a leader of the Proud Boys, who was  the first person to break inside the Capitol, said that President Trump  effectively told his client and others:         People of the country, come on down, let people know what       you think. [The] logical thinking was, ``He invited us       down.''    Pezzola's lawyer went on:         These were people acting in a way they have never acted       before, and it begs the question, ``Who lit the fuse?''    On January 6, we know who lit the fuse. Donald Trump told these  insurrectionists to come to the Capitol and stop the steal. And they  did come to the Capitol, and they tried to stop the certification. They  came because he told them to. And they did stop our proceedings, but  only temporarily, because he told them to.   Have you noticed, throughout this presentation, the uncanny  similarity, over and over and over again, of what all these people are  saying? They said what Donald Trump said, and they echo each other:  Stand back and stand by. Stop the steal. Fight like hell. Trump sent  us. We are listening to Trump.   The riots that day left at least 7 people dead; more than 150 people  injured; Members, Senators, and our staffs all traumatized to this day;  damage and pain to our Capitol; damage and pain to Americans; damage to  our police force; and damage to other nations who have always seen us  as a bastion of democracy.   All of these people who have been arrested and charged, they are  being held accountable for their actions. Their leader, the man who  incited them, must be held accountable as well. But, as I said earlier,  you don't have to take my word for it that the insurrectionists acted  at Donald Trump's direction. They said so. They were invited here. They  were invited by the President of the United States.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         Unidentified Speaker. We were invited here. We were       invited. Hey, we were invited here. We were invited by the       President of the United States.    Mr. Manager RASKIN. Senators, Representative DeGette just showed how  the insurrectionists believed and understood themselves to be following  President Trump's marching orders. She explained in chilling detail how  they were acting in perfect alignment with his political instructions  and his explicit strategy to retain power.   They did what he told them to do. This pro-Trump insurrection did not  spring into life out of thin air. We saw how Trump spent months  cultivating America's most dangerous extremist groups. We saw how he  riled them up with corrosive lies and violent rhetoric, so much so that  they were ready and eager for their most dangerous mission,  invalidating the will of the people to keep Donald Trump in office.   We must remember that this was not the first time Donald Trump had  inflamed and incited a mob. Trump knew that his incitement would result  in violence not only because of the thousands of violent messages that  were posted all over the forums and the widespread news of preparations  for violence among extremist groups and his communications on Twitter  with the insurrectionists themselves; he knew it also because he had  seen many of the exact same groups he was mobilizing participate in  extremist violence before. Moreover, he had seen clearly how his own  incitement of violence in praise after the violence took place  galvanized, encouraged, and electrified these extremist followers.  These tactics were road-tested.   January 6 was a culmination of the President's actions, not an  aberration from them. The insurrection was the most violent and  dangerous episode--so far--in Donald Trump's continuing pattern and  practice of inciting violence. But I emphasize ``so far.''   Earlier, Congresswoman Plaskett showed several episodes of Trump's  incitement that took place during the Presidential election. But his  encouragement of violence against other public officials who he thought  had crossed him long predates the 2020 campaign.   The incitement of violence is always dangerous, but it is uniquely  intolerable when done by the President of the United States of America.  But that became the norm.   On President Trump's watch, White supremacists and extremist groups  have spread like wildfire across the land. His own Department of  Homeland  [[Page S648]]  Security called homegrown terrorism the No. 1 threat facing Americans  today. But no matter how many people inside and outside government  begged him to condemn extreme elements promoting violence and, indeed,  civil war in America and race war in America, he just wouldn't do it,  and that is because he wanted to incite and provoke their violence for  his own political gain and for his own strategic objectives.   Ever since he became President, Trump revealed what he thought of  political violence for his side. He praised it, and he encouraged it.   Right now, I am going to play for you just a few clips from over the  years when the President's words successfully incited his supporters  into assaulting his opponents.   (Text of video presentation.)         (People chanting: ``U.S.A.'')        President TRUMP. See, the first group, I was nice: Oh, take       your time. The second group, I was pretty nice. The third       group, I'll be a little more violent. And the fourth group,       I'll say: Get the hell out of here.        I said: Get him the hell out of here, will you, please? Get       him out of here. Throw him out.        I get a little notice--in case you see the security guys,       they are wonderful security guys. They said: Mr. Trump, there       may be somebody with tomatoes in the audience.        So if you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato,       knock the crap out of them, would you? Seriously, OK? Just       knock the hell--I promise you, I will pay for the legal fees.       I promise.    Well, we have seen these clips and many, many more like them before,  but think about the brutal power and effectiveness of his words with  his followers. You heard him. He told his supporters to be a little  more violent, and they responded to his command by literally dragging a  protester across the floor at one of his campaign rallies.   He cried: Get him the hell out of here. Throw him out.   His supporters punched and kicked another protester as he was  escorted from the hall. He told his supporters to knock the hell out of  people who opposed him and promised to pay the legal fees of the  assailants.   Time after time, he encouraged violence. His supporters listened, and  they got the message. But it wasn't just Trump's encouragement of  violence that conditioned his supporters to participate in this  insurrection on January 6; it was also his explicit sanctioning of the  violence after it took place.   Let's watch some of those incidents, beginning with Trump praising  supporters who assaulted a Black protester.   (Text of video presentation.)         President TRUMP. Lying Ted Cruz.        But we've had a couple that were really violent. And the       particular one, when I said I would like to bang him, that       was a very vicious--you know, it was a guy who was swinging--      very loud and then started swinging at the audience. And you       know what? The audience swung back. And I thought it was       very, very appropriate. He was swinging, he was hitting       people, and the audience hit back. And that is what we need a       little bit more of.        Unidentified Speaker. We will talk to you about that later.        Unidentified Speaker. Yep. There's not going to be time.        Unidentified Speaker. I am sick and tired of you guys. The       last time you came here you did the same thing. Get the hell       out of here.        Unidentified Speaker. You suck.        Unidentified Speaker. Get the hell out of here.        Unidentified Speaker. The last guy did the same thing. Are       you the guardian?        Unidentified Speaker. Yes, and you just broke my glasses.        Unidentified Speaker. The last guy did the same damn thing.        Unidentified Speaker. You just body-slammed me and broke my       glasses.        President TRUMP. Greg is smart. And, by the way, never       wrestle him. Do you understand that? Never.        Any guy that can do a body slam, he is my kind--        (People chanting: ``Jews will not replace us.'')        (People chanting: ``Fuck you, faggots.'')        Unidentified Speaker. What the fuck, you asshole.        Unidentified Speaker. I am not even saying we are not       violent. I'm saying that we fucking didn't aggress. We did       not initiate force against anybody. We are not nonviolent. We       will fucking kill these people if we have to.        President TRUMP. I do think there's blame, yes. I think       there is blame on both sides. You look at--you look at both       sides. I think there is blame on both sides. You also had       people that were very fine people on both sides.    Just in case you didn't catch all of that, the President praised a  Republican candidate who assaulted a journalist as ``my kind'' of guy.  He said there were ``very fine people on both sides'' when the neo- Nazis, the Klansmen, and Proud Boys invaded the city--the great city of  Charlottesville--and killed Heather Heyer. And he said that an attack  on a Black protester at one of his rallies was very, very appropriate.   Does that sound familiar? Listen to how President Trump responded  when asked abou his own conduct on January 6.    (Text of video presentation.)         Unidentified Speaker. What is your personal responsibility?        President TRUMP. So if you read my speech--and many people       have done it--it has been analyzed, and people thought that       what I said was totally appropriate.    So there the pattern is, staring us in the face. Very, very  ``appropriate,'' he said after a man was assaulted at one of his  rallies. ``Totally appropriate'' was how he characterized his  incitement on January 6, meaning that, of course, if given the chance,  he would gladly do it again because why would he not engage in totally  appropriate conduct?   An examination of his past statements makes it clear that when Donald  Trump tells a crowd, as he did on January 6, ``fight like hell or you  won't have a country anymore,'' he meant for them to fight like hell.  On January 6, that became clear to all of America.   Now, let's consider the events, Senators, that took place last year  in Michigan where President Trump demonstrated his willingness and his  ability to incite violence against government officials who he thought  were getting in his way.   When responding to extremist plots in Michigan, Trump showed he knew  how to use the power of a mob to advance his political objectives.   Beginning in March, Trump leveled attacks on Michigan Governor  Gretchen Whitmer for the coronavirus policies in her State.   On March 17, the day after Governor Whitmer pushed the Federal  Government to better support the States on COVID-19, Trump criticized  her handling of the pandemic, tweeting:         Failing Michigan Governor must work harder and be much more       proactive. We are pushing her to get the job done. I stand       with Michigan!    On March 27, he added:         I love Michigan, one of the reasons we are doing such a       GREAT job for them during this horrible Pandemic. Yet your       Governor, Gretchen ``Half'' Whitmer is way in over her ahead,       she doesn't have a clue. Likes blaming everyone for her own       ineptitude! #MAGA.    By April, Trump's rhetorical attacks and name-calling turned to calls  for mass mobilization of his supporters. This was a sign of things to  come.   On April 17, 2020, he tweeted:                              LIBERATE MICHIGAN    Not even 2 weeks later, on April 30, his supporters marched on the  Michigan State capitol in Lansing. They stormed the building. Trump's  marching orders were followed by aggressive action on the ground.   (Text of video presentation.)         Unidentified Speaker. We have a right. Let us in.        (People chanting: ``Let us in.''        Unidentified Speaker. Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler.        Unidentified Speaker. You policemen are all cowards. You       betrayed us. The police have betrayed the people.        (People chanting: ``Lock her up up.'')    As the video shows, these militant protesters showed up ready to take  a violent stand. They came armed and tightly packed themselves into the  building with no regard, of course, for social distancing.   This Trump-inspired mob may indeed look familiar to you: Confederate  battle flags, MAGA hats, weapons, camo Army gear--just like the  insurrectionists who showed up and invaded this Chamber on January 6.   The siege of the Michigan State House was effectively a State-level  dress rehearsal for the siege of the U.S. Capitol that Trump incited on  January 6. It was a preview of the coming insurrection.   President Trump's response to these two events was strikingly  similar. Following the armed siege in Lansing, President Trump refused  to condemn the attacks on the Michigan capitol or denounce the violent  lawbreakers. Instead, he did just the opposite. He  [[Page S649]]  upheld the righteousness of his violent followers' cause, and he put  pressure on the victim of the attack to listen to his supporters.   The day after the mob attack in Lansing, Trump told Governor Whitmer  to negotiate with extremists, tweeting that the Governor should just  ``give a little'' to the violent men who had stormed the Capitol,  threatening not only the stability of the Michigan government but her  own life.   As you can see, he tweeted:         The Governor of Michigan should give a little, and put out       the fire. These are very good people, but they are angry.       They want their lives back again, safely! See them, talk to       them, make a deal.    The President said heavily armed extremists carrying Confederate  battle flags and pushing past police to overtake the Michigan State  House chamber are ``very good people'' and just negotiate with them.   It is clear he doesn't think that they are at fault in any way at  all. But April 30 wasn't the only time Trump supporters stormed the  Michigan capitol. Emboldened by the praise and his encouragement and  support, they escalated again. Governor Whitmer refused to capitulate  to the President's demand to negotiate with them.   Two weeks later, on May 14, Trump's mob again stormed the State  capitol. This time, as you can see here, one man brought a doll with a  noose around the neck, foreshadowing the appearance of the large  gallows erected outside of this building, downstairs from here, on  January 6, as the crowd chanted--and I still can hear the words ringing  in my ear--``Hang Mike Pence. Hang Mike Pence. Hang Mike Pence.''   Over the coming months, even after a crowd threatening Governor  Whitmer stormed the capitol, Trump continued to assail her in public.  At a rally in Michigan on September 10, Trump whipped up the crowd  against Governor Whitmer saying:         She doesn't have a clue about reopening her own state's       economy.    The crowd cheered.   Then, on October 8, the precise consequences of the President's  incitement to violence were revealed to the whole world.   (Video presentation.)   Look at this. Thirteen men were arrested by the FBI for plotting to  storm the Michigan State capitol building, launch a civil war, kidnap  Governor Whitmer, transport her to Wisconsin, and then try and execute  her.   This was an assassination conspiracy, a kidnapping conspiracy. Look  at the language that they used. In the charging document, the FBI  reported that one of the conspirators said he needed ``200 men'' to  storm the capitol building and take political hostages, including the  Governor. The suspect called it a ``snatch and grab, man. Grab the  [f'ing] Governor.''   One of those men already pled guilty to this conspiracy.   The plot was well organized, just like the one that was coming on  January 6. The men in Michigan even considered building Molotov  cocktails to disarm police vehicles and attempted to construct their  own IEDs--something that actually happened here on January 6. Police  authorities arrested extremists who had weapons and materials to build  explosive devices, including one man found with an assault rifle and  enough materials to make 11 Molotov cocktails.   On September 17, 2020, one of the Michigan conspiracists posted:         When the time comes there will be no need to try and strike       fear through presence. The fear will be manifested through       bullets.    And what did Donald Trump do as President of the United States to  defend one of our Nation's Governors against a plotted kidnapping by  violent insurrections? Did he publicly condemn violent domestic  extremists who hoped and planned to launch a civil war in America? No,  not at all. He further inflamed them by continuing to attack the  Governor who was the object of their hatred in this kidnapping  conspiracy.   The very night this conspiracy became public and that Governor  Whitmer learned that there were 13 men who were planning to kidnap and  likely kill her, Trump did not condemn the violence. He did not  criticize the extremists. He didn't even check on Governor Whitmer's  safety. He chose to vilify Governor Whitmer again and then, amazingly,  took credit for foiling the plot against her, demanding her gratitude,  and then quickly, of course, changed the subject to antifa. He tweeted:         Governor Whitmer . . . has done a terrible job.    He demanded that she thank him for the law enforcement operation that  had foiled the kidnapping conspiracy that had been encouraged by his  rhetoric.   On October 17, a little over a week after these people were arrested  for preparing to kidnap Gretchen Whitmer, Donald Trump riled up the  boisterous crowd in Muskegon with more personal attacks on Whitmer,  driving the crowd to chant ``Lock her up. Lock her up.''   He had now seen that some of his followers were prepared to engage in  criminal violence with orchestrated attacks, deadly weapons, and  willing bodies to storm a State capitol building and to attack his  perceived political enemies, and so as the crowd chanted ``Lock her  up,'' he pivoted to his next goal. He told them they couldn't trust the  Governor to administer fair elections in Michigan. He used the crowd  that he knew would readily engage in violence to prepare his followers  for his next and, of course, his paramount political objective:  claiming the election was stolen and inciting insurrectionary action.   He did it again on October 27 during a preelection rally speech in  Lansing, MI, where the capitol had been stormed. Trump openly joked  with the crowd about critics saying his words had provoked the violent  plot against Governor Whitmer. Check it out. It is telling.   (Text of video presentation.)         President TRUMP. We got to get her going. I don't think she       likes me too much.        (People chanting: ``Lock her up.'')        President TRUMP. See, I don't comment to that because every       time, if I make just even a little bit of a nod, they say:       ``The President led them on.'' No, I don't have to lead you       on. Even a little nod, they say: ``The President said.'' Your       Governor, at the urging of her husband, who has abused our       system very badly--the only man allowed in the State of       Michigan--the only man allowed to go sailing is her husband.       Now, your Governor--I don't think she likes me too much. Hey,       hey, hey, hey, I'm the one. It was our people that helped her       out with her problem. I mean, we have to see if it is a       problem, right? People are entitled to say maybe it was a       problem, maybe it wasn't. It was our people--my people--our       people that helped her out.    So President Trump offered them a little winking inside joke about  his constant incitement of the mob and how much can actually be  communicated by him with just a little nod--just a little nod.   He presided over another pounding, rhythmic rendition of his  trademark chant: ``Lock her up. Lock her up.'' Then, referring to the  FBI's foiling of the kidnapping conspiracy, which was deadly serious,  he said that he helped her out with a problem.   (Text of video presentation.)         Maybe it was a problem; maybe it wasn't. We will have to       see.        Maybe it was a problem; maybe it wasn't.    The President of the United States of America--he could not bring  himself to publicly oppose a kidnapping and potential assassination  conspiracy plot against a sitting Governor of one of our 50 States?   Trump knew exactly what he was doing in inciting the January 6 mob-- exactly. He had just seen how easily his words and actions inspired  riots in Michigan. He sent a clear message to his supporters. He  encouraged planning and conspiracies to take over capitol buildings and  threaten public officials who refused to bow down to his political  will.   Is there any chance Donald Trump was surprised by the results of his  own incitement? Let's do what Tom Paine told us to do, use our common  sense, the sense we have in common as citizens.   If we don't draw the line here, what is next? What makes you think  the nightmare with Donald Trump and his lawmaking and violent mobs is  over? If we let him get away with it and then it comes to your  Stat capital or it comes back here again, what are we going to say?    These prior acts of incitement cast a harsh light on Trump's obvious  intent--obvious intent--his unavoidable knowledge of the consequences  of his incitement, the unavoidable knowledge of the consequences of his  incitement, and the clear foreseeability of the violent harm that he  unleashed on our people and our Republic.  [[Page S650]]    January 6 was not some unexpected, radical break from his normal law- abiding and peaceful disposition. This was his state of mind. This was  his essential M.O. He knew that, egged on by his tweets, his lies, and  his promise of a wild time in Washington to guarantee his grip on  power, his most extreme followers would show up bright and early, ready  to attack, ready to engage in violence, ready to fight like hell for  their hero, just like they answered his call in Michigan.   President Trump has said over and over his supporters are loyal. In  his own words, his supporters are the ``most loyal'' we have seen in  our country's history. He knew that his most hardcore supporters were  willing to direct violence at elected officials--indeed, to attack and  lay siege to a capitol building--and he knew they would be ready to  heed his call on January 6 to stop the steal by using violence to block  the peaceful transfer of power in the United States. He knew they were  coming. He brought them here, and he welcomed them with open arms:         We hear you (and love you) from the Oval Office.    My dear colleagues, is there any political leader in this room who  believes that if he is ever allowed by the Senate to get back into the  Oval Office, Donald Trump would stop at inciting violence to get his  way? Would you bet the lives of more police officers on that? Would you  bet the safety of your family on that? Would you bet the future your  democracy on that?   President Trump declared his conduct totally appropriate, so if he  gets back into office and it happens again, we will have no one to  blame but ourselves.   Mr. Lieu will return now to tell you about President Trump's total  lack of remorse after the insurrection.   Mr. Manager LIEU. Good afternoon. My colleagues walked you through  President Trump's actions leading up to January 6 and then the horrific  events on January 6, and we saw both during the attack as well as in  the days after the attack that this was a President who showed no  remorse and took no accountability--in fact, quite the opposite. As  Representative Raskin showed you, President Trump claimed that his  actions were ``totally appropriate.''   The assertion that everyone thought Donald Trump's actions were  totally appropriate, including people in this room, is, of course,  untrue. It is also dangerous. That is why Members of Congress and U.S.  Senators, former and current administration officials, State and local  officials, all unequivocally confirm what we witnessed with our own  eyes--that Donald Trump's conduct was wrong, it was destructive,  dishonorable, and un-American.   President Trump's lack of remorse and refusal to take accountability  during the attack shows his state of mind. It shows that he intended  the events of January 6 to happen, and when it did, he delighted in it.   President Trump's lack of remorse and refusal to take accountability  after the attack poses its own unique and continuing danger. It sends  the message that it is acceptable to incite a violent insurrection to  overthrow the will of the people and that a President of the United  States can do that and get away with it.   That is why we have to hold President Trump accountable, to send a  message that it is never patriotic to incite a violent attack against  our Nation's Capitol and that future Presidents will know that they  cannot follow in Donald Trump's footsteps and get away with it.   So let's start with the day of the attack. On insurrection day,  January 6, President Trump did not once condemn the attack, not even  once. Even when he finally asked the violent extremists to go home,  which was 3 hours after the attack began, he sends this video, and he  ends it with ``You're very special. We love you.'' That was his message  to people who perpetrated this violent, gruesome attack--``We love  you''--and then 2 hours later, he tweets ``Remember this day forever.''   This is not a man who showed remorse, but it is worse than that.  After that tweet, it took him another full day to even condemn the  attack itself. The very next day, President Trump was eerily silent,  and then at 7:01 p.m., he releases a prerecorded video, and there,  President Trump for the first time, nearly 30 hours after the attack  began, acknowledges and condemns the violent mayhem that occurred. He  said the demonstrators ``defiled the seat of American democracy.'' He  said that these demonstrators didn't represent this country and if they  broke the law, they would pay.   But even in that video, he says more lies. He says in that very same  video that he immediately deployed the National Guard. That, again, is  not true. The National Guard was not deployed until over 2 hours after  the attack began at around 3 p.m. Because of this late deployment, the  National Guard did not arrive until after 5 p.m.   When the Guard was deployed, the Pentagon had released a statement  that showed the list of people--and you saw that list--of folks that  were consulted before deploying the National Guard.   Several people were on their list, including the Vice President.  President Trump was not on that list. You know, as a veteran, I find it  deeply dishonorable that our Commander in Chief did not protect us.  Then, later, he tried to take credit for something he failed to do.  Shameful.   Also, in that video, you should note what it did not say. Absent from  that entire video was any actual acceptance of responsibility for his  actions. Absent from that video was a call to his most fervent  supporters to never do this again. And here was his final message in  that so-called condemnation-of-attack video.   Here is what he actually said:   (Text of video presentation of 1-7-2021.)         President TRUMP. And to all of my wonderful supporters, I       know you are disappointed, but I also want you to know that       our incredible journey is only just beginning.    President Trump not only failed to show remorse or take  accountability, he made clear he is just beginning.   For days, he did not address the Nation after this attack. We needed  our Commander in Chief to lead, to unite a grieving country, to comfort  us. But what did President Trump do? Nothing. Silence. We are all aware  that a violent mob murdered a police officer. It took President Trump 3  days before he lowered the flag of the United States of America--3  days--and President Trump, who was Commander in Chief at the time, did  not attend and pay respects to the officer who lay in state in the very  building that he died defending.   Now, some people have argued that President Trump made a mistake;  that he gets a mulligan, but we know President Trump didn't make a  mistake because, you see, if you or I make a mistake when something  very bad happens, we would show remorse; we would accept  responsibility. President Trump didn't do any of that. Why not? Because  he intended for what happened on January 6. And how do we know that? He  told us.   On January 12, as President Trump was boarding Air Force One, headed  to Texas--and you saw this video before, and I am going to show it  again--he was asked by a reporter:         What is your role in what happened at the Capitol? What is       your personal responsibility?    This was his response:   (Text of video presentation of 1-12-2021.)         President TRUMP. But they've analyzed my speech and my       words and my final paragraph, my final sentence, and       everybody, to the T, thought it was totally appropriate.    On January 12, President Trump had seen the violent attack on the  Capitol. He knew people had died, and his message to all of us was that  his conduct was totally appropriate.   I am a former prosecutor, and we are trained to recognize lack of  remorse, but it doesn't take a prosecutor to understand that President  Trump was not showing remorse; he was showing defiance. He was telling  us that he would do this again; that he could do this again; that he  and future Presidents can run for national election, lose an election,  inflame the supporters for months, and then incite an insurrection and  that that would be totally appropriate.   One week after the attack, on January 13, President Trump, in  response to continuing bipartisan criticism, released another video.   Here is part of what he said:   (Text of video presentation of 1-13-2021.)         President TRUMP. I want to be very clear. I unequivocally       condemn the violence that  [[Page S651]]       we saw last week. Violence and vandalism have absolutely no       place in our country and no place in our movement.    President Trump, of course, needed to make that statement. He needed  to unequivocally condemn that attack, but he also needed to mean those  words. You saw Donald Trump tweet endless attacks--sometimes 108 tweets  in a day--and in public speeches and across rallies, repeating words of  ``Fight'' and ``Stop the steal'' and ``Never surrender.'' You know what  it looks like when President Trump wants to convey a message.  Forcefully, loudly, and repeatedly he does that.   This video, sent after a week of the attack, was not that. We know  this because, in this video, he again does not show remorse and does  not take responsibility. He again does not acknowledge his role in the  insurrection. He does not say in that video, for example, ``Everything  I said in the months prior went too far,'' and he does not say the one  sentence that matters. He does not say the one sentence that would stop  future political violence: ``The election was not stolen.'' He still  hasn't said that sentence. That is why National Guard troops, in full  body armor, still patrol outside.   Reports from the White House also confirm that President Trump  believed he was ``forced by the bipartisan furor after the insurrection  to acknowledge the new administration.'' We know he did not stand  behind his belated condemnation because those around him confirmed it.  Behind closed doors, sources confirmed that President Trump still  refused to directly acknowledge his election loss to Joe Biden. He  refused to even attend the peaceful transition of power--the first  President in modern history. President Trump even, reportedly, while  watching the impeachment vote, ``focused his ire'' on the Republicans  who voted for his impeachment, peppering aides with questions about  ``what he could do to exact revenge.''   President Trump has made clear that, if he is not held accountable,  he will not be accountable. He will not stop. Now, President Trump  would have his base and the world believe that his conduct was totally  appropriate. It is important to impeach that falsehood, to make clear  to his supporters and everyone watching that what Donald Trump did was  not acceptable--in fact, quite the opposite.   People in his own party--State officials, former officials, current  officials, Members of Congress--have, unambiguously and passionately,  said that what Donald Trump did was ``disgraceful,'' ``shameful,'' and  have called his behavior ``existential'' and ``wrong,'' and they have  said that his actions gave rise to one of the darkest chapters in  United States' history.   Let's hear what some of these officials had to say. Here are  Governors Spencer Cox, Charlie Baker, Mike DeWine, Larry Hogan, and  Phil Scott.   (Text of video presentation of 1-11-2021.)         Mr. Cox. And people have to be held accountable. And yes,       that includes the President.    (Text of video presentation of 1-7-2021.)         Mr. Baker. It's important to remember that they were the       culmination of months of President Trump repeating over and       over again that the American electoral system is a fraud.       After he stoked the flames of outrage for weeks leading up to       the events of yesterday, he refused t adequately prepare the  U.S. Capitol for the possibility of violence and left it nearly  defenseless. His remarks during and after the travesty of the attack on  the Capitol were disgraceful.    (Text of video presentation of 1-7-2021.)         Mr. DeWine. President Trump's continued refusal to accept       the election results without producing credible evidence of a       rigged election has stirred the fire that has threatened to       burn down our democracy. This incendiary speech yesterday,       the one he gave preceding the march, that he gave to the       protesters, served only to fan those flames.    (Text of video presentation of 1-7-2021.)         Mr. Hogan. I proudly stood by my father's side at age 12 on       the floor of the House Chamber as we both took the oath of       office, an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the       United States. It's clear to me that President Trump has       abandoned this sacred oath.    (Text of video presentation of 1-7-2021.)         Mr. Scott. Seeing our Capitol, a symbol of democracy around       the world, stormed by an angry mob was heartbreaking. And let       me be clear: These actions were not patriotic, and these       people are not patriots. The fact that these flames of hate       and insurrection were lit by the President of the United       States will be remembered as one of the darkest chapters in       our Nation's history.    One of the darkest chapters in our Nation's history.   Former members of the Trump administration, longstanding Republicans,  also made clear that President Trump incited this insurrection and that  it went against our democracy.   The President's former Secretary of Defense, James Mattis, declared:         [T]oday's violent assault on our Capitol, an effort to       subjugate American democracy by mob rule, was fomented by Mr.       Trump.    Former White House Chief of Staff John Kelly spoke on this as well,  and I would like to play an audio clip of what he said.   (Text of audio presentation of 1-7-2021.)         Mr. Kelly. [W]hat happened on Capitol Hill . . . was a       direct result of him poisoning the minds of people with the       lies and the fraud.    If you couldn't hear that, what John Kelly said about President Trump  was that what happened on Capitol Hill was a direct result of his  poisoning the minds of people with the lies and the fraud.   Former Speaker of the House John Boehner declared:         [T]he invasion of our Capitol by a mob, incited by lies       from some entrusted with power, is a disgrace to all who       sacrificed to build our Republic.    This was echoed by former Trump official after former Trump official.   Here is what former National Security Advisors John Bolton and H.R.  McMaster, former White House Communications Director Alyssa Farah, and  former Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said:   (Text of video presentation of 1-7-2021.)         Mr. Tapper. Let me just ask you: Do you think President       Trump has blood on his hands?        Mr. Bolton. I think he does. Look, I agree with Bill Barr.       I think he did incite this mob with the clear intention of       having them disrupt the electoral college certification and       delay it to give him more time. I don't think there's any       question about it.    (Text of video presentation of 1-7-2021.)         Mr. McMaster. There are many reasons for this assault on       the Capitol, but foremost among them was the President's       exhortations, was the President's sustained disinformation.    (Text of video presentation of 1-17-2021.)         Mr. McMaster. We've seen a President stoking fears amidst       these crises.    (Text of video presentation of 1-17-2021.)         Ms. Farah. First and foremost, I want to say that what       happened at the Capitol was unacceptable, un-American,       undemocratic.    (Text of video presentation of 1-8-2021.)         Mr. Mulvaney. I think everybody recognizes that what       happened on Wednesday is different. You can go down the long       litany of things that people complained about with Donald       Trump, and I could probably defend almost all of them. Many       of them were policy differences; many of them were stylistic       differences, but Wednesday was different. Wednesday was       existential. Wednesday is one of those things that struck to       the very heart of what it means to be an American, and it was       wrong.    Mick Mulvaney, President Trump's former Chief of Staff, is clearly  saying what we all felt--that January 6 was different. It was  existential. It was wrong. It was un-American.   This sentiment was echoed not just from people outside the  administration but from people inside the Trump administration. Perhaps  the most telling was the flood of resignations from people inside  President Trump's administration with firsthand access to President  Trump. His own officials felt so betrayed by his conduct that numerous  officials resigned in protest days before the end of President Trump's  term. Sixteen officials resigned in protest--16. They all took this  dramatic action of resigning because they saw the clear link between  President Trump's conduct and the violent insurrection.   Here is some of what they said.   Secretary DeVos, who was in the administration the entire term, told  President Trump in her resignation letter:         [T]here is no mistaking the impact your rhetoric had on the       situation, and it is an inflection point for me.    Secretary Chao, who was in the administration the entire term,  explained:   [[Page S652]]              Yesterday, our country experienced a traumatic and entirely       avoidable event as supporters of the President stormed the       Capitol building following a rally he addressed. As I'm sure       is the case with many of you, it has deeply troubled me in a       way I simply cannot set aside.    Deputy Costello told his associates the attack was his ``breaking  point'' and, he hoped, ``a wake-up call.''   These rebukes and resignations from President Trump's own  administration make clear that President Trump's conduct was anything  but totally appropriate. They also remind us that this can and must be  a wake-up call.   As Representative Fred Upton so eloquently put it, ``[President  Trump] expressed no regrets for last week's violent insurrection at the  U.S. Capitol. This sends exactly the wrong signal to those of us who  support the very core of our democratic principles and took a solemn  oath to the Constitution. . . . It is time to say: Enough is enough.''   Now, no one is saying here that President Trump cannot contest the  election. Of course, he can. But what President Trump did, as his  former Chief of Staff explained, was different. It was dishonorable, it  was un-American, and it resulted in fatalities. President Trump spent  months inflaming his supporters, spread lies to incite a violent attack  on our Capitol, on our law enforcement, and on all of us.   And then he lied again to his base to tell them that this was all OK,  that this was all acceptable. And that is why President Trump is so  dangerous--because he would have all of us, all Americans, believe that  any President who comes after him can do exactly the same thing.   That is why lack of remorse is an important factor in impeachment,  because impeachment, conviction, and disqualification is not just about  the past. It is about the future. It is making sure that no future  official, no future President does the same exact thing President Trump  does.   President Trump's lack of remorse shows that he will undoubtedly  cause future harm if allowed, because he still refuses to account for  his previous grave crime against our government.   You know, I am not afraid of Donald Trump running again in 4 years. I  am afraid he is going to run again and lose because he can do this  again.   We are in an unusual situation because, despite President Trump's  claim that everyone thinks what he did was fine, so many have come out  and spoken so strongly and passionately about what happened here.   I would like to highlight a statement by Representative Anthony  Gonzalez. He said:         The Vice President and both chambers of Congress had their       lives put in grave danger as a result of the President's       actions in the events leading up to and on January 6th.       During the attack itself, the President abandoned his post       while many members asked for help, thus further endangering       all present. These are fundamental threats not just to       people's lives but to the very foundation of our Republic.    And now I would like to show what Members of Congress said leading up  to the most bipartisan impeachment vote in U.S. history, because I do  want everyone watching, especially President Trump's supporters, to see  firsthand what I believe we all feel--that what President Trump did was  not appropriate, that it was not American, and that it absolutely  cannot stand.
