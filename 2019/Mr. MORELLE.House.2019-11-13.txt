 Mr. Speaker, 1 year ago today, I took the oath of office  and was sworn in as a Member of the United States House of  Representatives.   It is truly the honor of a lifetime to represent New York's 25th  District, and I am grateful every day for the opportunity to serve the  community I love.   I am so proud of the work we have done in the past year to improve  the lives of everyday Americans. The House has passed landmark  legislation to create universal background checks on all gun sales. We  are taking action to lower the cost of prescription drugs and make  healthcare more affordable for working families. We are fighting to  protect our climate, strengthen our economy, close the gender pay gap,  and ensure everyone has access to a quality education.   Back home, I am working with community partners on strategies to  reduce poverty and give opportunity to all of our citizens.   I am proud of our work, but there is so much more still to be done,  and I look forward to another year continuing my work for the people of  my community and the people of the United States.                            ____________________
