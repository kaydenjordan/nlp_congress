 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to wish the great  Georgia Governor and U.S. Senator Zell Miller a happy 85th birthday. He  celebrated his milestone on February 24, 2017.   For his undergraduate education, Mr. Miller attended the University  of Georgia as well as my alma mater, Young Harris College. He often  compared Young Harris to a shoe factory because, as he says, you enter  single but you leave as a pair. Fittingly, it is where Mr. Miller met  his wife of more than 60 years, Shirley. Also fittingly, it is where I  met my wife of 38 years, Amy.   Mr. Miller has dedicated much of his life to serving the public,  starting out as the mayor of his small hometown of Young Harris in  north Georgia. This outstanding career led him through every level of  service, including State senator, Lieutenant Governor, Governor, and  United States Senator.   Mr. Miller's dedication to his home State of Georgia and the United  States as a whole continues to have lasting effects that are felt to  this day. As Governor of Georgia one of Mr. Miller's greatest gifts was  the HOPE Scholarship. This fund opens up educational  [[Page H2005]]  opportunities for thousands of Georgians every year by providing  college tuition assistance to qualified students.   Mr. Miller's legacy is well known in Georgia, but his accomplishments  and charisma also earned him the respect of his colleagues across our  Nation.   Once again, I want to wish a happy 85th birthday to Zell Miller and  thank him for his contributions to Georgia and the United States. We  can all learn from the great example of his dedication to the public.  time  1930                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend,  the gentleman from Florida, Representative Yoho, for this opportunity  and for hosting this tonight to discuss how ObamaCare is affecting  folks at home.   Consider the case of Bob Joiner, an independent adviser in south  Georgia. His wife, Kim, is an audiologist who works in a small practice  that does not provide healthcare benefits.   Bob and Kim exercise regularly, they watch their nutrition, and they  are fortunate to not have any health problems. They also have a 28- year-old son named Wesley.   In 2016, Bob's monthly healthcare premium increased 134 percent, and  his son's climbed to an astonishing 190 percent. In total, their 2016  annual premiums were $4,285.56 for their son Wesley and $19,026.12 for  Bob and Kim.   The Joiners should have been hopeful that, in 2017, they could change  their plan for something more affordable. But thanks to the Affordable  Care Act, that wasn't the case. This year, only one Affordable Care  Act-compliant plan was accessible to them on the healthcare.gov  website. An additional policy featuring a higher deduction with lower  premiums was available. However, the plan was not ObamaCare-compliant,  leaving the Joiners subjected to the Affordable Care Act penalty.   Before ObamaCare, the Joiner family's annual premium for the whole  family--the entire family--was $7,428. At the time, they had access to  multiple providers and dozens of plan designs. Unfortunately, ObamaCare  has brought chaos into the healthcare system.   I want to repeat that again. Before ObamaCare, the family's annual  premium for the whole family--for Bob, Kim, and their son Wesley--was  $7,428. Last year, just for Wesley, it was $4,285. For Bob and Kim, it  was $19,026. Folks, that is just astonishing. That is not right.   The Joiners are not alone when they explained that they are unable to  save for retirement or pay down their mortgage because of progressive  increases in healthcare costs. Patients across the country now face  this grim reality because ObamaCare has failed.   Just as the Joiners saw patient costs are skyrocketing, last year the  Obama administration even admitted that premium hikes were coming for  this year's healthcare plans.   It turns out the national average premium increase is an astonishing  25 percent. That is the average. In seven States, it is more than 50  percent. Unbelievable.   Well, Mr. Speaker, today is a new day. This afternoon, the Energy and  Commerce Committee completed a marathon markup of its portion of what  was ultimately to be the ObamaCare reconciliation bill.                                time  2100    It was an honor to be a part of that. Twenty-seven hours and 27  minutes we met, and we finally got it out of committee. Now it goes to  the Committee on the Budget, along with the bill that the Committee on  Ways and Means has sent. So those two bills will be put together and  they will go to reconciliation.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have been a part of this historic  opportunity, taking the first meaningful steps toward entitlement  reform and replacing ObamaCare. I thank all of my colleagues who are  here this evening taking part in this Special Order as well as thank  each Member of Congress who has and continues to take a stand against  the idea of a top-down, one-size-fits-all approach to health care.   Our plan presents a better way. The American Health Care Plan will  give us access and affordability. It will give us patient-centered  health care. Enough of this top-down, cookie-cutter approach that we  have had, thinking that everything from Washington, D.C., is better,  thinking that we know what the States need. That is not right. What we  need is to empower patients. What we need is to have patients in  control of their healthcare system, and this is what the American  Health Care plan does. It empowers patients through health savings  accounts, through tax credits, reforming Medicaid. The American Health  Care Plan is on its way. I am excited. I am excited for America.   I, again, thank Representative Yoho for hosting this Special Order.  We appreciate your work. I thank all Members of Congress who have had a  part of this on both sides of the aisle. I thank everyone. Help is on  the way: better health care, market-based health care, where  competition and choices will be the case, where insurance companies  will be fighting for your business, where you will have choices, where  you will have competition in the market. That is what we need. That is  what is going to bring healthcare costs down.
