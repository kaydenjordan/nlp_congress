 Mr. President, last week, the country and the world  received some really great news that we have longed for quite a while  to hear. A major American drug company, together with its German  partner, announced that their candidate for a COVID-19 vaccine appears  to be at least 90 percent effective in trials. That is 90 percent--nine  zero. Dr. Fauci called these preliminary results extraordinary. Another  expert called the news ``as good as you could hope for.''   Of course, tests and trials are ongoing. The FDA will perform its own  thorough review, which will include analyzing months of safety data.  The American people should rest assured there are appropriate and  necessary measures to ensure the safety and efficacy of any vaccine  before it is rolled out to the American people, but this will proceed  with the lifesaving urgency that is called for.   Right now, COVID-19 is continuing to spread across the country at  rates that are not sustainable and which we must try to slow.  Yesterday, my home State of Kentucky just logged its highest ever daily  total--2,700 new cases. The positivity rate of our tests is the highest  since early May.   It is urgent that all Americans continue the smart steps that have  gotten us this far: wearing masks, social distancing, adapting our  plans and routines. This virus is not going to magically leave us alone  if we decide we are fed up with taking precautions, but thank God and  thanks to the brilliant scientists, we may look back on this hopeful  announcement as the beginning of the end of this terrible ordeal.   I said back in March that our country was about to meet a whole lot  of brandnew heroes. Many were going to be doctors and nurses. Others  were going to be essential workers who kept society going. Some were  going to be the men and women who worked like crazy in labs and  research centers until we had this virus beaten. But every single  American has a role.   As cases continue to climb, the simple advice--wear a mask, practice  social distancing, wash your hands--is now just as important as ever.  So, of course, discovering the vaccine will only be a part of the  battle. Once one or more candidates have been proven effective and  safe, it will be a second Herculean undertaking to scale up production  and distribute doses of the vaccine throughout our country. This is why  this Senate and the Trump administration have been on the case for  months.   As part of the historic CARES Act, we created Operation Warp Speed--a  historic effort that combined interagency government work with public-  [[Page S6658]]  private partnerships. This was a 21st-century Manhattan Project for a  COVID vaccine. We helped fund research and development for several  firms. We committed billions of dollars in advance purchase agreements.  We flattened regulatory barriers to speed the process. We provided  backing so that companies could begin mass-producing vaccine doses  before clinical trials had fully concluded so we would have a head  start on whichever ones wound up working.   If things stay on track, we hope to have a safe and effective vaccine  in a timeframe that will be absolutely historic. President Trump's  administration and this Congress should take huge pride in the  groundwork we laid.   Now, strangely enough, some are finding it challenging to simply  applaud this unambiguous good news. The Democratic Governor of New York  opined a few days ago that it was ``bad news'' that a vaccine  breakthrough may have been reached, because President Trump is still in  office.   Now, I understand Governor Cuomo has found the time during this  pandemic to write and publish a self-congratulatory book on  leadership--this, notwithstanding that his own State has been  absolutely pummeled by the disease and his own administration  intentionally sent thousands of COVID-19 positive patients into  vulnerable nursing homes.   The Governor has the temerity to say this vaccine breakthrough is  partially ``bad news''--partially ``bad news''?--because it occurred  under the Trump administration. He gestured vaguely toward unspecified  concerns about distribution. I guess he would have preferred the  lifesaving breakthroughs to have been delayed longer, with more  American deaths in the meantime.   The irony, as our colleague the Senator from Tennessee has pointed  out, is that the plans that are in place put States in the driver's  seat for arranging distribution and making sure the most vulnerable  citizens receive access. The Federal Government is there to provide  guidance and support. As Senator Alexander said, the Governor of New  York might want to devote more time and attention to developing this  crucial plan rather than undermining public confidence for the sake of  politics.   Sadly, this isn't anything new. Just a few weeks ago, the Democratic  Governors of both New York and California both began openly second- guessing the Food and Drug Administration and doubting its ability to  assess the safety of a vaccine. There were suggestions that blue States  may set up their own State review boards and then withhold lifesaving  vaccines from their own people for who knows how long until this extra  obstacle had been hurdled. This is where they are. Vaccines aren't  vaccines if a Republican is President until New York and California  reinvent their own miniature FDAs.   To be clear, Americans purchase nearly 4 billion prescriptions every  single year--4 billion prescriptions--trusting the expertise and  professionalism of the FDA. That is the trusted authority. Nobody is  crying out for liberal Governors to add their own Good Housekeeping  seal of approval, let alone potentially delaying the end of COVID-19 to  do so.   If this vaccine proves to be the one, citizens in New York and  California should not have it withheld from them because their  Governors care more about performatively opposing President Trump than  about hard science. This reminds me of when the junior Senator from  California declared back in September, during her Vice Presidential  campaign, that she might hesitate to trust a vaccine.   The whole country understands that our Democratic friends are not  charter members of the Donald Trump fan club. We know that. They do not  need to dabble in the early stages of anti-vax conspiracy theories to  prove it. In fact, for the sake of public health and public confidence  and saving lives, they have a moral obligation to stop.   If a vaccine has been found and distribution can begin soon, that is  good news, not bad news. It would be a major victory for our country  and the world, fueled by American innovation and aided by Operation  Warp Speed, thanks to this Senate and the Trump administration. It  would save thousands and thousands of American lives, and public  confidence will be essential.   So this is where we are. Leaders on all sides have a duty to act  accordingly.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
