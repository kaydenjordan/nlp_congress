 Madam President, I just want to follow on from what  Senator Murkowski just said.   Here is our resolution, S. 5066, introduced by Senator Murkowski and  myself, and we just want to thank our colleagues for agreeing to this  tribute to Congressman Don Young. We miss him every day, and as Senator  Murkowski so eloquently stated, we are naming buildings and job  centers--he did a great job on that--but it is great to be able to be  naming a volcano, very appropriately a volcano, for Don Young.   So good to be here on the floor with my friend and fellow colleague  from Alaska, and it is great to see the majority leader and my  colleagues agree to this naming.   Hopefully, we will get this signed into law soon--a volcano, a  Federal courthouse in Fairbanks, a job training center, all in the name  of our greatest Congressman ever--50 years, half a century almost.  Pretty remarkable and really an honor to be here on the Senate floor to  watch it get passed.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
