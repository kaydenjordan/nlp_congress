 Mr. Speaker, for 7 years, Republicans have talked about  repealing the Affordable Care Act and replacing it with something  better.   And then in the first 100 days of the Trump administration,  Republicans offered a plan that would have raised premiums, raised  deductibles, and taken away health care from 24 million Americans.   The Trump-Republican proposal was a cowardly cynical effort to lower  taxes on the richest Americans, strip away insurance protections from  hardworking families, and to dismantle Medicare and Medicaid. Their  plan would make Americans pay more to get much less.   When this horrible deal failed, President Trump did what he does  best: he lashed out. He lashed out at the American people, threatening  to stop critical cost-sharing health insurance subsidies that ensure  the sickest and some of the poorest Americans can afford health care.   Health care, Mr. Speaker, is not a game. It is a matter of life and  death for millions of Americans. On health care and every other issue,  President Trump's first 100 days have been nothing more than a string  of broken promises, empty words, and extravagant lies.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the underlying legislation, which I  view as a great step forward.   Mr. Speaker, we have heard about the misdeeds alleged of the prior  Register of Copyrights, and we have heard what a wonderful Librarian  Carla Hayden is; and I agree, she is a wonderful Librarian. But this  bill is not about individuals. It is not about whether the last  Register was a good or bad Register. It is not about whether she knew  what she was doing on modernization or not. This bill is an  institutional bill. This bill is against politicizing. This bill is for  strengthening and enhancing the stature of the Office of Register of  Copyrights.   The committee held 4 years of hearings on the Copyright Act. There  are many contentious issues that we will be bringing to the floor over  the next couple of years on that. This was not one of them. This issue  had broad support.   Everybody agrees that the Office of Copyright must be modernized.  What this bill does is to take it and give it a little more  independence from the Library of Congress. The Librarian of Congress is  an interested stakeholder. There are many stakeholders in Copyright.  Librarians are stakeholders, tech people are stakeholders, content  creators, movie studios, authors, and editors--there are lots of  different stakeholders. No stakeholder should be in a controlling  position.   The Librarian of Congress is in a controlling position, and there is  a consensus that that ought to be reduced. I, personally, and a lot of  other people think the Register's Office should be taken out of the  Library entirely. But this bill is a compromise. It doesn't do that. It  simply enhances the stature of the Copyright Office by making this a  Presidentially appointed office for a 10-year term.    You talk about politicizing? Right now, President Trump could, if he  wished, fire the Librarian tomorrow. The Librarian serves at his  pleasure, and the Register of Copyrights serves at her pleasure. So the  President totally controls the Librarian of Congress and the Register  at any time.   This bill would say that the President, with the advice and consent  of the Senate, would appoint the Register who would have a 10-year  term. That gives her or him more independence, obviously, and it  enables them to undertake the proper modernization.   One of the problems we saw was that the modernization requirements of  the Library of Congress are very different from the modernization  requirements of the Copyright Office, and one seemed to take precedence  over the other, which is not surprising when one is subject to the  other and part of it.   So this bill would increase the stature of the Copyright Office. It  would make it less political by giving the incumbent a 10-year tenure  during good behavior. There are powerful interests who have an  interest, and they would be one step further removed because of the 10- year tenure.   This is a bill that has broad bipartisan support. Almost every  interest group that deals with the Copyright Office is in favor of  this, from the authors to the directors, to the songwriters, to the  motion picture people, you name it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, but I am opposed to the  rule.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1695. This legislation  would strengthen the Copyright Office and make it more accountable to  Congress by turning the Register of Copyrights into a Senate-confirmed  position.   Since 2013, under the bipartisan leadership of Chairman Goodlatte and  Ranking Member Conyers, the Judiciary Committee has undertaken a  comprehensive review of the copyright laws and the Copyright Office.  Over the course of 20 hearings with 100 witnesses, as well as listening  sessions across the country, and individual meetings with a broad range  of stakeholders, we have heard one consistent message: that the  Copyright Office must be modernized to meet the needs of the public in  the copyright community.   This bill is an important first step in that process, and it is  appropriate that we consider it today on World Intellectual Property  Day when we recognize the tremendous contribution that intellectual  property laws, including copyright, make to our economy and to our  creativity. But maintaining this vibrant copyright ecosystem depends on  having an effective Copyright Office to oversee it. Throughout the  copyright review process, it became evident that the current structure  of the Office has hindered its ability to serve the public and the  copyright community effectively.   For historical reasons, the Copyright Office is located in the  Library of Congress, and the Register of Copyrights answers solely to  the Librarian of Congress. As an institutional matter, this creates a  conflict. Libraries are a key stakeholder in the copyright community,  but they are one among many stakeholders, each with different  priorities and interests. To place the Copyright Office in the hands of  one interested party does a disservice to the copyright system it is  charged with administering.   H.R. 1695 would remedy this problem by making the Register of  Copyrights a Presidential appointment subject to Senate confirmation.  It would establish an open and transparent process for publicly vetting  a nominee for Register and would allow the broad range  [[Page H2870]]  of copyright stakeholders to provide input through their  elected Representatives.    It would also strengthen the ability of Congress to provide  meaningful oversight of the Copyright Office, and, by establishing a  10-year term for the Register, it would insulate the Office from any  improper political influence.   It is particularly important that Congress have the final say in who  serves as Register because, by statute, the Copyright Office serves as  an expert adviser to Congress on copyright matters. The Office has  played an invaluable role throughout the Judiciary Committee's  copyright review process, and this bill would ensure that we continue  to rely on independent advice from the Register as we make further  reforms to the copyright laws.   Under current law, the selection of the Register is left entirely to  the Librarian. And since the Librarian serves at the pleasure of the  President, it is really the President who can dictate the choice of  Register if the Librarian wishes to keep her job. And the Register can  be dismissed at any time by the Librarian, possibly at the direction of  the President.   This bill serves as an important check on the President's power by  removing his unfettered ability to name a Register, by requiring Senate  confirmation of the position instead, and by giving the Register a  fixed 10-year term.   The role of Congress is further solidified by an important amendment  that was added during the committee's markup by the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). Under her amendment, which is now in the bill,  a panel of congressional leaders, along with the Librarian of Congress,  would develop a list of candidates from which the President would  choose a nominee. This strengthens congressional input and preserves an  important role in the process for the Librarian as well.   The Jackson Lee amendment strikes a good balance between respecting  the roles of Congress, the President, and the Librarian in selecting  the Register, and I appreciate the contribution she made to the bill.   The Copyright Office serves a vital function, but its current  structure does not reflect the importance of the Office. H.R. 1695  elevates the status and the stature of the Register, and treats the  position like other Federal officials with similarly significant  responsibilities--like the Director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark  Office. This would make the Copyright Office more responsive and  accountable to Congress, and it is the first step to its providing the  Office with the flexibility and independence it needs to serve all  members of the copyright community effectively.   This legislation is independent of any evaluation of the fitness of  the current Librarian--who is excellent in my opinion--of the fitness  of the prior Register. This legislation has been developed over a  period of years, and the importance is institutional, not reflecting  the personalities of the current occupants.   This legislation is supported by a broad range of stakeholders,  including the AFL-CIO and several other major unions, and it passed the  Judiciary Committee by a nearly unanimous vote of 27-1.   It deserves similar support by the full House, and I urge all of my  colleagues to support the bill.
