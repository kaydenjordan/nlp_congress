 Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                     Washington, DC.

The estimated total value of       the new items is $91.3 million, but will not cause an       increase in the total estimated program cost. The total       estimated case value will remain $1.3 billion with MDE       remaining $900 million of this total.        (iv) Significance: This notification is being provided as       the additional MDE items were not enumerated in the original       notification. The proposed sale will support Spain's       capability to strengthen its homeland defense and deter       regional threats. This additional aircraft will also enhance       Spain's commitment and contribution to NATO in providing a       Combat Aviation Brigade.        (v) Justification: This proposed sale will support the       foreign policy and national security of the United States by       improving the security of a NATO ally which is an important       force for political stability and economic progress in       Europe. It is vital to the  [[Page S165]]       U.S. national interest to assist Spain in developing and       maintaining a strong and ready self-defense capability.        (vi) Sensitivity of Technology: The statement contained in       the original AECA 36(b)(1) transmittal applies to the MDE       items reported here.        (vii) Date Report Delivered to Congress: January 25, 2023                            ____________________
