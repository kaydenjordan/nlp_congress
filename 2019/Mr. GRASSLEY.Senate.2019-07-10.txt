 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for  60 seconds as in morning business.    Madam President, we are all very much concerned about  several mass instances of violence around the country. The Secret  Service has a program of alerting people to some of those things and  training people.   Understanding the common factors of the past acts of mass violence  can help us prevent future tragedies. The Secret Service, through its  National Threat Assessment Center, compiles and studies data on these  risk factors.   Yesterday, the Secret Service released its report entitled ``Mass  Attacks in Public Spaces,'' which confirms that there are often warning  signs before targeted violence.   Following up on the expertise of the Secret Service, I introduced a  bill that goes by the acronym EAGLES Act to expand the National Threat  Assessment Center to conduct additional research and training to  prevent targeted violence.   Congress should pass this law to help stop violence before it  happens.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I want to update my colleagues and the  American people about efforts to reduce the cost of prescription  medicine.   Last week, our country and the American people celebrated  Independence Day, marking 243 years of self-government. As elected  representatives, it is our job to make the government work for the  people, not the other way around.   For more than two centuries, our system of free enterprise has  unleashed American innovation, investment, and ingenuity. Robust  competition incubates advances in science and medicine. It leads to  lifesaving cures and promising treatments for cancer, Alzheimer's,  diabetes, and other debilitating diseases.   However, prescription medicine too often smacks consumers with  sticker shock at the pharmacy counter. The soaring prices leave  taxpayers with a big tab--particularly under the Medicare and Medicaid  Programs--and they weigh heavily on the minds of moms and dads all  across the country.   Last week, I held meetings with my constituents in 12 counties across  Iowa. The cost of prescription drugs comes up at nearly every single Q- and-A county meeting that I hold. Iowans want to know why prices keep  climbing higher and higher. They want to know why the price of insulin  keeps going up and up and up--nearly 100 years after the lifesaving  discovery was made. They want to know what can be done to make  prescription drugs more affordable.   I am chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and in that position,  I have been working with Ranking Member Wyden from Oregon on a  comprehensive plan to do just that. We have held a series of hearings  to examine the drug price supply chain. We are working on a path  forward. We are taking care to follow the Hippocratic Oath: ``First, do  no harm.'' In other words, let's be sure we don't try to fix what is  not broken. Americans don't want to give up high-quality lifesaving  medicine. That is why I support market-driven reforms to boost  competition and transparency, because with transparency brings  accountability and the marketplace working more free of secrecy.   Congress needs to get rid of perverse incentives and fix problems  that undermine competition in the drug pricing system, including  withholding samples by brand-name pharmaceutical companies, pay for  delay, product-hopping, and rebate-bundling. There is too much secrecy  in the pricing supply chain. Consumers can't make heads or tails of why  they are charged what they pay for their medicine.   President Trump has made reducing drug prices a top priority of this  administration, and they have taken several steps under various laws-- including even under ObamaCare--to do things that give more freedom to  consumers of medicine and on other healthcare priorities.   In another instance, on Monday, the Federal court took a negative  move, knocking down a rule that would require drug companies to  disclose the price of their drugs in television ads. This is very, very  disappointing. Senator Durbin and I worked on this in the last  Congress, and I am going to continue to work with Senator Durbin to get  this job done. Congress must correct what the Federal court said the  administration didn't have the authority to do. I disagree with the  court, but Congress can fix that. Big Pharma is already required to  disclose side effects in their ads. Consumers ought to know what the  advertised drug will cost. Today, I call upon my colleagues to climb  aboard that effort Senator Durbin and I will be pursuing.   Let's pass the bipartisan healthcare bills thoughtfully crafted in  various committees. The previous three speakers spoke to some of those  issues. Let's get these various bills correcting some of these problems  over the finish line. Working together, we can drive down the price of  prescription drugs without derailing quality and without derailing  innovation, all of which saves lives and improves the quality of life  for the American people.   I yield the floor.
