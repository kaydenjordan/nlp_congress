 Mr. Speaker, the U.S. Government, the greatest Nation on  Earth, should never shut down. Never. It is outrageous, it is totally  unnecessary, and it must end immediately.   Today, 800,000 Federal workers who go to work every day to serve this  Nation and the American people won't get  [[Page H511]]  paid, not because they did a bad job, but because of a temper tantrum  from a President whose first allegiance is not to the national  interest, but to protecting his fragile ego, and keeping his racist  campaign promise to build a wall that no one with an ounce of common  sense wants.   The U.S. House has passed legislation to open the government, pay our  employees and contractors, and get on with the people's business. It is  up to Leader McConnell and the President to do their jobs and end this  ridiculous Trump shutdown.
