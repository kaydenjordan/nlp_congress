 Madam Speaker, let's be clear about one thing. If we were  on the eve of a Republican President being sworn in and his Democratic  predecessor had said the same thing that this President said and  incited his followers, his mob, to descend upon the Capitol, we would  be joining them, not making comparisons. Because guess what? I don't  care about no base.   I care about this democracy and this country, and what happened the  other day should never happen again. We need to stand up and do the  right thing.
