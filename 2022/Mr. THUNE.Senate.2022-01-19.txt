 Mr. President, later today, we expect the Democrat leader  to force a vote on undermining the filibuster in hopes of forcing  through a Federal election takeover to give his party an advantage in  future elections. Make no mistake about it, that is what we are talking  about--federalizing elections in this country; usurping, preempting  States, where elections have been administered and regulated since the  inception of this country.   The method--the method--that you are talking about using to do it  will literally undermine and blow up everything the Senate was supposed  to be.   Now, you can say that the filibuster is used to prevent or block  things from happening, and that may be true. You have done it. We have  done it. Used a 60-vote threshold last week to stop a bipartisan Russia  sanctions bill from passing in the U.S. Senate. Both sides have done  it. But the filibuster is representative and symbolic of something much  larger, and that is, the very essence of what the Senate is about.   I want to read for you from the Federalist Papers because there has  been a lot of quoting of the Founding Fathers over here today.   This is what the author of Federalist 62 notes:         [A] senate, as a second branch of the legislative assembly,       distinct from, and dividing power with, a first, must be in       all cases a salutary check on the government. It doubles the       security to the people, by requiring the concurrence of two       distinct bodies in schemes of usurpation or perfidy. . . .        Secondly. The necessity of a senate is not less indicated       by the propensity of all single and numerous assemblies to       yield to the impulse of sudden and violent passions, and to       be seduced by factious leaders into intemperate and       pernicious resolutions.    To go on, the author of Federalist 62:         [A] continual change even of good measures is inconsistent       with every rule of prudence and every prospect of success.        In the first place, it forfeits the respect and confidence       of other nations, and all the advantages connected with       national character.        The internal effects of a mutable policy are still more       calamitous. It poisons the blessing of liberty itself. It       will be of little avail to the people, that the laws are made       by men of their own choice, if the laws be so voluminous that       they cannot be read, or so incoherent that they cannot be       understood; if they be repealed or revised before they are       promulgated, or undergo such incessant changes that no man,       who knows what the law is to-day, can guess what it will be       to-morrow. Law is defined to be a rule of action; but how can       that be a rule, which is little known, and less fixed?    Ladies and gentlemen, our Founders created this institution to be  separate and distinct from the House of Representatives for a reason.  And what you are talking about doing today is turning the U.S. Senate  into a majoritarian body no different--no different--from the House of  Representatives except with longer terms and, some people would argue,  bigger egos. That is what we are talking about doing. They won't need  us. Yes, we have longer terms; they are staggered. But the essence of  the Senate is a check and balance on the passions of the other body,  and there is a reason why the Founders created it.   Now, I represent a red State, South Dakota. I am not a racist, nor  are the people whom I know in the State of South Dakota. Our State  legislature, like most States' legislatures, pretty much every year  comes up with ideas. Some of them--a few of them--not most, but a few  get enacted into law. A lot of them end up on the cutting room floor,  which is where most legislative ideas end up. And there are some crazy  ones.   I would argue we have some crazy ones coming out of here. There are  some pretty crazy bills that get introduced around here, most of which,  gladly, never make it into law.   But in South Dakota, our legislature meets every year, like most  legislatures, introduces a bunch of bills, acts on them, conducts  hearings, and moves them through the legislative process. Some become  enacted and signed into law; most don't. One of the bills that did get  signed into law was a bill that created a photo ID to vote. It was  passed in 2003. It has worked well in South Dakota. People support it,  not just in South Dakota but across the country. And after passing in  2003, the 2004 election had the largest turnout in modern history, at  least for the years for which we have that kind of information  available, as 78.6 percent of people voted in the 2004 election after-- after--2003, when the South Dakota legislature passed a photo ID law.    Now, I think there are some ideas out there that are pretty bad, and  I am not one who is here to dispute the 2020 election. The 2020  election is over. It has been decided. It was the largest turnout since  1900. It was the largest turnout in 120 years, which is why you all are  arguing that these States are going in and changing things to prevent  high turnout. Well, in most of the States that I have seen--at least  that I can tell--the legislation that I have looked at that have been  passed and enacted are things that in most cases people would say:  Well, yeah, that is probably within the purview of the State  legislature.   The State of Georgia, for example, in terms of days in which you can  early vote, actually has more early voting--more early voting, more  permissive early voting--than the State of New York or the State of  Delaware, the President's home State. There is no-excuse absentee  voting. We have that in South Dakota. We have a long period for  absentee voting or early voting in South Dakota, much longer than what  we are talking about here. In a red State, the State legislature  decided that, thought it made sense. But no-excuse absentee voting is  something that we do in South Dakota, something that is allowed for in  Georgia but is not in the State of New York or the State of Delaware,  because the States decide it, as it should be.   About standing in line and giving people things while they are  standing in line to vote, the State of South Dakota has a law against  that, too. It is called electioneering. It is called electioneering.  Now, there isn't anything that I understand of Georgia law that doesn't  prevent an election worker from going out and giving somebody a glass  of water or something to eat. There isn't anything that says that 150  feet away--which is 50 yards--50 yards away, you can't feed people  lunch. All it says is, when somebody is standing in line, that  political operatives shouldn't be electioneering, going out and handing  things out to induce people to vote a certain way.   Ladies and gentlemen, don't blow up the U.S. Senate and everything  that the Founders intended the Senate to be about over an issue that,  for all intents and purposes--and you can say it is not--but it is  federalizing our elections. It is taking power away from States to make  the laws that govern our elections.   And thank God in 2020 the States did things the right way. The States  certified on time, in accordance with the law, the 2020 election. And  if we hadn't  [[Page S283]]  had that, if we had sucked all that power up here to Washington, DC,  and centralized our elections, what do you think would have happened?   I mean, I think there is a reason why we have a decentralized system,  and I think it makes sense for a country as big as ours, particularly  at a time when we are worrying about other countries hacking our  elections. It is a lot harder to hack 50 States than it is one computer  system here in Washington, DC. But that is what we are talking about,  and you can't sugar coat it. You can disguise it and you can say it is  Jim Crow 2.0 and all that, but it is federalizing elections in this  country and taking power directly away from the States.   I lost my first Senate election back in 2002. I was ahead on  Wednesday morning. Tuesday night and Wednesday came and went. On  Wednesday morning, I was sitting in my living room in Sioux Falls, SD,  watching the television, and I watched my 3,300 vote lead become a 524  vote deficit, like that because one precinct came in from one of the  Reservation counties in South Dakota, and they voted 94 percent--93  percent--against me, and I lost that election. And I had all these  people, all of these smart political minds around the country and in  South Dakota, say: You have to contest it. There are irregularities.  You know there are irregularities.   I thought about it, and we did a little bit of looking into it, but,  a day later, I decided to say the election was over. I lost that first  election. And you know what, that is what happens. Sometimes we win;  sometimes we lose.   What you all are trying to do here is create a system, it seems to  me, at least, where you give your side a permanent advantage. And I  don't--I mean, that is your prerogative. If you want to do this, that  is fine in terms of having the issue and talking about it. But the one  thing I just fundamentally disagree with is how you are proposing to do  it--to literally do away with everything the Senate was designed and  created to be by our Founders and has served a purpose very, very well,  and you all did it the last session of Congress. You filibustered  numerous coronavirus bills. You filibustered police reform. You  filibustered pro-life legislation, and then go down the list. And like  I said, you used the 60-vote threshold last week to keep a Russia  sanctions bill--a bipartisan Russia sanctions bill, I might add--from  passing the Senate.    And you can go on and look at all the statements you have all made  through the years, and I am not going to repeat them, because you heard  them over and over again. But I think it is important to remember one  thing, and that is, when you make statements like that, they do have a  shelf life. And some of that shelf life is pretty short, because it was  just a few years ago, in some cases 3, 4 years ago; in some cases, 1  year ago, 2 years ago.   A lot of you have statements publicly, clearly out there, defending  the filibuster: Doing away with it would be doomsday for democracy;  turn America into a banana republic.   Don't do it. I am just saying, don't do it. There has got to be  somebody over there who gets this. I mean, we had the pressure to do  this. You know that. Thirty-four times, our President in the last  administration--34 times--tweeted publicly, demanded that Republicans  get rid of the filibuster, and we resisted it. And I have had people in  the media ask me. And I have heard that your side is saying, too: Well,  the Democrats, you know, if we don't do it now, Republicans will do it.   No, we are not going to do it--not if you don't. If you do, then  sure, then all bets are off. And then the Senate becomes the House of  Representatives and policy changes every 2 years or 4 years, depending  on who is in power. There is no stability. There is no predictability.  There is no moderation, and there is no incentive for this body to work  together across the aisle. That changes permanently.   I hope that doesn't happen because I don't think that is what we  should be about--certainly not what we should be about. But that is  where this is headed if--if--if you move forward, if you change the  rules, overthrow the rules to do this.   Mr. President, we are better than this. Our country is better than  this. Our Founders created a system that was designed to provide that  moderation, provide that continuity, to provide that stability, to  provide that predictability in a way that what is being talked about  today would completely destroy and undermine, not only in the near term  but permanently--because you can't do this once. You can't turn this  off. You can't put the genie back in the bottle. Once you do this, it  is a new state of play in the U.S. Senate, and that is a whole new  world, not just for us but for the people we represent, for our Nation  and for the world.   I hope and pray that there are enough wise Democrats on your side  that will join with all of us to resist the pressure that you are  feeling, like we did when our President came to us and said you have to  do this. We aren't going to do it because we understand what it means,  and you should too.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
