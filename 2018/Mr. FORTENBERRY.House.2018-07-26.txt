 Mr. Speaker, this is very good timing. I want to  thank the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin) for his thoughtful  and important words because I wanted to speak to the same topic.   This week, a dedicated group of Nebraskans with disabilities visited  my office. And what was their mission? To remind us all here in  Washington of the importance of the Americans with Disabilities Act,  and the importance of continuing to work toward progress in its  implementation.   Where did this come from? It was fueled by a chorus of voices many  years ago who refused to accept a second-class status in our country.  And it was driven by a moment in our country when we recognized that we  are stronger and more vibrant when we draw on the talents of all  people.   The ADA enshrined into law the notion that Americans living with  disabilities deserve to participate in our society free from  discrimination, and have access to integrated, community-based  services.   Mr. Speaker, the ADA helped open up schools and workplaces, stadiums,  parks, trolleys, and buses regardless of a person's disability. It also  ensured that healthcare providers offer reasonable accommodations and  effective communication for their patients with disabilities.   Mr. Speaker, there is still more work to do.                            ____________________
