 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1868.   Since the start of the pandemic, Congress has passed several  emergency COVID-19 response packages to help our communities get back  on their feet. Unfortunately, as the chairman mentioned, due to  technicalities in the reconciliation process, some of that progress  will be wiped away unless we pass this legislation.   So H.R. 1868 is necessary to prevent the automatic, across-the-board  funding cuts that will undermine our recovery. Just as the ranking  member mentioned, that will happen unless we pass this bill. Many of  those cuts will occur within the jurisdiction of the Committee on  Education and Labor.   For example, the legislation before us protects student borrowers  from automatic increases and loan origination fees and would increase  the cost of taking out a student loan.   The bill protects TEACH Grants, which help recruit talented  individuals into the classroom.   The proposal preserves funding for many of our colleges struggling to  survive during the pandemic.   Passing this legislation will prevent cuts to grants that go to  students whose parents made the ultimate sacrifice serving our Nation  in Iraq and Afghanistan.   Finally, this bill protects Americans' access to affordable  healthcare during the global health emergency.   Mr. Speaker, Congress took bold action to get our country through the  pandemic by enacting the American Rescue Plan. Now we must take this  final step in the reconciliation process to ensure that we do not  undermine critical programs that students and families urgently need.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.                                time  0930
