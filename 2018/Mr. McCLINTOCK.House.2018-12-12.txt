 Mr. Speaker, every nation has a natural right and a  fundamental responsibility to determine who is admitted within its  borders. This is what defines a country and ultimately determines  whether its culture, customs, and institutions will endure.   The unique qualities that develop within each country's borders  naturally make some countries more desirable places to live than  others. These differences drive immigration patterns. The more  successful a nation, the greater the demand to immigrate to it, and  ours is the most successful in human history.   Most of the world's 7\1/2\ billion people live in violent and  impoverished conditions, and it is no wonder that they find the United  States an attractive alternative. Yet uncontrolled and indiscriminate  immigration from those countries to ours risks importing the same  undesirable conditions that encouraged their immigration in the first  place.   History offers us many examples of great civilizations that have  succumbed to this paradox, and the current crisis on our southern  border poses a fundamental test of whether ours may join them.    America has traditionally welcomed the truly persecuted who have  escaped to our shores, but what is unfolding today makes a mockery of  our asylum laws. This was not a peaceful caravan of asylum seekers, as  many have attempted to portray. A caravan is a group of people  traveling legally and peacefully through a foreign land. An invasion is  a group of people attempting to violate a nation's border by force,  whether by military or mob action.   The vast majority camped on our southern border are military-aged  males. Authorities have already identified roughly 600 as known  criminals, and Mexican law enforcement has reportedly arrested roughly  100 for crimes committed in their country. The fact that this force has  attacked both Mexican and U.S. law enforcement, with several injuries  reported, contradicts any claims that, as a group, they come with  peaceful intent.   Nor are they asylum seekers in any conventional sense. No doubt many  are nonviolent and simply caught up in the group dynamic of a mob. But  poverty and violence in a country does not entitle every person in it  to enter ours. Asylum is reserved for those who have been specifically  targeted for harm by their own government based on their race,  religion, nationality, political opinion, or social group, and who have  entered directly into our country from their own.   In these instances, asylum is reached by crossing a border and  accomplishing separation from that government. A Central American  arriving in Mexico has already achieved this and, therefore, has no  call on asylum in any other country. The appropriate request to make is  to the Government of Mexico, a request some have already made and  Mexico has granted.   Nothing succeeds like success. If this group is allowed to muscle its  way into the United States, we can expect many and still larger groups  to follow.   If anything, this crisis should emphasize the importance of  completing the border wall that Congress first authorized in 1996 and  President Trump is desperately trying to construct.   A forceful incursion of our border can be repelled only by applying  equal or greater force. That is a recipe for violence and bloodshed.  The physical separation provided by a wall can prevent that.                                time  1015    It not only protects the officers who place their lives on the line  in defense of our law, it also protects the lawbreakers themselves from  the violent conduct that their behavior otherwise would make  inevitable.   Orderly immigration, regulated by law and protected by secure  borders, is a prerequisite to a civilized and prosperous nation. If our  immigration laws are not enforced, then our borders become meaningless  and America becomes a vast, open territory between Canada and Mexico  susceptible to every social, political, and economic disorder brought  to it.   This seems to be the ultimate aim of the American left and its  powerful chorus in the media. We are fortunate in this crisis to have a  President obedient to his constitutional command to ``take care that  the laws be faithfully executed.'' In the remaining days of this  session, Congress has a responsibility to give him the tools to do so.  It remains one of the great remaining tests of the 115th Congress.

For us, yes, we are losing friends and colleagues whose good judgment  we have often relied upon and whose friendship we will always treasure.  But far more importantly, it is a sad day for our State and our Nation,  for they are losing the service of experienced leaders dedicated to  restoring freedom as the cornerstone of our public policy.    David Valadao and Jeff Denham ably represented communities in the  Central Valley of California, in highly competitive districts where  Republican voters have always been a distinct minority. And yet, their  sincere engagement with their constituencies and their pragmatic  approach to their local challenges and problems saw them elected and  re-elected in the House.   When we served together in the State Senate, Jeff Denham refused to  vote for an irresponsible State budget. Public employee unions tried to  recall him for it, but the voters stood by him.   No one doubts that, but for the hyper-partisan tone of these unique  times, they would have both been handily re-elected.   I first met Ed Royce 37 years ago when we served together in the  California Legislature. When he was already a recognized leader in the  State Senate, one Saturday afternoon, I found him, to my stunned  surprise, wearing an apron and working behind the counter at a  coffeehouse he had just acquired. That work ethic, combined with his  quiet and unassuming nature and keen ability to cut through rhetoric to  reach bedrock reality, has made him one of the most effective Members  of the House and someone I greatly admire.   I met Dana Rohrabacher a few years later when he first ran for  Congress in 1988. It has been said that if you look up Orange County in  the dictionary, you will find his picture. For three decades, he has  been an icon in Southern California, representing the conservative  ideals, the libertarian leanings, and the casual lifestyle that define  the big OC of that era, an era that now closes with his departure from  Congress.   In 1993, I met Darrell Issa when he became a driving force on the  board of directors at the Claremont Institute, a think tank devoted to  putting American founding principles back into the public policy  debate. That same driving belief in freedom and free markets  had already made him a titan of industry and would soon make him an  effective and tireless advocate for these principles in Congress.    More recently, I have had the honor to serve with Mimi Walters and  Steve Knight.   I can tell you that when Mimi sets her mind on something, she is  terrifying. She pursues her objectives with all of the subtlety and  nuance of a heat-seeking missile. Her constituents had an advocate who  pulled out all the stops on their behalf, something I think they will  come to appreciate in retrospect.   I served with Steve Knight's dad in the State Senate and, at that  time, represented the adjoining district. I have sat with Steve every  day on this floor during votes, and I can say with some authority that  he is the full measure of his father and then some. Never have I known  a colleague to agonize more in order to weigh his votes for the  betterment of his community and his country. He is a man of quiet and  firm principle, a voice that I predict his constituents will also come  to sorely miss.   You know, Churchill once observed that politics are just as  interesting as war, and much more exciting, for in war, you can be shot  dead only once, but in politics, many times.   I have found that to be true over my political career, and it is from  that fact that springs my hope that we will see all these heroes back  in new and more influential roles in the years ahead.                                time  1715
