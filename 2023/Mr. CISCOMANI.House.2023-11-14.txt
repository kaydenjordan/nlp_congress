 Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of Head Start  programs across the country.   As a father of six, I recognize the importance of early learning and  development for our next generation. As a dad, I want to ensure all  children have the same opportunities to build a strong foundation for  their lives.   That is why I joined my colleague and friend Representative Lawler on  his amendment, which we will consider later, to increase the amount of  Head Start funding provided in the FY 2024 Labor, Health and Human  Services, Education and Related Agencies appropriations bill.   Further, I introduced my own amendment, which is included in the en  bloc to underscore the importance of the Head Start program.   The importance of these programs, both in my district and across the  country, cannot be understated. When our students and families have  access to these resources, they are better equipped to put their best  foot forward each day, both in and out of the classrooms.   With 22 Head Start programs at almost 500 locations in Arizona, these  programs are vital to the well-being of families and children  everywhere. In my district alone, 10 percent of the families with  children under the age of 5 lives below the poverty level. The tools  our students need to succeed go far beyond pencils and notebooks in the  classroom. When we invest in our kids, we are investing in a stronger  community.
