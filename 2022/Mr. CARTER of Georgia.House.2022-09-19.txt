 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  heroism of the Thunderbolt Fire Department for its swift and effective  response after Savannah Bananas pitcher Bill Lee collapsed while  warming up.   Bill ``Spaceman'' Lee is a legendary pitcher, a Boston Red Sox Hall  of Famer, and a notorious personality in Major League Baseball. He is  beloved by his community. Teammates and colleagues use words like  ``infectious,'' ``unique,'' and ``living legend'' to describe him.   His commitment to the great American pastime is lifelong, having  continued to pitch for 40 years after the end of his career in the  major leagues.   While warming up for a Savannah Bananas game, Bill, unfortunately,  suffered from a sudden cardiac episode that rendered him unconscious  and unable to breathe. The Thunderbolt Fire Department reacted  immediately, however, and Bill was quickly resuscitated and in a stable  condition when he was transferred to a local hospital.   Bill is already well on his way to a full and speedy recovery and is  today in great spirits, waiting for his next game.   We have the Thunderbolt Fire Department's timely intervention to  thank for saving this baseball legend's life, and I take this  opportunity to recognize them today.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding, and I thank him for hosting this because this is extremely  important. I hope people are paying attention to this.   As I say, what we are doing right now is intergenerational theft--$31  trillion in debt. That is intergenerational theft. In fact, Madam  Speaker, by the time I am done speaking tonight just my part, the  Federal debt will have grown by more than $13,000. That is right. I  suspect I will take about 3 minutes, maybe 4, but during that time, the  Federal debt will have grown by $13,000.   We learned last week that August's annual inflation rate was a  staggering 8.3 percent. By ``we,'' of course, I mean everyone except  Joe Biden, who boasted on 60 Minutes last night that inflation has not  spiked. If the worst inflation numbers in 40 years isn't a spike, I  don't know what is.   Unfortunately for Mr. Biden, the numbers don't lie. That 8.3 percent  inflation is costing families well over $4,000 this year alone,  essentially wiping out one month's paycheck. I don't know a single  family that can afford that kind of sacrifice.   Worse, real wages have fallen every single month since President  Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus passed last year.   But it is not just today's taxpayers that will feel these impacts.  Generations from now, people will still be feeling the sting of Biden's  inflation crisis. Over the next decade, decisions made in Biden's first  2 years will add $4.8 trillion to our Federal deficit--$4.8 trillion.   Decades of lower interest rates have spared the Federal Government  from facing the true costs of borrowing at such high levels, but  today's inflation has forced the Federal Reserve to raise interest  rates. We are quickly approaching a point where the interest alone on  our Federal debt will overwhelm our Federal budget resulting in dire  economic effects.   One percentage, one percentage of higher interest rates would cost  the Federal Government $400 billion every year starting next year. Just  1 percent rise in the interest rate costs the Federal Government $400  billion in extra interest. That is on top of what we are paying  already. That is money we could spend on national defense, healthcare,  and other of the many priorities our Nation faces.   But instead, we are paying interest on our debt. Interest payments  will pass defense spending by the end of the decade. They will pass  Medicare by 2046 and Social Security by the midpoint of the century.   As the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates to combat  inflation, which will likely happen again this week, this only gets  worse. This, again, is intergenerational theft.   Every year we add more than four times the entire U.S. population to  our national debt. The time to act is now. We are stealing from our  children and our grandchildren and deferring a crisis for them to fix.  We must act.   Each year that goes by without increased deficits digs ours hole  deeper and deeper. It is time to put down the shovel.   One of the first thing I learned when I became a member of the  Georgia State legislature was when you are in a hole, quit digging. We  are in a hole. We are stealing from our children and our grandchildren  and deferring a crisis for them to fix, and we must act.   As a medical professional by training, I am well acquainted with the  Hippocratic oath, which famously says: ``First, do no harm.''   Congress must take a similar approach when it comes to our budget.  [[Page H7959]]  Congress doesn't control interest rates, but we can control how much  money is added to our national debt. Responsible fiscal policy that  balances our budget is the first step to walking away from the fiscal  cliff over which our children's children are already dangling.   President Biden's budget calls for $1 trillion in deficit spending  every year going forward. Again, that is money we do not have and  cannot continue pretending like we do.   Republicans must insist on reining in this spending. That means no  more trillion-dollar packages that pour fuel on the fire of inflation.  That means eliminating our deficit so we can pay off our outsized debt.  That means returning the budget process to regular order.   You know, Washington Democrats recently passed the Inflation  Reduction Act, or as I like to call it, the inflation acceleration act.  Because this bill did not go through regular order, there was a grave  oversight that threatens a $5.5 billion electric vehicle plant that is  set for construction in my district. It has put it in jeopardy. This  highlights just how important it is that bills go through regular  order. If we had had a committee markup on this, we could have caught  it. If we had vetted it--one of my favorite sayings is that none of us  are as smart as all of us. That is why all of us should be involved in  this.   The same logic applies to budgeting. If we don't give our Members the  ability to read, debate, and amend legislation, we end up with policies  and proposals and budgets that hurt the same people they purport to  help.   When we miss budget deadlines, we are breaking the law. In what world  does it make sense for a legislative body to routinely break Federal  law, the laws we wrote and passed?                                time  2045    Small business owners and families have to make a budget and they  have to stick to it. It is time to restore fiscal discipline in  Washington, D.C. It is time to balance our budget.   Again, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me, and I thank him for  hosting this. This is important. I don't know what it is going to take  to get people's attention short of a catastrophe, but I do know this:  we cannot continue. We cannot continue on the route in which we are  right now. This is intergenerational theft. We cannot leave this to our  children and our grandchildren.
