 Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate an important  milestone for the Vietnamese community in my district and across the  United States.   This week marks the 35th anniversary of Orange County's Little  Saigon, which is now home to the largest concentration of Vietnamese  anywhere outside of Vietnam itself.   To this day, many of Little Saigon's residents are first-generation  Vietnamese who fled communism to find freedom in this country. They  brought with them a rich heritage, a beautiful culture, and a proud  history.   They are small business owners, public servants, community leaders,  educators, healthcare professionals, lawyers, journalists, parents, and  everything in between.   The Vietnamese community in Orange County is a shining example of a  fundamental American truth that no matter who you are or where you come  from, if you work hard and stay true to the principles of liberty and  justice for all, you can achieve success for yourself and your family.  Southern California and America are stronger because of their  contributions.   I am proud to represent the Vietnamese Americans living in  California's 45th District, and I am committed to ensuring that each of  them can build and enjoy their own American Dream.                    Celebrating Filipino Independence Day     Madam Speaker, I rise today in celebration of Filipino  Independence Day.   The history of Filipino independence is a story of a people who  remained tirelessly committed to democratic values of self- determination and freedom, even amidst the most challenging  circumstances.   On June 12, 1898, the Philippines declared their independence after a  long history of occupation. However, the country remained a territory  of the United States for many years, even after Congress enacted the  Philippine Independence Act of 1934.   It wasn't until the Fourth of July in 1948 when President Harry S.  Truman issued Proclamation 2695 that the United States recognized  Filipino sovereignty, officially marking the nation's independence.   Both during and since its independence, the Philippines has been one  of the United States' most important allies.   My district in southern California is home to around 30,000  Filipinos. They are an integral part of our communities, touching every  aspect of our way of life with an entrepreneurial spirit, a respect for  their traditions, and a love for America.   I am proud to represent them in the United States Congress, and I  will always fight for a better life for them and for all of my  constituents.   To the Filipino community in southern California and across the  country, I wish a very happy Independence Day.                            ____________________
