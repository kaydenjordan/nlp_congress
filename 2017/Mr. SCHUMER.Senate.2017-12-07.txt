 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so  ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I first would like to talk today about  year-end business.   Congressional negotiators are making good headway on a budget deal  that would meet our commitments to our military and also our urgent  priorities here at home. I hope this progress continues this week.   Unfortunately, the progress in Congress is in stark contrast to the  rhetoric coming from the White House.  [[Page S7899]]  President Trump again suggested yesterday that a ``shutdown could  happen.'' If a shutdown happens, as the President seemed to be rooting  for in his tweet earlier this year, it will fall on his shoulders. His  party controls the Senate, the House, and the Presidency.   Nobody here wants to see a shutdown. We Democrats are not interested  in one. That is why we are working with our Republican colleagues in  good faith to resolve all of the issues we have to solve before the end  of the year, and it is in this spirit that Leader Pelosi and I will go  to the White House this afternoon to discuss all of the issues before  us.   It is no secret that one of the major sticking points--if not the  major sticking point--in the negotiations is funding levels for  programs that invest directly in economic growth and a social safety  net for the middle class. Democrats are pushing for sorely needed  funding to combat the opioid crisis, to shore up pension plans, to  support veterans' health, to relieve student loan debt, and build rural  infrastructure.   Without a budget agreement that lifts spending caps on both defense  and economic development in a fair and equitable manner, programs I  have mentioned, and so many others--medical research comes to mind-- could see their funding cut. Our veterans deserve better. People  seeking recovery from opioid addiction deserve better. Hard-working  pensioners deserve better. We must do both things--support the military  and programs that create jobs and growth here at home--in equal  measure. Both are very important.   I know there are some on the far right who say all the jobs programs  and economic growth programs are unimportant, but most of us, Democrats  and Republicans, believe both are important. The idea that both are  important has been the basis of successful budget agreements going back  several years, including the agreement we reached last April, where the  military side and the domestic job, economic growth side were treated  equally.   Unfortunately, it appears that the Freedom Caucus--a rather small  bloc of hard-right House conservatives--is trying to derail another  successful parity agreement. According to press reports, the Freedom  Caucus is pushing for a very short-term extension of funding for jobs  and economic development, while pushing for a long-term extension and a  large increase for funding in defense. That is a ruse designed to slash  funding for education, healthcare, infrastructure, and scientific  research--all the things the Freedom Caucus, against the will of the  overwhelming vast majority of Americans, doesn't want the government to  fund.   Make no mistake, the Freedom Caucus is gearing up to hurt the middle  class on the budget, just like so many Republicans way beyond the  Freedom Caucus did with their tax bill--just like on the tax bill. We  Democrats are going to defend the middle class because they need our  help, too, and they have been forgotten by our Republican colleagues  throughout the year, but this time, the Freedom Caucus's actions, if  they had their way, could lead to a disaster. Speaker Ryan must stand  up and tell the Freedom Caucus, no, they cannot be allowed to hold  hostage productive bipartisan budget negotiations with outrageous  demands that hurt the middle class. If Speaker Ryan lets them have  their way, it will cause a shutdown. It will be on the Freedom Caucus'  shoulders, Leader Ryan's shoulders, and the President's shoulders  because such a bill could not pass either the House or the Senate--we  are giving them fair warning right now--not right at the deadline.                            ____________________     Finally, Mr. President, let me say a word about the  Dream Act. Earlier this week, my friend, the senior Senator from  Illinois, came to the floor to update the Senate on the progress he is  making in his negotiations with Senate Republicans on an agreement that  would provide a significant investment in border security in exchange  for the Dream Act.   As I have said in the past, Democrats support real border security.  We will be happy to join with Republicans to pass legislation to secure  our border in exchange for the Dream Act. Those talks continue to make  good progress. I hope we can reach an agreement soon.                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, a word on the special counsel. Over  the past few weeks, I have continued to hear Republican lawmakers and  partisan media hosts attack the integrity of Special Counsel Mueller in  a shameful display meant to undermine his investigation into the  connections between the Trump campaign and Russia. Spuriously attacking  Robert Mueller, one of the most respected and trusted civil servants in  our country, is the surest route to losing all credibility.   I remind everyone on the right who are trying to muddy the waters on  the Mueller investigation that Robert Mueller was a career prosecutor  who has served both Republican and Democratic administrations in the  most trusted of roles. He was appointed by President Trump's own Deputy  Attorney General. It defies credulity to lambaste him as partisan or  biased. He is as straight a shooter as they come. This is bigger than  one man. The attacks on Special Counsel Mueller and his investigation  erode faith in the rule of law, that bedrock principle at the heart of  our civic life.   If independent investigations into matters as grave as foreign  interference in our elections succumb to intimidation and partisan  slander, we will be no better than a third-world country. Rule of law  will be gone, at least for the President of the United States, which is  something Americans have treasured for centuries. What has always  defined American democracy is an unyielding faith in the rule of law-- its power to check our people, as well as our Presidents. Special  Counsel Mueller is the rule of law at work in our 21st century American  democracy. Intentionally and spuriously impugning his integrity--not  because he has done anything wrong but because they don't like what he  is doing; very partisan, very biased, very one-sided is their view--is  not only inaccurate but damaging to a core ideal in our country--the  independent and impartial rule of law. We must loudly reject the  strident voices who engage in these attacks on both ends of  Pennsylvania Avenue.                            ____________________     Finally, Mr. President, on the issue of taxes, with the  passage of the Republican Senate bill last Friday, the Republican Party  has shrugged off its history as the party of tax cuts and become the  party of tax hikes on the middle class. The Republican tax bill will  end up raising taxes on millions of middle-class families to pay for  corporate welfare.   As our Republican colleagues march us toward an enormous corporate  tax cut, we have seen numerous companies start to announce plans to buy  back more of their stock--not build factories, not create jobs, but to  buy back their stock, which, of course, benefits the CEOs because the  stock price goes up.   T-Mobile has announced $1.5 billion in stock buybacks; Mastercard, $4  billion; Bank of America, $5 billion. Just this morning, three or more  companies announced hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of buybacks.  These companies, I would say to President Trump and I would say to my  Republican colleagues, are not announcing new investments in their  workforce or wage increases, as Republicans promised they would. They  are announcing stock repurchasing programs that benefit their wealthy  investors.   The tax bill will also saddle the next generation of leaders with  larger deficits and debts, limiting our ability to make the kinds of  investments we need to be making in education, infrastructure, and  scientific research--a far surer path to good-paying jobs and raising  wages than giving corporate America, already flush with cash, even more  stock buybacks. For the same reason, those increased deficits,  Republicans are now coming back and saying that they want to slash  Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, making it even harder in  America to access affordable healthcare and retire with dignity.   Speaker Ryan admitted it yesterday. He said: ``We're going to have to  get back next year at entitlement reform, which is how you tackle the  debt and  [[Page S7900]]  the deficit,'' and he specifically mentioned Medicare. They first  create the deficit by these huge tax cuts for the wealthiest  corporations and individuals, and then they take it out on the middle  class by saying: We have no choice but to cut Medicare. What is the  matter? I hope the American people will see this. I hope some of the  news channels and radio commentators will note this, since those are  the people who listen to them.   By the way, that is only what we know about the bill. It was muscled  through the Chamber with such reckless haste, we are finding errors and  consequences every day. In yesterday's POLITICO, Greg Jenner, a former  top tax official in Bush's Treasury Department who helped write the  1986 tax reform bill, was quoted as saying:         The more you read [of the Republican tax bill], the more       you go, ``Holy crap, what's this?'' We will be dealing with       unintended consequences for months to come because the bill       is moving too fast.    That is a Republican, a former tax official from President Bush's  Treasury Department.   When we were debating the Affordable Care Act--a process that took  over a year--the esteemed majority leader admonished: We need to slow  down and get this right.   The tax bill, by comparison, spent hardly 2 weeks in the House and 3  weeks in the Senate, and it is a lot worse for the average middle-class  person. I would say the same thing to the majority leader that he said  to us: Slow down and get this right. There is no need to rush this  hastily considered, highly complex, hugely consequential tax bill  before some artificial deadline.   We have a responsibility to get this right for the American people,  particularly the American middle class. I still believe the way to do  it is through an open, transparent, and bipartisan debate.   I yield the floor.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland is  recognized.                            ____________________
