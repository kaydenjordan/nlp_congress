 Mr. Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of the  majority leader the floor schedule for next week, and I welcome the  majority leader back to the colloquy. It is good to see him spry.  [[Page H3818]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), my  friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that information  as we look toward this appropriations process coming to the floor next  week.   I would hope it doesn't take the same tone that it took in committee,  and that is a hyper-partisan approach, which in years past, we have  seen Republicans and Democrats come together to ultimately determine  how best to fund this United States Government. And any bill that is  going to get sent to the President's desk is going to ultimately be a  bipartisan bill.   Unfortunately, that is not the bill that is going to be coming to the  floor. There are a lot of very extreme radical elements that were put  in that bill, but there was also something very alarming, and that was  a break, a departure, from over 40 years of bipartisan agreement on  what is known as the Hyde amendment.   Henry Hyde, in the 1970s, was able to get agreement between  Republicans and Democrats to say on all the things we may disagree  with, let's at least agree that taxpayer funding should not be used for  abortions. And overwhelming majorities of Republicans and Democrats  have supported that going back to 1976.   This appropriations bill guts the Hyde amendment. And why this  Democrat majority decided to break from decades of bipartisan agreement  on Hyde is perplexing. But I would hope, among many other things, we  would be able to have that full debate on the House floor; that  amendments like restoring Hyde would be made in order, not a closed  process, not a very narrow process where the goal would be to push a  hyper-partisan bill out of the House that won't become law, which means  it would be a very futile exercise that we would be participating in  next week, but, in fact, to work in a bipartisan way on those things  that we can come to an agreement on about how to properly fund the  government.   I am not sure if that is being anticipated with the seven bills that  are coming in this bloated bus, but I would hope that the majority, as  the Rules Committee looks to determine which amendments would be made  in order, would go to an open process and let things like the Hyde  amendment be debated, and frankly, to be supported in the bipartisan  way that it has always enjoyed going back over 40 years.   Mr. Speaker, maybe the gentleman could shed light on that, and I  would yield to the gentleman.     Mr. Speaker, hopefully, like I said, we get the  opportunity to have that open debate process so that we can bring  amendments like restoring Hyde to this floor.   Mr. Speaker, I would also like to ask about something that is going  to be coming up next week, and that is this January 6 Commission that  the Speaker created is expected to meet next week.   Yesterday, we saw an alarming departure from Congressional tradition,  and that is Speaker Pelosi unilaterally made a decision to remove  minority members from that committee. You go through the history of  Congress, and prior to this year, never has the Speaker denied the  minority the ability to choose who they are going to put on committees.  And not only did it happen yesterday with multiple members, a ranking  member of a standing committee was removed, an officer in the United  States Navy was removed from that committee, without explanation.   That, first of all, undermines all credibility that this committee  will have. It is clear that now it is an attempt by the Speaker to just  completely politicize that committee. Why the majority chose to abuse  power in that way and deny minority rights in that way is perplexing,  but it doesn't bode well for the institution, and it surely doesn't  bode well for the impartiality and the credibility of this committee.   I don't know if the majority is looking at reconsidering that  decision, but  [[Page H3819]]  obviously, it is unprecedented. And if the gentleman wants to explain  that, I will be happy to yield.    That was not the reason that Ms. Cheney was removed as  chair.    It had nothing to do with the statements that were made.    An opinion we don't share because it is not accurate.    Mr. Speaker, that wasn't the opportunity that we asked  for, and I think the majority leader knows that the minority leader put  a number of issues on the table that he wanted included in that review,  and those were rejected. They were rejected by the Speaker, and they  were rejected by the majority.    The majority leader will have an opportunity, but there  were a number of things you said that I think need to be cleaned up  because they are just not accurate.   If you look at the Members that were kicked off from the minority  side yesterday--still no explanation given, by the way--that includes a  ranking member of a committee and an officer in the United States Navy  who was removed yesterday by Speaker Pelosi with no reason given in an  unprecedented way.   Maybe Speaker Pelosi and maybe this majority don't want to see all  the facts come out because those two Members who were removed yesterday  were raising very serious questions that ought to be answered, whatever  those answers are. Whatever those facts are, they were publicly raising  questions.   Maybe because they raised those questions that might be uncomfortable  for the majority, they were removed from the committee with no  explanation given. That had never happened before in the history of  this Congress.   Again, if you want the facts, don't sit there and say that you want  the facts if you are going to remove people who are trying to get  facts, who are raising serious questions that should be answered. They  raised them publicly, and they were going to raise them in the  committee. Maybe because they were going to raise those tough  questions, they were removed by the Speaker, Members of the minority  who were removed by the Speaker.   I don't know if that is the new precedent that the majority leader  wants to see in the future. But I will tell you, since the gentleman  likes quoting Liz Cheney, I will read this quote from Liz Cheney:  ``Speaker Pelosi and the Democrat majority have no business determining  which Republicans sit on committees.'' That is from Liz Cheney, if the  gentleman wants to quote.    Mr. Speaker, that is a quote about Mrs. Greene, but it  is a general quote about whoever it is. You could go down your list.   By the way, there were Members of the majority who are on that  committee who voted on January 6 to reject electors. Maybe not this  year's January 6, but as the gentleman knows, every Republican  President this century has had Democrats on this House floor object to  electors being seated, including multiple members of the January 6  committee on the majority side. They weren't removed. In fact, they  were appointed by the Speaker.   Yet, two of our Members, who raised very serious questions about  facts that should be answered, wherever those answers lead, were  removed because  [[Page H3820]]  maybe the majority doesn't want all the facts to come out. Maybe they  only want a certain narrative to come out. That is not an  investigation. That is a kangaroo court, if that is the approach that  is going to be taken.   But the action taken yesterday by the Speaker, the unprecedented  action, undermines the credibility of that commission, and it is a  shame for the institution because the Members we appointed were going  there to find the facts, to help participate in finding the facts.   Clearly, that is not the interest now of this committee. That was  exposed yesterday in the Speaker's unprecedented action.   It is not something that this institution, whether it is Republicans  running it or Democrats--and as the gentleman knows, that pendulum  swings both ways. But never before this year had a majority removed  Members that minority leaders submitted for committees. It is just not  what has happened in this institution. But, now, it seems to be the  norm because maybe some people that are asking tough questions are  asking too tough of questions that this majority doesn't want to be  answered, kind of why this majority won't have a hearing on the origins  of COVID.   In fact, it was Mr. Jordan, along with myself and others, who has  raised serious questions that have been backed up by many medical  experts around this country that COVID-19 very likely started in the  Wuhan lab and was leaked out. Medical experts from every walk of life  have looked at the genetic makeup of this COVID-19 virus and said it  couldn't have been transferred from bats to animals to humans. In fact,  it was likely modified genetically in the lab in Wuhan.   Yet, there is not a single hearing that has been held by this  majority on whether it was gain-of-function research, possibly funded  with taxpayer money. All of those questions should be raised, but maybe  the majority doesn't want those facts to come out.   We should want the facts to come out wherever they lead. So don't  pound the desk and say you want the facts when you remove people who  are asking questions to get at the facts. It shouldn't be a one-sided  question and argument.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, but why not look at all of them?    Mr. Speaker, if the facts were what the majority wants,  then the majority wouldn't be afraid of certain Members asking tough  questions that maybe the majority doesn't want.   Since the gentleman brought up Mr. Jordan, I will tell you a question  that Mr. Jordan has been raising publicly. One of the questions Mr.  Jordan has been raising is: Why weren't the Capitol Police better  equipped when there was intelligence prior, weeks prior to January 6,  that there may be large crowds, that there may be threats? Why weren't  the Capitol Police more equipped? Were National Guard offered to the  Capitol that were rejected? And at what level, if that is the case,  were they rejected?   Maybe he was starting to ask those questions. Maybe he should have  just sat back and not raised those questions until after the committee  started, but he started raising those questions.   By the way, they are important questions to be answered, but he won't  be able to ask those questions about why the Capitol Police weren't  better equipped because Speaker Pelosi yanked him off the committee  when he was selected by the minority leader.   You can talk about the power of the Speaker and brag that that is her  power, but just because you have the might doesn't make it right. What  she did was an abuse. To say, ``I am just going to choose who on the  Republican side I am going to allow, but, boy, if some other Members  are going to ask tough questions, I have the power to take them off,''  that is not what power is used for.   This House, this democracy, we should want the facts. If some Members  are going to ask tough questions, you should want everybody to be  asking tough questions. If the facts lead there, you go there. If the  facts don't lead there, you go somewhere else and ask more tough  questions.   If some Members are going to ask tough questions that the majority  doesn't want to be asked, that undermines the credibility of that  commission to remove them from asking those questions.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, they haven't said publicly whether they  [[Page H3821]]  would or not. Mr. Jordan sure did. Again, maybe he was punished for  raising tough questions in advance of the hearing instead of waiting.   But in the end, those were questions. Sheriff Nehls, who was also one  of our selections, was right there with these brave Capitol Police  officers, holding down the House of Representatives so that the Chamber  wasn't breached. Sheriff Nehls was right there.   But, again, if the integrity of that commission is now undermined  because Speaker Pelosi chose to remove people who were going to ask  tougher questions, then, ultimately, it proves that this is not a  commission set on finding the facts. It is a commission set on  establishing a narrative regardless of the facts. That is a disgrace,  for this institution to go down that road.   There is still time to reconsider. Mr. Speaker, I would urge the  majority to reconsider how they use or abuse the power that is vested  upon them.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.                                time  1130     Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that as that commission  starts, it will not include other Members, Republican Members, who  wanted to ask some of those tough questions in terms of supporting the  police.   I don't think the gentleman has seen any stronger support for police  than on this side of the aisle. I have been maybe more vocal than  anyone about support for the United States Capitol Police because I  wouldn't be here alive today without the bravery and heroism of the  Capitol Police, and I think we all stand with them.   Ultimately, when you look at the supplemental that came through the  House in May, there were a number of Members on the Democrat majority  side who voted against that supplemental who have been vocal about  defunding the police.   And, in fact, we have been trying to bring up H. Res. 352, which  expresses support for police in opposition to this crazy, radical idea  of defunding the police, where in many of these cities that have  actually defunded the police, they have seen rapid increases in crime.   Even more--and I know I have held roundtables with sheriffs from the  New Orleans area, as many of my colleagues have met with law  enforcement--they will tell you the biggest challenge today, in  addition to the growing crime wave, they are seeing is a demoralization  around the country for police because they see these efforts to defund  the police and they see elected oficials speaking out publicly against  police. It is not coming from the Republican side. I think the  gentleman knows where it is coming from.    Why won't this bill be brought to the floor to just express support  for police?   The fact is that the majority on the Democrat side will not bring a  resolution to express support for police, H. Res. 352, by Ms.  Malliotakis and others, at a time when we are seeing around the country  not only a demoralization but an increase in resignations. People are  leaving the great work of law enforcement because they see in those  communities that have defunded the police a lack of support. Most  sheriffs will tell you they are having trouble recruiting new people  right now because of the attacks on police all around the country that  we saw from the summer where cops where murdered, shot, beaten. Yet a  resolution to express support to let them know that we have their back  still won't be brought to the floor by this majority.   I hope the gentleman would look at bringing H. Res. 352 to the floor  so that we can actually express to all police that we support them and  that we do have their back.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I will just point out that President Biden  himself a year ago said he supports efforts to divert money away from  police, which, by the way, is the same thing as defunding police. If  you are diverting money away from police, then you are defunding  police. But, again, there is a resolution that has been sitting out  there for a while now expressing support. I hoped we would bring that  to the floor and express that support.   There are also a number of other issues dealing with inflation. We  are seeing a dramatic increase in inflation across this country.  Everything someone buys when going to a grocery store, we are paying  more for things like eggs and milk. If you try to go on a summer  vacation right now, you are paying over 40 percent more for gasoline.  You are seeing it across the board, and that dramatic increase in  inflation is a tax. It is a tax on hardworking families.   This chart shows for the gentleman so many of those things. Used cars  are up 45 percent, if you can even find a car to buy because there is  such a shortage when the government is paying people not to work.   The borrowing, by the way, and spending of trillions of dollars-- which are some of the items that are going to be coming to the floor  next week and beyond, trillions more, much of it deficit spending--is  part of the reason we are seeing inflation: gas 45 percent up, home  prices 15 percent up, milk 5 percent, laundry machines 29 percent, if  you can get one. You might have to wait 6 months to get a washer and  dryer.   All of this is a tax on hardworking, middle-class families.   What we should be doing is bringing legislation to the floor to  confront these problems, not to keep spending trillions and trillions  more in deficit spending and higher taxes that ultimately would lead to  more evaporation of middle-class jobs which is what the majority is  bringing, but I would hope that the gentleman would look at working  with Republicans on legislation to start addressing some of these  problems that are affecting household families all across the country.                                time  1145    Republican, Democrat, Independent, doesn't matter, they are seeing  this problem, and they would like to see this Congress confront it, not  make it worse with more deficit spending, with more multitrillion- dollar spending bills and higher taxes that will ship more jobs  overseas, shutting down energy production in America.   While the President is signing or authorizing agreements with Russia  to use pipelines to ship their energy to other countries, he is  shutting down pipelines in America so that we can use more of our  natural resources, again, leading to higher prices across the board,  things that are adversely affecting families.   I hope we can bring legislation to confront these challenges to the  floor, and I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, as we look at those bills coming to the  floor next week, frankly, they would make those problems worse. I know  when we talk about the inflation side--we talk about inflation, because  it is the thing we hear the most when we talk to our constituents back  home, because regardless of the statistics, the data is little solace  if you see your dollar going for less further, less far. In fact, you  see your dollar not going as far because whatever you are making, you  are spending even more money than you were spending before and waiting  longer to get things because of these policies.   In fact, the spending itself is part of the problem that is leading  to inflation. People get that. And so they look at these multitrillion- dollar spending bills and they are starting to ask the questions: What  is really in those bills? If it is not things to help my family,  because I am paying more with all of this new spending, what is in it?   We just found out today there are millions of dollars in the bill  that is coming to the floor next week specifically just for one entity,  Planned Parenthood of Mar Monte, San Jose, California; Planned  Parenthood, the largest provider of abortions in the country. So not  only is Hyde being discarded, the mutually agreed upon, bipartisan, and  not just Henry Hyde with a few other people. Henry Hyde passed this in  the 1970s under a Democrat majority. Democrats and Republicans said  taxpayer funding shouldn't be used to provide abortions, and it had  always been sacrosanct in spending bills that this Congress passed,  Republican and Democrat, since that time until now.    So not only are they gutting Hyde in the bill, but they are putting  millions of dollars into Planned Parenthood by name. This is what  drives people nuts when they see that kind of spending and a disconnect  because they are paying more money for regular household goods. And  instead of us confronting that on the floor, they see this kind of  spending that is generational, because it is the next generation that  will have to pay for it. Because as much as it seems this majority  wants to raise taxes to spend more money, even all the taxes that would  run more jobs out of this country don't cover all of this kind of  radical spending.   I would hope we go a different direction. We surely will be opposing  that kind of radical spending and it surely won't be helping those  families who just want answers, who just want to see relief from the  problems that they are facing.   I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, the final point I would like to bring up to  the leader, we are seeing something that is actually very encouraging  in Cuba; that is, the people of Cuba taking to the streets to demand  freedom; something that has been decades in the making. I would hope  that we see all government leaders, Republican, Democrat, executive  branch, legislative branch, all expressing our support for the Cuban  people who seek freedom, because I think one of the most heartfelt  signs that I know I saw, and so many of my colleagues saw just a week  ago, were not only people taking to the streets to call for freedom,  they were carrying the American flag in Cuba.   We see this all around the world. It is one of the things that for  all of our differences brings us together, and that is that here in the  United States Congress, we are not only working to promote freedom in  this country and to preserve it for future generations, but this  freedom that we work to preserve inspires people all around the world.  Whether it is Cuba, or in Iran which we saw years ago, or any other  country, when people seek freedom, there is really only one flag that  they wave, and that is the United States flag.   Our colleague, Mario Diaz-Balart, whose family fled Cuba, like so  many of our colleagues, some first generation. Carlos Gimenez, former  mayor of Miami-Dade, personally fled Cuba seeking freedom--and talking  about the American Dream--he is a first generation who fled a socialist  nation who is now a sitting, voting Member of the United States  Congress, who now wants to express support for the Cuban people.   So there is a resolution, H. Res. 527, that expresses our solidarity  standing with the people in Cuba who are seeking freedom. I would just  ask the gentleman if he would look at bringing that bill to the floor.  The people in Cuba are trying to get that freedom, and they are being  heavily oppressed. Many may even be being murdered right now as they  have shut down the internet. They shut out the media, because there is  no freedom of the press.   We are hearing stories that are very alarming. If we can express our  support that we are standing with those people in Cuba who do seek  freedom as well, I think it would be a strong signal. I ask the  gentleman if we could bring that to the floor.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that. Hopefully, we can work  together to get that brought to the floor and express that support in  unison and that would send a strong message.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, as we remember the life of Jerry Lewis, I  remember the first time that I had the opportunity to meet with him. It  was back in 2005. I was a State representative from Louisiana, and  Hurricane Katrina had ravaged the whole New Orleans region.   Thousands of people were out of their homes. The city was decimated.  The whole region was decimated, and we were starting to work on a plan  to rebuild New Orleans.   Obviously, there was a big Federal role to be played. President Bush  had committed to help us, but it took action from Congress to  ultimately make that happen, to rebuild the levees so that the  communities could be protected, to help people get back in their homes.  And that brought me to Jerry Lewis.   He met with me and a few other people, and he committed to do the  things that needed to be done to help us get back on our feet at our  lowest point. That is who Jerry Lewis was.   The city of New Orleans, the people of the New Orleans region, owe a  great debt to Jerry Lewis for the things he did, the real action he  took to help build New Orleans back after Katrina.
