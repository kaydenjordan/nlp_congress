 Mr. Speaker, it has been said, ``The bravest are surely  those who have the clearest vision of  [[Page H9553]]  what is before them, glory and danger alike, and yet notwithstanding,  go out to meet it.''   These words embodied the life of Officer Jared William Franks of the  Greensboro Police Department. Officer Franks was killed in the line of  duty after bravely engaging in the pursuit of a suspect.   Only 24 years old, Officer Franks dedicated his life to public  service and creating a safer community for us all. He is the first  Greensboro officer to die in the line of duty in 17 years, reminding us  of the bravery and strength members of law enforcement show our  communities every single day.   We must never forget and always be thankful for their courage and  dedication. Please keep his family; his dad, Officer Captain Franks;  and fellow officers in your prayers as we remember Officer Franks' life  and legacy.                            ____________________
