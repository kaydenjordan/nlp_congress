 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, I rise today to express concern over a  monumental breach to the Nation's national security infrastructure.   Last week, the Washington Post, among other publications, reported  hacks of several government agencies by way of the SolarWinds platform  over several months.   The New York Times, on the 17th of this month, had a headline that  included these words: ``Officials Warn of `Grave Risk.' '' But in that  report, the New York Times indicated that at least 40 companies,  government agencies, and think tanks had been infiltrated. The  infiltrated agencies include the Departments of Defense, State,  Homeland Security, Treasury, Commerce, Energy, and Energy's National  Nuclear Security Administration, as well as the National Institutes of  Health. That is about seven different entities, if you include the  Department of Energy as one entity, in the hacking of different parts  of the Department, and there could be more.   All the reporting indicates that the hackers are affiliated with  Russian intelligence. Russia has proven itself both capable and willing  to invade and exploit our digital infrastructure for its own ends.   While Secretary of State Mike Pompeo confirmed that Russia was behind  this damaging breach of our systems, President Trump is casting doubt-- and that might be an understatement.   Even in the waning days of his administration, our national security  continues to suffer at the hands of the President's deference to  Vladimir Putin.   I have to say for the record, I hope this number changes, but only  about 10 Republican Senators have expressed concerns. I hope that  number grows exponentially in the next couple of days.   I have to ask: What if this breach occurred under a Democratic  President--President Obama, for example? Would there be more than 10  statements or 11 or 12? This should be categorically, roundly condemned  by every U.S. Senator of either party.   These hacks renew the urgency for additional resources for defensive  cyber security across our government. This need is not a new one. In  fact, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, known as  CISA, C-I-S-A, was stood up within the Department of Homeland Security  in 2018 precisely to shore up the U.S. Government's defenses against  such hacks, such intrusions.   However, as we all know, just days after the 2020 Presidential  election, President Trump fired CISA's Director, Chris Krebs, for  contradicting the President's own false claims regarding the election.   The President has failed to take this hack, this attack on our  security, this attack on our government seriously. This hack raises  serious questions about the nature of cyber espionage and what  constitutes hostile acts by another country.   These are questions I look forward to exploring as we learn more  about the scope and nature of this latest breach. While both of our  countries certainly engage in espionage, we must be vigilant in the  protection of our own data and technology from foreign interference,  and we need to hear more from Senators on both sides of the aisle about  this attack.   The second and related issue is the reporting just in the last day or  so, reports that the President may be seeking to invoke the  Insurrection Act to impose martial law and refuse to step down from the  Presidency next month. The reporting indicates that these discussions  took place in the Oval Office.   I would argue--I think most Americans would argue--that even the mere  discussion of martial law, the mere mention of it, the mere invocation  of the whole notion of martial law is both harmful and dangerous.   Republican Senators, so far, have not condemned these actions that  blatantly violate democratic norms. Maybe one, maybe two--I hope that  number grows as well--but the silence from the majority party in the  Senate on this report is deafening. I would hope that every Senator  would roundly condemn the mere mention of martial law.   Attempting to seize election machines--that would be the effect of  the invocation of martial law if it were operationalized--election  machines in a number of States seized by the government of the United  States.   I have got to ask the question: In America? In the United States of  America? Is that what the White House is really discussing?   All that America expects--and it is not much--is that Senators of  both parties would condemn, in the strongest possible terms, even the  discussion of martial law.  [[Page S7915]]    The Army Secretary and the Army Chief of Staff released a joint  statement clarifying, based on these dangerous actions proposed by the  President's team, that ``there is no role for the U.S. military in  determining the outcome of an American election.''   It is hard to believe that those officials in our government who help  defend our country would even have to say that based upon what the  reporting indicates.   So I hope that, even in this holiday season, it is made very clear by  every Member of the U.S. Senate that this will not be tolerated and has  to be condemned. We can't just say: Oh, well, it is another outrage,  another insult. It should be condemned, just like the actions of the  Russian Government should be condemned as well.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I just want to make a couple of brief  comments about the legislation we are going to be voting on, we hope,  tonight.   I will talk about, for purposes of time, not the spending bill or the  spending portion, the so-called omnibus. I will talk about the COVID-19  relief provisions. I won't go through all of them, obviously, but there  is a lot of good news for many Americans in this legislation.   The consensus on unemployment benefits will help a lot of Americans:  $300 per week for all Americans receiving unemployment benefits through  March 14. The Pandemic Unemployment Assistance Program is extended to  help self-employed individuals, gig workers, and others in  nontraditional employment.   The economic impact payments for Americans across the country: $600  for individuals making up to $75,000 a year and $1,200 for couples  making up to $150,000 per year, as well as a $600 payment for each  dependent child. That means a family of four would receive $2,400 in  direct payments.   The Paycheck Protection Program, so-called PPP: $284 billion for the  first and second PPP forgivable loans.   There is more money for transportation, more money for health, and,  in particular, money for the procurement of vaccines and therapeutics,  as well as money for vaccine distribution.   Education is funded for more than $80 billion; emergency rental  assistance, $25 billion; the Postal Service, $10 billion; childcare,  $10 billion--both very important.   The ones I am especially grateful for, even though on a lot of these  I would vote for higher numbers--a lot of us would--are the nutrition  provisions: $26 billion in agriculture and nutrition funding. Half of  that will be used for direct payments to farmers who have suffered  losses due to the impact of the pandemic. The remaining 13, the other  half of the 26--$13 billion will be used to combat food insecurity,  which is on the rise due to the economic impact of the pandemic.   There is a lot in here that is positive for American families, for  workers, for small businesses, and for so many other needs. It took way  too long. This is months overdue. There are gaps in it.   I think this is a 3-month bill to help folks get through January,  February, and March. I think we will need another bill after that. And,  obviously, I am very disappointed we don't have dollars in here to help  nursing homes, which I fought very hard for. We will keep up that  fight.   It doesn't have the direct help to State and local governments, even  though there are provisions that will help States but not nearly  enough.   So it is far, far from perfect, but I think it is important that we  pass it to provide direct help to people who have challenges, whether  it is with employment or running a small business or supporting their  families.   The last point I will make on this is that we gather here today--and  we hope the vote will be tonight before midnight, but we don't know.  But it is just ironic that today is the 21st of December, the winter  solstice, the darkest day of the year.   I was noting this weekend Elizabeth Dias wrote an op-ed, a very  thoughtful op-ed, in the New York Times about winter and all of the  ways different cultures have dealt with the darkness and the severity  of winter. But here is what she says, and I hope it provides a context  for what we are about to pass and what we must do in the months ahead  when the virus is still raging and the death number keeps climbing.  Here is what Elizabeth Dias says:         The great irony of winter is that the moment darkness is       greatest is also the moment light is about to return. Each       year the winter solstice comes with the promise that the next       day will be brighter.    In this season of hope and this holiday season, we hope and we pray  that this legislation will bring some light to people's lives, that it  will give them a sense, in addition to having a vaccine available now,  that brighter days are ahead.   We can't underestimate the darkness that has engulfed so many  families, but we hope tonight that we provide at least a measure of  light to all the darkness that so many families have faced   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, as we approach the end of another year, I  rise to remember all those American men and women who have given what  President Lincoln called ``the last full measure of devotion'' in  service to this great Nation.   I often reflect on the Gettysburg Address when thinking about our  servicemembers and veterans. We all know this short, somber speech has  reverberated throughout our history with an influence that vastly  exceeds the few minutes for which Lincoln actually spoke. In November  1863, President Lincoln stood on the battlefield in Gettysburg to bless  those brave soldiers who had fallen in what was the bloodiest battle in  U.S. history up to that point. The ``last full measure of devotion''  remark has always resonated with me, as it does with so many Americans,  but Lincoln had another message in his address. He said, ``It is for us  the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which  they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.''   Even in moments of mourning, Lincoln charged those still standing to  rededicate themselves to the hard work of preserving our Nation's  integrity, protecting our fundamental freedoms, and building our  families' security and prosperity. In a time of great division, this  was no small task, and it today remains one of our urgent and most  solemn tasks.   The year after the Gettysburg Address, the women of Boalsburg, PA,  began a tradition that would carry on for generations. They gathered  together to decorate the gravestones of their loved ones who had gone  to God. They wanted to reach beyond the pain to show their fathers,  husbands, brothers, and sons that their memories endure in the hearts  and minds of the living. Honoring the spirit and sacrifice of our  military and veterans isn't just about isolated days of commemoration  on Veterans Day and Memorial Day each year, it is about the work we do  every day to be worthy of their valor, as my father used to say.   As we discuss a potential U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, combat  the resurgence of ISIS in the Middle East, exercise oversight over  other U.S. military engagements overseas, and look to resolve  increasingly complicated global crises, we must not forget those who  have given the ultimate sacrifice in service to our country,  particularly in the most recent wars. The numbers are important: 7034  Americans have lost their lives in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,  with an additional 7 killed in African Command operations since 2001.  This includes 300 servicemembers from Pennsylvania--the fifth highest  toll of any State. Over 53,000 have been wounded, including more than  2,000 from Pennsylvania. Although this administration refuses to be  transparent in its deployment tracking, press reports indicate that  approximately 7,500 Americans are currently serving in Iraq and  Afghanistan, with an additional 65,000 serving in the Persian Gulf and  Saudi Arabia.   This year, for the first time in nearly two decades, Pennsylvania did  not lose any servicemembers abroad. While I am grateful Pennsylvania  did not suffer losses this year, this milestone only serves as a  reminder of the grim toll that the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have  taken on the Commonwealth and the Nation. As families of fallen  servicemembers continue to mourn, we must reconsider the nature of our  military commitments overseas and recommit to ensuring those who serve  are taken care of.   These fighting men and women were born into families, not into  divisions and brigades. They are sons and daughters, husbands and  wives, fathers and mothers. Their love for their families is matched  only by their devotion to our country.   But many more bear the scars of war. Some families have a loved one  who served in Iraq or Afghanistan and returned home but was one of the  53,250 wounded. And we must not overlook the unusually high percentage  of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans who have died since returning home,  whether from drug overdose or suicide. Thousands of American families  continue to pay a terrible price for the courage and dedication of  their family members who gave life and limb for this country.   As we look to a new year and a new Congress, I am reminded of the  moments when policymakers reached across the aisle, putting partisan  differences aside to implement ideas that best served the American  people. We can think about the establishment of the first system of  State veterans homes after the Civil War, enactment of the GI bill  after World War II, creation of the modern, Cabinet-level Department of  Veterans Affairs under President Reagan, all required foresight and  courage to see come to fruition. The year ahead provides an opportunity  for further bipartisan cooperation in service of our veterans and our  men and women in uniform.   Each of us, those who have served and those who haven't, must be a  part of the effort toward healing. We can meet today's challenges with  the spirit of the women in Boalsburg so many years ago, to remember our  past and keep working towards our future. We can continue our work here  in Washington, in Pennsylvania, and across the Nation, to ensure we are  worthy of the valor of the men and women we commemorate today. I call  on my colleagues in the Senate to reflect every day on the sacrifice of  those who came before us.   As another year comes to a close, we remember and honor those who  have laid down their lives for this great Nation. God bless them.                            ____________________
