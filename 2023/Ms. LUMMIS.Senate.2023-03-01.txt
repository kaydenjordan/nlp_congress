 Madam President, it is with a heavy heart that I  rise today to share with you that Wyoming lost one of its finest  residents on September 21. At the age of 89, God called up one of his  most faithful servants, Clarene Law, up to heaven. I join with the rest  of Wyoming in mourning this tremendous loss.   While she was born in neighboring Idaho, Clarene's journey to Wyoming  began in 1959 when her husband at the time was hired to be a guidance  counselor at Jackson/Wilson High School, which brought the family to  Jackson, WY. In the early 1960s, Jackson presumably looked a whole lot  different than it looks today. Of course, Grand Teton National Park and  Yellowstone were a short drive away, and the entire area is surrounded  by so much natural beauty, but it was not the major tourist destination  that it is today.   Once settled in Jackson, Clarene took what may be considered her  first step in the hospitality business by working as a bookkeeper and  auditor at the Wort Hotel in Jackson. In 1962, while working at the  Wort, she overheard a conversation about the owner of the Antler Motel  telling another person they wanted to sell it. After hearing this  conversation, Clarene chimed in to say that she was interested. Clarene  and her husband got together, scrounged up their money, were able to  receive assistance from both sets of parents to make the necessary down  payment to become owners of the Antler Motel.   The work at the Antler was tough, but it also gave her the chance to  be a  [[Page S566]]  working mother and watch her kids while doing all the remaining tasks  necessary for running a hotel. She worked the front desk, cleaned the  sheets, made the beds, did the books, and eventually even pumped gas at  the station they later added. Business was certainly picking up, and it  allowed them to start expanding the Antler. They were able to purchase  several nearby properties which were rolled into the Antler itself and  a location that once was a series of different restaurants to what is  known today as the Pearl Street Market.   In 1973, Clarene remarried Creed Law who was a hard-working man who  could do just about anything with his hands. Creed was also  instrumental in the upkeep and expansion of the hotel operations. There  were few things he couldn't fix and coincidentally put together. Case  in point, they actually purchased what was the Settlers Best Western in  Worland and took it apart only to put it back together in Jackson, some  250 miles away.   Clarene certainly knew what she was doing, and she was doing it  extremely well. Over the years, they continued to expand, purchase new  properties, update some of the old ones, and at the time of her  passing, Clarene and Creed owned 6 lodges with 477 hotel units and  employed numerous people to help manage and maintain them. One of the  true special parts about that is that, over the nearly 60 years that  Clarene was responsible for the hotels, you could regularly still find  her sitting behind the front desk at the Antler, greeting people, and  getting them situation and settled into their rooms.   For anyone to have worked nearly 60 years setting up a major family  business and helping to transform Jackson into the destination that it  is today would be remarkable enough and incredibly noteworthy, it still  does not even tell the full story of how Clarene impacted Wyoming.   Having been recognized by so many in the community for her hard work  and dedication to Jackson and seeing the town grow and develop, she was  frequently asked to serve in numerous civic organizations. She was able  to make time to serve as a board member for the Jackson Hole Chamber of  Commerce and the Jackson Planning Commission. The list goes on. She was  a founder and president of the Jackson Hole Resort Association,  president of the Wyoming Lodging and Restaurant Association, director  of the Jackson State Bank, a member of the school board, and still  found a way to teach Sunday school. Much of this work led to her  receiving the Big WYO award in 1987, which is an incredible honor put  forth by the Wyoming Hospitality and Travel Coalition.   The desire to work with her community and to find solutions to  improve and make things better led to her decision to run for the  Wyoming House of Representatives. Her neighbors agreed and voted her to  be their State representative in house district 23, where she served  the people of Teton County for seven 2-year terms from 1991-2005.   During her time in the legislature, she became the chair of the house  minerals, business, and economic development committee, which is quite  fitting since she was responsible for so much growth in the tourism  industry in Teton County. She was a strong supporter of the Cultural  Trust, supported learning centers and access to healthcare, especially  working for a Medicaid match for traumatic brain injuries for adults.  She was also one that had a way about her that seemed to ease the  tension in the room. Her collegial way amongst her fellow  representatives was such that she was able to bring people together and  find something that they can agree on. Having served in the State  legislature with former Senator Mike Enzi, maybe she was familiar with  his 80/20 tool, which emphasizes focusing on 80 percent of an issue  people can agree on and leaving out or finding another way to work on  the 20 percent which typically is the part which many tend to disagree  on. Regardless, she had a very successful second career for herself and  influenced so many by serving Wyoming in the State house.   Before her passing, Clarene wrote a memoir about her life. It is  titled, ``And I Had Fun! The Life and Legacy of Clarene Law.'' That is  a perfectly fitting title as that is how she ended many of her letters.  After having known her for as long as I have, I am sure that, yes, she  had fun.   Clarene was a legend, truly one of a kind. She was the best of the  best. She was kind, but firm, smart and generous, and devoted to  serving her Teton County community. Her family and husband Creed were  her greatest joy. Above all else, she was a woman of great faith.  Clarene was the type of leader and person we should all aspire to be.  She was a dear friend and a woman I admired greatly. I will miss  everything about her, but her legacy lives across her beloved State of  Wyoming.                            ____________________
