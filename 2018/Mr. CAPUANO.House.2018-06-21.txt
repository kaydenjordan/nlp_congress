 Mr. Speaker, this bill also authorizes $24 billion to  build a stupid wall.   This bill also says it is going to be harder for family reunification  by repealing two laws that already allow it.   This bill also says that 3 million people who have done the right  thing and are in line to become citizens are now going to be shunted  aside.   Don't kid yourself about what this bill says and what it doesn't say.   This bill also is a sham. You know it and I know it.   Now, previous speakers said that history is going to judge us. You  are right. It will.   On this issue, God is going to judge you as well. When you go to  those gates and there is a little thing in there that says you went out  of your way to use children for your political purposes, you really  think that is a good mark to have in your book? I don't think so.   When you talk about compromise, it takes a little bit more than just  looking in the mirror and compromising with yourself. It actually means  you have to deal with people who sometimes don't agree with you.   This bill is a lousy bill. You know it; we know it; and America knows  it.
