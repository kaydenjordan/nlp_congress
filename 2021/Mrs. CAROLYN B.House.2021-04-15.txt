 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her  remarks.)    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong  support of the Paycheck Fairness Act.   On average, women are paid just 82 cents for every dollar paid to  men. The gap is even larger, almost double, for women of color.  Compounded over a lifetime, the pay gap becomes a wealth tax, costing  women thousands and thousands of dollars in lost wages.   Longstanding workplace discrimination sets women back in pay,  benefits, hiring, and promotions. Closing the pay gap will provide more  financial stability for women, especially those who are hardest hit by  the pandemic.   At a recent Oversight and Reform Committee hearing on Equal Pay Day,  soccer superstar Megan Rapinoe testified: ``One cannot simply  outperform inequality.''   Combating pay discrimination requires deliberate action, and that is  what the Paycheck Fairness bill does. I urge a ``yes'' vote on this  important bill.                            ____________________     MALONEY of New York: Committee on Oversight       and Reform.
