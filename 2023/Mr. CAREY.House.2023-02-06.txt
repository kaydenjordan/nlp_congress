 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 302, the  Energy Cybersecurity University Leadership Act of 2023.   Reliable energy infrastructure is critical to our national security  and our economic well-being. With the rising number of threats and  attacks on our energy grid, this bipartisan, commonsense legislation  will help our country avoid large-scale power outages due  to cyberattacks on our critical infrastructure.    The Energy Cybersecurity University Leadership Act directs the  Secretary of Energy to provide financial assistance to graduate  students and postdoctoral researchers studying the convergence of  cybersecurity and energy infrastructure.   This financial assistance in the form of fellowships, scholarships,  and research and development projects will prepare the next generation  to address the cyberattacks on our energy infrastructure that our  Nation will inevitably face.   These graduate students and postdoctoral researchers will have the  opportunity to study and train at our national laboratories, giving  them the proper experience and tools to be successful in protecting our  energy grid as they enter the workforce.   With the war in Europe, the rising threat of China, and the record- high energy prices over the last couple of years, it is more important  than ever to invest in the protection of energy infrastructure, and  this legislation is a step in the right direction.   I thank Congresswoman Ross for her work on this important legislation  as well as Chairman Lucas and Ranking Member Lofgren for bringing the  bill to the floor for consideration.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this important  bill.
