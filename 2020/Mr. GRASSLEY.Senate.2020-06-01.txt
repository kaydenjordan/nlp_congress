 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the  Senate for 1 minute.    Mr. President, our Nation is hurting. George Floyd's  death was horrific, and justice must be served. The Justice Department  has opened an investigation, and the officer has been charged with  murder.   A single act of violence at the hands of an officer is one too many.  George Floyd deserved better. All Black Americans do. Indeed, all  Americans do. The last thing we need is more pain, more devastation,  and more injustice.   As a country, let's strive for compassion and listening to others.  The best way to honor George Floyd is to engage with all members of our  community, including Members of this body, on how to heal these wounds.  This is an opportunity for Congress to discuss what reforms can and  should be made to address police use of force. Let's move forward and  protect our communities together.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
