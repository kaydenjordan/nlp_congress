 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate a  remarkable collaboration between Cold Zero Premium Spirits and Cedar  Ridge Winery & Distillery that embodies the spirit of giving back and  honoring our veterans.   Casey Maxted, a former Green Beret, brought together friends and  colleagues from the military and cofounded Cold Zero in Swisher, Iowa.   This year, members of Cold Zero Premium Spirits and Cedar Ridge  Winery & Distillery spent the 22nd anniversary of the 9/11 terror  attacks bottling whiskey. Over 2,000 bottles of this special whiskey  will be available, and each bottle is signed by one of six Medal of  Honor recipients, including Cedar Rapids native Sal Giunta.   As we approach Veterans Day, let us remember the profound impact we  can have on the lives of our veterans by rallying around organizations  and businesses who support them and are also veteran owned.   Thank you, Cold Zero Premium Spirits and Cedar Ridge Winery &  Distillery for your inspiring efforts to make a difference.   I would also like to wish a very happy birthday to the most special  man in my life, my husband, Curt Meeks. Happy birthday, honey.                            ____________________
