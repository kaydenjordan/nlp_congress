 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as leaders of the  Republican Party in both the House and the Senate have introduced  legislation to ban abortion nationwide.   It doesn't matter if you live in a State where abortion is protected  by the voters like Nevada. Abortion would be banned in every State.   The most extreme restrictions would be held in place, and women's  healthcare decisions would be taken away from you and handed over to  Lindsey Graham and his Republican colleagues.   The vast majority of Americans support Roe, but the Supreme Court has  stripped away our freedoms and overturned 50 years of constitutional  precedent.   Since Roe, extremist politicians have introduced nearly 590 bills to  ban, restrict, and control our choice. That is right--nearly 600 bills.   They are obsessed with taking away our most personal healthcare  decisions, and we can't let that happen. I will do everything in my  power to stop the Washington Republicans who want to take away your  freedom. We will not be intimidated.                            ____________________
