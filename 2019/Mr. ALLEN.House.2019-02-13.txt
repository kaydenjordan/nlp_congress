 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to legislation that my  Democratic colleagues are pushing to raise the Federal minimum wage to  $15 an hour--more than double its current level.   As a member of the House Education and Labor Committee, I  participated in a hearing last week to speak against this radical  proposal that will hurt low-skilled workers and small businesses the  most. I am a proud small business owner, and I know for a fact that  businesses pay wages according to their employees' skill set. In a free  enterprise environment, a growing economy grows jobs which grows  opportunities which grows wages.   I believe you reward a good day's work, but my Democratic colleagues  don't want to believe that we can produce economic opportunity in  concert with growing wages without the government interfering.   Signing the front of the paycheck and providing folks with a good job  has been one of the greatest privileges of my life. That is why I  oppose the Raise the Wage Act. This one-size-fits-all, top-down  government regulation will destroy millions of hard-earned jobs and  restrain our growing economy.   Democrats should focus on economic growth and getting the American  people back to work, not an unpopular, progressive agenda.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Walorski for her  efforts in organizing this important Special Order.   You know, Mr. Speaker, as the proud father of four and grandfather of  13, I rise here this evening, joined by many of my Republican  colleagues, to recognize that we have a moral duty and obligation to  protect the most vulnerable among us: those who cannot yet protect or  speak for themselves.   But as we stand here tonight, Democrats in State legislatures across  the country are celebrating legislation to deny medical care to an  innocent baby who is born alive after a failed abortion. We cannot  stand idly by and allow this to happen.   How have we come to this point in our country where infanticide is  something we disagree on? Each and every one of us has a right to life,  even an innocent newly born gift from God, and I will continue to stand  up and fight for that right to life every step of the way.   We must continue to be proactive in bringing commonsense pro-life  legislation to the House floor. I hope to have an opportunity to offer  my full support for these bills and protect the sanctity of life.
