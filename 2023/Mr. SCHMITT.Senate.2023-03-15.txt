 Madam President, I rise today to honor the life  and memory of T.E. ``Jake'' Fisher, of Portageville, MO.   Jake Fisher was well known for his time as director of the University  of Missouri's Delta Research Center, in Portageville, MO, which was  renamed the ``Fisher'' Delta Research, Extension, and Education Center  in Jake's honor after his retirement in 2011. Jake began his career at  the Delta Research Center in 1961 and worked his way up from farm  worker to director by 1989, until his retirement after more than 50  years with the University of Missouri. To commemorate Jake's service to  the University of Missouri, the College of Agriculture, Food, and  Natural Resources created the T.E. Jake Fisher Scholarship Fund, to  continue Jake's huge legacy of encouraging students from the Bootheel  region to attend Mizzou.   Jake's devotion to his community and the State of Missouri will never  be forgotten. He served on numerous boards over the years and  maintained connections with folks across the State. One of his most  passionate roles was president of the Pemiscot-Dunklin Electric  Cooperative Board of Directors, a position he held until his retirement  in September of 2022. He also held positions on the boards of the M&A  Electric Power Cooperative and the Associated Electric Cooperative.   Jake was a fine man that will forever be remembered for possessing a  heart of gold and an enormous friendly presence. I had the distinct  honor of meeting Jake at the Annual Fisher Delta Research Center Field  Days, an event where thousands of guests from across the State of  Missouri gather to celebrate agriculture, Southeast Missouri, and life- long learning. I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in honoring the  life of Mr. Jake Fisher, and I offer my sincerest condolences to his  wife Shelly, daughter Stacey, and remaining family and friends during  this difficult time of mourning.                            ____________________
