 Mr. Speaker, last summer, the House passed all 12  appropriations bills before the fiscal year started on October 1.   We appropriated nearly $650 billion to provide our servicemembers  with the resources they need to defend this country in the face of  threats from North Korea, China, Russia, al-Qaida, ISIS, and Iran. The  House funded other Federal programs at nearly $550 billion.   For the past 3\1/2\ months, however, our military and servicemembers  have been operating under continuing resolutions, also known as CRs,  which means they are stuck at the funding levels they had last year.  That is because Senate Democrats are holding back the full funding of  our defenses so they can add billions of dollars more in other Federal  spending.   The defense of this country, Mr. Speaker, is not some bargaining  chip, and preventing our servicemembers from getting the resources they  need, especially after we have seen servicemember deaths resulting from  the lack of training and proper equipment, is unconscionable.   As Secretary Mattis told us last year: ``Long-term CRs impact the  readiness of our forces and their equipment at a time when security  threats are extraordinarily high. The longer the CR, the greater the  consequences for our force.''   It is way past time for Senate Democrats to end their filibustering  of our Nation's defense and to start helping our servicemembers in  harm's way.                            ____________________
