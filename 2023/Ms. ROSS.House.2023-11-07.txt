 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to House  Republicans' transportation and housing appropriations bill.   This week Republicans are fast-tracking a bill that would make it  more difficult for people in North Carolina to commute to work and find  an affordable place to live.   Specifically, this legislation slashes funding for the HOME program,  the sole Federal housing program dedicated to affordable housing  construction.   Under their plan, funding will be cut by two-thirds, and 17,000 fewer  affordable homes will be built or rehabilitated in the coming fiscal  year.   I consistently hear from constituents about the high cost of housing  and how it is an unbearable burden. Across North Carolina, 25 percent  of all renter households are categorized as extremely low-income. These  families need our help.   Madam Speaker, we must do more to make housing affordable, and we  must reject this deeply flawed bill.                            ____________________
