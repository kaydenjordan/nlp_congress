(c) Ports of Entry Described.--In this section, the term       ``ports of entry'' means United States air, land, and sea       ports of entry.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the United States has over 300 official ports of entry,  ranging from land border ports along our southern and northern borders  to international airports in major metropolitan cities, to seaports  ranging from the Great Lakes to coastal cities. While each port  facilitates trade and travel that keeps our economy humming, each has  their own unique security challenges to prevent illicit activity. That  is why it is imperative that we know the vulnerabilities and  operational needs at each and every port in order to properly protect  our homeland from threats and exploitation.   I introduced this bill because our country's ports are long overdue  for a comprehensive review. My bill requires the Department of Homeland  Security to do a full threat and operational analysis of these  vulnerabilities and create a strategy and implementation plan to  prevent human trafficking, illicit drugs, illegal contraband, and  transnational criminal activity at our air, land, and sea ports of  entry.   The bill also works to improve the flow of commerce that is vital to  our economy. We need to not only think about the security of our ports,  but also the infrastructure and operational needs as well.   Ports of entry continue to be a preferred location for transnational  criminal organizations and drug smugglers to transport illicit drugs  and contraband into the United States. In fact, between October 1,  2010, and March 31, 2018, Customs and Border Protection conducted more  than 84 million nonintrusive inspection examinations, resulting in more  than 19,000 narcotics seizures and $79 million in currency seizures.   Many U.S. ports of entry were built 40 to 50 years ago. Therefore,  they were never designed for post-9/11 security measures, technology,  or increased volume of traffic. These infrastructure constraints  magnify the threats at our ports of entry and manifest themselves as  long lines and bottlenecks that strain Customs and Border Protection's  ability to properly vet all incoming traffic. In addition, long lines  and wait times delay trade and cost the U.S. economy millions of  dollars every year in lost productivity.   This is why my bill's required analysis will look over current and  potential threats, methods, and pathways used to exploit security  vulnerabilities and improvements needed to improve illicit drugs and  other contraband from crossing our border. Following the analysis, my  bill directs the Department of Homeland Security to create a strategy  and implementation plan to address the threats and operational  inefficiencies identified. We need to fix these problems. We need to  take action. Our ports must be brought into the 21st century.   I am pleased by the support I have received on this legislation, and  I specifically want to thank Chairman Brady of the House Ways and Means  Committee and Chairman McCaul of the House Homeland Security Committee  for working with me to bring this bill to the floor. Modernizing our  ports of entry is just one step in securing our border.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting H.R. 6400,  and I reserve the balance of my time.

The Committee on Ways and Means has       jurisdiction over this bill and an additional referral was       granted to the Committee on Homeland Security. The Committee       on Homeland Security ordered this bill favorably reported.       Because of the extensive communication regarding the policies       contained in the bill, the Committee on Ways and Means is       willing to waive formal consideration of the bill so that it       may proceed expeditiously to the House Floor.        Please note that by waiving formal consideration of the       bill, the Committee on Ways and Means is in no way waiving       its jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in those       provisions of the bills that fall within your Rule X       jurisdiction.        I will include a copy of our letters in the Congressional       Record during consideration of this legislation on the House       floor and would support your effort to seek appointment of an       appropriate number of conferees on any House-Senate       conference involving this legislation.            Sincerely,                                                       Kevin Brady,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                  Washington, DC, September 4, 2018.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Brady: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 6400, the ``United States Ports of Entry Threat and       Operational Review Act.'' I appreciate your support in       bringing this legislation before the House of       Representatives, and accordingly, understand that the       Committee on Ways and Means will not take further action on       this bill.        The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual       understanding that by foregoing consideration on this bill at       this time, the Committee on Ways and Means does not waive any       jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this bill       or similar legislation in the future. In addition, should a       conference on this bill be necessary, I would support a       request by the Committee on Ways and Means for conferees on       those provisions within your jurisdiction.        I will insert copies of this exchange in the report on the       bill for H.R. 6400. I thank you for your cooperation in this       matter.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support  H.R. 6400, and I yield back the balance of my time.
