 Mr. President, today I offer my recognition of the  unique service of the Utah Diaper Bank to the people of Utah and,  seecifically, to the children of our great State. Their service, now  spanning nearly a decade, officially started in March 2013 when a few  dedicated individuals recognized the necessity fof an organized,  community-based approach to collecting and distributing diapers. Today,  after years of careful planning and hard work, hundreds of thousands of  diapers are being distributed throughout Utah to those who need them.   Some years ago, Victor Velivis, a Utah information technology  professional, was watching television when he noticed an vertisement  placed by a crisis nursery. The nursery requested diapers, not to  stockpile them, but because they were out--flat out--of diapers. Vic  donated what diapers he could and kept tabs on the nursery for a year.  A year later, the same nursery ran out again. Puzzled, he set out to  investigate.   After investigating, Vic realized that safety-net programs such as  the food stamp program and Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for  Women, Infants and Children do not cover the cost of diapers. He also  realized that low-income parents cannot take advantage of free or  subsidized childcare if they cannot afford to leave diapers at  childcare centers. This prevents parents from accessing daycare and  prevents them from being able to work or attend school on a consistent  basis.   Vic began. to think about alternatives. What about cloth diapers? he  thought. He soon realized, however, that most people living in poverty  do not have access to washing facilities. Thus, they are unable to use  cloth diapers for health and sanitary reasons.   The more he learned, the more Vic realized how hard it can be for  parents in need to put diapers on their children.   In some Utah families, children suffer multiple days in the same  diaper. Not only is this tremendously uncomfortable, it also puts the  child at risk of serious illness and disease. In fact, according to one  expert source, to prevent complications, it is recommended that parents  change their newborn baby's diaper every 2 to 3 hours. That is 8 to 12  diapers each day; and, at about 25 cents per diaper, a total of nearly  100 dollars per month. But what if you can't afford that? The Utah  Diaper Bank was created to address this problem directly.   The Utah Diaper Bank serves the needs of infants and young children  by overseeing an organized approach to collecting and distributing  diapers to organizations and individuals who need them. The bank  fulfills this mission by supporting diaper drives, collecting and  stockpiling diapers, and then distributing diapers throughout the  State. What began as a loosely connected group of friends operating out  of their homes, now operates out of a warehouse and distributes  hundreds of thousands of diapers annually.   The Covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated demand for the services  provided by the Utah Diaper Bank. In early 2020, the Utah Diaper Bank  was shipping 50,000 diapers a month with a target of 500,000-750,000  for the year. Then, once the pandemic had hit, they started shipping  well over 100,000 per month. By the end of 2020, they had shipped over  880,000. They have never seen demand for diapers like they are seeing  now. Yet, they continue to succeed in fulfilling their mission.   The most remarkable part of the operation of the Utah Diaper Bank is  that they operate without any paid staff. Their team is made up  entirely of volunteers. Further, they receive neither private nor  government grants and operate on a strict collection-distribution  model.   The folks at the Utah Diaper Bank undeniably deserve recognition for  their devout service to the people of Utah. It is my unique privilege  to honor them today.
