 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, yesterday was the  third anniversary of the Pulse nightclub shooting. Three years ago, 49  young people were senselessly murdered and 53 more were wounded.   In the 3 years since then, approximately 120,000 more Americans have  died from our Nation's gun violence epidemic, and our Nation has failed  to take any meaningful action. Just recently, we witnessed another mass  shooting in Virginia Beach that killed 12 people--12 innocent people.   And yet Congress has yet to pass commonsense measures to save lives,  measures that 90 percent of Americans support like universal background  checks and bans on massacre-sized magazines and silencers.   H.R. 8, passed by the House more than 100 days ago, still awaits  action in the Senate.   How many more tragic anniversaries must pass--how many must die-- before we offer more than thoughts and prayers?                            ____________________     MALONEY of New York:        H.R. 3279.
