 Madam Speaker, I start by echoing the  sentiments that both the chairman and the ranking member had about  Jackie Walorski and how deeply we all feel for her and her family and  the staff members who were lost.   I congratulate Mr. Neal and also members of this committee, most  notably Mr. Thompson and Mr. Blumenauer, as well, for their work on  climate change and for their work throughout this period of putting  forward consequential legislation. I say ``consequential'' in the time  I am allotted because I want to talk and focus specifically on some of  these claims.   I hope the American people are listening. You don't bring about  change by appealing to the sum total of the fears of the American  people. You bring about change aspirationally and by doing something  constructive and putting forward legislation as opposed to putting  forward the collective fears of a nation and hoping that you might be  able to exploit those fears for political gain.   The myth that there are 87,000 IRS agents, even Trump's former person  rejects that. It is nonsense, as Mr. Neal has pointed out.   What matters to people is when you help them directly, like Rod  Yearwood in West Hartford, Connecticut, who is paying $1,400 a month  for his insurance, but now, under this bill, is paying $20 a month. The  real savings he gets from that allows him to provide for a college  education for his children. Aspiration.                                time  1330
