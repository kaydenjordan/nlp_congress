 Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and for  our work together on this issue.   Madam Chair, I represent the district in this Congress that has the  highest concentration of active duty military. If my constituents are  called to war with Iran, they will go without hesitation or question.  They will fight and win decisive victory, and I am incredibly proud of  them.   But if they must deploy the patriotism to go downrange and win this  war, we should at least have the courage to vote for it or vote against  it, every darn one of us.   And if my war-hungry colleagues, some of whom have already suggested  that we invade Venezuela, North Korea, and probably a few other  countries before lunchtime tomorrow; if they are so certain of their  case against Iran, let them bring their authorization to use military  force against Iran to this very floor.   Let them make the case to Congress and to the American people. Let  them show the military families in my district what their loved ones  will fight for and die for. If we do that, then I think we serve the  country well.   My constituents are doing their part, and I think it is about time  Congress does our part and speak to these critical matters of war and  peace.
