 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the Republican leader was here a few  moments ago discussing an issue which I think has gotten a lot of play  here lately, and that is this attempt by Democrat members of the Texas  Legislature to come to Washington, DC, to protest legislation that is  being moved through the legislature in the State of Texas. In fact,  this is the cover of one of yesterday's newspapers--or I should say  today's newspapers.   It has a photo there of all the Democrat legislators from Texas  meeting with the Democrat leadership here in the U.S. Senate.  Allegedly, they are here, playing hooky from their jobs in Texas,  having flown in, I am told, on private jets--so much for doing  something about the climate--to protest the fact that in Texas their  voices are not being heard and not being given input into the  legislative process there.   I point that out simply because it is really incredibly ironic. I  mean, it is rich with irony. Sometimes, around here, you just say you  can't make this stuff up. They are here in Washington, DC, away from  Texas, which is where their jobs are, to protest the fact that their  views and voice are not being heard in Texas and that the majority in  Texas is running roughshod over the minority and their rights.   The same Democrats, I would add, here in Washington, DC, are trying  to get rid of the legislative filibuster in the U.S. Senate, the very  mechanism that historically has protected the rights of the minority  and given them a voice in the legislative process, the very thing that  has been used historically in a way that ensures that the Senate has to  come together behind big solutions, collaborate, find that common  ground, find that compromise. The Democrats here in Washington and  these Democrats from Texas are all in favor of getting rid of the  legislative filibuster.   Think about that. It is really pretty remarkable that they would come  up here to protest what is happening in Texas at a time when they  support getting rid of the very protections that give the minority here  in the U.S. Senate a voice in that legislative process.   And the other really remarkable irony about this is the issue that  they are here to speak in support of S. 1, the bill that would  federalize, that would nationalize elections in this country and take  power away from States when it comes to regulating and administering  elections, a power that has been held by States going back to the  Founders.   And so they came here basically to say you need to pass H.R. 1. Well,  again, what is H.R. 1? H.R. 1 is this massive Federal takeover of  elections in this country, and it is also the test case for why we have  got to get rid of the legislative filibuster.   I would be willing to bet that the Democrat leader at some point in  the next couple of weeks is going to call up S. 1 again. We voted on it  once already, but he is going to call it up again because he thinks it  is good politics, and, plus, he wants to pressure his Members to do  away with the legislative filibuster in order to pass S. 1 with 51  votes.   So, again, the irony of all of this, honestly, is some stuff you just  flat can't make up. But I would reiterate what I have said before about  S. 1: It is a solution in search of a problem. We have States around  this country who are, in some cases moving to put in place election  integrity measures, measures that will ensure that every vote counts  and that everybody has an opportunity to vote but that people don't  have an opportunity to cheat.   That is all it is about. It is about election integrity. And most of  the measures that are being adopted in States around this country are  simply that--nothing more, nothing less--and, again, historically  consistent with the way that our election process has been governed in  this country, and that is to allow States to make those to do things in  a decentralized way, to not consolidate power in Washington, DC, but  rather to distribute that power and make it that much harder to hack  into it.   I mean, you think about it, you have 50 election systems in this  country. It was what the Founders intended. They wanted to distribute  power. They wanted to have a decentralized system, not one that was  driven and controlled by a bureaucracy here in Washington, DC. I think  that is consistent with what the American people believe ought to  happen and the cases it should be when it comes to elections in this  country.   So it really is interesting to see these Democrat legislators from  Texas coming to Washington, coming all the way up here--again, playing  hooky from their jobs in Texas--to protest a piece of legislation that  is being used by the Democrat leadership to try and get rid of the  legislative filibuster, the very mechanism that protects the rights and  the voice of the minority in the U.S. Senate.
