 Madam Speaker, celebrated each March, Women's History  Month serves as a time to honor and recognize the momentous achievement  of women who have continued to shape the United States today.   What began as a week-long celebration in 1981 is now a month-long  celebration starting in 1995.   This year, I am especially proud to highlight a group of women making  history right now in Texas' Third Congressional District. Collin  County, Texas, has 11 State district courts with 11 presiding judges,  and 7 county courts at law with 7 presiding judges.   In 2017, an addition of a new judge brought the total number of  female judges serving on district courts to six, meaning that, for the  first time in history, a majority of the court seats are now held by  women. But just this year, with the election of another woman in Texas'  219th district court, there are now seven women serving on the county's  district benches. Making this accomplishment even more remarkable, just  12 years ago, there was only one female judge on the county's benches.   While only 33 percent of the judges throughout the United States are  women, Collin County is leading the way with 64 percent of the district  court judge benches held by women judges.   I salute Judge Corinne Mason, Judge Angela Tucker, Judge Jennifer  Edgeworth, Judge Andrea Thompson, Judge Cynthia Wheless, Judge Jill  Willis, Judge Piper McCraw, and Judge Emily Miskel.
