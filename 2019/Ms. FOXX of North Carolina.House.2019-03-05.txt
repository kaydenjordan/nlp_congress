 Madam Speaker, I rise to wish Mrs. Ginny  Walker a happy 100th birthday. It has been a delight getting to know  Mrs. Walker and her family since they began splitting their time  between homes in Greensboro and Land Harbor in North Carolina's Fifth  District.   Mrs. Walker is a mother of two, grandmother of three, great- grandmother of six, and beloved by all of them. Shortly after moving to  North Carolina, her husband, Delmer, started Delta Electronic Plating  Company, and she went back to school to learn how to keep books and  even helped in the plant and driving trucks.   Mrs. Walker remains an engaged citizen to this day, especially in  bridge circles and First Baptist Church, where everyone enjoys her  pies.   At 100, I hope to be as full of life as Mrs. Walker, and I wish her a  wonderful birthday and many, many more to come.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, we are here tonight to  honor our colleague, Walter B. Jones.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank Congressman Price for the effort he  has put in to making this evening a time for us to honor Walter, our  esteemed colleague.   Madam Speaker, Walter Jones will always be remembered for his  dedication to North Carolina's Third District and his steadfast support  for all of our Nation's men and women in uniform. I know that many of  the speakers will  [[Page H2344]]  talk much more about that this evening, as will I.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.  Price), for his comments.   Then, Madam Speaker, we will be recognizing our colleagues from both  sides of the aisle, which is extremely appropriate, particularly in the  case of Congressman Jones.    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Price for his  comments.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Amash) for  his tribute to our good friend, Walter Jones.    Madam Speaker, I thank Representative  Amash for his comments tonight.  [[Page H2345]]    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. Gabbard).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from North Carolina (Mr. Butterfield), another one of our colleagues.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from eastern North Carolina (Mr. Rouzer), my colleague.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the  distinguished gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the  distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa).                                time  2000     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  California (Mr. LaMalfa), and I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for his comments. And I now yield 3 minutes to  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Gohmert) for his extremely eloquent remarks.   Madam Speaker, I yield as much time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman  for her comments.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  his comments.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Pascrell), a long-serving Member and another respected Member of this  body.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  New Jersey for his eloquent comments.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko) for  his comments.     Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Tonko for  those words.   Madam Speaker, as we sometimes say here to keep from using up time we  shouldn't use, I want to associate myself with all the comments made by  my colleagues.   Walter was all of the things that our colleagues have talked about.  He had a fantastic Southern charm and a fantastic smile. He was humble;  he exhibited acts of kindness; and he was pious, not self-righteous.   I regret, as others have said, that I didn't take more time to spend  with him. But I think even in Walter's death, he has done something we  talk about doing here and that is to bring the House together on an  issue.   We are here to honor a very extraordinary man who did what his  conscience told him to do, and he sometimes suffered the consequences.  But I think tonight exhibits that doing the right things for the right  reasons will be honored and has been honored tonight.   I thank, again, all the Members who came here tonight to speak on  Walter's behalf. We all benefited from that.   I particularly thank the dean of our delegation,   David Price, who  was a longtime friend of Walter B. Jones, Jr. I thank his assistant,  Gloria Nlewedim, for her great assistance in this.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of  my Special Order, because I know there are Members who wish to insert  their comments because they could not be here.    Madam Speaker, I would ask Mr. Price if  he has any closing comments he would like to make.    Madam Speaker, I again thank Mr. Price  for his contribution to this evening, and I agree with the gentleman.  It is unfortunate sometimes that it takes a death to bring out these  kinds of comments and this kind of camaraderie. We must remember  tonight and practice it more often.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
