 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Child Care  Is Essential Act.   Without additional Federal assistance, half the childcare capacity in  [[Page H3906]]  California and across the country is at risk of disappearing. This bill  would provide much-needed relief for these facilities in my State and  support working families.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative DeLauro for her leadership on  this issue and for working with my friend, Representative Bacon, and me  to include language from our bill in this package.   My bipartisan bill ensures childcare providers can pay for cleaning  supplies and safety equipment to protect children and childcare workers  from the coronavirus.   According to a nationwide survey, 91 percent of childcare centers are  incurring additional costs for cleaning supplies. We must provide the  necessary resources to protect the health and safety of our children  and childcare workers.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in support of this bill  to ensure childcare facilities nationwide can continue to serve our  families.    Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of our local  cities in the 39th Congressional District and across America. Our  cities continue to combat the coronavirus and provide central services,  but they are losing revenue fast.   Citizens in my district sent a letter urging support, and since the  beginning of this pandemic, I have been advocating on their behalf.  Without Congress stepping up, public safety will be on the chopping  block.   While my Republican colleagues and the White House want to speak out  against defunding the police, their lack of support for our towns and  cities means they are not only defunding the police but also the fire  department and other public safety services.   This last-minute Senate Republican COVID relief bill does just that  and puts the safety of the American people at risk. It also ties school  funding to reopening and puts big corporations over frontline workers.   I renew my call to all of my colleagues and to the White House to not  put our cities in a situation where they have to lay off first  responders and cut community programs.   Let's provide our cities with the financial support they need.                            ____________________
