 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 601, I call up  the bill (H.R. 3684) to authorize funds for Federal-aid highways,  highway safety programs, and transit programs, and for other purposes,  with the Senate amendment thereto, and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on the measure under consideration,  H.R. 3684.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes.   Americans are tired of potholes damaging their cars, failing bridges,  decrepit transit, trains that derail, water mains that explode, sewer  systems that back up into their basements and pollute our rivers.   More than 70 percent of Americans strongly support a major Federal  investment in rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure. The last major  increase in Federal support for infrastructure was during the Clinton  administration's first term--the first term of the Clinton  administration.   Then, President Bush did nothing on the issue.   President Obama came in talking about infrastructure investment. He  passed the American Recovery Act that invested 4 percent of all that  money in infrastructure. I worked with Chairman Jim Oberstar; I chaired  the subcommittee. We wrote a very ambitious surface transportation  reauthorization, which he had been promised by the Obama administration  would be next. But it wasn't. They pulled the plug.   Then came President Trump, the builder. He invited a large group of  us down to the White House. We had a long discussion, and we agreed,  and finally, at the end, he turned to the Speaker and says: Nancy,  Nancy, how much do you need?   And she says: $1.5 trillion, Mr. President.   He says: No, no, no, no; $1.8 trillion. No, no, no; two sounds  better, $2 trillion.   Okay. We agreed to come back in 3 weeks and hammer out the details.   We came back in 3 weeks. He walked into the room, and he had a hissy  fit, slammed the door, walked out, and that was the end of it, except  for the seven fake infrastructure weeks during the Trump  administration.   Now, the House, on the 1st of July, passed the INVEST Act, a bill  that went through a real legislative process, hours in committee,  amendments, hours on the floor, amendments. That was the bill the  country most needed for the 21st century infrastructure. I had hoped to  go to conference with the Senate, actually go through the legislative  process--pretty darn rare around here these days, the way things should  work, the way they are supposed to work under the Constitution.  Unfortunately, because of the Senate filibuster, that wasn't to happen.   So, this President rolled up his sleeves and waded in because he  promised to get infrastructure done. He negotiated first with one group  of Republicans. That didn't work. He then found another group, mostly  Republicans, two Democrats, and spent endless hours between the White  House and that group, negotiating a bipartisan infrastructure bill.   In the end, when this bill came to the floor of the Senate, 19  Republican Senators voted for it--19 Republican Senators voted for it.   Here are a few things from the White House fact sheet on that bill.  It makes the largest Federal investment in public transit ever; makes  the largest Federal investment in passenger rail since the creation of  Amtrak; makes the single largest dedicated bridge investment since the  construction of the Interstate Highway System; makes the largest  investment in clean drinking water and wastewater infrastructure in  American history, delivering clean water to millions of Americans;  ensures every American has access to reliable high-speed internet;  tackles climate change with the largest investment in clean energy and  EV infrastructure, electrifying thousands of school and transit buses;  reconnecting communities; safe streets; $17 billion for ports; $25  billion for airports.   This is what the President managed to negotiate with the recalcitrant  Senate and get around the filibuster and get 19 Republican votes.                                time  1915    This bill is not perfect. It is not the bill that I would have  written. I oppose their decision not to correct the decade-long cuts to  the bus program; the provision creating a dedicated set-aside for  polluting buses within the Low or No Emission Vehicle Program. That is  kind of laughable. I oppose the failure to tighten the Buy American Act  requirements for transit rolling stock or to further crack down on  predatory Chinese state-owned enterprises, which was in our bill, as  well as the omission of the investments in fix it first and mandatory  greenhouse gas reductions.   I will continue to work on addressing these issues. But the reality  today before us is that this is the only option with an evenly divided  Senate and the stupid rules of the Senate, including  [[Page H5447]]  the filibuster. So it is this or nothing on the long overdue investment  in America's infrastructure.   I hope the Republicans on the other side will support it. If they  don't, I would like them to tell us exactly what they would do.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a summary of the  bill written by the White House.                  Historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal         Today, the President and the bipartisan group announced       agreement on the details of a once-in-a-generation investment       in our infrastructure, which will be taken up in the Senate       for consideration. In total, the deal includes $550 billion       in new federal investment in America's infrastructure. The       bipartisan infrastructure deal will grow the economy, enhance       our competitiveness, create good- jobs, and make our economy       more sustainable, resilient, and just.        The deal will create good-paying, union jobs. With the       President's Build Back Better Agenda, these investments will       add, on average, around 2 million jobs per year over the       course of the decade, while accelerating America's path to       full employment and increasing labor force participation.        President Biden believes that we must invest in our country       and in our people, by creating good-paying union jobs,       tackling the climate crisis, and growing the economy       sustainably and equitably for decades to come. The Bipartisan       Infrastructure deal will deliver progress towards those       objectives for working families across the country. The       Bipartisan Infrastructure deal:        Makes the largest federal investment in public transit ever        Makes the largest federal investment in passenger rail       since the creation of Amtrak        Makes the single largest dedicated bridge investment since       the construction of the interstate highway system        Makes the largest investment in clean drinking water and       waste water infrastructure in American history, delivering       clean water to millions of families        Ensures every American has access to reliable high-speed       internet        Helps us tackle the climate crisis by making the largest       investment in clean energy transmission and EV infrastructure       in history; electrifying thousands of school and transit       buses across the country; and creating a new Grid Development       Authority to build a clean, 21st century electric grid.        The President promised to work across the aisle to deliver       results for working families. He believes demonstrating that       democracies can deliver is a critical challenge for his       presidency. Today's agreement shows that we can come together       to position American workers, farmers, and businesses to       compete and win in the 21st century.                      Roads, Bridges, and Major Projects         One in five miles, or 173,000 total miles, of our highways       and major roads and 45,000 bridges are in poor condition.       Bridges in poor condition pose heightened challenges in rural       communities, which often may rely on a single bridge for the       passage of emergency service vehicles. The Bipartisan       Infrastructure deal will invest $110 billion of new funds for       roads, bridges, and major projects, and reauthorize the       surface transportation program for the next five years       building on bipartisan surface transportation reauthorization       bills passed out of committee earlier this year. This       investment will repair and rebuild our roads and bridges with       a focus on climate change mitigation, resilience, equity, and       safety for all users, including cyclists and pedestrians. The       bill includes a total of $40 billion of new funding for       bridge repair, replacement, and rehabilitation, which is the       single largest dedicated bridge investment since the       construction of the interstate highway system. The bill also       includes a total of $17.5 billion for major projects that are       too large or complex for traditional funding programs but       will deliver significant economic benefits to communities.                                    Safety         America has one of the highest road fatality rates in the       industrialized world. The  [[Page H5448]]       deal invests $11 billion in transportation safety programs,       including a new Safe Streets for All program to help states       and localities reduce crashes and fatalities in their       communities, especially for cyclists and pedestrians. It will       more than double funding directed to programs that improve       the safety of people and vehicles in our transportation       system, including highway safety, truck safety, and pipeline       and hazardous materials safety.                                Public Transit         America's transit infrastructure is inadequate--with a       multibillion-dollar repair backlog, representing more than       24,000 buses, 5,000 rail cars, 200 stations, and thousands of       miles of track, signals, and power systems in need of       replacement. The deal invests $39 billion of new investment       to modernize transit, and improve accessibility for the       elderly and people with disabilities, in addition to       continuing the existing transit programs for five years as       part of surface transportation reauthorization. This is the       largest Federal investment in public transit in history, and       devotes a larger share of funds from surface transportation       reauthorization to transit in the history of the programs. It       will repair and upgrade aging infrastructure, modernize bus       and rail fleets, make stations accessible to all users, and       bring transit service to new communities. It will replace       thousands of transit vehicles, including buses, with clean,       zero emission vehicles. And, it will benefit communities of       color since these households are twice as likely to take       public transportation and many of these communities lack       sufficient public transit options.                          Passenger and Freight Rail         Unlike highways and transit, rail lacks a multi-year       funding stream to address deferred maintenance, enhance       existing corridors, and build new lines in high-potential       locations. The deal positions Amtrak and rail to play a       central role in our transportation and economic future. This       the largest investment in passenger rail since the creation       of Amtrak 50 years ago. The deal invests $66 billion in rail       to eliminate the Amtrak maintenance backlog, modernize the       Northeast Corridor, and bring world-class rail service to       areas outside the northeast and midAtlantic. Within these       totals, $22 million would be provided as grants to Amtrak,       $24 billion as federal-state partnership grants for Northeast       Corridor modernization, $12 billion for partnership grants       for intercity rail service, including high-speed rail, $5       billion for rail improvement and safety grants, and $3       billion for grade crossing safety improvements.                              EV Infrastructure         U.S. market share of plug-in electric vehicle (EV) sales is       only one-third the size of the Chinese EV market. The       President believes that must change. The bill invests $7.5       billion to build out a national network of EV chargers. This       is the first-ever national investment in EV charging       infrastructure in the United States and is a critical element       in the Biden-Harris Administration's plan to accelerate the       adoption of EVs to address the climate crisis and support       domestic manufacturing jobs. The bill will provide funding       for deployment of EV chargers along highway corridors to       facilitate long-distance travel and within communities to       provide convenient charging where people live, work, and       shop. Federal funding will have a particular focus on rural,       disadvantaged, and hard-to-reach communities.                                Electric Buses         American school buses play a critical role in expanding       access to education, but they are also a significant source       of pollution. The deal will deliver thousands of electric       school buses nationwide, including in rural communities,       helping school districts across the country buy clean,       American-made, zero emission buses, and replace the yellow       school bus fleet for America's children. The deal invests       $2.5 billion in zero emission buses, $2.5 billion in low       emission buses, and $2.5 billion for ferries. These       investments will drive demand for American-made batteries and       vehicles, creating jobs and supporting domestic       manufacturing, while also removing diesel buses from some of       our most vulnerable communities. In addition, they will help       the more than 25 million children and thousands of bus       drivers who breathe polluted air on their rides to and from       school. Diesel air pollution is linked to asthma and other       health problems that hurt our communities and cause students       to miss school, particularly in communities of color and       Tribal communities.                           Reconnecting Communities         Too often, past transportation investments divided       communities--like the Claiborne Expressway in New Orleans or       1-81 in Syracuse--or it left out the people most in need of       affordable transportation options. In particular, significant       portions of the interstate highway system were built through       Black neighborhoods. The deal creates a first-ever program to       reconnect communities divided by transportation       infrastructure. The program will fund planning, design,       demolition, and reconstruction of street grids, parks, or       other infrastructure through $1 billion of dedicated funding.                        Airports, Ports, and Waterways         The United States built modem aviation, but our airports       lag far behind our competitors. According to some rankings,       no U.S. airports rank in the top 25 of airports worldwide.       Our ports and waterways need repair and reimagination too.       The bill invests $17 billion in port infrastructure and $25       billion in airports to address repair and maintenance       backlogs, reduce congestion and emissions near ports and       airports, and drive electrification and other low-carbon       technologies. Modem, resilient, and sustainable p011,       airport, and freight infrastructure will support U.S.       competitiveness by removing bottlenecks and expediting       commerce and reduce the environmental impact on neighboring       communities.                 Resilience and Western Water Infrastructure         Millions of Americans feel the effects of climate change       each year when their roads wash out, airport power goes down,       or schools get flooded. Last year alone, the United States       faced 22 extreme weather and climate-related disaster events       with losses exceeding $1 billion each--a cumulative price tag       of nearly $100 billion. People of color are more likely to       live in areas most vulnerable to flooding and other climate       change-related weather events. The deal makes our communities       safer and our infrastructure more resilient to the impacts of       climate change and cyber attacks, with an investment of over       $50 billion. This includes funds to protect against droughts       and floods. in addition to a major investment in       weatherization. The bill is the largest investment in the       resilience of physical and natural systems in American       history.                             Clean Drinking Water         Currently, up to 10 million American households and 400,000       schools and child care centers lack safe drinking water. The       deal's $55 billion investment represents the largest       investment in clean drinking water in American history,       including dedicated funding to replace lead service lines and       the dangerous chemical PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl). It       will replace all of the nation's lead pipes and service       lines. From rural towns to struggling cities, the deal       invests in water infrastructure across America, including in       Tribal Nations and disadvantaged communities that need it       most.                             High Speed Internet         Broadband internet is necessary for Americans to do their       jobs, to participate equally in school learning, health care,       and to stay connected. Yet, by one definition, more than 30       million Americans live in areas where there is no broadband       infrastructure that provides minimally acceptable speeds--a       particular problem in rural communities throughout the       country. The deal's $65 billion investment ensures every       American has access to reliable high-speed internet with an       historic investment in broadband infrastructure deployment,       just as the federal government made a historic effort to       provide electricity to every American nearly one hundred       years ago.        The bill will also help lower prices for internet service       by requiring funding recipients to offer a low-cost       affordable plan, by creating price transparency and helping       families comparison shop, and by boosting competition in       areas where existing providers aren't providing adequate       service. It will also help close the digital divide by       passing the Digital Equity Act, ending digital redlining,       creating a permanent program to help more low-income       households access the internet, and establishing a new       program to help low-income households obtain the devices       required to access the internet.                          Environmental Remediation         In thousands of rural and urban communities around the       country, hundreds of thousands of former industrial and       energy sites are now idle--sources of blight and pollution.       26 percent of Black Americans and 29 percent of Hispanic       Americans live within 3 miles of a Superfund site, a higher       percentage than for Americans overall. Proximity to a       Superfund site can lead to elevated levels of lead in       children's blood. The deal invests $21 billion in       environmental remediation, making the largest investment in       addressing the legacy pollution that harms the public health       of communities and neighborhoods in American history,       creating good-paying union jobs in hard-hit energy       communities and advancing economic and environmental justice.       The bill includes funds to clean up superfund and brownfield       sites, reclaim abandoned mine land and cap orphaned gas       wells.                             Power Infrastructure         As the recent Texas power outages demonstrated, our aging       electric grid needs urgent modernization. A Department of       Energy study found that power outages cost the U.S. economy       up to $70 billion annually. The deal's $73 billion investment       is the single largest investment in clean energy transmission       in American history. It upgrades our power infrastructure,       including by building thousands of miles of new, resilient       transmission lines to facilitate the expansion of renewable       energy. It creates a new Grid Deployment Authority, invests       in research and development for advanced transmission and       electricity distribution technologies, and promotes smart       grid technologies that deliver flexibility and resilience. It       invests in demonstration projects and research hubs for next       generation technologies like advanced nuclear reactors,       carbon capture, and clean hydrogen.                                   Offsets         In the years ahead, the deal, which will generate       significant economic benefits, and it is financed through a       combination of redirecting unspent emergency relief funds,       targeted corporate user fees, strengthening tax enforcement       when it comes to crypto  [[Page H5449]]       currencies, and other bipartisan measures, in addition to the       revenue generated from higher economic growth as a result of       the investments.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Pallone), the chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Johnson), a member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen), a member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I was confused by the gentleman's speech. This bill was written by 10  Republican Senators and two conservative Democrats, and to say half the  bill isn't infrastructure, there is a $1 billion program to rejoin  communities split asunder.   The President went down and visited one in Louisiana. It is a skyway  that has to come down. It is falling apart. So are we just going to  build another skyway or are we going to rejoin that community?   In Portland, Oregon, they are talking about a freeway-widening  project there, but they are also going to cap that so they can rejoin a  neighborhood. That is infrastructure, and it is also creating community  jobs and economic development.    I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms. Bourdeaux), a  member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The gentleman who preceded me, of course, did not talk about what he  would do to fix the Nation's crumbling infrastructure:   42,000 bridges that need replacement or repair.   40 percent of the National Highway System degraded to the point where  it has to be rebedded, not just put a coat of asphalt on top.   A $100 billion backlog to bring transit up to a state of good repair.  On and on and on.   Wastewater, drinking water. The needs are incredible. This bill will  address those things.   And the rate of return is phenomenal, if you look at analyses by Wall  Street and others. There is no better investment that the Federal  Government can make than investment in infrastructure. It not only  creates jobs,  [[Page H5451]]  it creates lasting economic benefits for this country, makes us more  competitive with the world.   The gentleman is conflating two different bills. We have one bill  before us, not being held hostage. We are here debating it. But I  didn't hear your alternative.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.   The events that led up to this bill were pretty messy and painful; I  agree with that.   Unfortunately, given the dysfunction on the other side of the Hill,  called the Senate--absurd rules like the filibuster, where you have to  have a supermajority to do anything, and I don't know how many bills  the House has sent over that are sitting there that would serve the  American people well; and then the Byrd rule, which we are going deal  with later, a rule written by a Senator dead for 12 years, a rule  written 28 years ago where the Parliamentarian holds a seance to find  out what can go in and not go in the bill. That is what we are dealing  with.   If we are going to make the investments that we need in our  infrastructure--and I don't think there is anybody on the other side of  the aisle that disagrees, when you see the ratings from the American  Society of Civil Engineers, when you see the water mains blowing up and  flooding streets, when you see the sewers backing up into people's  houses or overflowing into the river or, without the resilience we need  because of climate change, have them getting overrun during severe  weather events.   These are investments that America needs, and I am still not hearing  from the other side of the aisle their plan to make these needed  investments, put millions of Americans to work in very good-paying  family wage jobs, and to make America more competitive.   Yes, I wish the Senate bill had been different. I wish, for instance,  they had taken our provisions to put some predatory Chinese companies  out of business. I don't know, I guess they have a very good lobbyist  over there on the Senate side.   There are many things like that that were neglected in this bill that  would have provided more American jobs. But there are millions of jobs  attached to this bill. We need those jobs. We need the investment. We  need to rebuild America.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining on  each side.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.   That was incredible. This is the Green New Deal bill? It includes  Rodney Davis' provision from the House side, which guts the NEPA  process. That is not exactly a Green New Deal priority.   It cut dramatically the investments in the House bill in transit and  rail, not exactly the Green New Deal priority.    That is absurd. You want to drag out this chimera. ``Oh, look, it is  the Green New Deal.'' No, it is not the Green New Deal. It is a bill  written by 10 Republican Senators and two conservative Democrats coming  from the Senate side, which is not, in my opinion, doing near enough to  address climate change impacts from fossil fuel transportation, our  largest contributor.   Now, of course, on your side of the aisle, climate change doesn't  exist. You want to have a bill for resilience. Why do you need  resilience? Why is the sea level rising? Why are we having incredible,  unprecedented severe weather events or like the heat dome in Oregon,  where people died?   Why are we having these things? ``Oh, it is a natural occurrence like  the Ice Age or whatever.'' It is not. It is real, and this bill does  not do enough to deal with it.   I intend to continue to fight to do more to deal with climate change,  no matter how much you want to deny it on that side of the aisle.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire about two things of the  Chair. How much time remains on either side, and since we are ending  the debate before we are finishing the debate, which side gets to  close?    Mr. Speaker, could you repeat that?    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.    There seems to be confusion on the other side of the aisle. I am  hearing a  [[Page H5453]]  lot of different numbers. There is one bill before us today. The  gentleman says it is not bipartisan. Eighteen Republican Senators voted  for it. Granted, neither of his illustrious Senators from his State  voted for it, but 18 Republican Senators did vote for it.   The numbers keep jumping around. We have one bill before us today,  not the other one you want to debate. We have one bill before us that  will build America's infrastructure, a long-overdue investment. We  haven't increased investment substantially since the Clinton era. It  has fallen apart. If you deny that, I have nothing more to say.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  We are going to close the debate for tonight and continue this debate  tomorrow. Perhaps Summit will come back to planet Earth.   Mr. Speaker, look, very simply, we are looking at a record investment  in our crumbling infrastructure. I will just repeat it one more time:  42,000 bridges on the national highway system in need of serious repair  or replacement; 40 percent of the National Highway System needs to be  rebedded--that is totally rebuilt. That is expensive, not just another  coat of asphalt on top, because it has been neglected for so long.   This is costing Americans every year a thousand bucks for car repair,  blown-out tires, misaligned front ends when they hit these potholes.   Americans want this done. Yeah, it is going to increase investment in  transit; $100 billion-dollar backlog to bring transit to a state of  good repair in this country.   We have the strongest Buy America requirements of any part of the  government. There were two potential problems with Chinese-owned  industries. Unfortunately, the Senate couldn't see their way to close  those. But the predominant amount of this money--and those loopholes  have already been partially closed from other legislation I put  through--will be spent on American jobs, American manufacturing made  here in the United States of America, another key part of the  President's proposal. Bring it home. Make it here. Rebuild our country.  To be continued.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
