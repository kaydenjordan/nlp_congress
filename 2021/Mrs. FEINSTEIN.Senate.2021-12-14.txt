 Mr. President, today, I am reintroducing legislation  that would help bolster the Nation's background check system for  firearms.   Under current law, the FBI is forced to remove records from  incomplete background checks from their systems if those checks are not  finalized within 90 days. As a result, many firearms are sold without  completed background checks--a dangerous practice that allows  individuals to access a firearm even if they are prohibited by law from  possessing such weapons.   In 2020, Americans purchased a record number of guns--over 23 million  firearms--and this year is expected to set records once again. That  record number of purchases is overwhelming our background check system.   The large majority of background checks are straightforward and are  completed within 3 days, but especially due to the volume of checks  required by the increase in gun purchases, some can take significantly  longer.   According to Everytown for Gun Safety, between March 2020 and July  2020, the FBI was unable to resolve 207,694 background checks within 90  days and was therefore required to wipe the incomplete checks from  their systems. Since these background checks were never completed, it  is impossible to know how many firearms were transferred to prohibited  purchasers.   As firearms sales continue to soar, Congress must act to protect  public safety by ensuring background checks are completed.   This bill would do exactly that. It would allow the FBI to maintain  gun purchase records until the background checks is completed. It would  also require the FBI to query additional relevant databases as part of  a firearm-related background check. This would guarantee that the  information necessary for conducting effective firearm background  checks is maintained.   I thank Senators Blumenthal, Booker, Brown, Menendez, Murphy,  Padilla, and Whitehouse for their support and urge the rest of my  colleagues to support the bill as well.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today, I am reintroducing legislation  that would help bolster the Nation's background check system for  firearms.
