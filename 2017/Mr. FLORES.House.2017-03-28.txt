 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I thank the gentlewoman for yielding the balance of her time to me.   Mr. Speaker, as an original cosponsor of the House companion to S.J.  Res. 34, I rise to strongly urge my colleagues to support the  resolution before us today. Like all of my colleagues in the House, I  care deeply about protecting the privacy of our constituents, but I  cannot support the Federal Communications Commission's  counterproductive rules that will actually harm consumers and stifle  innovation.   For 20 years, the Federal Trade Commission--or the FTC, as we call  it, frequently--oversaw consumer privacy for the entire internet  ecosystem: content providers, advertisers, and internet service  providers, or ISPs. The FTC's privacy program focused on preserving  sensitive consumer data and took the context of a consumer's  relationship with businesses into consideration. The FTC's experience  in implementing a wide range of rules and regulations has resulted in  over 500 cases protecting consumer information, ensuring their privacy  online.   In a flawed political move, absent any finding, complaints, or  investigations to determine whether broadband providers have violated  consumers' privacy or that the FTC had failed at doing its job, the FCC  proceeded with a partisan vote to target ISPs and to expand its  regulatory footprint.   After stripping the FTC of its authority over the privacy practices  of internet service providers, the FCC subsequently adopted rules that  would harm consumers and split the internet, creating an uneven playing  field between service providers and content providers. Congress must  fix this overreach so the new administration can create a  comprehensive, consistent set of privacy protections.                                time  1615    Consumers expect their privacy to be protected the same way no matter  what type of entity holds their data. Having two sets of requirements  creates confusion for consumers and may jeopardize their confidence in  the internet.   Our internet economy has thrived under the privacy regime created by  the FTC. Yet the FCC, under its previous Chairman, Tom Wheeler, wanted  to undermine that success by bifurcating privacy protections to serve  outside political interests, not the American consumer.   By contrast, the FCC's approach did not base its requirements on  consumers' preferences about sensitive information and to set opt-in  and opt-out defaults. Accordingly, its overall approach was top-down,  heavyhanded regulation in stark contrast to the FTC's greater reliance  on markets and consumer preferences.   The FCC's rule has a number of problematic issues:   The first is that the opt-in/opt-out regime reduces consumer choice  and would be detrimental to the survival of many businesses in this  country.   The second is that the FCC would have prohibited unforeseeable future  uses of collected data regardless of what consumers actually preferred  and businesses may need.   Third, the FCC would also have unjustly applied its heavyhanded  approach to broadband providers, treating them more harshly than other  players in the internet ecosystem.   In sum, the FCC's broadband privacy protection approach would have  rejected free markets and ignored sound economics.   Alternatively, the FTC private enforcement is market oriented and  flexible and adaptable to changes in consumer preferences and markets.  It also treats companies and players neutrally, fostering an  environment of competition and innovation.   This resolution rescinds the FCC's rule, but it does provide the FCC  the opportunity to provide oversight more in line with the FTC, which  has been successfully regulating online privacy for nearly two decades.   This joint resolution does not lessen or impede privacy and data  security standards that have already been established. We are simply  restoring a more stable regulatory playing field to ensure that  consistent, uniform privacy security standards are maintained to  protect consumers and future innovation.   Once Congress rejects these rules, the FCC can turn back to  cooperating with  [[Page H2494]]  the FTC to ensure that both consumer privacy across all aspects of the  internet is provided through vigorous enforcement and also that  innovation is allowed to flourish.   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I would just  remind my colleague, once again, that the FTC has no authority to  regulate ISPs once this bill is implemented; and consumers will not be  protected, and their current FCC Commissioner has stated that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Colorado  (Ms. DeGette).   Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I oppose this resolution because it would  remove consumers' right to control their online privacy and put it in  the hands of corporations.   Every time people go online, they create trails of data that have  tremendous commercial value. This creates incentive for the ISPs to  sell web history to a third party, be it an advocacy group, a for- profit company, or even a foreign government.   Late last year, the FCC put Americans in charge of how ISPs use and  share their consumer data. The FCC's rule also required that the ISPs  engage in reasonable data security practices.   Even if people believe that the FCC's rule went too far and should be  modified, it is unclear how the FCC could move forward with such a plan  given the constraints of the Congressional Review Act. Furthermore, as  several people have mentioned, the FCC, which is charged with  protecting consumers' privacy, does not even have the authority to  oversee ISP practices.   Given the number of data breaches in recent years at companies such  as Yahoo, we should, frankly, be strengthening data retention  requirements, not weakening them. At its core, S.J. Res. 34 weakens  consumer protections today and makes them harder to implement in the  future, which is why I urge my colleagues to oppose it.

Mr. Speaker, we are thinking that the gentleman's  comments do not pertain to this resolution, that this resolution in no  way is going to allow any of the activities that were described,  whether it is cuddling or anything that is going to get in the way of  any of that or allowed to be sold.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Collins).   Mr. COLLINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the  people who worked to make this legislation a reality. As we become  increasingly concerned with cyber threats, online privacy is a critical  concern for every American.   Unfortunately, in October of last year, the FCC issued regulations  titled, ``Protecting the Privacy of Customers of Broadband and Other  Telecommunications Services,'' also known as broadband privacy rules.  These titles do not actually accurately reflect the impact these  regulations are having on constituents' electronic privacy.   These broadband privacy rules took internet service providers, ISPs,  which you subscribe to for TV and internet access, and edge providers  that deliver online applications, services, and website content, and  separated them into two different groups. This has caused confusion  among businesses trying to adhere to this change.   While writing this regulation, the FCC had the opportunity to employ  FTC precedent in drafting the broadband privacy rules, but instead  chose to ignore existing precedent and create additional and onerous  regulations. The FCC believed that these new rules would give consumers  more choice and heightened transparency; however, this has not been the  case.   This legislation does not remove privacy protections for consumers,  and it does not expose consumer information. Both the FCC and the FTC  will retain authority over consumer privacy on a case-by-case basis.  ISPs will continue to be subject to the Communications Act of 1934,  which protects all consumer proprietary network information. This is in  addition to the many other existing Federal and State privacy rules  that ISPs must continue to follow.   This proposed system, separating edge providers from ISPs, creates  confusion for both consumers and business operations. This legislation  works to reduce the confusion that has been created from this  unnecessary regulation that has stifled competition and impeded  innovation. I am happy to support this legislation which will provide  much-needed clarity to the ongoing debate.   Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how  much time remains on both sides?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 5\1/4\  minutes remaining. The gentleman from Texas has 2 minutes remaining.    Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I just remind my  friend, you can say it as many times as you want, but the fact of the  matter is that, under current law, the FTC has no authority to regulate  the FCC, and the FCC Commissioner has said that you cannot do this  without a rule in section 222.

Mr. Speaker, I include in the  Record letters from a coalition of small ISPs, a coalition of civil  rights organizations, the Consumers Union, and an article by Terrell  McSweeny all opposing this CRA.

Dear U.S. Representatives: We, the undersigned founders,       executives, and employees of ISPs and networking companies,       spend our working lives ensuring that Americans have high-      quality, fast, reliable, and locally provided choices       available when they need to connect to the Internet. One of       the cornerstones of our businesses is respecting the privacy       of our customers, and it is for that primary reason that we       are writing to you today.        We urge Congress to preserve the FCC's Broadband Privacy       Rules and vote down plans to abolish them. If the rules are       repealed, large ISPs across America would resume spying on       their customers, selling their data, and denying them a       practical and informed choice in the matter.        Perhaps if there were a healthy, free, transparent, and       competitive market for Internet services in this country,       consumers could choose not to use those companies' products.       But small ISPs like ours face many structural obstacles, and       many Americans have very limited choices: a monopoly or       duopoly on the wireline side, and a highly consolidated       cellular market dominated by the same wireline firms.        Under those circumstances, the FCC's Broadband Privacy       Rules are the only way that most Americans will retain the       free market choice to browse the Web without being surveilled       by the company they pay for an Internet connection.

Hon. Paul D. Ryan,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles Schumer,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan, Senator McConnell, Representative       Pelosi, and Senator Schumer: The undersigned media justice,       consumer protection, civil liberties, and privacy groups       strongly urge you to oppose the use of the Congressional       Review Act (CRA) to adopt a Resolution of Disapproval       overturning the FCC's broadband privacy order. That order       implements the mandates in Section 222 of the 1996       Telecommunications Act, which an overwhelming, bipartisan       majority of Congress enacted to protect telecommunications       users' privacy. The cable, telecom, wireless, and advertising       lobbies request for CRA intervention is just another industry       attempt to overturn rules that empower users and give them a       say in how their private information may be used.        Not satisfied with trying to appeal the rules of the       agency, industry lobbyists have asked Congress to punish       internet users by way of restraining the FCC, when all the       agency did was implement Congress' own directive in the 1996       Act. This irresponsible, scorched-earth tactic is as harmful       as it is hypocritical. If Congress were to take the industry       up on its request, a Resolution of Disapproval could exempt       intemet service providers (ISPs) from any and all privacy       rules at the FCC. As you know, a successful CRA on the       privacy rules could preclude the FCC from promulgating any       ``substantially similar'' regulations in the future--in       direct conflict with Congress' clear intention in Section 222       that telecommunications carriers protect their customers'       privacy. It could also preclude the FCC from addressing any       of the other issues in the privacy order like requiring data       breach notification and from revisiting these issues as       technology continues to evolve in the future. The true       consequences of this revoked authority are apparent when       considering the ISPs' other efforts to undermine the rules.       Without these rules, ISPs could use and disclose customer       information at will. The result could be extensive harm       caused by breaches or misuse of data.        Broadband ISPs, by virtue of their position as gatekeepers       to everything on the intemet, have a largely unencumbered       view into their customers' online communications. That       includes the websites they visit, the videos they watch, and       the messages they send. Even when that traffic is encrypted,       ISPs can gather vast troves of valuable information on their       users' habits; but researchers have shown that much of the       most sensitive information remains unencrypted.        The FCC's order simply restores people's control over their       personal information and lets them choose the terms on which       ISPs can use it, share it, or sell it. Americans are       increasingly concerned about their privacy, and in some cases       have begun to censor their online activity for fear their       personal information may be compromised. Consumers have       repeatedly expressed their desire for more privacy       protections and their belief that the government helps ensure       those protections are met. The FCC's rules give broadband       customers confidence that their privacy and choices will be       honored, but it does not in any way ban ISPs' ability to       market to users who opt-in to receive any such targeted       offers.        The ISPs' overreaction to the FCC's broadband privacy rules       has been remarkable. Their supposed concerns about the rule       are significantly overblown. Some broadband providers and       trade associations inaccurately suggest that this rule is a       full ban on data use and disclosure by ISPs, and from there       complain that it will hamstring ISPs' ability to compete with       other large advertising companies and platforms like Google       and Facebook. To the contrary, ISPs can and likely will       continue to be able to benefit from use and sharing of their       customers' data, so long as those customers consent to such       uses. The rules merely require the ISPs to obtain that       informed consent.        The ISPs and their trade associations already have several       petitions for reconsideration of the privacy rules before the       FCC. Their petitions argue that the FCC should either adopt a       ``Federal Trade Commission style'' approach to broadband       privacy, or that it should retreat from the field and its       statutory duty in favor of the Federal Trade Commission       itself All of these suggestions are fatally flawed. Not only       is the FCC well positioned to continue in its statutorily       mandated role as the privacy watchdog for broadband telecom       customers, it is the only agency able to do so. As the 9th       Circuit recently decided in a case brought by AT&T, common       carriers are entirely exempt from FTC jurisdiction, meaning       that presently there is no privacy replacement for broadband       customers waiting at the FTC if Congress disapproves the       FCC's rules here.        This lays bare the true intent of these industry groups,       who also went to the FCC asking for fine-tuning and       reconsideration of the rules before they sent their CRA       request. These groups now ask Congress to create a vacuum and       to give ISPs carte blanche, with no privacy rules or       enforcement in place. Without clear rules of the road under       Section 222, broadband users will have no certainty about how       their private information can be used and no protection       against its abuse. ISPs could and would use and disclose       consumer information at will, leading to extensive harm       caused by breaches and by misuse of data properly belonging       to consumers.        Congress told the FCC in 1996 to ensure that       telecommunications carriers protect the information they       collect about their customers. Industry groups now ask       Congress to ignore the mandates in the Communications Act,       enacted with strong bipartisan support, and overturn the       FCC's attempts to implement Congress's word. The CRA is a       blunt instrument and it is inappropriate in this instance,       where rules clearly benefit internet users notwithstanding       ISPs' disagreement with them.        We strongly urge you to oppose any resolution of       disapproval that would overturn the FCC's broadband privacy       rule.

House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: Consumers Union, the policy and       mobilization arm of Consumer  [[Page H2500]]       Reports, writes regarding House consideration of S.J. Res.       34, approved by a 50-48 party line vote in the Senate last       week.        This resolution, if passed by the House and signed into law       by President, would use the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to       nullify the Federal Communication Commission's (FCC) newly-      enacted broadband privacy rules that give consumers better       control over their data. Many Senators cited ``consumer       confusion'' as a reason to do away with the FCC's privacy       rules, but we have seen no evidence proving this assertion       and fail to understand how taking away increased privacy       protections eliminates confusion. Therefore, we strongly       oppose passage of this resolution--it would strip consumers       of their privacy rights and, as we explain below, leave them       with no protections at all. We urge you to vote no on S.J.       Res. 34.        The FCC made history last October when it adopted consumer-      friendly privacy rules that give consumers more control over       how their information is collected by internet service       providers (ISPs). Said another way, these rules permit       consumers to decide when an ISP can collect a treasure trove       of consumer information, whether it is a web browsing history       or the apps a consumer may have on a smartphone. We believe       the rules are simple, reasonable, and straightforward.        ISPs, by virtue of their position as gatekeepers to       everything on the internet, enjoy a unique window into       consumers' online activities. Data including websites       consumers visit, videos viewed, and messages sent is very       valuable. Small wonder, then, that ISPs are working so hard       to have the FCC's new privacy rules thrown out through use of       the Congressional Review Act. But we should make no mistake:       abandoning the FCC's new privacy rules is about what benefits       big cable companies and not about what is best for consumers.        Many argue the FCC should have the same privacy rules as       those of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). FCC Chairman       Ajit Pai went so far as to say ``jurisdiction over broadband       providers' privacy and data security practices should be       returned to the FTC, the nation's expert agency with respect       to these important subjects,'' even though the FTC currently       possesses no jurisdiction over the vast majority of ISPs       thanks to the common carrier exemption--an exemption made       stricter by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in last year's       AT&T Mobility case. We have heard this flawed logic time and       time again as one of the principal arguments for getting rid       of the FCC's strong privacy rules. Unfortunately, this is       such a poor solution that it amounts to no solution at all.        For the FTC to regain jurisdiction over the privacy       practices of ISPs, the FCC would first have to scrap Title II       reclassification--not an easy task which would be both time-      consuming and subject to judicial review, and jeopardize the       legal grounding of the 2015 Open Internet Order. Congress, in       turn, would have to pass legislation to remove the common       carrier exemption, thus granting the FTC jurisdiction over       those ISPs who are common carriers. We are skeptical Congress       would take such an action. Finally, the FTC does not enjoy       the same robust rulemaking authority that the FCC does. As a       result, consumers would have to wait for something bad to       happen before the FTC would step in to remedy a violation of       privacy rights. Any fondness for the FTC's approach to       privacy is merely support for dramatically weaker privacy       protections favored by most corporations.        There is no question that consumers favor the FCC's current       broadband privacy rules. Consumers Union launched an online       petition drive last month in support of the Commission's       strong rules. To date, close to 50,000 consumers have signed       the petition and the number is growing. Last week, more than       24,000 consumers contacted their Senators urging them to       oppose the CRA resolution in the 24 hours leading up to the       vote. Consumers care about privacy and want the strong       privacy protections afforded to the them by the FCC. Any       removal or watering down of those rules would represent the       destruction of simple privacy protections for consumers.        Even worse, if this resolution is passed, using the       Congressional Review Act here will prevent the FCC from       adopting privacy rules--even weaker ones--to protect       consumers in the future. Under the CRA, once a ride is       erased, an agency cannot move forward with any       ``substantially similar'' rule unless Congress enacts new       legislation specifically authorizing it. Among other impacts,       this means a bare majority in the Senate can void a rule, but       then restoration of that rule is subject to full legislative       process, including a filibuster. The CRA is a blunt       instrument--and if used in this context, blatantly anti-      consumer.        We are more than willing to work with you and your fellow       Representatives to craft privacy legislation that affords       consumer effective and easy-to-understand protections. The       FCC made a step in that direction when it adopted the       broadband privacy rules last year, and getting rid of them       via the Congressional Review Act is a step back, not forward.       Therefore, we encourage you to vote no on S.J. Res. 34.            Respectfully,      Laura MacCleery,        Vice President, Consumer Policy & Mobilization, Consumer       Reports.

Jonathan Schwantes,        Senior Policy Counsel, Consumers Union.                                   ____                       [From wired.com, Mar. 22, 2017]             Congress Is About To Give Away Your Online Privacy                 (By Terrell McSweeney and Chris Hoofnagle)         The resolution that could come to a Congressional vote this       week aims to tackle differences in how the FCC rule treats       ISPs compared with other internet companies. Your broadband       provider has to offer you a choice about what information it       shares about you, but ecommerce sites and search engines do       not.        Advocates for repealing the current protections--the       resolution is sponsored by Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ)--argue       that Congress should void the FCC's rule using the       Congressional Review Act. They contend that in order to       properly govern privacy and avoid confusing consumers, the       FCC should maintain consistent rules across the internet       ecosystem. But inconsistent standards pervade privacy and       consumer law. Furthermore, consistent standards militate in       favor of increasing protections for privacy, rather than       unraveling them as the current proposal would do.        An alphabet soup of state and federal laws set the privacy       requirements for everything from our financial information to       data about our children. That's largely because privacy is       both essential to and sometimes in conflict with our most       deeply held value, liberty. So, legislators have never been       able to craft omnibus privacy protections. Instead, they've       developed frameworks informed by prevailing norms,       incentives, political economy, and ways the information might       be used.        As we connect more devices in our home and on our bodies,       the array of technologies that raise data privacy and       security concerns is expanding. The privacy landscape will       likely continue to be shaped as technologies evolve.        Different consumer technologies may justify different       approaches. For example, the safety issues inherent in cars       and medical devices may warrant particularly strong privacy       and security protections. In the future, privacy rules could       come from the FCC as well as the Department of Commerce,       National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Food and Drug       Administration, and other agencies.        Consider that your bank can--and probably does--sell your       contact and financial information unless you opt out. Yet if       you rent a movie, online or off, the rental service can't       sell information about your media consumption without your       consent, and it must delete your rental history after it's no       longer needed. Congress enacted those protections to shield       intellectual freedom, so that one can enjoy controversial       movies without fear of one's curiosity resulting in extortion       or embarrassment.        This brings us to our second point: If consistency and       reducing consumer confusion is the goal, consumers should       demand stronger internet privacy norms. Given the animating       purpose of protecting movie rental information, why not       require consumers to consent to the sharing any information       about their online behavior? After all, our web activity is       the ultimate manifestation of our intellectual curiosity,       representing second-by-second decisions about consuming news       and entertainment.        In addition to existing federal laws, legislators could, as       professor Helen Nissenbaum has suggested, look to offline       contexts, such as the strong privacy norms governing       searching for a book in a library, to guide the privacy rules       we ought to enjoy when using a search engine. The government       also could take a page from the confidentiality standards       patients enjoy when conversing with physicians and apply       those same norms to medical information websites.       Policymakers could look to the last two centuries of privacy       in the postal mail to guide rules for commercial scanning of       email. Yet in all these contexts, web business models drive       design decisions that have turned social and personal       behaviors into marketplace transactions.        Left standing, the FCC rule offers an opportunity for a       meaningful debate about how to better translate our analog       privacy norms into the digital world. Broadband ISPs are       essentially utilities, like postal mail and the telephone.       Subscribers have little or no competitive choice as to which       provider to use. ISPs know our identities, and their position       gives them the technical capacity to surveil users in ways       that others cannot. It makes sense to ensure consumers can       choose whether to share data related to their Internet usage.        The majority of consumers--91 percent in a recent survey--      feel they've lost control of their personal information. Yet,       paradoxically, the late, great privacy researcher and       historian Alan Westin consistently found that Americans       expect companies to handle personal data in a       ``confidential'' way. In reality, the modern internet is like       a one-way mirror, where users are often unaware that they are       being silently watched by third parties. The FCC rule exposes       this one-way mirror and allows people to decide whether to       draw a curtain on it.        Maintaining the current rules would make ISP practices more       consistent with consumers' expectations of confidentiality.       Congress should spend time examining the  [[Page H2501]]       strengths and weaknesses of our current approach, instead of       using consistency arguments to eviscerate the FCC's rule.    Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute  to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lofgren), my colleague from the  class of '94.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.   Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I ask my  colleagues to vote against this horrible resolution, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.   Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I ask my  colleagues to vote against this horrible resolution, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   We have heard a lot of interesting claims today in the discussion  about this fairly simple resolution to roll back overreaching  regulation from the FCC that were passed late in the Obama  administration's time.   I would remind everybody, Mr. Speaker, that this CRA has nothing to  do with the President's tax return, it has nothing to do with Russian  hacking, and there have been some gross mischaracterizations of what  this resolution does.   Why do we need this resolution?   The three reasons are, as Chairwoman Blackburn opened up at the  beginning:   First of all, the FCC swiped jurisdiction from the FTC.   Second, two cops on the beat create confusion among consumers and  among the ISP providers.   Third, the FTC already has jurisdiction over this space.   Let me close with this: this resolution of disapproval only rescinds  the FCC's rule, but it still provides the FCC the opportunity to  provide more oversight more in line with the Federal Trade Commission,  which has successfully been regulating online privacy for nearly 2  decades.   This resolution does not lessen or impede the privacy and data  security standards that we already have established. We are simply  restoring a more stable regulatory playing field to ensure that  consistent uniform privacy standards are maintained to protect  consumers and future innovation.   Once Congress rejects these rules, the FCC can turn back to  cooperating with the FTC to ensure both the consumer privacy across all  aspects of the internet is protected through vigorous enforcement and  that innovation is allowed to flourish.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this commonsense resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.
