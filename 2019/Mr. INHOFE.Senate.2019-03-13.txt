 Mr. President, just like last year, I remain deeply  concerned about the humanitarian situation in Yemen, as well as the  erratic behavior of Saudi Arabia's leadership. We have all suffered  through that.   However, I oppose the resolution brought forth by Senators Lee,  Murphy, and Sanders, which, if implemented, would end all security  cooperation with our partners in Yemen against the Houthis.   First of all, we are not engaged in hostilities in Yemen against the  Houthis, and here is what we are doing in Yemen: We are providing  intelligence support that helps construct no-strike lists that enable  humanitarian efforts and protect humanitarian aid workers.   Some of these workers are workers we are very close to--our allies.  Our intelligence support is also vital to assisting our partners in  defending themselves against the Iranian-supported ballistic missile  attacks.   It is important to emphasize that our partners are the tip of the  spear, not us. Beyond this, our security cooperation provides leverage  that we have used with the Saudi-led coalition to advance peace  negotiations.   If we pull that support, here is what we can expect: Israel loses,  Iran wins, and the humanitarian situation will get worse. I think we  all understand that.   Our partners will be less capable to confront the lethal ballistic  missile threat, and peace efforts will lose a vital line of support.  Moreover, if a ballistic missile hits a population center and kills  Americans because we, due to the resolution, withheld intelligence, it  would be unforgiveable. That is why I introduced an amendment to  specifically protect our civilian population.   In closing, the vote is not about whether we approve of Saudi  Arabia's behavior; I don't. It is about whether we will use our  leverage with the Saudi-led coalition to ensure humanitarian access and  promote peace, and, more fundamentally, it is about whether we take  seriously our responsibility to keep Americans safe. That is really  what this is all about. It merely includes that we would eliminate the  threats to civilian population centers in coalition countries,  including locations where citizens and nationals of the United States  reside. I can't imagine anyone would be opposed to that.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Will the Senator yield for a parliamentary inquiry?    It was my understanding that before the vote on my  amendment, I would be recognized prior to the vote for 1 minute or so.  Is that correct?    Mr. President, we have heard a lot of controversy about  this. I think the main thing for me at this late hour in relation to  use of force--ours is not that type of activity there. We are on the  outside. We are providing intelligence. We are not the tip of the  spear. We are not the inductee in that type of action.   I would just say that if they are successful in their efforts, then  the loser would be Israel. Iran would be the winner, and the  humanitarian situation would be worse. I think most of us understand  that.   The amendment we are talking about right now is merely an amendment  that would put us in a position where, if a ballistic missile or cruise  missile or UAV hits a population center and kills Americans, because  we, due to the resolution, withheld intelligence, it would be  unforgiveable. I think we all understand that. American lives could be  lost.   That is why I introduced an amendment to specifically protect  civilian populations. I am talking about not just other countries but  our civilian population. We all know the exposure is there, and this  would take that exposure away.                               Motion to Table
