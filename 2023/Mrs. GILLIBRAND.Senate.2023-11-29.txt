 Madam President, I am here once again to highlight  the stories of the people who have been and continue to be held hostage  by Hamas. I am so happy to hear that several of our hostages, whose  families I have worked with, have been finally returned. They include:  4-year-old Abigail Mor Edan, whose parents were both murdered in front  of her eyes and who now faces the horrible process of healing from the  many traumas she underwent; Danielle Aloni and her 5-year-old daughter  Emilia. They had been visiting Danielle's sister Sharon, her brother- in-law David, and their 3-year-old twins Emma and Julie on the day of  the attack, when all of them were taken captive. Sharon, Emma, and  Julie have also just been released, but David still remains in  captivity.   I am so grateful that members of another family I have worked with  have also been released. They include 67-year-old mother Shoshan,  sister Adi, Adi's two young children Naveh and Yahel, Aunt Sharon, and  Sharon's 12-year-old daughter Noam.   It has been heartening to see these families reunited with their  loved ones, to see the joy and the indescribable relief, and I am  grateful to the Biden administration for making these reunions  possible. But, of course, many, many more people still remain in  captivity, including Emma and Julie's father, David, and Naveh and  Yahel's father, Tal.   These families have already endured the worst traumas imaginable, and  yet now they have still been ripped apart, with no idea when they will  see their fathers and brothers and sons again. Tal is a 38-year-old who  reads a lot and loves to explore new topics as well as exercise and  play sports. He and his family like to travel in the desert areas in  southern Israel and spend time near the Sea of Galilee.   David is a talented 33-year-old actor who lived with his family in  Nir Oz. He and his family woke up on the morning of October 7 to the  sound of bombs and sought refuge in their home's bomb shelter. But when  Hamas set fire to their house, the shelter filled with smoke and forced  them out to meet the terrorists.   His American family last saw him in a video shared by Hamas where he  can be seen in the back of a truck with Sharon and one of the twins. A  survivor who was able to escape says she spoke briefly with him and  that he said to her:         I know that I left the safe room with two babies, and now I       have only one.    I can only imagine what it must be like for him now to have both of  his babies ripped away.   These two families, these fathers, don't deserve to be separated from  their families. They don't deserve to be kept in horrific conditions,  potentially with little food.   As joyful as it has been to see some of the hostages reunited with  their families, we must not stop pushing for the release of all the  remaining hostages. I will continue to work with their families and  with the Biden administration to advocate for these individuals, and I  will not rest until we get every hostage, including the nine Americans,  home.   I yield the floor.
