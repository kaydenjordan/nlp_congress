 Mr. President, I rise in celebration of Public Service  Recognition Week, a time to honor public servants at all levels of  government for their dedication and outstanding service to this Nation.  Since 2010, I have taken to the Senate floor to honor our particularly  noteworthy government employees--a tradition that was first begun by my  good friend Senator Ted Kaufman.   Today and during this week, I would like to continue this tradition  by highlighting the contributions of three Virginians who have worked  tirelessly to improve the functioning of our government and advance  America's interests at home and abroad.
