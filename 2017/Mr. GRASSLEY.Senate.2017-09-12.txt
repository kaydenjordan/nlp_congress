 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today to question  the plan for auditing the Department of Defense. The new Chief  Financial Officer, Mr. David Norquist, presented a plan to the Armed  Services Committee on May 9. It appears flawed, like a lot of other  such plans. The Department  [[Page S5204]]  may be audit ready by the September 30 deadline, but the goal--and the  goal ought to be a clean opinion--isn't in the mix. In its place, we  get another lame excuse: ``I recognize it will take time to go from  being audited to passing an audit.''   We have heard this story over and over for 26 years. When will it  come to an end?   I don't think the Pentagon has a clue if the Department is truly  audit ready. Then, why is the Chief Financial Officer predicting  failure before the audit even starts?   Doubletalk is necessary to accomplish that goal. A monster is lurking  in the weeds, and nobody wants to talk about it. It is the ``deal- breakers.'' That is a term that is often used in audit reports. They  are red-flagged accounting issues listed in Department of Defense  reports for years and years. They are prefaced by this warning: ``The  deal-breakers prevent clean opinions.''   If Mr. Norquist wants to win this war, he had better get on top of  the ``deal-breakers.'' But he ignored them in testimony, focusing  instead on this apparent distraction: DOD has spent too much time  ``preparing for full-scope audit without starting it.''   We need to pinpoint ``vulnerabilities''--those are his words, and he  went on--``to drive change to a clean opinion.'' Suggesting that the  Department of Defense lags behind on audit starts or needs more audits  to spot weaknesses seems very wrongheaded. The Department has conducted  nonstop audits since 1991--294 financial audits, to be exact--and 90  percent were failures, but a few were full-scope audits with clean  opinions. Together, the Corps of Engineers and the Military Retirement  Fund earned 28 clean opinions out of 43 starts. In the case of the  Corps of Engineers, auditors relied on unorthodox procedures known as  ``manual workarounds'' or ``audit trail reconstruction work.'' Highly  paid auditors scramble around searching for missing records. These  procedures work on small jobs, but the point is that they are an  inefficient substitute for a modern accounting system.   Now, I have talked about small jobs. To the contrary, on big jobs  this approach is a nonstarter. Yet, that is exactly where Mr. Norquist  intends to go--the toughest, the unauditable: the Army, the Navy, the  Marine Corps, the Air Force, and the rest of the Defense Department.  This is where auditing hits the wall--over 200 starts without a  successful finish.   If these audits begin before the accounting house is in order, the  Norquist plan may be swallowed up by the swamp. The destructive power  of the deal-breakers was hammered home by the most important audit so  far--the Marine Corps audit. Their impact was exposed in a first-rate  report issued by the Government Accountability Office. I spoke at  length about that report on the Marines on August 4, 2015. Today, I  will touch on it just briefly. This background is very, very important.   Back in September 2008, the Marine Corps, the smallest of the big  ones, stepped up to the plate. The Marine Corps boldly declared that it  was audit ready. As a pilot project, the Marine Corps would lead the  way. High hopes for a breakthrough were not to be. Ten years and five  audits later, the Marine Corps is still stuck on square one. The  inspector general and the Government Accountability Office determined  that it was never ready for audit. It failed for the same reasons as  all the other audits failed, going back to the term ``deal breakers.''   To make matters worse, there was an attempt to cover up these  shortcomings. Initially, a clean opinion was issued. The then-Secretary  of Defense, Chuck Hagel, gave the Marine Corps an award for being the  first service to earn a clean opinion. The opinion did not stand up to  scrutiny. The evidence did not meet ``professional auditing  standards.'' So the inspector general had to withdraw, leaving Mr.  Hagel with egg all over his face.   The deputy inspector general for audit was removed and reassigned,  and the accounting firm involved lost the contract to Kearney &  Company, where the now Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Norquist, was a  partner.   Without strong leadership, the Marine Corps could be the Norquist  template. This is where we have been before: audit ready but light  years away from a clean opinion. So that takes you to nowheresville.  Why go there when you know what you are going to find? Although lessons  were learned, the end result was mostly waste--$32 million for five  premature audits. DOD is big, big business for these auditing firms,  and what do we get? No clean opinion.   The deal-breakers, which doomed the Marine Corps audit and all the  others, are alive and well. They are still driving the freight train  with no fix in sight. Yet, in spite of these formidable barriers, the  Marine Corps is once again shooting for the moon. It jumped out in  front of all the other military services by starting a full financial  audit, which the press calls a ``mammoth task.'' Why would the outcome  be any different this time around, when we just exposed within the last  2 years that what they thought was a clean audit was not such a clean  audit.   The government's expert on accounting--and I call him the expert on  government accounting because he is Comptroller General Gene Dodaro-- understands the dilemma. The $10 billion spent annually on fixing the  accounting system, he says, ``has not yielded positive results.'' Money  is being spent in the wrong places. Mr. Dodaro wonders if the  Department of Defense has the talent to get it right, and that is his  word--``talent.''   With his plan resting on shaky ground, Mr. Norquist may need to shift  gears. For starters, the cost of the full financial audits, which are  touted as the largest ever undertaken, could top $200 million. Spending  so much money on audits doomed to failure would be a gross waste of tax  dollars.   Now, I am not suggesting that Mr. Norquist back off. Mr. Norquist  just needs to get a handle on the root cause of the problem, and the  feeder systems are that root cause. As a main source of unreliable  transaction data, the feeder systems are the driver behind the deal- breakers. Fix them, and then the rest should be just a piece of cake.   Department of Defense reports have repeatedly called for ``testing  the feeder systems.'' However, according to the Government  Accountability Office, those tests were never, never performed.    So the aggressive testing and aggressive verification of transactions  are the right places to start. Senators Johnson, Ernst, Paul, and this  Senator are sponsoring an amendment to make that happen.   Once all of the tricky technical issues are ironed out and testing  provides confidence that the system is reliable, the plan will gel.  Audit readiness will be self-evident, not contrived. Full financial  accounting could begin. Clean opinions should follow, and those clean  opinions should be our goal.   There has been 26 years of hard-core foot-dragging that shows that  internal resistance to auditing the books runs very, very deep. It will  take strong, confident leadership and strong determination to root out  that internal resistance to auditing the books. I am counting on  Secretary Mattis and Chief Financial Officer Norquist to get the job  done in the shortest time possible.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, the IRS has never been, and likely will  never be, an agency anyone is glad to hear from.   However, American taxpayers should at least have confidence that they  will receive a fair shake from the agency. Without this, our system of  taxation that relies on voluntary reporting of income will fall apart.   In recent years, gross mismanagement and inappropriate actions by  certain IRS employees have shaken what confidence taxpayers have had in  the agency.   Today, Senator Thune and I are reintroducing legislation we  introduced last Congress aimed at ensuring that appropriate safeguards  are in place to protect taxpayer rights by preventing IRS abuses.   Called the Taxpayer Bill of Rights Enhancement Act (TBORE), our bill  updates and strengthens several provisions enacted in prior Taxpayer  Bill of Rights legislation.   I am pleased that several of the provisions in last Congress' version  of the bill were enacted into law, including codifying the Taxpayer  Bill of Rights.   However, more must be done if we are going to renew the taxpaying  public's confidence in the IRS.   No legislation is likely to fix all of the IRS recent shortcomings on  its own. There is a need for a change of culture within the IRS.   We hope our bill will serve as a catalyst for a cultural shift within  the IRS. Our bill sends a clear message to the IRS--Congress is not  going to tolerate poor service and the systematic abuse of taxpayer  rights.   We look forward to working with our colleagues toward reforming the  IRS and protecting taxpayer rights.                                  ______                                         By Mr VAN HOLLEN (for himself, Mr. Schatz, and Mr. Booker):   S. 1798. A bill to establish a Federal standard in order to improve  the Nation's resilience to current and future flood risk; to the  Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.
