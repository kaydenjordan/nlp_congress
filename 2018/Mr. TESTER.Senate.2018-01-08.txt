 Mr. President, I was necessarily absent due to a  flight cancellation out of my control when the Senate voted on the  motion to invoke cloture on Executive Calendar No. 370.   On this vote, had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on the  motion to invoke cloture on Executive Calendar No. 370.                            ____________________
