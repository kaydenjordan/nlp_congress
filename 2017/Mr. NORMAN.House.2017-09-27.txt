 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3823, the Disaster  Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2017, which provides  additional time to debate the future of our Nation's air traffic  control system.   Earlier this week, I visited Charlotte Douglas' air traffic control  tower and learned firsthand from the controllers about the importance  of modernizing our traffic control system. Fortunately, Chairman Bill  Shuster exercised leadership through spearheading H.R. 2997, the 21st  Century AIRR Act, that does just that, by shifting the current  bureaucratic and broken air traffic control to a stakeholder-managed,  not-for-profit corporation. With NextGen projected to ultimately cost  $120 billion, it is imperative that we fix our air traffic control in  this Congress.    Importantly, the 21st Century AIRR Act also strengthens air service  in rural communities through ensuring that general aviation will have  full access to U.S. airspace. It advances the remote air traffic  control tower program, which means that rural communities are fully  integrated into our Nation's air traffic control system.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with my colleagues on this  critical issue facing the Fifth District of South Carolina.
