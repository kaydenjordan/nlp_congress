 Mr. Speaker, I don't blame the gentleman. I  appreciate the opportunity to discuss the Affordable Care Act. As we  discuss this, as he has indicated, it helps a little bit to talk about  what the situation was before the Affordable Care Act passed.   We knew that costs were going through the roof. We knew that those  with preexisting conditions, if they could get insurance, would have to  pay a lot more for that insurance. We knew that women were paying more  for insurance than men. We knew that millions of people every year were  losing insurance. That is what was going on before.   People talk about small businesses. Well, small businesses had  trouble getting insurance because if they had a person with a chronic  illness, it would be unlikely that they could afford small-business  insurance. But now, the costs have continued to go up, but they have  gone up at half the rate they were going up before.   Those with preexisting conditions can now get insurance at the  average rate. Women are no longer paying more than men. And 20 million  more people have insurance, not millions of people losing insurance  every year, 20 million more people have insurance.   Now, the full name of the Affordable Care Act is the Patient  Protection and Affordable Care Act. There are certain protections, like  insurance companies can't cut you off after they have paid a certain  amount. There are no more caps. They can't rescind your policy. After  you get sick, they can't just decide not to renew your policy. There is  no copay or deductible for prevention and cancer screening. We are  closing the doughnut hole. The average senior has saved already about  $1,000 because of the Affordable Care Act support for closing the  doughnut hole. Those under age 26 can stay on their parents' policies.  Those are some of the benefits of the Affordable Care Act.   Now, we didn't solve all of the problems. There are still problems.  But if we are going to change the Affordable Care Act, we ought to  improve the Affordable Care Act. Unfortunately, the bill that was  introduced in the middle of the night fails on a number of areas.   Now, we would know precisely how bad a bill it is if they would wait  a couple of days for the CBO to score the bill. It would point out all  of the flaws. But there are just a couple.   One is just a fundamental principle that it purports to cover  preexisting conditions without a mandate for coverage. We know that if  you allow people to wait until they get sick before they buy insurance,  people will wait until they get sick before they buy insurance. The  average insurance pool is sicker, more expensive. Healthy people drop  out, and the thing spirals out of control. We don't have to speculate  how this works because we know.   New York State tried it, and the cost went up so much that when the  Affordable Care Act came in with a mandate, the cost for individual  insurance dropped more than 50 percent. Washington State tried it. It  got so bad that by the time it got going a couple of years, nobody  could buy insurance. Nobody could buy insurance in the individual  market. So we know what happens when you try to cover people with  preexisting conditions without a mandate.                                time  2000    So this plan, when it starts off with that policy, we know it is  bound to fail.   We also noticed another flaw: that it saves money by allowing people  to purchase insurance that doesn't cover everything. We have people  buying insurance now that have to buy the basic essential benefits  package. When you can start picking and choosing, you might save a  little money, but things like maternity care, if that becomes an  optional coverage, then anybody that wants that will not be able to  afford it.   It will cost whatever it costs to have a baby. They just have to pay  the bill. They might as well not have insurance. So that is because, if  anybody purchases maternity insurance, it is because they expect to  have a baby in the coming year, and it becomes unaffordable. If  everybody pays the average, everybody pays everything, then everybody  can afford the maternity coverage.   So allowing people to pick and choose what they want, that might help  a few, but those that need that coverage won't be able to afford it.   A final flaw, as the gentleman pointed out, is massive tax cuts.  Well, when you reduce the revenue available, two things happen: there  is less support for Medicaid, and there is less support for people in  paying their premiums. So in the fullness of time, fewer people will be  insured; and so you have a plan with fewer people insured, watered-down  benefits, and a plan that is ultimately going to fail.   That is not an improvement. If we are going to deal with the  Affordable Care Act, we ought to have an improvement; and until we have  an actual improvement, we ought to leave the Affordable Care Act alone.   I am delighted to be here discussing the Affordable Care Act with the  gentleman, warning people that, if they go forward without a  Congressional Budget Office evaluation so they know what is going on,  we may have a plan that is a lot worse than even before the Affordable  Care Act.    Shortly after the Affordable Care Act passed  and went into effect, a young lady approached me in a store--she was a  clerk in a store--and said: Bobby, don't let them repeal ObamaCare  because my son is alive today because of ObamaCare.   I said: Well, what do you mean?   She said: Late last year, he was diagnosed with a fatal disease for  which there is a cure, but we couldn't afford the cure. Thankfully, he  lived to January 1, when ObamaCare kicked in, and we can afford the  cure. My son is alive today because of the Affordable Care Act.   If it is repealed, what happens in that case? What happens in all of  the other  [[Page H1579]]  cases when people don't have insurance? We have heard it represented  that, well, anybody can get health care. All they have got to do is  show up at the emergency room.   Well, yeah, that is fine. You can show up at the emergency room with  a stroke, but you can't get blood pressure pills that could have  avoided the stroke to begin with. They can stabilize you and send you  home, but in terms of a cure or a surgery that may cure the problem,  you don't get that. You just get stabilized in the emergency room, and  that is not health care. We need people with insurance so they can  obtain the preventive care and the corrective care that will get them  off on the right track.   The gentleman talked about stripping coverage. When you take that  kind of money out of the system, less support for Medicaid, fewer  people getting Medicaid, less support for premium support so that  people can actually afford it--if you look at the proposal, a lot of  people can't use the tax cut because it is insufficient to pay the  premium and they don't have the rest of the money.   So we need to make sure that CBO scores this. They will highlight all  of these problems. They will show that many fewer people will be  insured and that it is not an improvement. We shouldn't do anything  unless we are actually improving the Affordable Care Act.     To add insult to injury, part of the scheme is  to allow insurance companies to charge senior citizens even more. Right  now they are limited to three times what they charge everybody else.  Their bill allows up to five times. That is a two-thirds increase in  the cost. So if the tax credit wasn't enough to begin with, it is going  to get worse.    That is right.   When everybody pays an average, if you allow some people to pay more,  some people are going to pay less, but it is a zero-sum game. Every  time they show somebody can pay less, then know that somebody will pay  more. They have a scheme, for example--they call it association plans-- where you get a group of healthy people, they come from out of the  insurance pool and get a better rate because the insurance company will  look at the association and say: Those are the young, healthy people, I  can give them a better rate. They can save money.   What happens to everybody else? They have to pay more.   Last time they came up with this idea, the research showed that 80  percent of the people will pay higher premiums if you allowed people to  withdraw from the pool, a healthy group. Now, actually, it will always  work, because the group you pull out, if the bids come in higher than  average, nobody is going to buy the insurance. They are going to go  right back into the regular pool. So any time you have one of these  things, it will only work if you are pulling out young, healthy people,  and that leaves behind, for everybody else, higher rates.    In fact, when we passed the Affordable Care  Act, the estimated cost on a family policy was about $1,000 a year on  the family policy for uncompensated costs shifted on to the insured  public. In fact, in Virginia, it is estimated that approximately $15 a  month is paid on everybody with insurance, $15 a month to go to the  400,000 people that would have had insurance if we had expanded  Medicaid.   So if you have 100 employees, you can just figure you are paying  about $1,500 a month extra because we did not expand Medicaid. 400,000  people will go to the hospital, won't pay, and when people with  insurance go, they just have to pay a little extra, about $15 a month  per person in the Commonwealth of Virginia because of that.    Mr. Speaker, well, that part of the Affordable  Care Act has actually improved the quality of service.   There are other things in the Affordable Care Act, such as funding  for education of more providers, more doctors and nurses, and other  providers because we have a lack of professionals. One area, for  example, is psychiatry. If the Veterans Administration hired all the  psychiatrists they need, there wouldn't be any for anybody else. We are  so far behind. And the Affordable Care Act provides for that service.   As you pointed out, there is a difference between the ability to pay  for the services and the services that are there. People frequently  compare the single-payer plan in Canada, which in many areas is a rural  area. So you don't have the critical mass of population to support a  high-tech medical system. So if you are going to have a baby, it is  probably going to be delivered by a family doctor, not an obstetrician.  In some areas, you have to go 200 miles to find a neurosurgeon. That  doesn't have anything to do with the fact that they can pay for the  services. It is just that the services aren't there.   So when people talk about the health delivery system, as you pointed  out, that is different. The fact that you can actually pay for services  doesn't diminish the opportunity to have those services there; it  actually increases the possibility that those services will be there.    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman indicated, in rural  areas, one of the things that we have done is funded community health  centers, which provides, where there are no professionals, a community  health center where you can actually go to get comprehensive primary  health care and then referred to a specialist somewhere if that is  needed. That funding would be obviously in jeopardy.   As you pointed out, when you have tax cuts in terms of resources,  that will translate into fewer people actually insured. They will have  watered down benefits. And because there is no mandate to ensure that  everybody is in the pool and they are trying to cover preexisting  conditions, you have a prescription for disaster. That is not an  improvement of the Affordable Care Act.   We need to insist that CBO score the legislation before we start  taking votes so that people know exactly what they are getting into.    Mr. Speaker, the clinics will shut down.  Insurance companies will stop writing insurance if people can wait  until they get sick before they buy insurance. The insurance companies  reacted to that system in Washington State by selling nobody any  insurance. So we know what is going to happen.   The CBO, when they score this, will point that out, and we will know  exactly what the problems are.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  California for organizing the Special Order so that we could actually  discuss some of the problems with going forward without a CBO score,  without knowing what we are doing. Certainly, it is not an improvement  in the Affordable Care Act.
