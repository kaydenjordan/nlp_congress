 Mr. Speaker, the work of Congress, and particularly the  House of Representatives, is to advance the well-being, security, and  economic growth of the American people.   Let me define for you, Mr. Speaker, who the American people are. For  all of us as Members of Congress, that looks very different.   For me in my district, it means the young entrepreneur who is eager  and excited about starting a new business, a startup company.   It is the middle-aged couple who have government jobs and who have  worked diligently, scrimped and saved to buy a home, and are now  looking for financing and support to send their children to college.   It is the veteran who has served this country and now has to navigate  through the bureaucracy of the Federal Government to get those rights  and privileges that, having served this country, he or she deserves.   It is the senior citizen and the retiree who are always watching  their budget to make sure that they have enough to meet all of their  bills and somehow get by.   Those are the people and the families whom I fight for. I know that,  on my side of the aisle, those workers, parents, seniors, and young  people are whom we, as Democrats, are fighting for. While we may come  from different families with different standings, beliefs, and  statuses, that is whom we all should be working for in this Chamber.   Presently, however, the House Republican economic scheme will only  hurt working American families, whom we say we are here to support. As  Congress, as the House of Representatives of the people, we must, in  partnership with the President, continue to enact legislation to  protect the financial security of American working families.   That is why I am directly calling on my colleagues, the Republican  Conference members, to begin the work of legislating for the American  people--the majority of Americans, not the performative politics  required by an extreme social media fringe--with legislation to help  work out the best possibilities to solve the growing challenges that  our families, the American people, face every day.   The current Republican-led plan to cut taxes in favor of the wealthy  does not help lower- and middle-income families. Instead, it increases  our national deficit and makes inflation worse.   The dismantling of Social Security will be devastating to retirees,  who have paid into that system and believe that it is something that  they are going to have to live out their best days yet.   Likewise, allowing for prescription drug prices and health insurance  premiums to rise while simultaneously allowing for an increasing energy  bill and student loan payments only make it harder for families to  financially stay afloat and take care of their health.   In the last Congress, the 117th Congress, President Biden and House  Democrats forged extraordinary progress, working in a bipartisan manner  in the other Chamber, for American working families with many  consequential new laws.   They include the American Rescue Plan, which kick-started the fastest  and strongest jobs recovery in modern times, creating more than 10  million jobs in just 2 years; the infrastructure law, which put  Americans back to work while simultaneously rebuilding our roads,  bridges, ports, and water systems; the Bipartisan Safer Communities  Act, which deploys stronger tools to keep guns out of dangerous hands;  the PACT Act, which ensures that veterans who are exposed to toxic  chemicals while protecting our Nation can access the healthcare  services they need; the CHIPS and Science Act, which will power  American preeminence in science, innovation, and manufacturing,  strengthen our national security, and bring jobs back to  [[Page H586]]  America for decades to come; and the Inflation Reduction Act, which  slashed prescription drug costs and lowered healthcare premiums,  delivering the most consequential climate action in history and  reducing the Federal deficit.    All of this progress can continue if we continue to work to legislate  and not to perform for cameras and social media. To work for the  American people is incumbent on us all--Democrats, Republicans, all of  us--to work together to protect the health, security, and freedom of  American families.                            ____________________
