 Madam Speaker, throughout his career, Fred  Keller has had many titles.   He's been a CEO, State representative, Congressman, and deacon. But  the title that I know Representative Keller is most proud of is  ``grandfather.''   Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize and to thank a man whom I  have had the privilege of calling a fellow legislator and a friend.   For the past 4 years, I have been proud to work alongside  Representative Fred Keller. One of the great joys of my time in  Congress has been joining alongside Fred Keller and other Members of  Congress in a morning prayer group.   Through his actions and through his deeds, Representative Keller has  set an example of what it meant to serve his constituents faithfully  and with their best interests at heart.   Throughout his career, Fred has been a champion of conservative  values, defending life, fighting for our students, and always working  tirelessly to hold government accountable.   There has been no greater advocate for his district and no greater  champion of liberty than Representative Fred Keller.   Madam Speaker, this body will miss having Representative Fred Keller  among us in the 118th Congress.                       In Remembrance of Kurt Keilhofer     Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember  the life of Mapleton firefighter, Kurt Keilhofer, who was killed while  serving the people of Huntingdon County on December 6, 2022.   A native son of Pennsylvania, Kurt dedicated his life to serving  others, to serving his community. Aside from his work in agriculture,  Kurt served not only as a firefighter, but also a member of the  Mapleton Borough Council where he worked each day to put the needs of  Mapleton residents first. He enjoyed camping, motorcycles, and spending  time outdoors. More than any of this perhaps, Kurt also enjoyed time  with his 15 grandchildren and his great-granddaughter, Aria.   We owe a debt of gratitude that we can never repay to Kurt, who gave  his life while doing what firefighters do: protecting others each and  every day that they serve us.   This year, 86 firefighters have lost their lives in the line of duty.  This Christmas, please join me in saying a prayer for those families  who will be missing a loved one who died in the service to their  communities.                            ____________________
