 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, in thinking about some of the debates  swirling about here in Washington, DC, as to whether capitalism or  socialism should be a preferred economic model, I recall a story that  involves Boris Yeltsin, who went on to become the Russian President,  who happened to be in Houston, TX, in 1989, visiting the Johnson Space  Center--a very important part of NASA in Houston--when he decided to  visit a grocery store in Clear Lake, TX. Though it sounds like it could  be, this isn't the beginning of a Wes Anderson film.   It was nearly 20 years ago, in 1989, when the Soviet Union had not  yet imploded and when the Berlin Wall was still standing. It would be 2  years before Yeltsin would be forced to take steps to begin to  transform the Soviet  [[Page S1752]]  economy. As I said, he was in the Houston area, finishing a tour of the  Johnson Space Center, when he made an unscheduled stop at a Randalls  grocery store before he headed to Miami.   The Houston Chronicle reported at the time that Yeltsin gawked at the  abundant produce, the selection of fresh fish, the checkout aisle, and  especially the frozen pudding pops. He roamed the aisles, according to  the story, stared at the frozen food section, and took advantage of the  free samples of cheese. He actually talked to some of the customers  there and asked questions about what they were buying and how much it  cost them. He was stunned--absolutely stunned--as this was a far cry  from the grocery stores in the Soviet Union. Yeltsin said: ``Even the  Politburo doesn't have this kind of choice, not even Mr. Gorbachev.''   That day, Boris Yeltsin learned something that the overwhelming  majority of people in our country already know--that socialism cannot  provide the bounty, the prosperity, or the choices that capitalism can.   Leon Aron, who wrote Yeltsin's biography, quoted one of his  associates.   He said:         For a long time, on the plane to Miami, he sat motionless,       his head in his hands. ``What have they done to our poor       people?'' he said, after a long silence.    He told his fellow countrymen who were traveling with him that if  their people were to see the conditions in American supermarkets,  ``there would be a revolution.''   Make no mistake about it. If the most radical Democrats in our  country today get their way on the outlandish socialist policies they  are pushing, the American people will be calling for a revolution.   The Green New Deal, Medicare for All, and economic security for those  who are able-bodied yet who are unwilling to work are policies that are  not going to raise up the most economically disadvantaged people in our  country. They are going to pull everyone else down. Socialism promises  not prosperity for all but what Winston Churchill called the equal  sharing of miseries.   Though these self-proclaimed democratic socialists make big promises  on how their policies will deliver fairness and equality for all  Americans, that could not be further from the truth. The first thing  these policies would do is to bankrupt our country. These unworkable  economic policies will kill jobs and outlaw our most reliable,  affordable energy sources. ``Medicare for All'' will turn into  ``Medicare for none'' when the entire system crashes and when those who  are unwilling to work will lose any incentive to even try. It would  subsidize a nation of slackers.   This threat of the seductive embrace of socialism isn't an  exaggeration. Some of our friends across the aisle are actually  critical of the equal opportunity, ``pulling yourself up by your  bootstraps,'' hard-working economic system that has made our country  the envy of the world. They say: You didn't create your success; the  government did--what a bunch of hooey.   Over the weekend, one Democratic Member of the House who was speaking  at South by Southwest in Austin, my hometown, referred to capitalism as  ``irredeemable'' and tried to blame capitalism for every problem that  exists in our society. I admit that we are not perfect, but capitalism  isn't the cause of every problem that exists in our society. Of all  places to complain about the perils of capitalism, there is more than a  little irony in her having chosen Texas--the most successful, free- enterprise economy in our Nation.   Instead of talking about this socialist, Big Government approach that  we all know will fail, let's look at how the Texas model has led my  State to become an economic powerhouse and the envy of the Nation.   We keep taxes low, government spending restrained, and regulations at  a rational minimum to give people and the small businesses that provide  jobs the freedom to pursue their dreams and to prosper. I must say that  it is obvious that it is working. The unemployment rate in Texas is 4  percent, which is among the lowest in the Nation. In Midland--in the  Permian Basin, the heart of the energy boom in my State--unemployment  is 2.1 percent. You are hard-pressed to find anybody to take the jobs  that do exist because, essentially, everybody who is willing to work is  fully employed. The biggest problem that job creators have is getting  the workers they need. Yet there is a silver lining for the workers.  This pushes wages higher as businesses compete for their labor.   Last week, the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Economic  Analysis released international trade data that showed Texas, for the  17th year in a row, as the top State for exports. We make stuff, and we  sell stuff. We grow things. We raise cattle and agricultural products,  and we sell them. We are the top State for exports. In fact, our  exports account for nearly 20 percent of the exports of the entire  Nation. In 2018, that totaled more than $315 billion of exports--more  than double that of California's, which is the second highest exporter.  These earnings not only fuel the economy of our State, but they boost  the entire Nation.   Our export dominance is only part of the reason Texas is thriving.  Together, with lower taxes and less burdensome regulation, businesses  and dream seekers are drawn to our State, which creates opportunities  for everyone who is willing to work. Instead of growing government and  increasing the tax burden, we allow businesses--small, medium, and  large--to invest in their workforces, in our communities, and in our  way of life.   In Texas, we believe that less government is more. We don't try to  centralize power in the statehouse. We give businesses, entrepreneurs,  and hard-working Texans of all backgrounds, ethnicities, and races the  freedom by which they can create their own opportunities. We know that  the more you tax, the more there are government controls and that the  more you regulate, the greater the burden is on new ideas, investment,  and opportunity.   The socialist policies being espoused by some members of the  Democratic Party are not going to make our businesses and our economy  stronger or more competitive. Indeed, history has shown that these are  failed policies that will stifle innovation, discourage hard work, and  make us look more like that 1980s Soviet grocery store.   Instead of our grocery stores being filled with a selection of  beautiful produce, fresh meat, your favorite snack foods, they will be  stocked with whatever the government says it wants you to have. Instead  of making an appointment with your doctor when you are sick, you will  wait for Lord knows how long to get an appointment with a government- run clinic and have few, if any, options. Instead of forcing ourselves  out of bed in the morning to go to work, people who are able but who  don't want to work will stay in bed, knowing they can receive food and  medical care that will be subsidized by your labor and your hard-earned  tax dollars.   That is what these old--but now, somehow, dressed up as something  new--failed ideas that have been proposed by our Democratic colleagues  would do. Forget government ``of the people, by the people, and for the  people.'' They want a country by the government, for the government-- the people be damned.   In his autobiography, Yeltsin wrote: ``When I saw those shelves  crammed with hundreds, thousands of cans, cartons and goods of every  possible sort, for the first time I felt quite frankly sick with  despair for the Soviet people . . . that such a potentially super-rich  country as ours has been brought to a state of such poverty.''   I pray that our country never sees that day when it is brought to  ruin because of these 21st century socialists.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
