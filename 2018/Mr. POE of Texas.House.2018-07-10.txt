 Mr. Speaker, America's Peace Corps volunteers are  our angels abroad. They represent the very best about America. They  give years of their lives to help people they have never met in some of  the most remote areas of the world.   Often this means putting their own safety at risk, expecting the  United States to have their backs. But right now we are not doing  enough to protect them while they are overseas. This will change with  the Sam Farr and Nick Castle Peace Corps Reform Act sponsored by myself  and Joe Kennedy of Massachusetts.   Many returning volunteers, like Sara Thompson, struggle to receive  the medical care they need while they are in a foreign country. Sara's  troubles began when the Peace Corps prescribed a medication called  mefloquine to protect her from malaria. But during her service in  Burkina Faso, she began to have horrific nightmares and struggled with  her mental health. When she turned to the Peace Corps for help, the  medical officer excused her symptoms by simply saying: You are not  adjusting well.   The nausea and nightmares continued. With no support from the Peace  Corps, she started to research the problems. It was then she realized  the malaria medicine the Peace Corps had given her was making her sick.  But today she still deals with these medical issues and feels abandoned  by our Peace Corps.   Peace Corps volunteer Nick Castle died in rural China after an  inefficient, under-equipped, and unresponsive Peace Corps-led medical  team made gross mistakes in treating his illness.   The Sam Farr and Nick Castle Peace Corps Reform Act establishes  criteria for in-country medical doctors and ensures that they have the  resources they need to take care of our volunteers. Giving our  volunteers the best medical care possible is an absolute necessity when  they are serving America.   There is more. A brave volunteer told me recently about the daily  sexual harassment she experienced while she served overseas. In broad  daylight, men would grope and threaten her as she walked home from  school. One afternoon at the market, the cashier threatened to break  into her house in the middle of the night and sexually assault her. So  she reported this to the Peace Corps, and they assured her that these  men were just joking. No surprise, the harassment continued.   Finally, she made the decision to return to America. She could no  longer bear the constant hostile environment. The Peace Corps recorded  her reason for leaving as difficulty in adapting to the culture. In  other words, the sexual assaults were her fault.   Are you kidding me?   Sexual assault and harassment should never be excused as joking and  should never be brushed off as a cultural norm.   Mr. Speaker, as a former judge and co-chairman of the Victims' Rights  Caucus, I would point out that sexual assault is never the fault of the  victim.   This bill creates new trainings and safeguards to protect volunteers  from sexual assault and harassment. It also makes the Office of Victim  Advocacy a permanent establishment.   Then there is Peace Corps volunteer Jennifer Mamola. Early one  morning, Jennifer was walking with two friends to a bus stop. Out of  nowhere, a drunk driver ran into them. One volunteer was killed. Both  of Jennifer's legs were broken. So she returned home to America still  bedridden and loaded on pain medication. She faced an uphill battle of  endless bureaucracy to receive treatment and surgeries. After months of  fighting government bureaucrats, she was finally granted treatment.   Far too often volunteers fall between the cracks and are forced to  pay exorbitant medical bills out of pocket until the Department of  Labor decides to cover their medical situation. So this bill would  provide medical coverage to returning volunteers while they wait for  the Department of Labor to give them the medical benefits they deserve.   The changes in this bill will go a long way in keeping our volunteers  safe.  [[Page H5994]]  The bill provides Peace Corps volunteers critical information regarding  the country that they are going to serve in. It also requires the Peace  Corps to provide volunteers with access to medical doctors while they  are overseas. And it makes the Sexual Assault Advisory Council and  Office of Victims' Advocacy permanent. It also extends volunteers'  medical benefits upon their return home until their coverage kicks in  from the Department of Labor.   Mr. Speaker, we must not continue to send our volunteers out into the  world without adequate protections against harm. Give them a qualified  medical doctor, and we must have an effective healthcare system to take  care of them when they return. Our government should fight for our  Peace Corps volunteers, not fight against them.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, this week President Trump will join  our allies for the important NATO summit. At the top of this list must  be countering Russia's aggression and imperialism against our allies  and the U.S.   But to achieve this, everyone must contribute to the cause. Of the 29  nations within NATO, only 8 members--including the United States--are  meeting the 2 percent of GDP pledge for defense spending.   For years, there has been a historical problem of excuses made for  noncompliance by some of our NATO allies. President Trump is right to  bluntly encourage our friends to meet their obligations to deter Czar  Putin.   Neighbors in Texas ask me: Why does the United States spend more  money defending some European countries than the countries do  themselves?   Fair question.   Mr. Speaker, I support NATO, but our NATO allies would do well to  stop criticizing the U.S. commitment to NATO and, rather, fully fulfill  their commitment to our mutual defense. It is time to belly up to the  bar and pay their share.   And that is just the way it is.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the 29 countries and whether  they are meeting their 2 percent guideline or not.                      NATO Members Meeting 2% Guideline         1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Royce and  Ranking Member Engel for marking up the Sam Farr and Nick Castle Peace  Corps Reform Act. This act is named after two former Peace Corps  volunteers. Sam Farr served with us here in the United States Congress.   I also thank Representative Kennedy from Massachusetts, who was also  a Peace Corps volunteer several years ago, for his cosponsorship of  this legislation to protect our Peace Corps volunteers. I call them our  angels abroad.   Recently, I have heard too many stories of young, eager volunteers  who selflessly give away years of their lives to help other people in  foreign countries, countries that many Americans have never even heard  of, but sometimes these Peace Corps volunteers are let down by the  organization that they gave so much to.   Jennifer Mamola was hit by a drunk driver while serving in Uganda.  She was at a bus stop with another volunteer, who was killed by the  drunk driver. Jennifer had both of her legs broken.   When she returned home, still bedridden and loaded on pain  medication, she faced an uphill battle to get medical treatment and  endless bureaucracy from our own government. After months of fighting  the system, she was finally approved for medical treatment, only to  have her case continuously reopened.   Others tell of their struggle to receive quality medical care and  protection while they are abroad in foreign countries.   Sara Thompson suffered for months from terrible nightmares and  nausea. When she turned to the Peace Corps doctors, they attributed her  symptoms to ``not adjusting well'' in the foreign country.                                time  1715    Not until Sara conducted her own research back in the United States  did she realize that the malaria medicine the Peace Corps had  prescribed for her was the thing that was making her sick. Her doctors  never recognized the symptoms. Sara still suffers from these symptoms  and this misdiagnosis and feels that the Peace Corps abandoned her.   Another brave volunteer told me about the sexual harassment she  experienced while serving overseas in a foreign country. During broad  daylight, men would grope and threaten her as she walked home from  school. This harassment went on for months and months. When she  reported this to the Peace Corps, the Peace Corps assured her that the  men were just joking.   Are you kidding me, Mr. Speaker?   When she could no longer bear the harassment, she returned home, and  the Peace Corps recorded her reason for leaving the Peace Corps as  ``difficulty adapting to the culture.''   Sexual assault and harassment should never be excused as joking. It  should never be brushed off as a cultural norm. And, Mr. Speaker,  sexual assault is never the fault of a victim.   As a former judge, I can tell you that it is our duty to do  everything within our power to protect these ambassadors, these angels  abroad.   The Sam Farr and Nick Castle Peace Corps Enhancement Act of 2018  builds on and extends protections for our volunteers which became law  as a result of the Kate Puzey Peace Corps Volunteer Protection Act of  2011, which I introduced, and it finally became law in 2011.   H.R. 2259 protects volunteers at every stage of their service with  the Peace Corps: The onboarding process, their time in-country, and  when they return home. During the onboarding process, this bill  requires the Peace Corps to provide information on health risks and  crimes to volunteers up front so that they can be informed and make a  good decision on where to serve. Sometimes Peace Corps volunteers have  no idea about the assaults that take place in these foreign countries.  Those days will be over.   While they are deployed in the country, this bill requires the Peace  Corps to make sure volunteers have access to qualified medical doctors.  These doctors must consult with outside experts and the Center for  Disease Control on best practices, particularly on mental health and  malaria medications.   We also added important provisions on protection from sexual assault  and harassment recommended by the Office of Special Counsel in a report  that was released by them this year.   H.R. 2259 extends the Sexual Assault Advisory Council for an  additional 5 years. It makes the Office of Victims Advocacy permanent.  Both of these valuable resources for volunteers who have been assaulted  or harassed would have expired this year.   And finally, when volunteers return home from their service with  illnesses and injuries that they received overseas, they should not  have to spend months dealing with bureaucratic red tape so that they  can get medical care. This bill will ensure that they immediately  receive the medical care and mental healthcare that they need and  deserve.   Peace Corps volunteers, Mr. Speaker, are the face of our country in  places where America's shining beacon of hope and liberty has not  always shined so bright. They promote goodwill and a better  understanding of the United States. This helps to ensure an enduring  partnership with our Nation.   But most of all, they do good things. They do good because they are  good. They change lives every day in the local communities that they  serve; and we, at home, must ensure we are doing all we can to minimize  unnecessary dangers for these volunteers. The Sam Farr and Nick Castle  Peace Corps Enhancement Act of 2018 is a crucial step.   So I thank the Speaker for bringing this bill to the floor, and I  urge my colleagues to support this critical bill, and the Senate to  take it up as soon as possible.   I also would like to thank my staffers, Oren Adaki, Patrick Megahan,  and Luke Murry in the Majority Leader's office.   Peace Corps volunteers, Mr. Speaker, are the best that we have in  this country, and that is just the way it is.   I reserve the balance of my time.

Dear Chairman Gowdy: Thank you for consulting with the       Foreign Affairs Committee and agreeing to be discharged from       further consideration of H.R. 2259, the Sam Farr and Nick       Castle Peace Corps Reform Act of 2018, so that the bill may       proceed expeditiously to the House floor.

Edward R. Royce,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, Washington, DC.

Dear Chairwoman Foxx: Thank you for consulting with the       Foreign Affairs Committee and agreeing to be discharged from       further consideration of H.R. 2259, the Sam Farr and Nick       Castle Peace Corps Reform Act of 2018, so that the bill may       proceed expeditiously to the House floor.

Sincerely,                                                   Edward R. Royce,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, when I travel overseas in foreign countries, I, like  many of the members of the Foreign Affairs Committee, try to meet with  our Peace Corps volunteers. Most of those volunteers are in Third World  countries, and I have had the honor to meet with them. They have come  down from the mountains in Peru to meet with me and other Members.   One thing is universally true about all of them: They love being a  Peace Corps volunteer. They love working in that country and doing  things in that country most of us would never do, but they do it  because they are good, and they do good.   And when the Peace Corps volunteers came to me first a few years ago  about some of the things that were happening in the Peace Corps, they  all made it clear to me that, even though these bad things happened to  them while they served in the Peace Corps, whether it was being  assaulted overseas, lack of medical attention by the Peace Corps,  whatever, they all still supported the Peace Corps. They were not  bitter about the Peace Corps. They weren't mad at the Peace Corps. Many  of them said they would volunteer again if they could.   They are remarkable individuals. They are the best that we have in  this country who represent us all over the world doing good things for  people.   Of course it helps the United States politically, but, more  importantly, it helps these people in these countries to have things  that they would never be able to have without these Peace Corps  volunteers working with them and helping to make a sanitary  environment, helping them to market such things as guinea pigs, as I  learned in Peru.   They are remarkable individuals, and I want to make that very clear  that the Peace Corps volunteers support making the Peace Corps better,  but they support the Peace Corps most of all.   Let me just mention this about Nick Castle. He died while he was in  China. He died because he did not get adequate medical attention,  medical attention that the United States was responsible for making  sure that he got that he did not get, and because of that, he died in- country. So this bill is  [[Page H6025]]  named after Nick Castle, and it is named after Sam Farr.   I want to also say again how much I appreciate Joe Kennedy from  Massachusetts being the cosponsor of this, him being a Peace Corps  volunteer, his family being supportive of the Peace Corps. One of the  best things the United States ever did was when John F. Kennedy  invented the Peace Corps.   We should continue to send our angels abroad, representing the United  States, representing what is good, and we should support them when they  are overseas, when they return home, and after they have even left the  Peace Corps. Our government should work to help the Peace Corps, not  work against the Peace Corps.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
