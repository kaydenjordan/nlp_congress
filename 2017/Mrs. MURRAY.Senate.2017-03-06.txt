Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 7  minutes.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                                  Travel Ban     Mr. President, before I talk about the Republican's  reckless move tonight to roll back important worker protections, I do  want to address the President's revised immigration Executive order  that he signed just hours ago. He may have rearranged some words, but  make no mistake, this is still a ban on Muslims. It still flies in the  face of everything this country is about and what we stand for.   Slamming the door shut on refugees and immigrants, no questions  asked, is un-American. Just like we saw in January, people across this  country are already standing up and saying once again this is wrong,  and we will not tolerate broad orders that target some of the most  vulnerable people in the world.   I urge the President, if you truly want to keep our country safe,  work with us, but we will not sit idly by as you continue to push a  hateful agenda that betrays our American values.   Mr. President, I want to turn to the vote that is going to occur  shortly here on the floor. I thank all of my colleagues who will be  joining me this evening. When President Trump was running for office,  he claimed he was going to be a President who fought for the middle  class. He made a promise that he wasn't going to do what most  Republicans have done in recent years and simply work for millionaires  and billionaires. He was going to be different. He would be someone  workers could count on.   We are just over a month into this Presidency, and it couldn't be  clearer; President Trump is breaking that promise, whether it is his  Cabinet picks or billionaires and Wall Street bankers and corporate  CEOs or his rush to destroy our healthcare system and create chaos for  families across our country or what Republicans have chosen to bring to  the floor tonight: another effort that would hurt our workers, hurt the  middle class, and hurt our economy.   Here is what I think we should be doing in Congress. We should be  working on ways to boost economic security for more working families,  and we should be helping our economy grow in the way that we know is  strongest: from the middle out, not from the top down.   We have made some important progress over the last several years, but  I think all of us on either side of the aisle agree there is a lot of  work left to be done. That is certainly what has been clear to me as I  have traveled across my home State of Washington, listening and meeting  with workers and their families. Families are working hard. They are  meeting their responsibilities, but far too many are still unable to  get ahead.   Again, that is the topic we should be discussing tonight: how to  support and empower more workers. Instead, we are here today because  President Trump and my Republican colleagues either simply are not  getting that message or they are too busy focusing on what is best for  the folks already at the top, because today Republicans are poised to  roll back a rule which helps protect our workers from wage theft, from  discrimination, from unsafe workplaces, and more.   I want to take just a few minutes to make very clear what is at stake  for millions of working families if Republicans roll back this rule.  Each year, far too many workers are deprived of overtime wages or they  are denied basic workplace protections. They have endured illegal  discrimination, and they face unwarranted health or safety risks. That  is unacceptable, and it has to come to an end.   Last year, Democrats, working with the previous administration,  pushed to finalize what is now known as the fair pay and safe  workplaces rule. For far too long, the government has awarded billions  of taxpayer dollars to companies that rob workers of their paychecks  and fail to maintain safe working conditions. This rule helps to right  that wrong. Under this rule, when a company applies for a Federal  contract, they will need to be upfront about their safety, health, and  labor violations over the past 3 years. That way, government agencies  can consider an employer's record of providing workers with a safe  workplace and paying workers what they have earned before they grant or  renew a Federal contract. To be clear, this does not prevent companies  from winning Federal contracts. It does not single out companies. It  does not deny companies the right to be heard. It simply improves  transparency and coordination so government agencies are aware of  companies' violations and can work with them to make sure they come  into compliance with essential labor laws.   Again, the emphasis on this is not punishment but on helping bring  more and more companies into compliance with the law and zeroing in on  violations that are, and I quote from the rule: ``Serious, repeated,  willful, or pervasive.'' Not only are these measures common sense, but  they would have major benefits for our workers, our businesses and, by  the way, our taxpayers. It would help hold the worst violators  accountable.   American taxpayers should have the basic guarantee that their dollars  are going to responsible contractors that will not steal from their  workers or expose their workers to safety hazards. It would protect  basic worker rights, and that, in turn, will help expand economic  security for all working families, and it will level the playing field  for businesses that do follow the law.   I think we can all agree that businesses shouldn't have to compete  with bad actors that cut corners and put their workers' safety at risk  or cheat their workers on their paychecks.   All of this, frankly, is pretty simple. When workers arrive on the  job, they deserve to know they will be treated fairly, that they will  be provided with a safe and healthy workplace, that their right to  collective bargaining will be respected, and they will be paid all the  wages they earned. Businesses that contract with the government should  set an example when it comes to each of these concerns, and taxpayer  dollars should only go to businesses that respect these fundamental  worker protections.   As I said, time and again, families nationwide are sending a very  clear message at marches, with phone calls and letters, online, and in  their communities. They expect and are demanding that their  representatives are truly committed to working for them. I, for one, am  committed to standing with them. I know my colleagues are committed,  and we are prepared to fight back.   Let's be clear, in rolling back these protections, President Trump  and his party are yet again breaking their campaign promise to put our  workers first. Workers will be hurt, wages will go down, rights will be  undermined, lives will be put at risk. Tonight I am here to urge my  Republican colleagues to drop this deeply harmful effort, reverse  course, and stand with working families once and for all.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The joint resolution was ordered to a third reading and was read the  third time.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The joint resolution having been read the  third time, the question is, Shall the joint resolution pass?   The yeas and nays have been previously ordered.   The clerk will call the roll.
