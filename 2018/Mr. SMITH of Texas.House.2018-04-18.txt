 Mr. Speaker, a recent poll of Texas voters shows  that they want to reduce and reform legal immigration and save jobs for  Americans.   The Pulse Opinion Research survey found that 63 percent of Texans  favor less immigration than the current annual level of 1 million.  Notably, 56 percent support cutting the number of green cards by at  least half. Only 14 percent of the voters questioned want to increase  immigration.   The poll also determined that Texas voters, by a 2-1 margin, want to  end chain migration and only admit spouses and minor children of  immigrants. Also, respondents strongly support workforce verification  to prevent illegal immigrants from taking jobs away from citizens.   Congress should listen to Texans' views on immigration policy. With a  2,000-mile common border with Mexico, Texas continues to bear the  burden of our current misguided immigration system.                            ____________________
