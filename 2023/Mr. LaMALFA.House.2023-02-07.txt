 Mr. Speaker, let's just sort this out in our minds for a  minute here.   Giving the privilege that our soldiers have fought for, the very  cornerstone privilege of voting in this country, to people that have  broken into this country and are here in this city illegally, granting  them the right to vote, the people all across the fruited plain have  got to believe that they are out of their minds here to extend that  privilege to people whose first act was to break into this country.  Now, they want to confer the privilege of voting and deciding who the  decisionmakers in Washington, D.C., are going to be for them. It is  absurd.    Now, there are a lot of things going on with D.C. politics and  demands for the area here. I understand, on some level, part of it. But  D.C. is about one-eighteenth the size of Rhode Island. Its population  is only a little bit larger than Fresno, California, one of the towns  in my home State.   They are demanding statehood?   It is right in the Constitution that the District of Columbia will be  kept separate from any State, so it doesn't have undue influence by a  State in conducting the business of the city and of the district and of  the Federal Government housed here.   It just shows that Congress, having been authorized and given the  duties of overseeing the district, needs to reassert itself once again,  because the council here is out of control, thinking that that is a  good idea, with some of the crime legislation that is being talked  about. But the right to vote being conferred upon people whose very  first act was to break into this country, people are really wondering  if this place has lost its collective mind.   I support this legislation to put D.C. back on the right path, the  right foot, of following the law. It would undermine elections all  across this country to have the idea of illegal immigrants voting in  this city or other ones around the country.
