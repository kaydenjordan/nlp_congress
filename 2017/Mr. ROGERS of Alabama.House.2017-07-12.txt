 Mr. Chair, I would like to thank Chairman  Thornberry and Ranking Member Smith for their leadership in bringing  this years's NDAA. I would also like to thank my friend and colleague  from Tennessee, Mr. Jim Cooper, the ranking member on our subcommittee,  for being such a great partner as we worked on this important bill.   Now, I would like to focus on some key provisions in the bill. First,  space reform. This bill takes two monumental steps to reform national  security space. First, the bill provides for the creation of a space  core within the Air Force to fix the fragmented space acquisition  process.   Second, it provides for the establishment of a subordinate, unified  command for space under U.S. Strategic Command to ensure integration of  the joint command of all space operations.   I can't stress enough the urgent necessity of these reforms. Our  society and our military are enormously dependent on space. Meanwhile,  our adversaries continue to grow their counterspace capabilities. These  adversaries have already reorganized their space forces toward the goal  of neutralizing our advantage in space.   Multiple studies going back almost two decades have recommended a  space force to fix our space acquisition and management problems.  Regardless, the DOD and the Air Force have yet to fix the problem.  Decisionmaking authorities for space acquisitions remain fragmented  across over 60 organizations. This bill would consolidate acquisition  authority and improve our ability to jointly operate in space.   Earlier this week, I returned from Asia where I got to meet with our  troops on the Korean Peninsula. I was in theater when North Korea  conducted their intercontinental ballistic missile. We must be vigilant  when it comes to our missile defenses, and this year's NDAA does that.   Noteworthy initiatives in the bill include the authorization of  approximately $2 billion in additional funds for the Missile Defense  Agency. It also accelerates our efforts to develop a space-based sensor  and interceptor capabilities. Lastly, the bill supports our nuclear  deterrence and includes provisions to improve the oversight of our  nuclear command, control, and communications.   Mr. Chair, I urge support of this important legislation.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.  [[Page H5730]]    The CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman, Mr.  Blumenauer, for his amendment, although I urge its defeat.   I start off with pointing out that both the Obama administration and  the Trump administration have decided the fact that Russia is in  violation of the INF Treaty, and neither of those administrations have  indicated any belief that Russia will come back into compliance.   But having said that, I want to say I am troubled that the gentleman  would want to provide a veto on the development of a system that hasn't  been developed, much less deployed. The gentleman is worried about  deployment of a system that we still don't have developed yet. And  hopefully it won't be deployed when it is completed.   That is really the function of whether Russia comes back into  compliance. General Selva, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff, testified before the HASC in March: ``They do not intend to  return to compliance absent some pressure from the international  community and the United States as a cosigner of that same agreement.  There is no trajectory in what they are doing that would indicate  otherwise.''   The development of this system that we are talking about here today  is that very pressure that General Selva was referencing. This kind of  development got the Russians to the table on the INF Treaty anyway, but  they are violating the treaty. And that doesn't just matter to Europe.  It matters to Asia, which is completely ignored by the gentleman's  amendment. And Asia matters on INF. Why? Because 95 percent of China's  missiles are in INF range.   The commander of PACOM has testified that he has requirements for  intermediate-range missile capability in Asia, ``the aspects of the INF  Treaty that limit our ability to counter Chinese and other countries'  land-based missiles, I think is problematic. ``   We didn't conjure the idea of a ground-launched cruise missile out of  thin air. The U.S. Army reported that introducing intermediate-range  ground-launched missiles into the land domain provides military  value across the range of the joint military operations and provides a  land-based counter to our adversaries' anti-access area denial  capabilities.    This report was required by the HASC last year as a part of our  multiyear oversight on how to respond to Russia's violations of the INF  Treaty, which the prior administration did nothing to challenge.   I appreciate the gentleman's interest. I will gladly work with him on  ways to counter Russia's violations of the treaty, but I must urge  defeat of this well-intentioned but poorly conceived amendment.   Mr. Chair, I urge support of the bipartisan approach taken by the  House Armed Services Committee in sections 1244 and 1245, and I urge a  vote ``no'' on the Blumenauer amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, again, I want to remind the  gentleman that nobody has indicated that Russia has any intention--they  see no signs that Russia has any intention of coming back into  compliance.   I think this is poorly thought out. We need to go forward and not be  giving vetoes to other people about what weapon systems we can start  developing.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman  from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).   The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding  and for offering this important amendment.   This is a simple and straightforward amendment that would help us set  priorities in spending taxpayer dollars in a small but meaningful way.  The U.S. signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, back in  1996, but the Senate voted against that ratification in 1999.   We are talking about two decades ago. In the meantime, the U.S. has  abided by a unilateral pledge to refrain from nuclear explosive tests  of any size or kind, but other nations, including Russia and China,  have not. They continue to conduct very low-yield nuclear tests that  the U.S. does not. Why? Two reasons: one, the CTBT has not entered into  force, and the CTBT doesn't even define what it bans.   So while we keep a very stringent policy against testing, other  nuclear powers do not. Twenty years later, it is time to ask ourselves  why we continue to fund the organization for a treaty that is not going  anywhere. This amendment wisely funds the International Monitoring  System which provides us some benefits but prohibits the approximately  $2 million in payments to the CTBT organization itself that is included  in the FY18 budget request for the State Department.   Let's set this small commonsense priority and let's reinforce the  Obama administration's own position that the U.N. resolution from last  year is not legally binding on the United States.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment.   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, to me, this is, again,  clearly an amendment which is in coordination with the Senate  initiative by Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas that clearly continues the  funding of the International Monitoring System to improve our global  nuclear detection capability and returns us to the longstanding  policies from President George W. Bush's administration.   The amendment is clear. Protecting American families is the job of  Congress, not an unaccountable, international body. As we see a rise-- as I have stated in the past--in threats around the world, our nuclear  deterrence capability is crucial to promote our ability to preserve  peace.   Mr. Chair, I urge the approval of the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.   The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman  from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson).   The amendment was agreed to.                   Amendment No. 10 Offered by Mr. Aguilar    The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10 printed in  part B of House Report 115-212.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.   The CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.   The CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chair, my friend from California is  correct about one thing: I will say a 30-year cost estimate is not  worth the paper it is written on.   I oppose this amendment, just as I opposed a similar amendment by my  friend from California, number 12. I submitted amendment No. 88 that we  will consider shortly. My amendment was a hopeful compromise with my  colleagues from California, who are offering amendment Nos. 10 and 12  on this same issue. Unfortunately, we have not been able to reach a  compromise, so we will put them all before our colleagues here on the  floor for consideration.   The bottom line is that my colleagues are asking DOD and CBO to  create a 25- and 30-year cost estimate for how much our nuclear forces  cost. That would triple the current requirement of 10-year cost  estimates. Unfortunately, these type of multidecade cost estimates  won't be worth the paper they are written on.   As evidence for that, Assistant Secretary of Defense Tom Hopkins, who  would be responsible for creating the DOD report, has called a 25-year  report on this ``burdensome.'' He explained it to us this way during a  hearing: ``Right now we submit a 10-year report that does have programs  and cost on it. . . . As you would expect, looking out that far, 25  years, the credibility of the numbers would be very, very suspect. . .  .   ``Forecasting DOD costs over a 25-year period with any useful  accuracy is extremely difficult given the challenges of predicting  developments in the international security environment and ongoing  technological advancements.''    The Armed Services Committee and this House have considered these  types of 30-year cost estimate amendments for DOD or CBO in the NDAAs  for the last 5 years.   Each time, for 5 years in a row, these amendments have been defeated.  That is because these types of amendments would not result in good,  effective oversight and transparency.   It would result in false and unreliable data entering the public  debate. If any of my colleagues are interested in a reasonable,  commonsense way to try and shed a little more light on these very long- term plans and costs, I encourage them to vote for my amendment No. 88.  My amendment allows the Secretary of Defense to provide for information  beyond 10 years if he thinks it is accurate and would be useful in  understanding the nuclear modernization programs.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this current amendment and  ``yes'' on my amendment No. 88, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would say that the Navy  provides 30-year cost estimates because Congress made them, and the  Navy  [[Page H5733]]  doesn't want to do it, and they don't think they are reliable.   I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I yield back the balance  of my time.   The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman  from California (Mr. Aguilar).   The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition  to this amendment.   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. LaMalfa). The gentleman is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I reluctantly oppose this amendment from my friend and  colleague from California. He is a very serious, thoughtful, and  clearly articulate Member, but it is for the same reasons that I just  outlined with Mr. Aguilar's amendment.   I will keep this brief because we just talked about this. But going  down this path for a 25- or 30-year cost estimate for nuclear weapons  is a bad idea and would result in bad data. The Acting Assistant  Secretary of Defense in the Obama administration who is still in the  Trump administration doesn't think it is a good idea either.   The HASC and the House have considered this 30-year cost estimate for  the last 5 years in a row, and each time it has been rejected. This  amendment would not result in good, effective oversight and  transparency.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to consider voting for my  reasonable, commonsense amendment when we get to it, amendment No. 88.  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment and ``yes'' on  Rogers 88.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I agree with the gentleman. We  don't want to be mushrooms, but we also don't want bad data. So I would  urge a ``no'' vote on this and urge people to support Rogers amendment  No. 88, which will allow the Secretary to go beyond 10 years to 25 or  30 if the Secretary believes it would yield valuable data.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance of  my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition  to this amendment.   The CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition  to this amendment.   The CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I strongly oppose this amendment, but it is not just  me. The Armed Services Committee considered nearly the same amendment  during markup, and it was soundly defeated.   It is not just the committee that opposed this amendment. It is also  our country's senior-most military officers. They repeatedly described  the urgent need for the LRSO and the declining reliability of the  NACMs.   They have testified before our committee in March on this exact  issue. Here is the Nation's second highest ranking military officer,  the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Selva:         ALCMs were designed and built in the 1970s with a 10-year       lifespan. We know today they remain relevant, but we can't       continue to maintain them. A decade from now, those weapons       will not be able to penetrate Russian air defenses, and       therefore there is an urgency for their replacement.    In the same year, STRATCOM Commander General Hyten said:         The LRSO is the first missile system developed in unison       with a nuclear warhead in mind for many decades. Limiting       resources or funding of either component will disrupt the       entire concept-to-capability timeline.    Here is President Obama's Assistant Secretary of Defense, Bob Scher,  testifying before my committee last year:        The Obama administration's decision to field a modern ALCM       replacement is essential to maintain the ALCM's unique       contribution to stable and effective deterrence.    Finally, let me briefly address this nonsense argument that LRSO is  destabilizing. Here is President Obama's Under Secretary of State for  Arms Control Rose Gottemoeller testifying before the Senate last year:         First, the LRSO is consistent with our arms control       commitments and President Obama's Prague agenda. Second, the       LRSO supports strategic stability and does not undermine it.       Third, it is important in the eyes of our allies. There is no       evidence that the LRSO or our nuclear modernization program       are prompting an action-reaction cycle or catalyzing these       arms races. The LRSO is valuable in maintaining strategic       stability.    Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I was quoting Rose Gottemoeller  from the Obama administration, saying that it was not going to  perpetuate this cycle.   Mr. Chair, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman  from Wyoming (Ms. Cheney), my friend and an outstanding member of the  Armed Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:        At the end of subtitle E of title XVI, add the following       new section:       SEC. 1673. MODIFICATION TO ANNUAL REPORT ON PLAN FOR THE                     NUCLEAR WEAPONS STOCKPILE, NUCLEAR WEAPONS                     COMPLEX, NUCLEAR WEAPONS DELIVERY SYSTEMS, AND                     NUCLEAR WEAPONS COMMAND AND CONTROL SYSTEM.         Subsection (a)(2)(F) of section 1043 of the National       Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (Public Law       112-81; 125 Stat. 1576), as most recently amended by section       1643 of the Carl Levin and Howard P. ``Buck'' McKeon National       Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (Public Law       113-291; 128 Stat. 3650), is further amended by inserting       after the period at the end the following: ``The Secretary       may include information and data for a period beyond such 10-      year period if the Secretary determines that such information       and data is accurate and useful in understanding the long-      term nuclear modernization plan.''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 431, the gentleman  from Alabama (Mr. Rogers) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alabama.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Chair, as I said a few minutes ago, I submitted this amendment as  a hopeful compromise with my colleague from California who offered  amendment Nos. 10 and 12 on this same issue. I will keep this very  brief because we have discussed this thoroughly tonight.   But going down a path of a 30-year cost estimate for nuclear weapons  is a bad idea and will result in bad data. As we debated this for the  past 5 years now, the Obama administration didn't want to do it, the  Trump administration doesn't want to do it, and the HASC and the House  have voted against it every year.   I urge my colleagues to consider voting for my reasonable commonsense  amendment, commonsense way to get this issue resolved with amendment  No. 88.   My amendment allows the Secretary of Defense to provide information  beyond 10 years if he thinks it would be accurate and useful in the  information it yielded. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on my  amendment and ``no'' on amendment Nos. 10 and 12.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield  back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Rogers).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Alabama will  be postponed.
