 Madam Speaker, I rise today as our Florida Keys are  under a state of emergency.   The President's unwillingness to secure our border, coupled with his  pathetic policy of appeasement and concessions to the brutal Castro  regime in Cuba, have created a migratory crisis unlike any other that  the Florida Keys has seen in decades.   Since August 2022 alone, Federal, State, and local law enforcement  have encountered nearly 10,000 people in waters off the coast of  Florida, and the Biden administration is directly responsible.   Dry Tortugas National Park has already been forced to close because  of this crisis, affecting the tourism-dependent economy of our Florida  Keys constituents, boaters, and tour operators, and the Biden  administration is directly responsible.   Secretary Mayorkas has repeatedly demonstrated abdication of his  responsibilities as leader of the Department of Homeland Security and  failed to enforce our public safety immigration laws. That is why I am  calling on him to resign immediately.   Governor Ron DeSantis quickly activated the National Guard, and I  commend him on behalf of my constituents for his leadership and bold  action.   I am calling on the Biden administration to take action now. We must  reimburse Monroe County and the State of Florida for local resources  that have been expended to process and care for the latest wave of  migrants. We need to increase Customs and Border Protection onsite in  Monroe County and provide additional resources to the Florida Keys.                            ____________________
