 Mr. Speaker, Congress is considering a transportation  appropriations bill right now as we speak. It is critical that we don't  give another dime to California's failed high-speed rail project that  has sought money year after year after year from the Federal level.   Indeed, this document does not provide any new money for the high- speed rail project, but they are certainly seeking it. There are  reportedly proposals for $3 billion requested by Governor Newsom and  even reportedly asks of a possible $28 billion, which is what they  really seek.   Let's go back just a little bit to learn the history of this project.  In 2008, a proposition was passed on California's ballot with the idea  to build a high-  [[Page H5475]]  speed rail system from San Francisco to L.A. The voters were told the  cost would be $33 billion. Okay. There would have to be a high-speed  rail that would go from the two cities at approximately 220 miles an  hour and get the job done in approximately 3 hours or less. It has  fallen far short of those goals.   They only have to have one high-speed train a day go in order to be  eligible to be called a high-speed train. Otherwise, it is going to be  a commuter line stopping in every little burg along the way. As it is  turning out, from San Francisco to San Jose, it looks they are going to  use local electric rail. Passengers would need to jump on a train in  San Jose and then take it down to an undetermined point in southern  California and perhaps jump on another train there.   We were talking about this last night in the debate, and I mentioned  that you could take a Southwest Airlines plane and already be on the  beach and have half a sunburn before you could get off the high-speed  rail at that point.   What is the cost these days? That is the interesting part. In 2008,  $33 billion is what they were sold. A year later, they adjusted the  price up to $42 billion. Not long after that, when I was still in the  State legislature, they actually admitted the price then would be $97  billion. Today's estimates show it to be $128 billion.   How much construction is finished on it? The voters were told in 2008  that it would be ready to go by 2020. Well, it is 2023, and not a  single mile of track has been laid. They have some bridges and  aqueducts already built around Fresno and such, but it is nowhere near  being completed.   They are trying to do it in segments, so they are doing the Central  Valley segment because, as they said at the time--this is pretty  funny--they can build it in the Central Valley, there are fewer people  there, so there is less resistance to having it built. They are going  to do a segment from Merced to Bakersfield, where it ends up in an  orchard somewhere as the terminus. At this point, we are finding they  need $28 billion just to complete that segment, not the entire thing.   It has been a boondoggle from the beginning, with lies basically from  the rail authority about what is going to happen with the timeline, the  environmental work, and the number of jobs.   Here is another good one: They were promising there would be a  million jobs for California. Well, 3 years into the project, they  finally admitted it would be a million job years. Currently, they claim  5,000 people are working on the rail, and so at that rate for a million  job years at 5,000 people, that would take 200 years to complete the  system.   Well, the people who voted for it would probably like to see it done  in their lifetime, which may not even happen. I think at this point,  why don't we just cut our losses and move toward something that is  useful not just for Californians but for all Americans.   Indeed, we want to do infrastructure around here. Why don't we do  true infrastructure? We talk about highways. We talk about a lot of  things. I am focused a lot on California's water situation. We have  several projects to add to its water supply so it can continue to grow  crops and people can thrive in our State, not just environmental water  that gets shifted more and more towards fish water and running it out  the delta, which doesn't actually help that situation or do anything  environmentally positive anyway.   Instead of continuing to come to Washington, D.C., for more money to  do something that is only covering this little portion of California,  rather than San Francisco all the way to L.A. as originally planned, I  propose instead that we shift the money into other projects that can  help all Americans.   They don't even have the route planned out for the high-speed rail  project. They don't know how they are going to get the last leap from  Bakersfield into southern California. Are they going to build a tunnel  through there with all that seismic activity? Are they going to go  around it? Are they going to go over it? They don't have the whole plan  this many years into the project, and they still want more money from  Washington, D.C., from all Federal taxpayers.   If they shift the money into other infrastructure that can help all  Americans, these crops that are grown in California, look at these  numbers, basically 100 percent of walnuts and tomatoes grown  commercially are grown in California. Many of these other crops, 90- plus percent are grown in California. Having a stable food supply is  what benefits Americans, so dollars invested into our water system in  California would go much further than wasting money on high-cost rail.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, as we approach Veterans Day this coming  weekend, we will remember that on the eleventh hour of the 11th day of  the 11th month it was originally the end of World War I. It was known  as Armistice Day, and in 1919 was the first Armistice Day until the  Treaty of Versailles finally was done after several iterations of  armistice was done back then.   Finally, in 1945, World War II veteran Raymond Weeks had the idea to  expand it to all veterans. Raymond Weeks was later known as the father  of what we now know as Veterans Day. In 1954 it was fully renamed  Veterans Day.   To properly put the focus on the service and thanking of all our  living veterans, this Saturday on November 11, I urge all Americans to  pause and participate in honoring our living veterans at local events  you may find in your area, Madam Speaker.   Let them know. It is not just a Friday off for Federal employees and  the banks or no mail on Saturday, but a grateful Nation, instead,  thanks them for preserving our freedom and that we should also be  participants in our citizenship for our country.                            ____________________
