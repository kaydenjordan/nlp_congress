 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Tarrant County  Sheriff Bill Waybourn and his deputies. Earlier this month, Sheriff  Waybourn announced the weeks-long investigation known as Operation  Buyer Beware, which focused on the demand driving human trafficking.   Together, Texas DPS, Fort Worth Police, Arlington Police and the  Department of Homeland Security successfully arrested a total of 115  men over the course of 1 week, many of them repeat offenders. Those  arrested were attempting to solicit sex from minors.   With this operation, the Tarrant County Sheriff has sent a clear  signal to offenders in the community that the safety and well-being of  our children is paramount, and acts of harm and violence will not be  tolerated. The sheriff's department stepped up to make use of the  recent changes to State law that will increase jail time for  solicitation.   We applaud our law enforcement and those dedicated to keeping Texas- 24 safe. Madam Speaker, I thank Sheriff Bill Waybourn and Tarrant  County law enforcement for executing this operation and making strides  to protect our community.                            ____________________
