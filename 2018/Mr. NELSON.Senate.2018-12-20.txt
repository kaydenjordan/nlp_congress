 Mr. President, I add my congratulations.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Thank you, sir. Thank you so much.    Mr. President, it is my understanding that Senator  Schumer wants to speak, and then I will seek recognition later.                            ____________________     Madam President, Syria has been a mess and a concern for  quite a number of years. By putting in a small footprint now of a  little over 2,000 special operations troops, the United States has been  considerably successful when you think of what a chaotic place it was  and still is and that it was especially inimical to the interests of  the United States just a  [[Page S7964]]  few years ago. Remember the horrible images of U.S. citizens being  executed by ISIS. Remember all of the trauma we have seen the Syrian  Government perpetrate on its own people.   Remember the successful efforts of a combination of forces that  ultimately took on ISIS, that removed it from its headquarters of its  caliphate and caused it to disperse if it were not eliminated at the  time. A lot of that was led with Kurdish fighters who were fighting  alongside U.S. special operations advisers. Even though complicated  because of the Russians' being there and the Turks' having interests  and Assad's trying to hang on to power, the United States has been  successful in not eliminating but in lessening the influence of ISIS.   Then came the shocker--the shocker of the President's announcing  unilaterally that, all of a sudden, he was going to pull the special  operations troops, as advisers, out of Syria. This would likely cause  immediate instability. It would certainly allow for ISIS to reconstruct  itself, and it would cause chaos with the Kurdish troops who fought  alongside the Americans, with the Turkish Government's going after a  number of them.   This is an ill-advised and probably a non-advised decision by the  President, and it should be reversed. This Senator calls on all of the  national defense, national security, and national intelligence  professionals who are within the administration to get the President to  reverse this unilateral decision that he has made. Otherwise, U.S.  interests are going to be ill-served.                            ____________________     Madam President, my concluding remarks are about an early  Christmas present that I received this past Monday at a staff going- away party that occurred in Florida, where all of our Florida staff  came together to wish each other well. Little did I know that a special  guest was going to appear. He was none other than one of the chefs of  the catering company that was catering this holiday going-away party.  Let me tell you the story of this 34-year-old chef and what happened 34  years ago.   At the time of the middle 1980s--1985 to be exact--this Senator was a  young Congressman. A husband and wife, who were constituents of mine in  East Central Florida, came to me in great distress because their infant  boy had been born with a defective liver.   The advance of medicine at that particular time was that there was no  known cure except to do a liver transplant. Thirty-four years ago,  organ transplants were still in their infancy, and 34 years ago, there  was no organ registry being maintained in order to try to find a family  who had lost a loved one so that a loved one's organs could be  harvested and then be available for those who were on a registry  waiting for them. None of that existed 34 years ago.   Only since then have we seen this miraculous organization set up  whereby people who need organ transplants can get on the list. Then,  whenever an organ becomes available, no matter where it is in the  country, that match--that organ--is immediately packed in ice and is  flown to the receiving hospital where the organ transplant is going to  occur. None of this existed. It was a catch-as-catch-can to find an  organ to transplant. This was especially true with a liver transplant  because a liver transplant, at the time, had to have the identical  blood type, and it had to be the identical size of the recipient's  liver.   Here was a few-months'-old child who was desperately clinging to life  and needed a liver transplant to survive. At the time, we were in  session. There was a particularly major bill that was up, and its  passage in the House of Representatives was in the balance--within just  a handful of votes. The bill was proposed by President Reagan. I had  already decided that I was going to vote for the bill, which was in  favor of the President's position, when I saw an opportunity to maybe  save this child's life. So I held out and declared my position as  ``undecided'' in my knowing that the votes were coming down to just one  or two at passage.   Actually, we must have been out for the weekend before this vote was  to have occurred, because I received a phone call from President Reagan  while I was at my home in Florida. The President greeted me and told me  what he was asking me to do.   I said to him: Mr. President, I have already decided that I am going  to vote for the bill, and I know that it is welcome news to you. I wish  you would do something for me--possibly save a child's life.   I then told him the story of the need of a liver of a certain blood  type and of a certain size for a transplant in a minor child. The  President said he would do that.   Shortly thereafter, the Secretary of Health and Human Services  called, who was a former colleague from the House--Secretary Margaret  Heckler of Massachusetts. She said: At the President's request, I am  going to have a press conference to put out this information that this  child is in need of this specific type of transplant.   Margaret Heckler did that. A donor was found because of that press  release in 1985 in California. They raced that harvested organ, by jet,  to the hospital in Pittsburgh. Ryan Osterblom, with his parents, was  then flown to the hospital. The successful transplant occurred 34 years  ago.   Early last Monday, you can imagine the Christmas present I received  when there at our going-away party for our staff, the chef of the  catering company was none other than 34-year-old Ryan Osterblom. That  was the best Christmas present I could have.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I join our colleague from Texas in asking  the Senate to take up and pass the Space Frontier Act of 2019. We are  asking to expedite consideration of this bill in order to allow for the  House to take it up and pass it tonight.   I thank Senator Cruz, Senator Markey, and the chairman of the  Commerce Committee, Senator Thune, for working with all of us on this  bipartisan issue.   It updates the commercial launch and Earth observation regulations.  It extends the International Space Station through 2030. This is no  minor task to get that national laboratory that is orbiting high above  the Earth--six human beings are on board right now doing research. All  the people participating, including the commercial sector, know they  will have that national laboratory all the way to the end of the decade  of the 2020s, which is going to allow them to plan and invest. Who  knows what discoveries they will make in this unique environment of  zero gravity.   The act also expands opportunities for partnerships with NASA under  the Agency's enhanced use authority.   Reforms in this bill will help commercial space companies, very  likely in the near future, to have two launches a day. As a result,  jobs will continue to soar as the rockets soar off the launchpads.  Extending the life of the station well through the next decade, as this  bill does, will also ensure that America remains a leader in space  exploration.   Now, we know our goal is to go to Mars with humans, and what this  bill does today furthers that goal by giving us a research outpost in  zero gravity--the International Space Station--by continuing to improve  and perfect America's launch capability.   I remind you, it was only a few years ago that we only had about one- third of the world's launches each year. The United States only had  one-third. We now have upward of two-thirds. A lot of this is occurring  right at Cape Canaveral and the Kennedy Space Center.    So as we set our sights on Mars with the way station at the Moon and  build the technologies and the systems in order to carry humans all the  way to Mars, land, and to return them safely, this bill is another  step, building on the NASA Authorization Act that we passed 1 year ago.   So indeed it is my privilege to be here and to be a part of the  passage of this legislation.
