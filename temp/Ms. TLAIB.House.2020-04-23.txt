 Madam Speaker, this bill is only necessary because, in the  last bill, Republicans prioritized a half-trillion-dollar gift to  corporations that turned around and laid off workers who bailed them  out.   Our people need us to prioritize public health and testing, and they  need recurring monthly relief payments now.   This is Skylar Herbert. You need to see her face because there needs  to be a human face to this pandemic. She is 5 years old, died from  coronavirus. Skylar loved dressing up and performing, and she loved and  adored being in kindergarten. Her death should be a wake-up call that  we must act in urgency.    Her father, a firefighter, her mother a police officer, first  responders, and the amount of guilt that they feel because maybe they  didn't have access to testing, that is exactly why they are out there  telling her story every single day.   Please, let's act now in urgency.    I urge my colleagues to please do more to save lives. It  is immoral for us to walk away and take a month off when people, our  neighbors, are dying and losing loved ones.   So, in memory of Skylar, in honor of her, please let's expand public  health funding and testing for everyone.
