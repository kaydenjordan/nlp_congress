 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 1146.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Today the House of Representatives will take a historic vote to roll  back one provision of the Republican tax law that was rammed through  the last Congress on a party line vote. In addition to the tax breaks  to millionaires, billionaires, and multinational corporations, there  was a provision that mandated oil and gas development in the Arctic  National Wildlife Refuge.   Today we will take up bipartisan legislation to repeal this drilling  mandate, protecting, not just the Arctic Refuge, but the wildlife and  the indigenous people who depend on this sacred natural landscape.   I introduced H.R. 1146 earlier this year with my Republican colleague  Brian Fitzpatrick because we believe, as do 182 other cosponsors of  this bill, that there are some places that are simply too important,  too special, too sacred to be spoiled by oil and gas development. This  is the same basic proposition that we were presented with yesterday  when the House passed bipartisan legislation to protect our coasts from  offshore drilling. Because the north coast of California is too special  to have its fisheries and coastal economy put at risk for the profit of  big oil. Because places like the Lowcountry of South Carolina are too  special to be spoiled by oil spills. Today we are here to show that the  Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, the largest wildlife refuge in the  United States is also too special.   The refuge is home to more than 200 different wildlife species, and  that includes the Porcupine caribou herd that is a vital source of  subsistence for the indigenous Gwich'in people. The refuge is a special  place where veterans recovering from PTSD find themselves again. We  have heard these voices and many others during Natural Resource  Committee deliberations on this bill in a hearing earlier this year.  And I thank all of those who testified and have spoken out to help us  bring this bill to the floor today.   The question before us is: Will the Federal Government protect this  special place and the communities that depend on it or will our Federal  Government be responsible for its destruction by auctioning it off to  big oil? During this debate, my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle are going to ask us and ask the American people to trust this  administration to do the right thing.   They are going to say that drilling can be done responsibly. They  will ask us to trust a Secretary of the Interior who the GAO has  determined violated Federal spending laws during the Trump government  shutdown. A secretary who violated his ethics pledge by meeting with  his former clients at the U.S. Oil and Gas Association as they were  pushing for more drilling on American public lands. And a secretary who  continues to shill for his former lobbying clients at every turn.   They will ask us to trust this administration where the leading  Department of the Interior official pushing for drilling in the Arctic  National Wildlife Refuge just left public service days ago to start a  new job at an oil and gas company with interests, believe it or not, in  Arctic oil and gas development in Alaska. You can't make this stuff up.  They will ask us to trust a President, who, armed with a Sharpie,  overrules scientists and threatens the jobs of scientists when they  speak out.    We need to reject this agenda of big oil and protect America's Arctic  from oil and gas drilling. It is time to pass H.R. 1146 and repeal the  Trump administration tax laws drilling mandate.   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his restraint.  One of the arguments my friend from Alaska invariably makes when we  talk about this issue is the proposed drilling area is just a tiny  little piece of a great big refuge in a great big State. And it is  typically characterized as just a little 2,000-acre postage stamp.   We need to dispel this very inaccurate and disingenuous  characterization. It may be 2,000 acres of hard footprint, but it is  not 2,000 acres of development all in one place. It is spread out  across the coastal plain, which is the beating heart of America's  largest wildlife refuge. And if you want to see what this footprint  really looks like, it is not so tiny, folks. When you look at the  hundreds of miles of roads and the gravel mining and the gravel pads  and the oil rigs and other infrastructure that have to go in, it looks  a lot differently than what has been characterized.   So this picture depicts what the true footprint of this little  postage stamp development in the Arctic refuge looks like. And I think  by any fair measure, it would absolutely despoil the beating heart of  America's largest wildlife refuge.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  Blumenauer), my friend and great champion of our public lands and of  the Arctic refuge.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New  Mexico (Ms. Haaland), the chair of the National Parks, Forests, and  Public Lands Subcommittee of the Natural Resources Committee.    Mr. Chair, I know the gentleman does not mean to  disrespect or trivialize the interests of an indigenous tribe that for  hundreds and hundreds of years has depended on the Porcupine caribou  herd, where its calving grounds and the heart of its migratory road is  right in the refuge we are talking about. I know the gentleman doesn't  mean to disrespect them by suggesting that their voices don't matter,  but we believe that the Gwich'in people's voice does matter. Mr. Chair,  you are going to hear us stand up for their interests consistently on  this issue.   Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Levin).    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I might consume.   Mr. Chair, listen to ``the people who actually live there.'' I wish  we had seen that same concern yesterday when we had a chance to vote on  banning offshore drilling in places where Governors, mayors, and  overwhelming majorities of actual residents don't want to see their  pristine coastlines and their coastal economies despoiled by oil and  gas development.   I am afraid that my friends sometimes have a selective sense of  hearing, but the one consistent voice that always seems to be heard is  that of Big Oil.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Lowenthal), my friend and the chair of the Energy and Mineral Resources  Subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I might consume.   Mr. Chair, we have addressed this postage stamp canard that we often  hear. This is the postage stamp. It is spread out throughout the  coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge. It is the world's biggest postage  stamp, if it is a postage stamp, and it would certainly despoil the  beating heart of America's largest wildlife refuge.                                time  0945    Let me just briefly address this other canard, the idea that Congress  set aside the 1002 area of the refuge for oil and gas development. If  we actually read the law, it was set aside for a study by the  Department of the Interior that would determine if it makes sense to  open up the beating heart of America's largest wildlife refuge to oil  and gas development.   And here is an inconvenient fact: The Department of the Interior  actually found that this is a uniquely vital natural resource that  could be dramatically harmed. That is why, for over 40 years, Congress  has declined to take the step that that law envisioned of opening it up  to oil and gas development. That is, until the last Congress, when it  was slipped in on a party-line vote against the wishes, frankly, of  even many of my friends across the aisle.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Barragan).    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva), the chair of the House Natural  Resources Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Levin).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, this is not about energy independence. If my friends  across the aisle were concerned about energy independence, they  certainly wouldn't have lifted the crude oil export ban in the previous  Congress. And if they wanted to talk about putting that crude oil  export ban back in place, we would have something to work together on  and we could actually take a step towards energy independence.   But the truth is we are awash in oil right now. We are exporting  millions of barrels of oil a day while we continue to import all that  big bad imported oil that sometimes my friends across the aisle are  concerned about.                                time  1000    What this is really about, is money and profits for Big Oil. They  make a lot more money when they can export that oil on the world  market. That is why, when we talk about developing the coastal plain of  the Arctic refuge, no one should be confused by these claims that that  oil would go to American consumption. It won't.   It will find top dollar on the global export market because that is  where Big Oil can make the most money, and that is what the agenda we  have heard about is really all about.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   We just heard some pretty high sanctimony about the need to listen to  the people who actually live there. That might be convincing but for  the fact that just yesterday, my friends voted to override the wishes  of the people who actually live on the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts, the  wishes of their Governors, their mayors, overwhelming majorities of  their populations, who don't want to wreck their pristine coastlines  and put their coastal economies at risk because of oil development.   So, again, let's not pretend that this is about listening to local  voices. This is about listening to one voice, and that is the voice of  Big Oil.   Let's take it back to Alaska. Even in the hotbed of oil development,  as my friends would tell it, in the village of Kaktovik, a 2016 poll in  that community indicated that that community itself is divided on the  question of whether oil and gas development should proceed.   So, again, let's not be selective or hypocritical about the voices we  claim to care about. Certainly, the voice of Big Oil is well- represented here today in this debate.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. I am  prepared to close.    Mr. Chair, it is important to remember that we are  talking about a Federal wildlife refuge, America's Arctic refuge.   Mr. Chair, you would lose sight of that, perhaps, listening to the  pretzel logic we just heard from my friend who at the end of the day  cannot square the selective concern for local voices when it comes to  drilling in a Federal refuge and yet the flouting of local voices when  it comes to drilling, in the Federal interest, the Outer Continental  Shelf on the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts. The disconnect is dizzying.   Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Colorado  (Ms. DeGette), who is one of the Members of Congress who has actually  spent some time in the Arctic refuge.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chair, I have a lot of respect and affection for the dean of the  House. I am sorry that we are on opposite sides of this issue. I am  also sorry that it seems when it comes to oil and gas development in  the Arctic refuge, he is listening to only some of the voices in the  Alaska community.   Mr. Chair, this week, dozens of indigenous Gwich'in leaders flew all  the way to Washington, D.C., as they have done many, many times over  the years, long before I started working on this bill. They do that  because the Arctic refuge is not simply a policy issue for them. It is  not about energy supplies, geopolitics, profits, or scoring political  points. It is about their entire way of life.   Those of us on the floor today don't worry that our entire history  and our entire culture hinge on the outcome of this vote. But for the  people in the gallery today, the Gwich'in who are in the gallery behind  me right now, that is exactly what is at stake.   For those on the other side who would have us destroy this wild and  sacred area for some petroleum profits, I would ask them this: Why now?  Why do we need to do this now? Because once it is done, it is done. The  coastal plain will never be the same again after the drill rigs roll  in.   If we wait, if we conserve, if we protect, and if we treat this  special area with the care it deserves, then it will still be there,  wild and undisturbed for future generations to enjoy. Or maybe my  grandchildren will still be debating Congressman Young's great-great- grandchildren over this same issue on this very floor.   Do you know what? That is fine. I don't mind the debate. That is what  this country is all about. But recklessly throwing open one of the most  special places in this country because a few oil companies want even  higher profits and President Trump wants a win? That is not fine. That  is not worth it.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to protect the Arctic, stand with the  Gwich'in people, and vote ``yes'' on the Arctic Cultural and Coastal  Plain Protection Act.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, unfortunately, this amendment is a stall  tactic to delay the bill's protections for the Arctic refuge from  taking effect until the Secretary of the Interior--a walking conflict  of interest who became the subject of investigations into ethical  violations just 4 days into his job--has conducted a ``consultation''  process and received formal action from one village, the village of  Kaktovik. I wish that same concern for Native American community  consultation had existed before the Republican tax bill was amended to  insert this drilling mandate without any consultation with Native  American Tribes, certainly not the Gwich'in people who may technically  live a little further away from the drilling area, but we are talking  about people who for millennia have depended on the Porcupine caribou  herd that absolutely depends on this pristine beating heart of  America's Arctic refuge.                                time  1030    So again, we are cherry-picking, I am afraid, which voices matter,  which voices get to be listened to, and certainly putting this  Secretary of the Interior in charge of that process would be a cruel  joke.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, let's do be careful about the facts.   More caribou than we have ever had before? That is certainly the case  for the Porcupine caribou herd, precisely because it has had the  benefit of the wilderness management of the coastal plain of the Arctic  Refuge so critical to its migratory pattern and its calving.   Throughout the rest of the Arctic, caribou are in real trouble. Herds  are declining, and a very recent study has confirmed that. So let's  take note of the fact that we have one place where caribou are  thriving. Let's not wreck that place with oil and gas development.   Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Haaland),  chair of the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands.    Mr. Chairman, as I said, this amendment is a delay  tactic to ensure that the current administration will lock in a lease  sale before protections can go into place or before they are finally  run out of office.   It does not require consultation with the Gwich'in people, many of  whom are here today. These are the folks who consider the coastal  plains sacred. They have relied on the Porcupine caribou since time  immemorial for their cultural, spiritual, and physical sustenance, as  well as food security.   There was no demand for Tribal consultation prior to this little  provision being slipped in to the tax giveaway in the previous  Congress. What we are hearing today is a very selective interest in  consultation that would place the entire process in the hands of a  Department of the Interior whose only interest is serving the interests  of big oil.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment and  ``yes'' on the underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment, I am sorry to say, is  another delay tactic in order to buy this administration more time to  jam through a lease sale.   We know that former Assistant Secretary Joe Balash said earlier this  year that the leased sale will happen in 2019 and that the  administration is running over all opposition in order to make that  happen, ignoring concerns of wildlife biologists about impacts from  seismic testing and oil development itself.   Now, I said ``former Assistant Secretary'' when I referred to Mr.  Balash, because he left the Department of the Interior. Just days ago,  he was a top official--remember--pushing for drilling in the Arctic  Refuge, and he left to take a job with an oil company that stands to  profit from the Trump administration's oil giveaway bonanza.   You can't make this stuff up, folks. Anyone who thought Teapot Dome  was the high watermark of corruption at the Department of the Interior  I hope is paying attention to the incredible craven levels of  corruption that we are seeing today. These are the folks who this  amendment would entrust with the authority to call the shots on whether  drilling should proceed.   Unfortunately, this is not a serious proposal. I urge my colleagues  to oppose it, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, the impacts on jobs for Native Americans, for minorities,  for women, this should not be used as a pretext for more oil and gas  drilling, especially in a pristine place like the Arctic Refuge. These  are frontline communities that often bear the brunt of pollution and  environmental justice impact. And it is deeply cynical to try to  suggest that their interest would be a reason to push for more drilling  in a place like the Arctic Refuge.    Mr. Chairman, if my colleagues want to work on jobs and the economic  interest of these communities, we have got a lot to work together on,  but we should do that in a way that looks to the future.   Squeezing a little more fossil fuel out of a special place like the  Arctic Refuge is not the future. Developing clean renewable energy  resources absolutely is the future. I hope some day we can get to the  point of working together to create great, well-paying jobs in those  future interests instead of trying to look backward to the era of  fossil fuels, which I hope we can bring to an end as quickly as  possible.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, this is, unfortunately, another delay tactic  intended to enable this administration to  [[Page H7684]]  rush through oil lease sales in the Arctic refuge.   And now I am afraid my friends across the aisle are really  stretching. This argument that oil development is good for caribou is  something we have heard before. It has been debunked every single time  we hear it.   But, if you really want to see the craven nature of this proposal,  focus on the fact that the person who would make the decision, who  would strike that balance between oil drilling and caribou protection,  is none other than the Secretary of the Interior, David Bernhardt, an  oil and gas lobbyist who temporarily left the payroll of the oil and  gas industry for a little time in public service and has never stopped  representing their interests. And we all know that, a year and a half  from now, he will be right back on Big Oil's payroll.   So this is not a serious argument. This is a delay tactic.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, well, again, this canard that oil and gas  drilling is good for caribou is right out of the ``thank you for  smoking'' playbook. It is just not true.   And rather than subscribe to these alternative facts, we need look no  further than the latest credible science that we have--it is from the  2018 Arctic Report Card--which found that caribou populations across  the Arctic have actually declined by 56 percent over the last two  decades. Yet, there is one exception to that trend, and that is the  Porcupine caribou herd, which has shown strength.   This is good news. It shows the importance of the National Wildlife  Refuge system and the wisdom of protecting this area in the first  place.   There is one place in the Arctic where caribou are thriving. It is a  place where we haven't done oil and gas development.   Let's not wreck the coastal plain of the Arctic refuge. If we care  about caribou, then, by all means, absolutely vote ``no'' on this  amendment and vote ``yes'' on the underlying bill.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to  recommit.    Mr. Speaker, for those who have flights to catch and  would like to get out of here, I think I have some good news. I think  we can keep this pretty short and pretty simple because this is a very  simple bill. It reflects the proposition that there are some places  that are simply too special, that are too unique, that are too  environmentally vital, and that are too sacred to indigenous people to  wreck them with oil and gas development. Surely, that is something that  most Americans and even most people in this body, regardless of their  party, could agree upon.   In fact, we saw bipartisan votes yesterday that reflected the same  proposition that the pristine coasts of the Atlantic, the Lowcountry in  South Carolina, and the beautiful California coast are places too  special to wreck them with new oil and gas development. If my  colleagues believe in this simple proposition, then, surely, it must  apply to America's largest wildlife refuge and to the beating  biological heart of that refuge, the coastal plain of the Arctic  National Wildlife Refuge. That is the simple thing that this bill is  all about.   Unfortunately, this motion to recommit is an attempt to distract us  from that, to delay protections against this drilling, so that this  administration can rush a lease plan forward. Frankly, by that time, it  is too late. You can't go backward once you open a place like this up  to drilling.   Now, my friends' concern for the local voices, some of whom in Alaska  want to see drilling, would be a lot more persuasive if, yesterday, we  hadn't had a vote where my friends across the aisle thumbed their nose  at the local voices in California, South Carolina, Florida, and other  places that don't want offshore drilling. So let's be consistent about  what local voices matter, and let's acknowledge the reality that the  only voice they really are hearing is that of Big Oil.   The truth is that this bill will not affect or impact our role in  global energy markets in the slightest. The minority seems to believe  that we can provide enough oil, if we just drill everywhere, to let  everyone in the world break free of Russian gas or Saudi Arabian oil.   The truth is that we are, right now, the largest oil producer in the  world. We produce over 12 million barrels of crude oil every single  day, and we are not going to be able to corner the market. I certainly  don't think, in light of that fact, that we should put at risk  America's coastal jobs or our biggest wildlife refuge in the Arctic  under this misguided notion of so-called energy dominance.   Now, I want to just close with two things. First, for those who may  still have some fiscal sensibility, I think there are still a few in  this House who would like to talk about fiscal issues. Last week,  Taxpayers for Common Sense said in an op-ed: ``Drilling in the Arctic  Refuge will be difficult and costs from mistakes high. Right now, oil  and gas is plentiful and prices are low, so this isn't the time to  develop marginal areas. It's not like the oil is going away. So without  huge returns, this action will put taxpayers on the hook for a lot of  risk with little potential reward. In the current fiscal and energy  climate, if drilling proposals in the Arctic Refuge move forward, the  joke's on us.''   Let the joke not be on us, colleagues.   Finally, I want to close by pointing out that there are some people  who have traveled thousands of miles to be with us today, all the way  from Alaska, the Gwich'in people, an indigenous community that since  time immemorial have depended on the Porcupine caribou herd and its  migratory route and its calving grounds that are absolutely in the  heart of the coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge. Many of them are here  today.   And, ladies and gentlemen, none of us here on this floor have to  worry about what our ancestors and what our family depend on for our  way of life, for our culture, for what is sacred for them, depending on  the outcome of this vote. For Gwich'in people, that is exactly what is  at stake.   So, colleagues, let's do the right thing for the environment. Let's  recognize that some places are too special to wreck with oil and gas  drilling. Let's do right by the Gwich'in people. Vote ``no'' on this  motion to recommit and ``yes'' on the underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
