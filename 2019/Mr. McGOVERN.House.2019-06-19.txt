 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules,  I call up House Resolution 445 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 445         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 3055) making appropriations for the       Departments of Commerce and Justice, Science, and Related       Agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2020, and       for other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be       dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived.

After general debate the bill       shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule.       An amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the       text of Rules Committee Print 116-18, modified by the       amendment printed in part A of the report of the Committee on       Rules accompanying this resolution, shall be considered as       adopted in the House and in the Committee of the Whole. The       bill, as amended, shall be considered as the original bill       for the purpose of further amendment under the five-minute       rule and shall be considered as read. Points of order against       provisions in the bill, as amended, for failure to comply       with clause 2 of rule XXI are waived.

It shall be in order at any time for the chair of       the Committee on Appropriations or her designee to offer       amendments en bloc consisting of further amendments printed       in part B of the report of the Committee on Rules       accompanying this resolution not earlier disposed of.       Amendments en bloc offered pursuant to this section shall be       considered as read, shall be debatable for 20 minutes equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Appropriations or their respective       designees, shall not be subject to amendment except as       provided by section 4 of this resolution, and shall not be       subject to a demand for division of the question in the House       or in the Committee of the Whole.

Sec. 5.  At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for       amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill, as       amended, to the House with such further amendments as may       have been adopted.

During consideration of H.R. 3055 or during the       further consideration of H.R. 2740, the Chair may entertain a       motion that the Committee rise only if offered by the chair       of the Committee on Appropriations or her designee. The Chair       may not entertain a motion to strike out the enacting words       of the bill (as described in clause 9 of rule XVIII).        Sec. 9.  On any legislative day during the period from June       28, 2019, through July 8, 2019--         (a) the Journal of the proceedings of the previous day       shall be considered as approved; and        (b) the Chair may at any time declare the House adjourned       to meet at a date and time,  [[Page H4780]]       within the limits of clause 4, section 5, article I of the       Constitution, to be announced by the Chair in declaring the       adjournment.        Sec. 10.

It shall be in order at any time on the       legislative day of June 27, 2019, for the Speaker to       entertain motions that the House suspend the rules as though       under clause 1 of rule XV. The Speaker or her designee shall       consult with the Minority Leader or his designee on the       designation of any matter for consideration pursuant to this       section.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Georgia  (Mr. Woodall), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                time  1215                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, I will be asking unanimous consent to  make a technical correction to the rule. The page containing the text  of an uncontroversial amendment, No. 64, to division B was  inadvertently omitted from our 645-page report.                     Modification Offered by Mr. McGovern     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  amendment I have placed at the desk be considered as though printed as  amendment No. 123 in part B of House Report 116-119, if offered by  Representative Lee from Nevada or her designee, and that the amendment  be debatable for 10 minutes equally divided and controlled by the  proponent and an opponent.   The Speaker pro tempore. The Clerk will report the amendment.   The Clerk read as follows:   Amendment Offered by Mrs. Lee of Nevada:         Page 109, line 7, after the first dollar amount, insert       ``(reduced by $500,000)''.        Page 109, line 13, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(reduced by $500,000)''.        Page 109, line 15, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(reduced by $500,000)''.        Page 159, line 19, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(increased by $500,000)''.     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for  his kindness.   Madam Speaker, on Tuesday, the Rules Committee met and reported a  rule, House Resolution 445. It provides for consideration of H.R. 3055  under a structured rule that makes 290 amendments in order. It also  provides for 1 hour of general debate controlled by the chair and  ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations.   Madam Speaker, this appropriations process represents a clean break  from the way the Republicans ran this place. They furthered an agenda  that was like Robin Hood in reverse, giving to the rich by stealing  from the poor.   This Democratic majority has a radical idea that the people's House  should, instead, work for the people, not the wealthy and the well- connected, but all Americans. You can see these values in the  underlying appropriations measure.   We support SNAP, our Nation's premier anti-hunger program, by  providing both stable funding and investments in the SNAP reserve fund.  This will give a helping hand to many of the 40 million Americans who  are struggling to put food on the table in America today.   That includes a lot of working families. It includes veterans. It  includes seniors. It includes those who are disabled. Because the truth  is, there is no plan B for many people who have fallen on hard times.  Food pantries are important, but many are already stretched too thin  and can't meet the demand.   We need to invest in SNAP. This program is a lifeline as families  work to get back on their feet.   For the life of me, Madam Speaker, I don't understand why investing  in SNAP has been a controversial subject for many of my colleagues on  the other side, why some have demonized the poor and traded in  stereotypes year after year.   On average, and I think it is important to make this clear for my  colleagues, SNAP households receive about $259 a month. The average  SNAP benefit per person is about $128 per month, which works out to  just $1.40 per person per meal.   Madam Speaker, $1.40 can hardly buy a cup of coffee for someone, let  alone a healthy, nutritious meal. That is what we are asking people to  live on, and it is a shame. I hope, in the future, we can find a way to  expand the SNAP benefit for those who are in need.   This bill also provides major funding to help stem the tide of opioid  abuse, which is ravaging communities across the country, through grant  programs that we know work, things like prescription drug monitoring,  overdose-reversal drugs, and at-risk youth programs.   We are not waiting around for this administration's long-delayed  transportation plan. The President has been rolling it out 2 weeks from  now for the last 2 years. We have an infrastructure emergency in our  country today. I have bridges in my district that are old enough to  qualify for Medicare. Others are older than some of the other States in  this country. It is the same old story all across the country.   That is why the American Society of Civil Engineers has given our  Nation's infrastructure a D-plus. This is appalling, Madam Speaker. We  owe a lot to those who built our roads and bridges a century ago, but  we cannot expect them to last forever. H.R. 3055 would provide real  funding now to rebuild crumbling infrastructure.   There are also badly needed investments here in our Nation's digital  infrastructure because the sad reality is that in America today, 25  million people in rural communities don't have access to high-speed  internet. Some are in my State.   Massachusetts has made significant strides in bringing high-speed  internet to the rural parts of western and central Massachusetts, but  there are still pockets where connectivity is still a problem.   This bill would fund an expansion of rural broadband services that  would allow more kids to do homework at home, expand economic  opportunities, and improve health outcomes. Affordable broadband should  be available to everyone, regardless of their ZIP Codes.   This bill also helps combat the gun violence epidemic by increasing  resources for programs that help reduce crime. This includes things  like fully funding the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check  System, making schools safer, and investing in mentoring programs for  at-risk youth.   This follows language in last week's minibus appropriations bill that  provided funding to research deaths and injuries caused by gun violence  for the first time in more than 20 years because this majority isn't  afraid to stand up to the NRA to protect the people we represent. We  know the will of the American people is stronger than the might of the  gun lobby.   There is also language in this bill that prohibits President Trump  from  [[Page H4781]]  diverting important military construction projects to build his  unnecessary border wall. This is a wall, by the way, that the President  claimed time and time again that Mexico would pay for. Now he is using  a bait-and-switch to force taxpayers to foot the bill.    This wall was preposterous when it was just a campaign talking point.  It is even more absurd as an actual policy paid for by the taxpayers of  this country.   These are just a few of our priorities in the bill. We are delivering  on our promise to invest in the things that matter to people.   Chairwoman Lowey, Ranking Member Granger, the entire Appropriations  Committee, and their staffs have done an extraordinary job. Their work  deserves a great deal of praise by both the Democrats and Republicans.  They are trying to fund our government in a timely way.   I don't know what the Senate is going to do on appropriations. They  haven't done much of anything on anything so far.   But I do know this: These bills are an investment in our future. They  are tailored toward providing opportunity for all Americans and  delivering on our pledge to make this place work for them again.   Fixing our infrastructure, reducing gun violence, providing economic  opportunity for small businesses, ending hunger, these are the kinds of  things our constituents want us to address.   I urge all of my colleagues to show the American people that we are  listening by voting for this rule. Let's keep bringing forward  appropriations measures that truly represent the will of the taxpayer.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I enjoy listening to the gentleman engage in debate,  but I will say this, that when I look at this rule and all the  amendments in order, I think I want to waive this rule because there  are so many amendments that we are making in order here.    The gentleman, I appreciate his praise saying that we made a lot of  good ideas in order, but I would say to the gentleman that he also made  some bad ideas in order. The gentleman referred to his amendment, which  I disagree with. But we also made amendments from other Republicans; I  am looking at the rule here: Mr. Burgess, Mr. Rutherford, Mr. Scalise,  Mr. King, Mr. Posey, Mr. Walberg, Mr. Gosar, Mr. McKinley, Mr. Hudson,  and Mrs. Walorski. I could go right through this and continue to read  the Republican amendments that we made in order.   In the Rules Committee last night during the markup, my friends  offered a number of amendments. Of the amendments they offered, nearly  half of them violated House rules or were duplicative.   When people draft amendments in a way that legislate on  appropriations bills or violate any of the House rules, it has been  customary for Democrats and Republicans to not make them in order. We  try to work with them to fix them, but last night, many of the  amendments, including a Democratic amendment that the minority offered  we could not vote for because it was not complying with the House  rules.   I am sorry that that is the case, but people need to know that, when  you are amending appropriations bills, you need to draft them in a way  that is compliant with the House rules.   A lot of the amendments that were offered by my friends were the  oldies but goodies. We have wall amendments, abortion amendments, and  stuff that we have voted on time and time and time and time again; and  I appreciate they want more time to vote on it, but we need to get our  work done here.   As the gentleman referred to, there is a Member on the other side who  has decided to have a little bit of a temper tantrum and call for a  vote on every single amendment and try to invoke every single  procedural measure so that everything is dragged out and moves at a  snail's pace. That is his right. I don't think it is a particularly  effective tactic, but if it makes him happy, he can do whatever he  wants. He has that right to do that on the House floor.   I was in the minority in the last session, and I lived through the  most closed Congress in the history of our country when the Republicans  brought more bills to the floor that were completely closed and that  were unamendable. Nobody could offer an idea. They did that more than  any other Congress in history. So we are trying to do this better. I  think we are, in many respects, doing it better, and we are going to  continue in that spirit.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Maine (Ms.  Pingree), who is a distinguished member of the Appropriations  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Maine an  additional 1 minute.    Madam Speaker, let me just address the issue of the  Endangered Species Act that the gentleman referred to. It is not a  ``Washington knows best'' and is certainly not a ``politicians know  best'' approach. It is based on science, on available science, not on a  special interest that is trying to get a different outcome.   If you don't believe in the direction of the act, if you don't  believe that it should be adhered to, then the remedy is to introduce  an alternative law. I would certainly vote against it, but the  gentleman has a right to do that.   The Endangered Species Act already ensures there is public notice and  public participation. There is an opportunity to comment on listing and  delisting decisions.   It is our view that Congress should not interfere in the process  outlined by the Endangered Species Act because it then becomes about  politics--not science, but politics--and it should be science that  determines the survival of a species.   I know science is a tough subject for my friends on the other side to  deal with, because so many of them don't even believe that we have a  climate crisis. But, in any event, I just wanted to respond.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Connolly).    Madam Speaker, I would point out to the gentleman that  this legislation contains the largest increase to combat Asian carp in  years.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Morelle), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, let me just say to the gentleman from  Iowa that we made in order last night one of his amendments related to  the census question. And I strongly disagree with him on that. I hope  we can defeat the amendment with a strong bipartisan vote.   But, nonetheless, we made his amendment in order, and I look forward  to the debate on the floor and, again, look forward to voting ``no'' on  it.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I thank the gentleman from Ohio for the constructive way that he has  brought his concerns to the floor. I am very sympathetic to what he is  trying to do. The Appropriations Committee believes that the funding  level in the bill will support hiring the maximum number of immigration  judges who can be brought on board in a single year. Nonetheless, we  are going to have to invest significantly more because there is a  backlog.   I think the problem with his amendment, and we talked about this last  night, was the offset. He wanted, basically, to take $71 million from  the general legal activities, which funds Justice Department divisions  such as the Civil Rights Division; the Civil Division, which includes  funding for cases involving consumer and elder fraud; the Criminal  Division, which includes mutual legal assistance reform; and the  Environment and Natural Resources Division. These litigation components  do a great deal of important work.   I think the conversation should continue, and we should, hopefully,  be able to build consensus around an offset that doesn't rob Peter to  pay Paul.   I appreciate the gentleman from Ohio very much.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I appreciate the fact that the gentleman appreciates the staff who  have been forced to remain here late into the night and into the early  morning while he has insisted on vote after vote after vote. I am  willing to venture a guess that the staff doesn't appreciate him very  much.   I appreciate that the gentleman wants to do something about the here  and now, about what is happening right this second. I wish the  gentleman had that same attitude before he voted to delay the  implementation of the emergency supplemental bill to deal with the  disasters that hit Texas and a number of other States.   Let me assure the gentleman that we are very concerned about the  humanitarian crisis at the border, and we are  [[Page H4786]]  engaged in negotiations with the Senate and the White House, trying to  resolve this.   There are serious humanitarian needs at the border, many of which  have been exacerbated by the Trump administration's cruel immigration  policies. I mean, House Democrats understand these urgent needs. We  want to address them, and negotiations continue.   Appropriators are continuing to have important conversations about  how best to balance funding to address the humanitarian needs of the  border with the imperative to hold this administration accountable.   If Republicans work with us, I am told that, by July 4th recess, we  can pass a bicameral, bipartisan bill to provide humanitarian funding  and protect the rights and the dignity of migrants.   It is hard for me to accept that the heart of what this  administration is doing has anything to do with being humanitarian,  with caring about the plight of these migrants. I have seen the  separation of children from their parents, the cruel separation of  children from their parents at the border. I have listened to this  President go on a rampage, diminishing the plight of these refugees, in  many cases, fleeing for their lives.   We are working, hopefully, in a bipartisan, bicameral way to get this  done. But I would say this: If we care about doing what is right from a  humanitarian perspective, it is not embracing the policies of this  President.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I  want to thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall), who is my  friend, and all those who participated in the debate here today.   Let me just make one observation about the previous question and this  debate on the border crisis. I am looking at a Politico column that  just appeared at 12:58 p.m. It says:         House inches toward 11th hour deal on funding the border       crisis.    We probably would have reached a deal already, because the  negotiations have been ongoing, but instead, Members have had to spend  an inordinate amount of time on the House floor voting on amendment  after amendment that passed almost unanimously.   One of the things I have learned about this place is that we have a  lot of people who like to embrace the theater of Washington, and  sometimes it becomes the theater of the absurd, people who know that  issues are about to be solved, but who then stand up and demand that it  gets solved so that when it gets solved, they can take a bow and take  credit.   The bottom line is what has gone on on this House floor has delayed,  I think, a solution here that we all want, and my hope is that Politico  is correct and that we will get to this resolution soon and that there  will be a big, strong, bipartisan support of whatever the agreement is,  but I assure you about one thing, no deal is coming to a conclusion  because of the theatrics that have happened on this House floor with  demanding vote after vote after vote.   It really has become silly, it has become absurd, and I think we are  better than that.   If people want to solve issues, they ought to support the negotiators  of both parties that are trying to work  [[Page H4787]]  out a deal, and that is the way this place should operate. When it  doesn't, it becomes silly, and that is what has been going on here.   Madam Speaker, I would urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the  previous question.   I would also say that there is no such thing as a perfect rule or  perfect bill, but this is it. There are 290 amendments that are going  to be debated on this. That is not clamping down on the process. There  are 290 amendments.   There are a lot of amendments here. I started reading some of the  Republican amendments that have been made in order. I have got to be  honest with you, a lot of them, I think, are really terrible ideas, and  I am going to fight like hell to try to defeat them because they are so  bad. But they are going to have their day on the floor and they are  going to be able to debate them.   That is not counting all the bipartisan amendments that have been  made in order where Democrats and Republicans actually came together  and forged a collaboration and a coalition to try to get stuff done for  the good of our country.   Now, Madam Speaker, I understand that some watching this debate might  find the appropriations process to be a little arcane, but it is  actually incredibly important.   It is about whether Congress is going to make investments that give  everyone in this country a shot at a better life. That is even more  important today, especially with this administration in power.   Republicans have claimed for years to want a government so small that  they could drown it in a bathtub. Well, this administration is taking  it one step further, and wants a government small enough to leave  millions of poor and working Americans with nowhere to turn. That is  why it has released one extreme proposal after the next that would cut  government spending to the bone for hardworking families, all while the  wealthy get a windfall.   I have heard from so many in my district that are rightly frustrated  by this approach. They want to see investments made in our communities  that help all Americans, and that is what this does.   Let me say it again. The Appropriations Committee, the Democrats and  the Republicans on the Appropriations Committee and their staffs,  deserve bipartisan praise for the incredible amount of work they have  put into this.   If you want to grow our economy and you want to combat gun violence,  you want to rebuild our infrastructure, and more, then you should  support this bill.   My friends on the other side who talked about wanting to debate more  Republican ideas on the House floor should also support this bill,  because, again, we are making 290 amendments in order for this bill.  Again, some of them I agree with, some of them I plan to vote against,  but they are all going to be debated.   Madam Speaker, I will conclude by saying, in addition to thanking the  Appropriations Committee and their staff, I want to thank the Rules  Committee, the Democrats and the Republicans, and our staffs, for all  the time that they have put in during, not only this week but last week  as well. It is like final exam week. These are all-nighters for the  staff, and oftentimes that gets overlooked, so I want to thank them for  their patience and for their diligent work.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' on the previous question, ``yes'' on  this rule and on the underlying resolution.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Woodall is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 445         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 14. That immediately upon adoption of this resolution,       the House shall resolve into the Committee of the Whole House       on the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       3056) to provide supplemental appropriations relating to       border security, and for other purposes. The first reading of       the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Appropriations. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. Points of order against provisions in the       bill for failure to comply with clause 2 of rule XXI are       waived. Clause 2(e) of rule XXI shall not apply during       consideration of the bill. When the committee rises and       reports the bill back to the House with a recommendation that       the bill do pass, the previous question shall be considered       as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final       passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of       the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution       on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House       shall, immediately after the third daily order of business       under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the       Whole for further consideration of the bill.        Sec. 15. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 3056.     Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.
