 Mr. Speaker, Mr. Green is not just a passionate  representative of the people of the Ninth District of Texas, he speaks  for millions and millions of people across the country. It has been  very moving to hear him talk about the problem of police brutality and  violence, which threatens our social contract.   The whole purpose of the social contract is that we will be safer  inside of it than we will be outside of it. And, yet, the social  contract is not working for a lot of people in a lot of different parts  of the country.   So I thank him for his passionate leadership on behalf of the George  Floyd Justice in Policing Act and for having us address this central  problem.                                time  1300    I appreciate your yielding to me. I wanted to spend a few minutes  talking about what is going on in the Middle East. It has been a brutal  week for Israeli and Palestinian civilians, as hundreds have been  killed in the savage violence that is engulfing the Middle East now.   This week I had the opportunity to meet on Zoom with young  Palestinians and Israelis who are part of a group called New Story  Leadership, which is a peace-building group that, since 2009, has  brought Israeli and Palestinian interns to come work on Capitol Hill.   I have had these interns work for me for, I think, 5 or 6 years,  really ever since I arrived in the House of Representatives. They come  to work, and they come to interact with each other. They come to learn  about democracy and human rights from America, a country that was  conceived with the dream of human rights and equality for everybody.  Although that was not remotely the reality for a lot of people, but it  has been the struggle for human rights and for equality that has  defined the American ethos and the American spirit.   So I asked these young Israeli and Palestinian former interns for me  and for other Members of Congress, as part of the New Story Leadership  program, to write to me about what is going on in their lives. Because  too often, of course, our sense of what is happening in a foreign land  is filtered through media, and it is filtered through different kinds  of party propaganda. I wanted to hear directly from them. I thought I  would share with you some of the responses I got. I want to enter them  into the Congressional Record.   Here is one from a Jewish Israeli citizen named Meshi: My name is  Meshi. I am an Israeli American, currently living in Tel Aviv. I was  born and raised in northern Israel, where my early childhood was spent  under rocket fire from Hezbollah. Today, in my late 20s, I am under  rocket fire from Hamas. In the last week or so, I have taken shelter in  my building's old stairway. I have run for cover in the street. I saw  the lynching of an Arab citizen by a Jewish mob on live TV. And I  worried for my brother-in-law, who had to leave my sister and their  newborn son at home after he was called into reserve duty.   Here's one from a Jewish Israeli citizen named Eran: My name is Eran  Nissan. I was an intern in Congressman Raskin's office in 2019. I  became a peace activist because of my military service, where I served  as a combat soldier in the Israeli Special Forces. For 4 years, I was  sent to countless missions to all of Israel's borders: Lebanon, Syria,  but mainly the West Bank and Gaza Strip. I experienced combat. I lost  friends and I lost classmates. These past 2 weeks have been the  scariest and most depressing time of my entire life. I spent the last  week monitoring rightwing groups on social media, where terrorist  organizations planned and organized lynchings and riots throughout  Israel. I did this as part of my digital activism, working with former  intelligence officers turned progressive political activists. My  neighborhood in Jaffa used to be a beacon of coexistence and  cooperation between Jews and Arabs. Now it is a war zone. The sounds of  exploding stun grenades from the nearby riots are only disturbed by the  sirens sending everyone into the shelters and stairways.   This is from Marwa, who is a Palestinian on the West Bank: My name is  Marwa Odeh. I am a Palestinian American from Hewara in Area C of the  West Bank. I was an intern in Congressman  [[Page H2637]]  Raskin's office in 2018. This year, a Muslim high holy day became a day  of chaos and despair for my family. On the day of Eid, May 13, my  cousin Yehya, who I used to play soccer with in my grandparents'  backyard, was shot in the eye with a rubber bullet fired by an Israeli  soldier. The rubber bullet tore open his left eyeball, leaving Yehya  blind in one eye. After that military action, my mother and my baby  sister Jena traveled to the hospital and were caught in a barrage of  tear gas and rubber bullets. Jena, who is just 5 years old, explained  to me the horror and fear that she went through: ``I was choking and my  eyes were burning. We were just going to see Yehya. We did nothing,''  she told me in a FaceTime call that night.   Here's one from Lujayn, a Palestinian who lives in East Jerusalem: My  name is Lujayn. I am a Palestinian living in East Jerusalem, in a small  village called Beit Hanina, which is surrounded by settlements. One of  the most basic human rights is to feel safe and secure, but my family  and I cannot feel safe in East Jerusalem. We can't feel safe because  settlers under the protection of Israeli soldiers are chanting ``Death  to Arabs'' and attacking Palestinians in my neighborhood. I can't feel  safe because an Israeli soldier threw a stun grenade at my father as we  walked out of Al-Aqsa Mosque during Ramadan. I can't feel safe walking  to the market and even sitting in my own house. During the past few  days, I have been telling my sisters and parents to turn off the lights  at home so that no one will think we are there. When I traveled to my  university a few days ago to get my diploma, I felt like a walking  target because I was constantly afraid I would be attacked just because  I am a Palestinian.   Here's one from Danni, a Jewish Israeli: My name is Danni, and I am a  Jewish Israeli. I am engaged to an Israeli combat soldier, and we live  in Haifa, which is known as the city of coexistence. In Haifa, I study  and work with Arabs and Jews alike. Last week, our city was hit by a  wave of violence by citizens against citizens. Violent extremists have  roamed the streets, terrorizing people and vandalizing people. Dear  American people, I know that you understand how dangerous it is to stay  silent when you see discrimination, oppression, and violence. It is  simply unsustainable. We need to move past the status quo so that I can  marry my fiance instead of him going to war, only to return to a broken  city.   Here's one from Tasnim, who lives in the Gaza: My name is Tasnim, and  I am a Palestinian from Gaza. My family and I left Gaza during the 2008  war. Unfortunately, when we moved, my sister was separated from her  children and they stayed in Gaza. Today, my two nieces, Iama and Heba,  who are young and dream of traveling the world, still live there in  Gaza. Since the airstrikes have started, we have been calling them  every single day to check to see if they are still alive. We hear of  constant attacks where kids are being buried under the rubble of their  own houses, along with their dreams. We are constantly afraid that the  next time we call them, we will not be able to reach them. The fear and  stress that come with trying to connect with my family in Gaza is  unimaginable.    Mr. Speaker, forgive me, how much time do I have remaining?    This is from Baha, a Palestinian from the West Bank: My  name is Baja Ebdeir, and I am from the occupied village of Beit  Nattiff. Now I live in Beit Jala. This past Ramadan, Israel refused to  issue permits for Palestinians to observe prayers at Al-Aqsa Mosque.  However, my father was one of the few luckiest to be issued a permit  for a medical appointment he had at the hospital in East Jerusalem. It  was not the medical appointment itself that got my father all excited  and happy, but the fact that he could use it to observe the holiest  night of Ramadan, Laylit Al-Qadr, the night of decree, at Al-Aqsa  Mosque, where our destiny is determined by God for the whole year.  Before he left, my father told us, ``After all, I have a permit, what  could happen?''   Actually, a lot happened in the two days my father spent at Al-Aqsa.  As the evening went by, an army of Israeli soldiers began to increase  in number. As soon as the Imam uttered ``Allah Akbar,'' God is the  greatest, to start off the holiest night prayer, Israeli soldiers threw  gas canisters at worshipers. As a result of the excessive amount of gas  my father inhaled, his severe coughing continues until today and his  eyes are as red as blood.   Usually my father never shares his fears with me, but this time he  opened up and I listened with awe. With every cough, my father vividly  remembers Al-Aqsa Mosque as a war zone where Israeli soldiers shot  rubber bullets and threw gas canisters at Palestinians. Hundreds were  injured and many of the elderly lost their lives on the holiest night.   Here is one from Doron, a Jewish Israeli citizen: My name is Doron,  and I am an Israeli who has lived in Jerusalem for the last decade.  Since 2009, I have participated in peaceful protests in the  neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah every week. I was touched to see how  during the recent few months, these protests have gained support and  momentum in Israel, Palestine, and internationally. Suddenly, activists  in the region and around the world demanded justice for the residents  of Sheikh Jarrah, who have been evicted from their homes.  Unfortunately, everything was disrupted by the recent escalation, which  was orchestrated to undermine the local movement in Jerusalem before it  was able to achieve any gains. Jerusalem is the home of Israelis and  Palestinians, and it should be equal, free, and safe for all its  inhabitants. Residents of Sheikh Jarrah should not be afraid to be  evicted from their homes at any moment.   Here is one from Diala, a Palestinian citizen of Israel: My name is  Diala, and I am a Palestinian citizen of Israel from Nazareth. During  the past few weeks, I have protested alongside many Palestinian women  against evictions in the neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah in Jerusalem. I  am a feminist and I strongly believe that the struggle for gender  equality is deeply connected to this struggle. As the police cracked  down on us, a group of peaceful protestors consisting primarily of  women, an Israeli police officer kicked me and pushed me to the ground.  As I lay on the ground, he continued to kick me, aiming at my legs and  ribs. Throughout my life, I have been told repeatedly that I have full  and equal rights as a citizen of Israel. However, this week, I have  witnessed the oppressive brutality at play against me and my people.   Mr. Speaker, we owe these young people a different future. In Israel  and in the West Bank and in Gaza, we owe them a future of peace and  justice and prosperity, where rockets are not raining down on the  people of Israel or the people in the West Bank or the people in Gaza.  We owe them a future where every young person can cultivate his or her  own creative talents and dreams for the future. We owe them a future of  mutual security for all sides and human rights for all people.   Everyone knows that the first casualty of war is the truth. We want  to make sure that the stories that people are living on the ground are  not consumed in any kind of party propaganda.   I urge my colleagues to listen to the voices of young Israelis and  young Palestinians suffering through this brutal cycle of violence and  ethnic conflict and systemic injustice. We owe it to them to call  openly and loudly on Prime Minister Netanyahu and on Hamas to accept an  immediate cease-fire and an end to all violence against civilians. This  is the precondition for moving forward to real peace and respect for  the human rights of all.   I applaud President Biden and his administration's commitment to  ending this violence. I hope that America will, again, with the new  administration, be able to resume a forward-looking and constructive  role in addressing all of the problems that beset the people in Israel  and the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, this week I met on Zoom with young Israelis and  Palestinians who are part of New Story Leadership, a peacebuilding  group that, since 2009, has brought dozens of Palestinian and Israeli  youth to work as summer interns on Capitol Hill and to share their  stories with Members of Congress. Here are a few of the stories my  former interns and other participants sent me about the horrific events  of the last few weeks:  [[Page H2638]]                                 Meshi--Jewish Israeli    My name is Meshi, I'm an Israeli American, currently living in Tel- Aviv.

Hundreds were injured and  many of the elderly lost their lives on the holiest night.

Moe--Palestinian from the West Bank    My name is Moe and I am a Palestinian from the West Bank, I interned  with Congressman Jamie Raskin in 2019.   Seven months ago I got married. This year, my wife and I celebrated  our first Ramadan together. We were so excited to celebrate it together  with both our families, but her family was unable to travel to see us,  because all the roads had been closed and settlers have been patrolling  the streets between the cities ready to attack Palestinian travelers.  We can't see our family and we can't travel anywhere.   I have heard about the danger that awaits us if we travel outside of  our village and I am terrified. I am worried for the safety of my three  brothers and father, who have jobs that require them to travel to  Israel. Now, they are stuck at home, unable to travel because they have  been warned that if they try to cross the border between the West Bank  and Israel, their lives would be in danger.
