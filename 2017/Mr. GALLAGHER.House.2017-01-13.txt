 Mr. Speaker, like every marine of my generation,  during my time in the Corps I gained a profound respect for General Jim  Mattis as simply the finest warrior that we have produced since Chesty  Puller, and much has been made in the last few weeks about his war- fighting prowess.   What commands my respect, why I rise today, and what I believe binds  [[Page H527]]  Jim so closely to the hearts of everyone who has ever worn the uniform  is his humility. General Mattis understands not only how to wield  military power decisively but also its limits. General Mattis also  realizes that the true source of our military strength doesn't come  from the E-ring of the Pentagon but, rather, from the fighting spirit  of the brave soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines that are deployed  right now doing a very dangerous job.   As the chairman mentioned, they deserve a Secretary of Defense on day  one. With Jim Mattis as that Secretary, they will have a leader who  always puts their welfare first and their mission first.   Now, I respect the concerns of my colleagues about the longstanding  principle of civilian control of the military, but I know Jim Mattis  personally, and I know how seriously he holds this principle as well.  When I deployed to Iraq in 2007 and again in 2008, it was the words of  General Mattis that reminded us that, if we ever showed contempt for  civilians, we would give the enemy a victory.   So I say, for the mission's sake, for our country's sake, and the  sake of men and women who have carried our colors in past battles,  let's come together today in support of Jim Mattis and thereby send a  signal to the world that there is once again no better friend, no worse  enemy than the United States of America.   Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.
