 Madam Speaker, if the Statue of Liberty  could cry, she would be crying today. As I stand here, there are 2,300  babies and kids who were ripped away from their parents by our  government and are in detention facilities across America.   America was a country founded by people fleeing persecution. We are a  land of immigrants. President Ronald Reagan called us ``that shining  city upon the hill.''   Unfortunately, Donald Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Nielsen  have perverted that grand legacy and have now engaged in the functional  equivalent of kidnapping.   You can believe in any God or no God at all and conclude that ripping  kids away from their parents is immoral. I believe in Jesus Christ.  Every single thing in the Gospels and what Christ taught goes against  the policy of family separation.   Imagine being a mother and father and losing your child to the  government and not knowing if you are ever going to see your child  again, the horror of that.   Imagine being a child; when you are young, your parents are likely  the most important people in your life. Imagine being ripped away from  your mother or father and not knowing if you are ever going to see them  again, and then being placed in a detention facility with strangers.  Imagine the horror and fear you will see doing that. What must that  sound like?   (Audio being played.)    For what reason, Madam Speaker?    Cite the rule, Madam Speaker.    There is no rule that says I can't play  sounds.    Why are you trying to prevent the  American people from listening to what it sounds like in a detention  facility?    These are babies and kids in a detention  facility. Why do you not let the American people hear what they are  saying?    There is no rule in the House that says I  cannot play sounds from a detention facility.    Read the rule. It does not say I cannot  play sounds from a detention facility.   Why are we hiding this from the American people?    Why are we hiding it from the American  people?    Why are we hiding it from the American  people?    We have 2,300 babies and kids----    We have 2,300 babies and kids in  detention facilities who were ripped away from their parents. I think  the American people need to hear this.                                time  1300     Madam Speaker, I think the American  people need to hear this ProPublica tape of a detention facility of  babies and children who were ripped away from their parents.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance  of my time.                            ____________________
