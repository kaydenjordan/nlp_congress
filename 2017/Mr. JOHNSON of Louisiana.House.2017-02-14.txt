 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include any extraneous material in the Record.    Mr. Speaker, today a bipartisan group of 46  freshman Members of this 115th U.S. Congress, representing red and blue  States from coast to coast, released a document that we have entitled  the ``Commitment to Civility.''   This evening, I am grateful to be joined on the floor by 21 different  leaders of our class, representing diverse districts in 15 different  States across our great Nation to speak to this important and very  timely issue.   This commitment document was created in early January following our  initial meetings together as a class. We discussed our mutual intent to  serve the best interest of the country, and to return to statesmanship  that was revered and modeled by the great leaders of our history.    I drafted this document to memorialize our Members' agreement to,  among other things, work towards restoring collegiality and civility in  the Congress; encouraging more productive dialogue; and building  consensus and strengthening the public's trust in America's  institutions.   This document is not intended in any way as a criticism of anyone  else in any other Chamber or branch of the government. Rather, it  represents the mutual commitments of the Members of our class that we  have made among and between ourselves.   As we teach our own children, we often have no control over what  others may do, but we are ultimately responsible for our own actions.  Personally, I want to say how encouraging it is to work with others  from across the political spectrum who want to lead by example and work  to restore civility in our public discourse. There may never have been  a more important time for that very important effort.   I am one who is regarded as probably being among the most  conservative Members of the Congress, and I will never deviate from my  core principles. However, I am mindful to always remember that while  some of my colleagues and I may have very different ideas and core  political philosophies, at the end of the day, we are all Americans and  we are all made in the image of God; thus, we believe we should act  accordingly.   Before my esteemed colleagues come to share their thoughts on this  important subject, I would like to introduce and read into the    =========================== NOTE ===========================        February 14, 2017, on page H1162, the following appeared: Before  my esteem colleagues come to . . .

It reads as follows:   ``As new Members of the United States House of Representatives and as  individual citizens we recognize the gravity of the responsibility we  have been given and the significance of this moment in the history of  our extraordinary country.   ``America remains the most free, most powerful and most prosperous  nation in all the world, and yet we face significant challenges. Among  these challenges has been an increasing division in and coarsening of  our culture fueled too often by the vitriol in our politics and public  discourse. One result has been a loss of trust in our institutions and  elected officials.   ``We believe there is a better alternative.   ``Although we represent both political parties and a wide range of  individual views across the political spectrum, our common and sincere  aims are to serve the needs and interests of the American people, to  work with one another and the leaders of our respective parties to  encourage greater confidence in our institutions, and to set an example  of statesmanship for the younger generation of Americans that will  follow.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        February 14, 2017, on page H1162, the following appeared: . . .  an example statesmanship for the . . .

We also believe that maintaining a  spirit of mutual understanding and cooperation will help make  government work more efficiently and effectively, help build consensus  and restore the public trust, and, ultimately, serve as a positive  influence on society at large.   ``For all of these reasons, we hereby pledge our names to this  Commitment to Civility on this 10th day of January, 2017, in  Washington, D.C.''    =========================== NOTE ===========================        February 14, 2017, on page H1162, the following appeared: For  all of these reasons, we hereby . . .

Mr. Speaker, at this time, I am delighted to yield to 21 different  leaders of our class, representing both political parties and 15  different States across our great land. Each will express their own  thoughts on this important subject.   I begin by yielding to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Barragan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Bergman).                                time  1700     Mr. Speaker, I thank the general for his  service to our country.   I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Suozzi).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Gallagher).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Kansas (Mr. Marshall).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Carbajal).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Nebraska (Mr. Bacon).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Panetta).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Lewis).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman  from New York (Ms. Tenney).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman  from Delaware (Ms. Blunt Rochester).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Smucker).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Khanna).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Crist).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick).    Mr. Speaker, I thank all these colleagues.  We were anticipating remarks from Mr. Gonzalez of Texas, Mr. Comer of  Kentucky, Mr. Raskin of Maryland, and Mr. Lawson of Florida, but their  schedules have suddenly taken them away this evening.   Mr. Speaker, I will close.   As you can see, our commitment to civility is sincere and important  to each of us and, we believe, to the Congress and to our country. As  we said at the outset here, there may never have been a more important  time for a commitment like this. Perhaps it is appropriate that our  hour happened to be assigned here on this Valentine's Day.   I am reminded, as I close, of the biblical admonition given to us in  Philippians, Chapter 2, Verses 3 through 4. It reads as follows: ``Do  nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility,  value others above yourselves, not looking to your own interests but  each of you to the interests of the others.''   Mr. Speaker, if we can do these things, we will do well by our  exceptional Nation.   I thank all of my esteemed colleagues for participating tonight and  all those who signed this commitment.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
