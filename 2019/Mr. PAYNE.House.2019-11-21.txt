 Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge the Senate majority  leader, Mitch McConnell, to bring our bills to the floor.  [[Page H9155]]    My House colleagues and I have passed 400 bills this Congress--400.  Unfortunately, more than 300 are stuck on McConnell's desk, including  275 bipartisan bills.   These bills include things like raising the minimum wage, protecting  retirees, protecting consumers when they sign contracts, and support  for our veterans. These are not partisan issues. These are American  issues.   Every day, we are trying to do the will of the American people; every  day, we fight to make their lives better; yet, every day, our public  opinion drops because the people do not see any results.   The time to act is now. The betterment of every American depends on  it.                            ____________________
