 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  six high school honors students from Pennsylvania's Fifth Congressional  District chosen to represent the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as  delegates at the Congress of Future Medical Leaders.   The following students were selected to attend the event, which will  take  [[Page H4745]]  place June 25 to June 27 in Lowell, Massachusetts: Tessa Anderson of  Clarendon, Taylor Grove of Mount Union, Daniel Headrick of Corry,  Serena Clarke of Warren, Selena Foster of Sheffield, and Monica Scotto  of DuBois.   These outstanding students were required to achieve a 3.5 GPA to be  nominated for this prestigious honors-only program by their teachers or  the National Academy of Future Physicians and Medical Scientists.   The event aims to encourage and guide the top students in our country  who hope to become physicians or medical scientists. Chosen delegates  at the congress represent all 50 States and Puerto Rico.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate these students on this tremendous  accomplishment, and I wish them the best of luck as they continue their  path to leading our Nation's medical profession.                            ____________________
