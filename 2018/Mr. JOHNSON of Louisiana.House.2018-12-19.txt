 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  brave firefighters, police officers, and first responders who  selflessly ran into harm's way answering the three-alarm call to the  devastating fire in my district at First Baptist Church Bossier City,  Louisiana, on December 10, 2018.   At 5:36 a.m., the Bossier City Fire Department responded to a fire  alarm at the church. The call for a second alarm went out at 5:50 a.m.,  and the Shreveport Fire Department was called to assist at 6:15 a.m.   During their efforts, there were a total of 30 firefighting units and  65 fire and support personnel from Bossier City and Shreveport working  to contain the fire and preserve the church.   First Bossier has such an extraordinary history in our region, and  its iconic steeple has been a landmark over Bossier for generations. My  wife, Kelly, and I were actually married in First Bossier's Faith  Chapel 20 years ago.   We are so grateful there was no loss of life or major injury to  anyone; and for the many extraordinary firefighters and first  responders from Bossier and Shreveport who battled the blazes that day,  we commend them for their heroic efforts, and we thank them for their  service and sacrifice.   We know the First Bossier family will pull together and recover from  this tragedy even stronger than before. The Bible teaches that trials  produce perseverance, character, and hope, and we believe that to our  core. The mission of First Bossier will continue in earnest, and its  best days are truly ahead.                            ____________________
