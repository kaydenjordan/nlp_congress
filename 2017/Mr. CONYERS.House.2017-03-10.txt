 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 720, the so-called Lawsuit Abuse  Reduction Act.   This bill amends rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in  ways that will chill the advancement of civil rights claims and  increase exponentially the volume and costs of litigation in the  Federal courts.   These concerns are not hypothetical. H.R. 720 restores the deeply  flawed version of rule 11 in effect from 1983 to 1993 in two ways: by  requiring mandatory sanctions for even unintentional violations rather  than leaving the imposition of sanctions to the court's discretion, as  is currently the case; and secondly, by eliminating the current rule's  21-day safe harbor provision, which allows the defending party to  correct or withdraw allegedly offending submissions.   Simply put, H.R. 720 will have a disastrous impact on the  administration of justice in numerous ways. To begin with, the bill  will chill legitimate civil rights litigation, which, to me, of course,  is very important.   Civil rights cases often raise novel legal arguments, which made such  cases particularly susceptible to sanction motions under the 1983 rule.  For example, a Federal Judicial Center study found that the incidence  of rule 11 motions under the 1983 rule was ``higher in civil rights  cases than in some other types of cases.''   Another study showed that, while civil rights cases comprised about  11 percent of the cases filed, more than 22 percent of the cases in  which sanctions had been imposed were, in fact, civil rights cases.   Under the 1983 rule, civil rights cases were clearly disadvantaged.  Yet, H.R. 720 would reserve this problematic regime.   Although the bill's rule of construction is a welcome acknowledgment  of the problem, it does nothing to prevent defendants from using rule  11 as a weapon to discourage civil rights plaintiffs. Even a landmark  case like Brown v. Board of Education might not have been pursued had  H.R. 720's changes to rule 11 been in effect at that time, because the  legal arguments in the case were novel and not based on then-existing  law.   In addition, H.R. 720 will substantially increase the amount, cost,  and intensity of civil litigation and create more grounds for  unnecessary delay and harassment in the courtroom itself.   By making sanctions mandatory and having no safe harbor, the 1983  rule spawned a cottage industry of rule 11 litigation. Each party had a  financial incentive to tie up the other in rule 11 proceedings.   We heard testimony on a previous version of this bill that almost  one-third of all Federal lawsuits during the decade that the 1983 rule  was in effect were burdened by such satellite litigation, where the  parties tried the underlying case and then put each side's counsel on  trial.   Finally, H.R. 720 strips the judiciary of its discretion and  independence. H.R. 720 overrides judicial independence by removing the  discretion that rule 11 currently gives judges in determining whether  to impose sanctions and what type of sanctions would be most  appropriate. It also circumvents the painstakingly thorough Rules  Enabling Act process that Congress established more than 80 years ago.   For all of these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join us in opposing  this highly problematic legislation.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler),  [[Page H2027]]  the senior member of the House Committee on the Judiciary.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler),  [[Page H2027]]  the senior member of the House Committee on the Judiciary.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler),  [[Page H2027]]  the senior member of the House Committee on the Judiciary.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 4 minutes to the  distinguished gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member of the  Committee on the Judiciary for his distinguished service and my good  friend from Texas for his managing of this bill on which we have a  vigorous and active disagreement, but realize that the role of the  Committee on the Judiciary is to enhance justice for all Americans, no  matter what size business, what ethnicity, racial background, what  issue they bring, whether they bring a commercial issue or whether they  are for criminal justice.   That is why I rise to oppose this legislation, for it is important  that we monitor, promote, coddle, and respect justice. I oppose the  legislation that aims to restore a long-discredited version of Federal  Rule of Civil Procedure 11, in effect from 1983 to 1993. I use as a  premise of my argument a letter from the Committee on Rules of Practice  and Procedure of the Judicial Conference of the United States, in  particular written by two distinguished Federal judges from Arizona,  the chair of the Committee on Rules and the chair of the Advisory  Committee on Rules, both Federal district court judges. But more  importantly, my luck was to meet with a series of judges in the past  week, Federal judges, Republican appointees and some Democratic  appointees, and there was a vocal outcry of the outrage of this  legislation, asking and begging that this legislation not be put in  place.   Let me give you a description from the Federal courts, recognizing:  ``We of course share the desire of the sponsors of LARA to improve the  civil justice system''--and that is the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act-- ``in our Federal courts, including the desire to reduce frivolous  filings. But LARA creates a cure worse than the problem it is meant to  solve.''   ``Moreover, as we are both Federal trial judges, our perspective is  informed by our ongoing daily experience with the practical operation  of the rules.''   I, too, am concerned about small businesses. That is why we need to  proceed as we are proceeding. It gives thoughtful judges the ability to  protect those entities. The facts do not, according to the letter,  support any assumption that mandatory sanctions deter frivolous  filings.   ``A decade of experience with the 1983 mandatory sanctions  provision,'' they go on to say, ``demonstrated that it failed to  provide meaningful relief from  [[Page H2028]]  the litigation behavior it was meant to address, and instead generated  wasteful satellite litigation that had little to do with the merits of  cases.''   What good is that for the small litigant? What good will they have  when they might be subject to satellite litigation? And so, Mr.  Chairman, why would we want to return to the failed, discredited  sanction regime rightly abandoned in 1993? H.R. 720 would require  courts to impose monetary sanctions for any rule 11 violation,  eliminating the safe harbor provision that currently allows attorneys  to correct or withdraw a filing before rule 11 proceedings commence.  That is justice: I made a mistake, I want to withdraw it. I am suing a  small business, I have a different perspective. I know the facts, let  me withdraw it.   The cost-shifting provision was eliminated by the courts because it  encouraged satellite litigation, and many cases required parallel  proceedings. Here is the worst of it: Suppose we were back in 1954.  Would Brown v. Board of Education be a frivolous lawsuit subject to  sanctions, a landmark decision of the United States Supreme Court that  declared State laws establishing separate public schools for Black and  White students unconstitutional? What about Griswold in 1965? It would  also be judged as a frivolous lawsuit.   The CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, Griswold was a landmark case in which  the Supreme Court ruled that we had a right to privacy. Or what about  the famous case that was made into a movie, Loving v. Virginia? I think  for almost 25 years this mixed-marriage couple could not live in their  own State. A lawsuit would have been considered frivolous. Loving was a  landmark case which decided Virginia's antimiscegenation statute was  unconstitutional.   New York Times Co. v. United States in 1971, the question was on the  constitutional freedom of the press. It reinforced the First Amendment.   Mr. Chairman, it is impossible to go back to the old days. I ask my  colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment, to come up and to  oppose the underlying bill in the name of justice for all.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record a list of seven notable cases  the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act may have barred from a courtroom.   seven notable cases the ``lawsuit abuse reduction act'' may have barred                              from a courtroom         Contrary to proponents' claims, LARA does not deter       frivolous lawsuits. Rather it deters meritorious cases by       imposing a one-size-fits-all mandate for federal judges.       Mandatory sanctions inevitably chill meritorious claims       particularly in cases of first impression or involving new       legal theories, including cases to protect civil rights, the       right to privacy, the environment, collective bargaining and       the First Amendment. Our system of justice is a moving body       of law, and novel legal theories have the ability to shift       public policy and law.        Below are seven notable cases that LARA may have prevented       because the cases presented what--at the time they were       presented to the court--would have been considered novel       legal theories:        Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954):       Brown was a landmark decision of the United States Supreme       Court that declared state laws establishing separate public       schools for black and white students unconstitutional. The       decision overturned the Plessy v. Ferguson decision of 1896       which allowed state-sponsored segregation. The Court's       unanimous decision stated that ``separate educational       facilities are inherently unequal.'' As a result, de jure       racial segregation was ruled a violation of the Equal       Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United       States Constitution. This ruling paved the way for       integration and the civil rights movement.        Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965): Griswold was       a landmark case in which the Supreme Court ruled that the       Constitution protected a right to privacy. The case involved       a Connecticut law that prohibited the use of contraceptives.       By a vote of 7-2, the Supreme Court invalidated the law on       the grounds that it violated the ``right to marital       privacy.''        Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003): In Lawrence, the       Supreme Court considered the issue of whether adult       consensual sexual activity is protected by the Fourteenth       Amendment guarantee of equal protection under the law. The       Court found that the petitioners were free as adults to       engage in the private conduct in the exercise of their       liberty under the Due Process Clause. The decision       decriminalized the Texas law that made it illegal for two       persons of the same sex to engage in certain intimate sexual       conduct.        Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, 549 U.S.       497 (2007): In this case, twelve states and several cities of       the United States brought suit against the United States       Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to force the federal       agency to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases       as pollutants. The Supreme Court found that Massachusetts,       due to its ``stake in protecting its quasi-sovereign       interests'' as a state, had standing to sue the EPA over       potential damage caused to its territory by global warming.       The Court rejected the EPA's argument that the Clean Air Act       was not meant to refer to carbon emissions in the section       giving the EPA authority to regulate ``air pollution       agent[s].''        Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967): Loving was a       landmark civil rights case in which the United States Supreme       Court, by a 9-0 vote, declared Virginia's anti-miscegenation       statute, the ``Racial Integrity Act of 1924,''       unconstitutional, thereby ending all race-based legal       restrictions on marriage in the United States.        New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713 (1971):       This case considered whether the New York Times and       Washington Post newspapers could publish the then-classified       Pentagon Papers without risk of government censure. The       question before the Court was whether the constitutional       freedom of the press, guaranteed by the First Amendment, was       subordinate to a claimed need of the executive branch of       government to maintain the secrecy of information. The       Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment protected the       right of the New York Times to print the materials.        Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153 (1978)       (The Snail Darter Case): In TVA, the Supreme Court affirmed a       court of appeals' judgment, which agreed with the Secretary       of Interior that operation of the federal Tellico Dam would       eradicate an endangered species. The Court held that a prima       facie violation of Sec. 7 of the Endangered Species Act, 16       U.S.C. Sec. 1536, occurred, and ruled that an injunction       requested by respondents should have been issued.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 720, the ``Lawsuit  Abuse Reduction Act of 2017,'' because it is both unnecessary and  counterproductive.   I oppose this legislation that aims to restore a long-discredited  version of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, in effect from 1983 to  1993.   The current Rule 11 allows federal courts, in their discretion, to  impose sanctions for frivolous filings and it encourages litigants to  resolve such issues without court intervention.   As written, H.R. 720 would change the sanctions for a violation of  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 11 to a cost-shifting sanction payable  to the opposing party, an antiquated version of the Rule in effect from  1983 until 1993.   Why, Mr. Chair would we return to the failed and discredited sanction  regime rightly abandoned in 1993?   H.R. 720 would require courts to impose monetary sanctions for any  Rule 11 violation, eliminating the safe harbor provision that currently  allows attorneys to correct or withdraw a filing before Rule 11  proceedings commence.   That cost-shifting provision was eliminated by the courts because it  encouraged satellite litigation; many cases required parallel  proceedings--one on the merits of the lawsuit and one on the Rule 11  motion.   The 1983 rule had a particularly negative disproportionate impact on  plaintiffs, especially plaintiffs in civil rights cases, because  plaintiffs in such cases often raise novel legal arguments, leaving  them vulnerable to a Rule 11 motion by a defendant.   Reinstating this mandatory fee shifting rule, as H.R. 720 does, will  again have a chilling effect on plaintiffs' claims, especially  individual plaintiffs taking on large corporate interests.   Sanctions were more often imposed against plaintiffs than defendants  and more often imposed against plaintiffs in certain kinds of cases,  primarily in civil rights and certain kinds of discrimination cases.   A leading study on this issue showed that although civil rights cases  made up 11.4% of federal cases filed, 22.7% of the cases in which  sanctions had been imposed were civil rights cases.   The imposition of mandatory fees and costs ultimately shifts the  purpose of the Rule from deterrence to compensation, encouraging  parties to always file Rule 11 motions in the hopes of gaining  additional compensation.   Both the Judicial Conference of the United States and the U.S.  Supreme Court support preservation of the current version of Rule 11(c)  and restoring the true balance between punishing unwarranted conduct  and deterring unnecessary litigation.   Given the highly problematic experience under the 1983 rule, which  sparked extensive and costly litigation, the rule burdened already  strained federal court system, adversely affecting cases of all types,  including civil litigation among businesses.   Congress should be looking for ways to decrease, not increase  wasteful burdens on  [[Page H2029]]  courts, and should avoid rule changes that have a discriminatory impact  on civil rights, employment, environmental, and consumer cases.   For these reasons and more, I oppose this bill.    Mr. Chairman, it is my pleasure to yield 4 minutes to  the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Chairman, it is my pleasure to yield 4 minutes to  the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  These constitute my closing observations on this measure.   Mr. Chairman, H.R. 720 would turn back the clock to a time when rule  11 discouraged civil rights cases, restricted judicial discretion, and  engendered vast amounts of time-consuming and costly so-called  satellite litigation.   Not surprisingly, the Judicial Conference of the United States, the  principal policymaking body for the judicial branch charged with  proposing amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure under the  careful, deliberate process specified in the Rules Enabling Act,  opposes this measure, noting that it creates a cure worse than the  problem it is meant to solve.   Likewise, the American Bar Association opposes this legislation, as  do numerous consumer and environmental groups, including: Public  Citizen, the Alliance for Justice, the Center for Justice and  Democracy, the Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union,  Earthjustice, the National Association of Consumer Advocates, and six  other major organizations.    Finally, last Congress, the Obama administration, strongly opposed a  substantively identical measure, noting that the bill was ``both  unnecessary and counterproductive,'' and that it ``actually increases  litigation.''   Accordingly, I urge my colleagues in this body to reject this flawed  bill.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H2030]]         Mr. Chairman, I ask that my amendment be brought forward  at this time.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Add, at the end of the bill, the following:       SEC. 3. PROTECTING ACTIONS PERTAINING TO CONSTITUTIONAL                     CLAIMS OR CIVIL RIGHTS.         Nothing in this Act, or the amendments made by this Act,       shall be construed to apply to actions alleging any violation       of a right protected by the Constitution or any civil right       protected by law.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 180, the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.    Mr. Chairman, I am very concerned that H.R. 720 may have  a serious, deleterious impact on the ability of individuals to protect  their civil and constitutional rights in Federal court. This is a point  that has been emphasized on this side ever since we have started  examining, more carefully, H.R. 720. Accordingly, my amendment would  simply exempt these types of cases from the bill.   Based on a decade of experience with the 1983 version of the Federal  Rules of Civil Procedure, we know that the civil rights cases were, in  fact, disproportionately impacted because they often raised novel  arguments.   For example, a 1991 Federal Judicial Center study found that the  incidence of rule 11 motions was ``higher in civil rights cases than in  some other types of cases.'' Another study shows that, while civil  rights cases comprised only 11 percent of the Federal cases filed, more  than 22 percent of the cases in which sanctions had been imposed were,  in fact, civil rights cases.   The bill contains a rule of construction intended to clarify that  ``it not be construed to bar the assertion of new claims or defenses or  remedies, including those arising under civil rights laws or the  Constitution.''   The inclusion of this language is an acknowledgment of the  disproportionate impact that the 1983 rule had on civil rights cases,  and we should applaud--and I am sure we do--its intent.   Nevertheless, I fear this rule of construction, by itself, will not  prevent defendants from using rule 11 as a weapon to dissuade civil  rights plaintiffs from pursuing their claims.                                time  1015    My amendment makes an explicit exception for civil rights and  constitutional actions. As a result, litigants will be clearly aware of  its existence and will not be able to force opposing parties into  satellite litigation when the case is brought under a civil rights law.   This amendment is necessary to avoid even the possibility of a  chilling effect that the revisions made by the bill to rule 11 could  have on those advocating for civil rights and constitutional law  protections. As the late Robert Carter, a former United States judge  for the Southern District of New York, who earlier in his career  represented one of the plaintiffs in the Brown v. Board of Education  case, said of the 1983 version of rule 11:   ``I have no doubt that the Supreme Court's opportunity to pronounce  separate schools inherently unequal in Brown v. Board of Education  would have been delayed for a decade had my colleagues and I been  required, upon pain of potential sanctions, to plead our legal theory  explicitly from the start.''   For that reason alone, I urge the adoption of this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I support Representative Conyers'  amendment.   I include in the Record in support of our amendment a Judicial  Conference letter dated April 13, 2015, and letters from a number of  organizations, including the Alliance for Justice and the American  Association for Justice.   I also include in the Record a letter from the American Bar  Association, who begins their message:   ``On behalf of the American Bar Association, ABA, and its over  400,000 members, I am writing to urge you to vote against H.R. 720, the  Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act . . . which is scheduled for a floor vote  this week.''       Re Groups Strongly Oppose Attacks on Civil Justice.       Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. John Conyers, Jr.,      Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking Member Conyers: On       February 2, the House Committee on the Judiciary is scheduled       to mark up several bills that collectively would make it more       difficult for Americans to enforce their legal rights, and       would place unreasonable burdens on the federal judiciary and       federal enforcement officials. The undersigned organizations       strongly oppose these bills as harmful and unnecessary.               H.R. 720: THE LAWSUIT ABUSE REDUCTION ACT (LARA)         LARA would make major, substantive changes to Rule 11 of       the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, bypassing both the       Judicial Conference of the United States and the U.S. Supreme       Court in the process. Rule 11 provides judges with authority       to sanction attorneys for filing frivolous claims and       defenses. It provides judges with discretion to decide, on a       case-by-case basis, if sanctions are appropriate. LARA would       remove this judicial discretion, mandating sanctions. LARA       would reinstate a rule put into effect in 1983 that was so       unworkable it was rescinded in 1993 after many problems and       nearly universal criticism. Among those problems were: the       rule had a chilling effect on the filing of meritorious civil       rights, employment, environmental, and consumer cases; the       rule was overused in civil rights cases as sanctions were       sought and imposed against civil rights plaintiffs more than       against any other litigants in civil court; and the rule       burdened the already strained federal court system with       satellite litigation over compliance with the rule. These       burdens adversely affected cases of all types, including       business-to-business civil litigation. Congress should be       looking for ways to decrease, not increase, wasteful burdens       on the courts, and should avoid rules changes that have a       discriminatory impact on civil rights, employment,       environmental, and consumer cases.                 H.R. 725: THE INNOCENT PARTY PROTECTION ACT         This bill would upend long established law in the area of       federal court jurisdiction, specifically addressing the       supposed overuse of ``fraudulent joinder'' to defeat complete       diversity jurisdiction in a case. It was previously known as       the ``Fraudulent Joinder Prevention Act.'' However, this bill       is not about fraud. It is a corporate forum-shopping bill       that would allow corporations to move cases properly brought       in state courts into federal courts. Corporate defendants       support this bill because they prefer to litigate in federal       court, which usually results in less diverse jurors, more       expensive proceedings, longer wait times for trials, and       stricter limits on discovery. For plaintiffs, who are       supposed to be able to choose their forums, this legislation       would result in additional time, expense, and inconvenience       for the plaintiff and witnesses. Moreover, there is no       evidence that federal courts are not already properly       handling allegations of so-called ``fraudulent joinder''       after removal under current laws. The bill would result in       needless micromanagement of federal courts and a waste of       judicial resources. While it purports to fix a non-existent       problem, it creates problems itself.                  H.R. 732: STOP SETTLEMENT SLUSH FUNDS ACT         Under existing laws, settlement terms that result from       federal enforcement actions can sometimes include payments to       third parties to advance programs that assist with recovery,       benefits, and relief for communities harmed by lawbreakers,       to the extent such payments further the objectives of the       enforcement action. This bill would cut off any payments to       third parties other than individualized restitution and other       forms of direct payment for ``actual harm.'' That restriction       would handcuff federal enforcement officials by limiting       their ability to negotiate appropriate relief for real harms       caused to the public by illegal conduct that is the subject       of federal enforcement actions. This bill would be a gift to       lawbreakers at the expense of families and communities       suffering from injuries that cannot be addressed by direct       restitution.        We urge you to oppose each of these bills.

ABA Urges You To Oppose Passage of H.R. 720, the Lawsuit Abuse                               Reduction Act         Dear Representative: On behalf of the American Bar       Association (ABA) and its over 400,000 members, I am writing       to urge you to vote against H.R. 720, the Lawsuit Abuse       Reduction Act of 2015, which is scheduled for a floor vote       this week.        Even though this legislation may seem straightforward and       appealing on initial review, a thorough examination of the       concerns the bill is designed to address provides compelling       evidence that, rather than reducing frivolous lawsuits, H.R.       720 will encourage civil litigation abuse and increase court       costs and delays.        H.R. 720 seeks to amend Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of       Civil Procedure by rolling back critical improvements made to       the Rule in 1993. The legislation would reinstate a mandatory       sanction provision that was adopted in 1983 and eliminated a       decade later after experience revealed its unintended,       adverse consequences. It also would eliminate the ``safe       harbor'' provision, added in 1993, which has helped reduce       frivolous lawsuits by allowing parties to withdraw claims       within 21 days after a motion for sanctions is served.        The ABA urges you to oppose enactment of H.R. 720 for three       main reasons. First, the legislation was drafted in an       empirical and historical vacuum without the input of the       judicial branch. Second, there is no demonstrated evidence       that the existing Rule 11 is inadequate and needs to be       amended. And third, by ignoring the lessons learned from ten       years of experience under the 1983 mandatory version of Rule       11, Congress incurs the substantial risk that the proposed       changes will harm litigants by encouraging additional       litigation and increasing court costs and delays.    I. AMENDMENTS TO THE FEDERAL RULES SHOULD BE VETTED THROUGH THE RULES                            ENABLING ACT PROCESS         The Rules Enabling Act was established by Congress to       assure that amendment of the Federal Rules occurs only after       a comprehensive and balanced review of the problem and       proposed solution is undertaken by the Judicial Conference of       the United States, the policy-making arm of the federal       judiciary, in consultation with lawyers, scholars,       individuals, and organizations devoted to improving the       administration of justice. Prior to submission to Congress, a       proposed amendment undergoes extensive review and public       comment, a process that often takes over two years and offers       Members assurance the proposed amendment is necessary and       wise.        In stark contrast, H.R. 720 proposes to amend the Federal       Rules over the objections of the Judicial Conference and       despite compelling evidence that it will adversely affect the       administration of justice.   II. THERE IS NO EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE THAT RULE 11 IS INADEQUATE AND NEEDS                               TO BE AMENDED         Proponents state that the legislation is needed to stem the       growth in frivolous lawsuits that, according to the written       statement of the National Federation of Independent Business,       has ``created a legal climate that hinders economic growth       and hurts job creation.''        There simply is no proof that problems created by frivolous       lawsuits have increased since 1993 or that the current Rule       11 is ineffective in deterring frivolous filings. In fact, it       is more likely that problems have abated since 1993 because       Rule 11's safe harbors provision provides an incentive to       withdraw frivolous filings at the outset of litigation.  [[Page H2035]]       In addition, according to Professor Danielle Kie Hart and       other researchers, after the current version of Rule 11 went       into effect, there was an increased incidence of sanctions'       being imposed under other sanction rules and laws, including       28 U.S.C. Sec. 1927, as well as pursuant to the court's       inherent power. Judges have numerous tools at their disposal       to impose sanctions and prevent frivolous lawsuits from going       forward.        III. THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL RISK THAT H.R. 758 WOULD IMPEDE THE    ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE BY ENCOURAGING ADDITIONAL LITIGATION AND                     INCREASING COURT COSTS AND DELAYS         Most importantly, there is no evidence that the proposed       changes to Rule 11 would deter the filing of non-meritorious       lawsuits. In fact, as stated earlier, past experience       strongly suggests that the proposed changes would encourage       new litigation over sanction motions, thereby increasing, not       reducing, court costs and delays. This is a costly and       completely avoidable outcome.                                IV. CONCLUSION         The 1983 version of Rule 11 was ill-conceived and created       significant unintended adverse consequences that harmed       litigants and impeded the administration of justice. We urge       you to avoid making the same mistake and to oppose passage of       H.R. 720.
