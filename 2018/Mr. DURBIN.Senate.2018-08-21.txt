 Madam President, pending before the U.S. Senate today are  two of the biggest appropriations bills we will consider this year. As  Senator McConnell, the Republican leader, mentioned, they are the  eighth and ninth bills we will pass.   One of those bills I have had a direct interest in as the ranking  Democrat on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. We are about to  break a record. This spending bill for the Department of Defense is one  of the largest increases we have seen in any given year. This bill is  $607 billion for day-to-day operations of the Department of Defense and  another $68 billion for something known as Overseas Contingency  Operations, which is just another category of spending. This one bill-- one bill of the Department of Defense--comprises 49 percent of all of  discretionary spending of the Government of the United States of  America. Almost half of our discretionary budget is going to be spent  in this bill. Accompanying it is the bill on health and education,  which is the second largest appropriations bill we consider. So between  the two of these bills, we are talking about a massive government  expenditure.   Let's reflect on that expenditure for a moment.   There is no replacement for a strong national defense, but we should  ask ourselves why. Why does it cost the American taxpayer so much to  defend America?   The last budget deal, under which we are working here, provided a  near-record increase for the Department of Defense. Going back almost  50 years, you can only find two or three other increases comparable. We  are talking about a massive expenditure and a substantial, historic  increase in the Department of Defense.   Why? Because we face enemies in this world. I am not naive about  that. I believe it. When it comes to superpowers threatening us, at the  top of the list is Russia, and second on the list is China.   How much do they spend, when it comes to the defense budgets of those  two countries--our two hard targets, the most threatening nations when  it comes to the United States? That is where you have to step back and  shake your head and say that can't be true. But it is true.   The Russian defense budget from 2017 to 2018 is $78 billion. Remember  my earlier figures? We are going to be spending $700 billion, and their  annual budget is $78 billion.   How can there be such a disparity? Some people have argued that it is  because of the accounting methods. It is the fact that Russian soldiers  are paid dirt wages and ours, thank goodness, are paid just  compensation and are given benefits. I accept all of that, but it still  doesn't explain an almost 10-to-1 ratio of spending in the United  States against spending in Russia.   What about China? There is another nation that we are worried about  in terms of our national defense. China is believed to spend about $175  billion a year, about one-fourth of our total defense spending.   Here is Russia spending about 10 percent of our defense spending, and  we are concerned about the threat they pose to the United States and  our allies. Here is China spending one-fourth of what we do, and we  worry about their expanded roles in places like the Pacific.   What is baffling about that comparison is that we spend so much more  than our major adversaries in the world. Yet many experts testify over  and over before congressional committees that we are falling behind in  the development of key technologies--technologies like satellites,  artificial intelligence, hypersonic missiles, and quantum computing.  [[Page S5735]]    It doesn't stand to reason that the United States of America, with  all of its strength and all of its innovation and all of its ingenuity,  is being challenged in the world by countries that are spending a  fraction of what we spend.   The conclusion is obvious. Our large increase of military spending  calls for more accountability on how these funds are being spent. I  voted for Secretary Mattis. I respect him very much, not only for his  service to our country as a General in the U.S. Marine Corps but also  as our Secretary of Defense. Thank goodness he is on the job. I have a  lot of faith in him, and I believe he has a steady hand in an  administration where there aren't too many steady hands.   In March, Secretary Mattis sent a memo to every member of the  Department of Defense, and here was the title: ``Be Peerless Stewards  of the Taxpayers' Dollars.'' I have had the opportunity on two or three  occasions to have direct conversations with Secretary Mattis about my  concern that we are dramatically increasing American spending over our  adversaries and still we believe they have a competitive edge or a  near-competitive edge in many critical areas. Secretary Mattis  correctly assessed in this report that the Pentagon needs a culture of  performance and accountability in order to increase the trust and  confidence that not only Congress but especially the American taxpayer  places in his team.   We also have a procurement system--a purchasing system--that sadly  encourages poor behavior and poor results. I asked Dr. Michael Griffin,  the top research and development official in the Department of Defense:  Why do we spend so much more in the United States and continue to fall  behind?   He said that many members of the Department of Defense are afraid to  be the last to say yes to a program that may not succeed. Too many  decisions are pushed up the bureaucratic ladder to higher levels, which  strangles these programs in redtape and delays them even more. If  something goes wrong, failures are the subject of heated congressional  hearings. We have seen that over and over--from $20,000 toilet seats  and similar scandals in the past.   I agree with Dr. Griffin's findings. The Department of Defense needs  to do so much more to change the culture of accountability at that  agency. We need to establish a new spirit of transparency. Right now,  every weapon system--every single one of them--is sold to Congress with  a rosy scenario: technological breakthroughs at a modest cost. There is  no difference between the sales pitch on a program that is easy to  develop and one that is a giant risk.   The Department of Defense needs to be more upfront and more candid  with what can go wrong and what will happen if something does go wrong.  Very often, the contentious hearings that Dr. Griffin spoke about are  not the result of a failed test but a broken promise.   While the Pentagon has much work ahead of it to improve its  accountability, the world does stand still. The Defense appropriations  bill before the Senate makes major investments and innovation, and  these are critical to our servicemembers, their families, and to the  defense of our Nation. In this bill there is $95.1 billion in research  and development spending. Remember, the total budget is almost $700  billion, and $95.1 billion goes for R&D. This is the highest level of  R&D funding in programs in the history of the Department of Defense,  even when adjusted for inflation, and I support it.   The increases provided by the committee will include major  investments in areas that are challenging and promising at the same  time: artificial intelligence, satellite technologies, and basic  research. In addition, the bill provides $1.8 billion, just a small  proportion of the total budget, and that money goes to medical  research. That is a 5-percent increase over last year's spending. This  DOD research is just a fraction of what is invested at the National  Institutes of Health, which I will address in a moment, that resulted  in breakthroughs ranging from breast cancer treatments to battlefield  medical care.   Our soldiers, sailors, marines, members of the Coast Guard, and  airmen are surviving in battle because of this research at the  Department of Defense. It is money well spent.   With all of the valuable investments that are included in this bill,  I want to especially thank Chairman Richard Shelby, of Alabama, for all  of his work on this bill. It has been a real joy to work with him. We  have disagreed on a few things--don't get me wrong--and I am sure we  will continue to do so, but we have known one another for many years.  We respect one another, and we are determined that this critical bill  is going to be part of the success report that comes out of the Senate  as we break for the Labor Day recess.   Chairman Shelby has been receptive to many suggestions and comments,  and I have tried to do the same when he has made some ideas a part of  his proposal in this bill. I want to commend him for all of his work to  get the appropriations process on track, not just on this bill but on  the others as well. We stand a real chance in the Senate of sending  most appropriations bills to the President before the end of the fiscal  year the last day of September--a feat that has not been accomplished  for the defense budget in 10 years.   To Chairman Shelby's great credit, he understands that moving this  Defense appropriations bill along also means moving other  appropriations bills with it. While there may be tough votes coming up,  we have come a long way to reestablish regular order in the last few  months, and I am happy to be a part of this bipartisan solution. I hope  the House will come back soon and join us in this effort. We would love  to see them again.   Now, let me say a word about the other appropriations bill that is  part of our package on the floor. This bill, the Labor-HHS-Education  bill, includes funding for the National Institutes of Health. For the  past 6 years, I have made this the focal point of my work here in the  Senate. I don't take particular credit for the results, but I have done  my darndest to encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  make this a priority, and I am happy to report they have.   For the fourth year in a row, Congress is on track to provide the  National Institutes of Health with funding increases of at least 5  percent in real growth--a $2 billion increase in this bill. In the  fiscal year 2019 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education  appropriations bill before the Senate, we will help to ensure that our  Nation's best and brightest medical researchers have the funding they  need to conduct research on the diseases and conditions that impact  every single American.   NIH researchers are currently trying to develop cures for cancer, to  figure out developments to delay or prevent the threat of Alzheimer's,  and to help better those living with heart disease or diabetes.   Between 2010 and 2016, the Food and Drug Administration approved 210  new drugs in that 6-year period of time for treatments in the United  States. Every single one of these new drugs was developed with funding  by the National Institutes of Health.   I hope, as we move forward to conference with the House on this bill,  that we can include at least a 5-percent funding increase for the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as other agencies  that allow America to literally lead the world in medical innovation.   This bill provides $3.7 billion for the prevention and treatment of  the scourge of opioid addiction. It will help our Federal agencies to  respond better to this ongoing public health challenge. It includes  provisions I requested to help the CDC address the toll of violence in  the city of Chicago and assist with the Legionnaires' disease outbreak  in Quincy, IL. It rejects President Trump's efforts to slash the  Federal-Work Study Program and includes an increase in the maximum Pell  grant of $100. It includes $5 million for the Open Textbooks Pilot  Program, helping college students across America with the exploding  cost of higher education.   It is a good bill, and I want to commend Senator Patty Murray of  Washington, the Democrat, and Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, the  Republican, for crafting the bipartisan fiscal year 2019 Labor, Health  and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill. I do think we  should be addressing the skyrocketing drug costs that every single  [[Page S5736]]  American is well aware of. It is something we all talk about, but the  underlying bill doesn't address it. I filed a bipartisan amendment with  my friend and colleague from Iowa, Republican Senator Chuck Grassley,  to improve price transparency and direct-to-consumer drug advertising.   If I ask you whether you have seen any ads for drugs on television  and you answer no, then, I know automatically that you don't own a  television because the average American sees a drug advertisement about  nine times a day.   Why do the drug companies spend so much money advertising on  television in the United States? Doesn't every other country do the  same? No. It turns out that the United States and New Zealand are the  only two countries that allow pharma, drug companies, to advertise  their products on television directly to consumers.   Why would pharma spend $6 billion a year on advertising so many  different ways for Americans to buy these drugs? Because it is  profitable. Americans, finally, after the fifth, sixth, seventh, or  eighth time they have seen it can not only pronounce but even spell  Xarelto. When they go to the doctor's office, they say: Doctor, maybe I  need a little different blood thinner; maybe I need Xarelto.   Xarelto turns out to be the brand name of a very expensive  prescription drug.   What about the drug Humira? How many ads have you seen for the drug  Humira? You can't escape them. It is the most advertised treatment on  television. Humira was designed to deal with rheumatoid arthritis, a  very serious illness that many Americans face. Then, they found out  that Humira might have some value when it comes to something called  psoriasis. What is psoriasis? It is the red patch on my elbow.   They said: You know, you ought to consider Humira to deal with  psoriasis.   Here is a Humira ad. Here is the one thing they don't disclose about  Humira on the ad. It costs $5,500 a month. I would like to have perfect  skin on my elbow--but at a cost of $5,500 per month? Would you think  twice about asking for this drug from your doctor if you knew that it  was going to cost this much? Of course you would.   Senator Grassley and I have a simple amendment. The drug companies  that want to advertise on television ought to advertise the price of  their product or treatment as well. Pharma hates this idea like the  devil hates holy water. The notion of actually disclosing what these  drugs cost would not only give you a jolt--as you hear $5,500 a month  for Humira--but it would also dramatize the increases in drug costs  that we see happening all of the time.   Senator Grassley and I have an amendment before this Senate that is  going to call for the disclosure of drug pricing. Don't you think the  American people deserve this information?   Guess what. Look at the passenger side behind the driver's seat in  your car. Look at the window. There is a little disclosure about  exactly what you should have to pay for that car. But when it comes to  paying for prescription drugs, pharma doesn't want to tell you. They  want you to finally face it at the cash register.   I think Americans have a right to know earlier and more about the  cost of these prescription drugs. Seventy-six percent of the American  people, incidentally, agree with that position.   This amendment is bipartisan and is supported, incidentally, by 76  percent of Americans, the American Association of Retired Persons, the  American Medical Association, and--hold on to your hat--President  Donald Trump supports this provision as well.   We have an amendment that is bipartisan and is supported by the  administration, which should be included in this bill, which will move  us toward price disclosure. I think it is overdue.   We also need to increase the funding for the Centers for Disease  Control's work on congenital heart disease, the most common and  deadliest category of birth defects.   I will be filing an amendment to increase the funding for this  program from $4 million to $7 million--a modest amount in a bill of  billions of dollars but one that would help 2.4 million Americans  living with congenital heart disease.                              Student Loan Debt    Madam President, I also plan to file 2 amendments to help some of the  44 million Americans who are struggling with student loan debt by  bringing sanity to the way student loans are treated in bankruptcy.   Unlike most types of debt, student loans are extremely difficult-- almost impossible--to discharge in bankruptcy. Why? There are two  reasons. A debtor has to meet a high bar of showing ``undue hardship''  in order to get student loans discharged, and the Department of  Education pays private contracting firms to fight the students tooth  and nail in court if they try to seek a discharge of their student debt  because of undue hardship.   My amendments would bar the use of Federal funds to pay these  contractors who contest undue hardship claims in bankruptcy court when  the claims are brought by certain student debtors.   Listen to the categories of people we have included in this  amendment, people I think would be deserving of discharge of their  student debts in bankruptcy court: No. 1, veterans who have been deemed  unemployable because of a service-connected disability; No. 2, family  caregivers of veterans or of the elderly or disabled family members;  No. 3, people receiving Social Security disability whose only income is  Social Security payments; and No. 4, borrowers who have finished school  but have spent at least 5 years at a low income of less than $24,000 a  year.   Those are four of the categories of people we think deserve a break  when it comes to student loan debt. I hope my colleagues will join me  in helping disabled veterans and their caregivers and the others  included in this amendment.   A second amendment would focus exclusively on disabled veterans and  family caregivers.   Finally, I will file two amendments to protect students from our  Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos. Secretary DeVos is planning to  repeal or rewrite Obama-era borrower defense and gainful employment  rules that help students and taxpayers avoid being cheated by for- profit colleges and universities.   Do you want to know the story on for-profit colleges and  universities? You need to know only two numbers: only 9 percent of all  post-secondary students attend for-profit schools--University of  Phoenix, DeVry, and similar schools; 9 percent of students go to that  type of school, yet 33 percent of all student loan defaults are from  students who attend these for-profit schools. Why--9 percent of the  students, 33 percent of the student loan defaults? There are two  reasons. No. 1 is they charge too darn much. They are dramatically more  expensive than other alternative education at the higher education  level. Secondly, their diplomas aren't worth the paper they are written  on. These students learn after they graduate that they can't get a job  to pay back their student loans.   So I think in this situation Secretary DeVos is doing exactly the  wrong thing. She is not holding these schools accountable. She is  making it tougher for the students who are lured into their traps to  get relief. I am pleased that many of my colleagues have joined in this  effort. The Secretary of Education should not roll back important  protections for students and taxpayers, and the Secretary should not  eliminate Federal student debt relief for borrowers defrauded by  predatory for-profit schools like Corinthian and ITT Tech. It is my  hope that these amendments will be included in the final bill.   Madam President, once again, the Senate is considering bipartisan  appropriations bills. These bills may not include everything I want or  everything other Members want. They are good compromises, which I plan  to support.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.                      Recognition of the Minority Leader     I announce that the Senator from Washington (Mrs.  Murray), the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Schatz), and the Senator from New  Mexico (Mr. Udall) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Washington (Mrs.  Murray), the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Schatz), and the Senator from New  Mexico (Mr. Udall) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I note my colleagues have come before me  to discuss the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to fill the vacancy on the  U.S. Supreme Court after the retirement of Justice Kennedy.   I checked, just to make sure I understood the section of the  Constitution. It is article II, relative to the President's powers,  which talks about the power of the President to fill that vacancy on  the Supreme Court, subject to the advice and consent of the U.S.  Senate. One hundred U.S. Senators ultimately have the last word on any  nominee. I am fortunate to serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee,  where we get the first chance to review any nominee and take a look at  their background and vote as a committee before the matter is brought  to the floor of the U.S. Senate.   I have listened to my colleagues who support Judge Kavanaugh  ascending to the bench and to a lifetime appointment to the highest  Court of the land. I am troubled by one particular aspect of this  nomination. It is different than  [[Page S5744]]  any nomination to the Supreme Court in the history of the United States  in this respect: This President made it clear that any person who  wanted to be eligible for the U.S. Supreme Court needed to pass a  clearance by two organizations. One is called the Federalist Society  and the other is the Heritage Foundation. Both of these are  conservative organizations which reviewed all of the potential Supreme  Court nominees and produced a list of 20 or more men and women who  would be eligible for the Supreme Court by their judgment.   Is their judgment important? I will point to one fact in history  which illustrates. When Neil Gorsuch was considered by President Trump  to serve on the Supreme Court and fill the vacancy of Antonin Scalia,  he was not notified by the White House. The White House called the  Federalist Society head, Leonard Leo, and asked him to call Mr. Gorsuch  and tell him the good news. So to say that the Federalist Society and  the Heritage Foundation played a critical role in the selection of a  nominee is an understatement. If you don't clear their background test,  their litmus test, you cannot be considered by the Trump administration  for the Supreme Court.   That is offensive to me. We don't see any reference to the Federalist  Society or the Heritage Foundation in the U.S. Constitution. There is a  clear reference to a President elected by the people of the United  States, but to give to any special interest group, right, left or  center, that kind of authority is way beyond what our Founding Fathers  imagined would be this process for selecting someone for the Supreme  Court.   Then it gets even more complicated. Before we consider a nominee for  the Supreme Court, we have to carefully review their records. It takes  time. Literally, scores of lawyers sit down and go through the  published opinions and speeches and other documents which evidence a  person's background, and when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh, it is an  extensive background. He has had a role at the highest levels of the  Federal Government for years: Ken Starr's Office of Independent  Counsel, the Bush v. Gore lawsuit that went down to the State of  Florida and beyond.   The cases he was involved in as a member of the court are pretty  obvious and published, but many of his other activities--particularly  in the White House when he served as Staff Secretary to the President  of the United States--were extensive. For a 3-year period of time, for  35 months, he was the gatekeeper in the White House as to the  documentation the President would receive and read. It involved a  pretty massive amount of time and documentation on all of the major  issues facing the Presidency for almost 3 years. Should we take a look  at it? Is it worth our investigation and inquiry into what Mr.  Kavanaugh said and did during those years?   Well, there was a time here when Republicans thought it was not only  important but essential when it came to a nominee named Elena Kagan.  Elena Kagan had never served on the Federal judiciary. She was  nominated by President Obama. At the time, the ranking Republican on  the Senate Judiciary Committee, Jeff Sessions of Alabama, insisted on  the full documentation of her role in the White House, and the  Democratic Senator, Patrick Leahy of Vermont, joined him in making that  request. As a result, 170,000 pages of documents were produced because  of the request made by Senator Sessions and Senator Leahy. It was a  bipartisan request. It established a standard.   The same standard was applied for Democratic nominee Sonia Sotomayor.  Documentation had to be presented to the committee and carefully  reviewed before there was a vote on whether that person would serve in  a lifetime appointment to the highest Court in the land.   Most of us assumed, at that point, that it was a settled practice in  the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee when it came to the documentary  proof we would ask for when nominees came before us for the Supreme  Court. We thought that, but we were wrong because when the Republicans  took control, everything changed. It changed, of course, with Antonin  Scalia's vacancy as a result of his untimely death--a vacancy President  Obama sought to fill during his last year in office. He ended up  nominating Merrick Garland, a DC Circuit Court judge of impeccable  credentials to fill the vacancy. Many Republicans in the Senate refused  to even meet with Merrick Garland, let alone consider him and vote on  him. So, for a whole year, the vacancy continued at the Supreme Court  while the Republicans broke Senate tradition and refused to consider  President Obama's nominee.   Then came the election of Donald Trump, the nomination of Judge Neil  Gorsuch, and the process went forward to fill the vacancy the  Republicans had kept open for more than a year before Neil Gorsuch was  finally voted on by the U.S. Senate.   So here came the second vacancy under the Trump administration--a  vacancy created by the retirement of Justice Kennedy--and the question  was obviously asked: What standard will you use for asking for the  documentary evidence of the person's background in public service?   Many of us assumed it would have been the same standard that was  pushed by Senator Sessions, a Republican of Alabama, and Senator Leahy,  a Democrat of Vermont. We were wrong. Instead, what the Republicans  said is, we are going to have a new rule when it comes to Republican  nominees from the Trump administration in the case of Judge Brett  Kavanaugh, and that new rule said we will not ask for documentation for  the 35 months when he served in the White House as the closest adviser  to the President of the United States. I can tell you there were a  myriad of issues that were considered by the President in that period  of time, and Brett Kavanaugh, then assistant to the President, was  involved in these decisions. We will not know what he said or did  because the Republicans have refused to ask for the documentary  evidence of his time there.   There is more to the story. The Republicans decided, for those  documents they might consider asking for, they would have a final  filter, and the final filter is a man named Burck, who has served as an  attorney for not only President Bush but also in the past for Steve  Bannon. Does the name ring a bell? Steve Bannon of Breitbart News.  Burck has served as his counsel and was a deputy to Brett Kavanaugh in  the White House.   Mr. Burck is literally going through Kavanaugh's documents from his  time in the White House Counsel's Office to decide which ones will be  given to the Senate Judiciary Committee to consider. So it means he is  the filter of things he doesn't want us to see and he doesn't want the  American people to see. This Republican advocate attorney is going to  be a decisionmaker when it comes to whether we can see documents that  were produced by Brett Kavanaugh when he served in the White House  Counsel's Office.   It gets even worse. It turns out, those documents, which he preclears  for us to read in the Senate Judiciary Committee, are subject to some  sort of committee confidentiality. I have served on the Senate  Judiciary Committee for a number of years, and I know there are  documents which are considered somewhat committee confidential, but it  is rare, and it is usually a case you wouldn't argue over; classified  information, for example. In this case, these Republicans on the Senate  Judiciary Committee will be the final, final filter as to whether the  American people will know the background of Brett Kavanaugh.   Why is there so much secrecy here? Why wouldn't these documents be  made public? Well, let's look back in time. When Elena Kagan was asked  to produce her documents from the time when she served in the White  House, she produced every one of them except those that were personal  and private. On how many of those 170,000 pages did she assert  executive privilege and say: I can't produce them? None. Every single  document was turned over to the Senate Judiciary Committee.   Now, when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh, I can't tell you what is going  on here. There is a concealment which is impossible to explain. What  would we find in those documents that have been carefully screened by  Mr. Burck and then again by the Senate Judiciary Committee Republican  majority?   I am concerned about it because this is a lifetime appointment to the  highest Court in the land. We know the  [[Page S5745]]  Court is carefully divided. It is legitimate for us to ask the  questions about Judge Kavanaugh's background because of our  constitutional responsibility to advise and consent, but we can't ask  those questions if they don't produce the documents, and that is where  we are today.   So my colleagues can come to the floor and talk about Judge  Kavanaugh's record leading up to this nomination. They are limited in  the information they have been given, and the limitations are  unprecedented in the U.S. Senate.   The Republicans, when it comes to the Supreme Court, just rewrite the  rules. Merrick Garland, President Obama's nominee: Sorry. No thanks. We  are not interested in interviewing him or even considering him for that  appointment. When it came to this judge, Judge Kavanaugh, the ordinary  production of documents, by a standard established by the Republicans  and Senator Sessions, is being ignored now when it comes to the  nomination of Brett Kavanaugh. We will be given limited information  because of this process and have to do our best to carefully review  this nominee before he is considered for this lifetime appointment to  the highest Court in the land.    I yield floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
