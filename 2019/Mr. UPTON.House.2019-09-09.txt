 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I might  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Rush, the distinguished chairman of the  Energy Subcommittee, as well as Mr. Pallone and Mr. Walden, for  bringing this bill to the floor.   As the use of digital technology expands across the Federal  Government and the private economy, there is a growing demand for  energy to power our data centers, which are at the very center of this  digital economy. With this growing energy demand comes, in fact, the  growing need to identify areas to use energy more efficiently.   Introduced by Ms. Eshoo and cosponsored by a number of Energy and  Commerce Committee members on both sides of the aisle, Mr. Kinzinger,  Mr. Welch, and Mr. Tonko, H.R. 1420 updates an important provision of  the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to increase  stakeholder involvement in the work to identify metrics and the best  practices to improve the energy efficiency of data centers.   It also updates provisions to better track Federal programs to  increase energy efficiency across the Federal Government's information  technology. This is a practical update to an important program that no  one should oppose.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1420, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I might  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill, H.R. 1768, the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act  of 2019, is a bipartisan bill. It was introduced by my Energy and  Commerce colleagues, Ms. Matsui, who just spoke, and Mr. Long, along  with Mr. Lowenthal and Mr. Wittman.   The bill simply, but importantly, reauthorizes the DERA program  through 2024.   This program was established by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. It is  a voluntary program, administered by the EPA, that helps fund the  retrofit or replacement of existing heavy-duty diesel vehicles,  engines, and equipment with cleaner diesel or new technology.   According to EPA's data, nearly 10 million older diesel vehicles are  operating throughout our transportation infrastructure with no modern  emission controls. The DERA funding and rebates help replace these  vehicles with equipment that meets or surpasses current emissions  standards.   The majority of program spending targets areas that are not meeting  air quality standards for particulate matter and other pollutants,  including at ports and freight-distribution centers and in numerous  communities reliant on legacy diesel engines, such as school buses and  other vehicles.   The Federal and State grants and other assistance under this program  resulted in cleaner, more efficient vehicles, and the net effect is  cleaner air in cities and communities that, in fact, need it the most.   As EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler notes, this is an effective and  innovative program to improve air quality across the country. In fact,  DERA funding has proven a cost-effective tool to help communities meet  their air quality implementation plans.   Congress has long supported this program, which it first reauthorized  in 2010 with strong bipartisan support and even after that  authorization expired in 2016. This bill will ensure the good work to  advance cleaner technology will, in fact, continue.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Palmer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to make the point that this is an  authorization that the level of spending will actually be determined by  the Appropriations Committee, not ours.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a news release from the EPA  making the point from Administrator Wheeler:         ``As this report details, the DERA program is an effective       and innovative way to improve air quality across the country       while providing children with safer, more reliable       transportation to and from school,'' said EPA Administrator       Andrew Wheeler.        Nearly 10 million older diesel engines are operating       throughout our transportation system.        DERA has led to cleaner air across the U.S. by reducing       emissions:        472,700 tons of smog-forming nitrogen oxides.        15,490 tons of particulate matter.        17,700 tons of hydrocarbon.        5,089,170 tons of carbon dioxide.                           [From EPA, 7/25/2019]   News Releases from Headquarters, Air and Radiation (OAR) EPA Report:           Clean Diesel Grants Rack up Major Air, Health Benefits                           (By EPA Press Office)         Washington (July 25, 2019)--Grants to clean up or replace       older diesel engines under the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act       (DERA) have delivered significant health and environmental       benefits to communities across America, according to a U.S.       Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) report released today.       DERA, a bipartisan effort authorized by Congress, provides       cost-effective reductions of harmful diesel pollution across       the U.S. and particularly in areas where air quality is a       concern.        ``As this report details, the DERA program is an effective       and innovative way to improve air quality across the country       while providing children with safer, more reliable       transportation to and from school,'' said EPA Administrator       Andrew Wheeler. ``Children's health is a top priority for       EPA, and DERA helps fulfill our children's health agenda and       commitment to ensure all children can live, learn, and play       in healthy and clean environments.''        Nearly 10 million older diesel engines are operating       throughout our transportation infrastructure with no modern       emissions controls. While some of these will be retired over       time, many will remain in use, polluting America's air for       the next 20 years. The DERA program provides rebates and       grant funding to replace these vehicles and engines with       equipment that meets or exceeds current emissions standards.        DERA has led to cleaner air across the U.S. by reducing       emissions:        472,700 tons of smog-forming nitrogen oxides.        15,490 tons of particulate matter (PM).        17,700 tons of hydrocarbon.        5,089,170 tons of carbon dioxide.        Since 2008, DERA has awarded $629 million in funding to       replace or retrofit 67,300 legacy diesel engines. EPA       estimates that reducing these harmful pollutants will lead to       $19 billion in health benefits and 2,300 fewer premature       deaths. EPA estimates that for every federal dollar spent,       DERA projects generate between $11 and $30 in public health       benefits and over $2 in fuel savings.        The DERA program works to reduce exposure and provide       improved air quality in communities where air pollution is of       concern, including those near ports, rail yards, and PM and       ozone non-attainment areas. Sixty-four percent of projects       awarded in fiscal year 2008-2016 were in areas with these air       quality concerns.        The Fourth Report to Congress summarizes the program's       accomplishments from fiscal year 2008-2013 and discusses       final and estimated results from funding in fiscal year 2014-      2016.

Mr. Speaker, this is a program that works. It takes those  older vehicles off the road. As far as I know, industry supports this.  It is better for our communities, which is why our committee, under  both Republican and Democratic chairmen and administrations, has  supported this, letting the appropriators decide the level of funding  that it actually prescribes.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues, again on a bipartisan basis, to  support this, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to confirm what the chairman said about this  bill. It is bipartisan. We worked on this together. It is a good bill  and it is an important one, which we passed on a voice vote on  suspension in the last Congress. It reauthorizes the State Energy  Program, and it strengthens our energy emergency planning and  preparedness efforts.   As States and communities respond to the damage throughout the  Southeast and the Mid-Atlantic from Hurricane Dorian, we are reminded  how States have to respond to so many different hazards, including  hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, fuel supply disruptions, and physical  and cyber threats.   This legislation, in fact, provides States with the flexibility that  they need to address local energy challenges. It ensures that State  energy security planning efforts address fuel supply issues, assess  State energy profiles, address potential hazards to each energy sector,  mitigate risk to enhance reliability, and incorporate regional planning  efforts.                                time  1700    This legislation, H.R. 2114, helps States protect fuel and electric  infrastructure from both physical and cyber threats and other  vulnerabilities. It makes sure that we are thinking ahead, not just  about an actual threat, but how our energy and electric systems might  be vulnerable in a broader sense.   The bill also encourages mutual assistance, an essential part of  responding and restoring, in the event of an energy emergency. So  prioritizing and elevating security planning and emergency preparedness  is, in fact, an important step in the face of increased threats,  vulnerabilities, and interdependencies of energy infrastructure and  end-use systems.   It is a bipartisan bill. It is a good bill. I urge all of my  colleagues to vote for it, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Flores), the sponsor of the legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation, H.R. 1760, the Advanced Nuclear Fuel  Availability Act, is, in fact, another bipartisan bill sponsored by Mr.  Flores, who just spoke, along with Jerry McNerney from California.   At the end of the last Congress, the House passed the identical bill  on suspension and also on a voice vote after the Energy and Commerce  Committee had reported the bill favorably and also on a voice vote.   Nuclear innovators face a critical challenge as they work to bring  several promising advanced nuclear technologies to the market. These  new designs require fuels that have different attributes than what is  used in today's fleet of nuclear reactors, but the fuels are not  commercially available.   So this bill ensures nuclear innovators will, in fact, have the  advanced fuels needed to develop and demonstrate their products  commercially. The bill provides a direct path to align advanced nuclear  fuel supply with initial demand for the deployment of next generation  nuclear technologies. It provides for the development of the technical  information necessary to assist the creation of the regulatory  licensing framework for these fuels.    The bill also directs the Secretary of Energy to establish a  temporary program, operating to support a public-private partnership  that is going to make what is known as high-assay low-enriched uranium  available for use in the first-of-a-kind advanced nuclear reactor  designs.   It is going to provide for the information necessary to inform the  new-market developments and cost recovery for any initial Federal  investment.   So, in short, the Advanced Nuclear Fuel Availability Act takes the  necessary steps to ensure that the infrastructure will be in place in  time to enable the development and deployment of a new generation of  nuclear technologies across the U.S.   It is an important bill for ensuring the Nation's international  leadership on nuclear technology to ensure that our energy security and  achieving our clean-energy goals are, in fact, done.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill and when it passes, I urge  our Senate colleagues to adopt it as well. It is a bipartisan bill and,  again, I congratulate the leadership on both sides of the aisle for  bringing this bill to the floor for debate in a vote this afternoon.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
