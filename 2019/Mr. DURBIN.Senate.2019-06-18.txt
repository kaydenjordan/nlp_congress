 Mr. President, if you study the recent course of American  history, you can note there has been the emergence of opportunity and  debates on freedom many times during the last 50 years.   I think back to my time, my early years of education in high school  and college, when America was in the midst of debate about the rights  of African Americans--the civil rights movements in the 1960s.   We have also had debates as well on the question of liberty and  freedom--freedom from discrimination for women in America and for those  who are disabled. It really is the hallmark of this democracy that we  continue to expand opportunity and continue to question our own beliefs  when it comes to the freedom which each of us cherishes.   We are now in the midst of an interesting transformation in this  country on the issue of rights of people with different sexual  orientation. We have seen some dramatic changes in just the last few  years as we find more and more people speaking out against  discrimination against those of a different sexual orientation, and, of  course, the landmark decision in Obergefell, where the U.S. Supreme  Court recognized the right for same-sex marriage. This is not without  controversy and not without dissenters, but the mainstream of America,  the vast majority of Americans believe we are moving along the same  path we did when we talked about the rights of those who are  minorities, women, and the disabled, when we say people should be free  of discrimination because of their own sexual orientation.   That is why it strikes me as unusual, more than coincidental, that in  June--the LGBTQ Pride Month--our Republican colleagues decided to bring  to the floor the nomination of Texas district court nominee Matthew  Kacsmaryk, who has repeatedly written in his personal capacity about  his opposition to LGBTQ rights and the Obergefell decision.   Mr. Kacsmaryk's nomination was reported out of the Senate Judiciary  Committee on a party-line vote in February, but for some reason, the  Republican leadership decided to wait and force a vote on the floor of  the Senate during Pride Month. Now they are calling for a vote this  week.   Mr. Kacsmaryk has not been shy about his hostility to marriage  equality in transgender Americans. On June 24, 2015, he wrote an  article in which he noted that the Supreme Court would decide the  Obergefell case in the next few weeks and speculated whether five  Justices would, in his words, ``invent a constitutional right to same- sex marriage.''   After the decision, Mr. Kacsmaryk wrote a disparaging summary--which  I will not quote into the Record--but it certainly shows his opposition  to the fundamental premise behind that decision. He was quoted in the  Liberty Institute blog of October 16, 2014 saying ``the pro-marriage  movement must prepare for the long war.''   He signed a letter in 2016 relating to transgender Americans, calling  them ``a delusion.'' Last December, the parents of 300 transgender  children--including 39 from my State of Illinois--wrote the Senate in  opposition to Mr. Kacsmaryk's nomination and said: ``Our children are  not a delusion, and neither is our love and support for them.''   Even though Mr. Kacsmaryk has expressed strident personal views  opposing LGBTQ rights, and even though he has litigated frequently in  cases involving these matters, he would not commit to recuse himself  from cases involving this issue if he were to be confirmed by the  Senate.   I oppose the Kacsmaryk nomination. This is yet another extreme  nominee outside the mainstream of American thinking who does not  deserve to be rubberstamped for a lifetime appointment by the U.S.  Senate.                        The Kovler Center and Cameroon    Mr. President, just 2 weeks ago, I had a meeting in Chicago with my  colleague Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky. We were at Heartland Alliance's  Marjorie Kovler Center. What happens at this center is truly remarkable  and a reflection of America's long history of welcoming those who are  fleeing political violence.    The Kovler Center is home to one of our Nation's oldest and most  respected facilities, helping those recovering from complex  consequences of politically sanctioned torture. This is its 32nd year  in operation. More than 3,000 torture survivors from 80 different  countries have received assistance and counsel at the Kovler Center in  Chicago.   The problem of torture among refugees is significant.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for an  additional 2 minutes.    The problem of torture among refugees is significant,  with an estimated 44 percent of refugees in the United States having  been victims of such horrors. Those from Bosnia, Cambodia, and many  other places all receive free treatment at the Kovler Center to recover  from their trauma.   During my visit I had the privilege of meeting refugees who had fled  the mounting violence in Cameroon. Cameroon is a West African nation  that is dealing with a complicated colonial legacy. Following World War  I, the League of Nations appointed France and Great Britain as joint  trustees to what was previously a German colony. Not surprisingly, the  two colonial powers imposed their own cultures on the new Cameroon.   Tragically, following the country's independence in the 1960s,  Cameroonian strongman President Paul Biya, one of the world's longest  serving leaders--now almost 40 years in office--further favored the  French-speaking population over its Anglophone regions.   The results were not surprising. The mounting resentment and calls  for greater autonomy within the Anglophone population caused ensuing  violent suppression from the Biya regime. The refugees I met with told  harrowing stories of this crackdown and violence.   I was pleased to join Senator Van Hollen last year in a letter urging  Secretary Pompeo to focus attention on the unrest in Cameroon, and I  was equally pleased when the administration scaled back U.S. military  assistance to Cameroon due to this government's violent repression. As  a Member of the Appropriations Committee, I will be watching carefully  the level of violence in Cameroon and, when the day comes, when we  consider any foreign aid to this Nation.   The work of the Kovler Center is a reminder that if we are going to  stand up for human rights we must be willing to be vigilant at all  times, even for small countries as far away as Cameroon.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     I announce that the Senator from New York (Mrs.  Gillibrand), the Senator from California (Ms. Harris), the Senator from  Hawaii (Ms. Hirono), and the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Udall) are  necessarily absent.
