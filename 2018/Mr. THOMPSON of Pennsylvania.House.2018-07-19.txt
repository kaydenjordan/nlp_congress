 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the Kennedy-Lugar Youth Exchange and Study Abroad program, otherwise  known as the YES program.   Sponsored by the Department of State and funded by Congress, the YES  program is celebrating 15 years of connecting the world.   Established after the September 11 attacks, high school students from  across the country spend an academic year in countries with a  significant Muslim population. The students live with a host family,  attend a local high school, and engage in activities to learn about  their host country's society and values. In turn, the students share  American culture and values with the people of their host country.   I recently met with a YES program participant from Pennsylvania's  Fifth District, Jocelyn Krieger from Port Matilda. This past academic  year, Jocelyn lived and learned in Bosnia. She and numerous other  students were able to participate in this important cultural exchange  that fosters understanding and collaboration between people of  different backgrounds.   Mr. Speaker, I know that this great program will continue to grow and  connect cultures to truly build a global community.                            ____________________
