 Madam Speaker, look at these young, innocent faces. I  suspect many of these children are seeing the House floor for the very  first time.   It is unfortunate that their first experience in this temple of  democracy, the people's House, is to be here as we call our government  to stop terrorizing children on the U.S.-Mexico border.   This past weekend, Madam Speaker, I traveled with Leader Pelosi and  the  [[Page H5291]]  chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. What we saw there was  heart-wrenching. We have heard the audio of children crying: ``Mami,  papi.''   Madam Speaker, it begs the question: Has our Nation lost its way? But  nothing is as heart-wrenching as seeing children's faces in person,  kids who were just taken from the arms of their parents, and children  in cages crying for their parents. This is child abuse.   Let's be clear, Madam Speaker, this travesty could end today. Donald  Trump could end this today by a single phone call.   To my Republican friends on the other side of the aisle, I simply say  this: What happened to the party of family values? History will  remember this moment.
