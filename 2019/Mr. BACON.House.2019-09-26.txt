 Madam Speaker, I rise today during Hispanic Heritage Month  to recognize Mundo Latino, a Hispanic publication originating from my  district in Omaha, Nebraska, that has had a lasting impact on our  Hispanic community for the last two decades.   Mundo Latino is a weekly newspaper serving the local Hispanic  population. Founded by Abril Garcia, it is celebrating its 20th  anniversary this year.   Abril was born in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, in 1973, and is a graduate  of the prestigious Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher  Education, or Tec de Monterrey.   Abril immigrated to the United States in 1996 and invested her time  and money in the success of her very own business, all while working  multiple jobs during its inception. The goal was to create a  communication medium that understood the language and culture of the  Hispanic community and, more importantly, the needs of immigrants  residing here in the United States.   Her degree in mass communication studies gave her the knowledge she  needed to ensure the success of her startup newspaper. In 1999, Mundo  Latino was born and had a distribution of 3,000 copies per month, all  while Abril was still working as a cashier at a local grocery store. By  2003, Mundo Latino was printing 20,000 copies per month, an outstanding  feat for a 4-year-old newspaper. In 2011, the success of Abril and her  staff enabled them to start a second publication exclusively serving  the Omaha area.    Today, Mundo Latino produces four different publications with a  circulation of nearly 40,000 copies a week across the State of Nebraska  and has become a cherished voice throughout the Latino community. Mundo  Latino is considered the main Spanish newspaper for the Hispanic  community in Nebraska and northwest Iowa.   Through the years, Mundo Latino has received numerous accolades,  including Small Business of the Year and Business of the Year in  Nebraska and Iowa, the Organization Award from the Nebraska Latino  American Commission, and many others.   Mundo Latino exemplifies the American Dream. Our Nation provides us  the opportunities to work hard and prosper, and Abril is doing just  that. Again, I congratulate Mundo Latino and Abril Garcia on achieving  20 years of excellence in business and journalism.                            ____________________
