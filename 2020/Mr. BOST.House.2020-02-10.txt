 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise today in support of S. 2107, which will help ensure the safety  and security of our agricultural imports.   The U.S. agriculture sector is a vitally important component of the  American economy. In my district alone, agriculture is responsible for  over 30,000 jobs and adds $2 billion to the economy.   In China, African swine fever has killed more hogs than the entire  U.S. herd combined. We must do everything we can to protect our  domestic herds against the same fate.   In authorizing more CBP agriculture specialists and K-9 teams at our  ports of entry, we can ensure the safety of our livestock while  preserving billions of dollars in potential losses to American  agriculture.   On behalf of thousands of livestock producers in my district, I urge  my colleagues to support the passage of this bill.
