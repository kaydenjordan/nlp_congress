 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R.  1996, the marijuana banking bill. This legislation is about  legitimizing and bankrolling the marijuana industry and making  legalization inevitable.   It is sad that the House is voting on this bill during a time when  our country is seeing increases in addiction, depression, and suicide.  Rather than helping victims of despair, we are enhancing the financial  benefits for those peddling and profiting off the sale of marijuana.   We are not even directly debating our drug laws. No. We are cowardly  debating if we should reward States for undermining the rule of law.   Despite what the swamp says, we don't need recreational marijuana. As  [[Page H1896]]  recently as 2016, the DEA determined that marijuana should remain a  schedule I substance.   I don't care what the lobbyists or talking heads for the marijuana  industry like John Boehner say, I care about keeping dangerous  substances away from our children and standing for the values I was  elected to fight for.   The last thing our country needs is our help facilitating the  profitability of addictive, behavior-altering, recreational drug use.   I oppose the bill, and I urge every Member to do the same.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.
