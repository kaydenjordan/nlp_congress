 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong support for  our Second Amendment as protected by the United States Constitution.   The right to bear arms shall never be infringed upon, and I will  always defend that right on this very floor.   I swore an oath to serve the people of Indiana's Sixth District, and  that means fighting for the God-given right of all Americans to defend  themselves and their property. The right to defend yourself and protect  your loved ones is paramount now more than ever.                              In Support of Life     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to give voice to those who do  not have one: The unborn children of America.   I am a pro-life American. It is our duty to protect the most  vulnerable among us. Every human being deserves a right to life, and I  will always defend that right. As I stand in this Chamber today, I  pledge to always fight for the fundamental right to live given to us by  God.                             Support Main Street     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support  Main Street as our economy reopens.   Across this Nation mom-and-pop shops are suffering.   The COVID-19 pandemic, combined with extreme social unrest, has  caused businesses everywhere to shut their doors, many of which may  never open again.   As we reopen, American jobs may be lost permanently.   Congress must make it a priority to protect and support small  business owners and workers.   It is our duty to do the people's work here in the people's House in  our Nation's capital.   Congress must support the Americans we swore to represent.                    In Support of Law Enforcement Officers     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my support for our  brave law enforcement officers.   Behind the badge and uniform of our men and women in blue are  neighbors and friends who put their lives on the line every day to  protect the citizens they serve.   Defunding the police would be downright dangerous, and I will never  support that.   Further, some are advocating to change qualified immunity.   Eliminating this civil protection would have disastrous implications.   It would open up officers and their families to countless civil  lawsuits and make community policing all but impossible.   In these times, the heroes of law enforcement deserve more support,  not less.      Americans Need a Strong Infrastructure Bill to Revive our Economy     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice opposition to H.R. 2.   Americans across this Nation need a strong infrastructure bill to  revive and strengthen our economy now.   Yet Democrats drafted this bill without any Republican input.   Commonsense, bipartisan proposals like the 12 amendments I authored  failed because this is not a serious effort. This bill is a progressive  wish list and a Nancy Pelosi power grab again.   I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 2.             Wishing Good Luck to 4-H Participants Across Indiana     Mr. Speaker, as the fair season begins, I want to wish the  best of luck to all 4-H'rs across Indiana's Sixth District.   Though this year's fairs are virtual and may look very different, the  hard work they have put in throughout this past year I want to  recognize.   4-H is a tremendous organization that helps our Nation's youth  develop the life skills needed to empower themselves and their  communities.   Best of luck to those participating in their 4-H county fair. You are  making your families and communities very proud.                            ____________________
