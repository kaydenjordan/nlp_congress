 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from  Florida (Ms. Shalala) for yielding time and, also, for her leadership  throughout the years in fighting to keep drug costs low. It really  matters to families all across this country.   I feel like shouting this from the top of the Capitol dome: We are  going to pass a bill that will allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices  in America.    This is kind of an all-American concept, isn't it, negotiate fair  prices?   But for too long, Big Pharma, these drug companies, have gouged  American families and consumers, and they have taken advantage of it,  haven't they? I mean, these prices are astronomical.   Families across America are often paying 4, 5, 10 times more the  amount for their prescriptions than families in other countries. That  is not right, and it is especially not right in this country where it  is the U.S. taxpayer who is often providing the funding for the basic  research to develop these drugs.   So let's all shout it from the Capitol dome, the very top: We are  going to allow--we are going to direct Medicare to negotiate prices to  bring the cost of prescription drugs down.   We are going to not just contain that in Medicare, but make sure that  it is spread, and those cost savings are realized for all of the  families who rely on private insurance.   And then, with the billions of dollars in savings, we are going to  improve Medicare. For a long time, Medicare has not provided  comprehensive benefits for vision, for hearing, for dental care. These  are fundamental health services.   So what a winning proposition for American families. And I am so  proud that it is the Democrats and our new majority that can deliver on  this promise for the people.   Lower drug costs now.
