 Mr. Speaker, Greg Gianforte is a family man and a  businessman. He has been a husband for 29 years, and he is a father of  four. He is a founder with his wife, Susan, of RightNow Technologies,  which employs over 500 fellow Montanans.   It is good to have another businessowner in this House, somebody who  knows the way the economy works, who has created jobs, and who cares  about his local community.   Now, Montana may only send one Member to this body, but out West, it  is not about how many of you there are, it is about how much you do.   Greg is a doer, and we are happy to have him here.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Montana (Mr. Gianforte),  who is the dean of Montana.
