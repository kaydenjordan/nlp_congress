 Mr. President, I look across the Senate and see  Senator McCain's desk silent, draped in black, under a vase of white  roses, and it breaks my heart. I am here to say my farewell, and I have  a bit of a predicament, which is that I am a very ordinary man, here to  try and give tribute to a very extraordinary man.   John McCain was an extraordinary man--extraordinary in his suffering  and resilience, extraordinary in his ideals and principles,  extraordinary in his courage and devotion, and extraordinary, too, in  the devotion he engendered.   We met when I was a new Senator and he already a legend. His battles  for campaign finance reform and against corrupting earmarks were  legendary. He could make a point here on the Senate floor with  legendary drama and punch and declarative force. He could also be  unreasonable, and he took a completely unreasonable liking to me. Our  politics did not match. I could offer him nothing. Yet he befriended  me, and, as so many colleagues know, John's friendship was a treasure.   John showed courage in many ways, but he showed real courage in  friendship. When an attack was mounted on one of Hillary Clinton's  staffers, he came straight to the floor to defend her publicly. When  someone attacked the character of Senator Obama at a political event,  he said: No, I know him. He is a good family man.   Loyalty attracts loyalty, and John was loyal. We traveled a lot  together--to Afghanistan and Iraq, to Munich, Mali, Mongolia, and  Macassar, to many, many places but, most poignantly, to Vietnam.   My dad served 5 years in Vietnam. He told me about his colleague,  Admiral McCain, whose son was a POW, who had been shot down and wounded  terribly but refused early release. As a boy, I went with my father to  Tan Son Nhut Air Base in Saigon the night our POWs returned from  captivity. John had left straight from Hanoi and did not pass through  Tan Son Nhut, but I witnessed how frail and ill and pale and battered  his fellow POWs were as they clamored out of the helicopters into the  glare of the TV lights.   I was ready to revere any man who had been through that, and to find  that this man was so friendly and cheerful and feisty and irreverent-- that put me irrevocably into the McCain fan club. I noticed I was not  alone. One telling measure of a man is his staff. John attracted people  of exceptional talent and ability, who became so devoted they would  walk through fire for him.   John attracted the admiration of foreign leaders, not just from great  powers but from remote and struggling countries. When we traveled in  Libya, John was received like Lafayette. He had been there when it  counted, when freedom there was in the offing. He was beloved in  Ukraine. He had spoken at the Maidan when freedom there was in the  offing. He spent an icy New Year's Eve with Ukrainian troops on their  frontline.   In Vietnam, John was revered. I don't know any celebrities, but I do  know what traveling with a celebrity is like because I have traveled  with John McCain in Vietnam. The statue that stands in Hanoi by the  lake where he was shot down calls him an air pirate, but he was treated  everywhere as a hero. And you had to know he liked the air pirate  thing.   Wherever we went in the world, he wanted to meet with prisoners, with  the opposition, with whoever was pursuing freedom for their country.  John McCain was America's most vigorous and loyal ambassador of  freedom.   He was fiercely proud that one place he was not welcome was Russia.  Putin had banned him. ``No more holidays in Siberia,'' John laughed.  Mark my words, one day even Russia will turn toward freedom, and when  it does, John McCain will be revered there.   John made a big difference in a great many ways, but the one I want  to close with is the Senate.   Senators are often stuffy. John was not. If there was ever a Senator  entitled to take himself seriously, it was John. Yet he didn't. He  effervesced the stolid Senate, to the occasional annoyance of some of  our colleagues. Here, too, John engendered lifetime loyalty and  affection and respect. Lindsey and Joe and Kelly were his great  amigos--none greater than Lindsey, but many of us loved him well.   Millions of Americans saw John McCain give the famous C-SPAN thumbs  down that put an end to repeal and replace. They probably did not see  what happened next. Having just cast what was a devastating vote for  many of his colleagues, he went back to his seat. From my seat here  across the Chamber, I saw John's colleagues gently start moving toward  him. They may have hated his vote, but there was nevertheless this  gentle flow of bodies moving to stand around and near him. His friend  Dan Sullivan of Alaska was one who came down from the back row just to  stand near John in the aisle. Hate the vote; love the man. This place  can be complicated.   John could be annoying. In Munich, accepting an award for John, his  beloved Cindy said: ``I love him--most of  [[Page S5951]]  the time.'' His temper could be explosive. I read once of a man  nicknamed for a South American volcano because he ``constantly fumed  and regularly erupted,'' and I thought of John. He loved a good fight  and was eager to pile in. ``A fight not joined is a fight not  enjoyed,'' he would say.   An extraordinary man is not a flawless man, and in his full humanity,  John gave the rest of us mortals hope. You need not be perfect to try  to be extraordinary. Well, he was extraordinary. I think we all found  in him qualities of affection, principle, courage, and drama that were  extraordinary. And at the end of the day, as compass needles turn  toward true north, you knew where he would be pointing.   I will quote some of his last public words here:         Though the true radiance of our world may at times seem       obscured, though we will suffer adversity and setbacks and       misfortune--never, ever stop fighting for all that is good       and just and decent about our world and each other.    I will never forget and will always treasure our friendship, but what  I will revere is the way John McCain pointed true north at what was  good and just and decent about our world and each other.   His hero, Robert Jordan, in ``For Whom the Bell Tolls,'' said, as he  died, ``The world is a fine place and worth the fighting for and I hate  very much to leave it.'' We hate very much, John, that you have had to  leave it. God bless you.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
