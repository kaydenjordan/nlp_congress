 Madam Speaker, there is a retirement crisis in America  today. Working men and women simply just don't have enough money in  retirement savings.   I rise today to advocate for the bipartisan SECURE Act, which will:  one, help small businesses provide retirement plans that include  automatic enrollment by giving those businesses an opportunity to pool  together and by offering them a tax credit to help pay for startup  costs; and, two, provide 401(k)s for the rising number of part-time  workers and independent contractors in the new tech economy that can be  portable from their current jobs to the next ones.   Since the 1980s, the American economy has grown dramatically. Since  1983, the Dow Jones has gone up 1,200 percent and the GDP has gone up  600 percent, yet the wages of the American people have gone up less  than 20 percent. No longer is hard work a guarantee of achieving the  American Dream.   Every American, whether liberal or conservative, believes that if you  are willing to work 40 or 50 hours a week and 50 weeks a year that you  should be able to have a decent place to live, to educate your  children, to have health insurance, and to retire one day without being  scared. That is simply not happening.   The SECURE Act will help make retirement security a reality for  millions of Americans.
