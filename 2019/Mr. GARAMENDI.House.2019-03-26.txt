 Mr. Speaker, I have got a couple of things I want to  do today, and I would like to start with a very special celebration  that occurs every spring, and this is the Sikh community's annual  historic, cultural, and religious celebration of Vaisakhi.   It is a celebration in the Punjab region of south Asia. It has been  going on for centuries, and today it is also celebrated in communities  throughout India, the United States, and, really, around the world.   Vaisakhi is an annual festival celebrating the spring season, and it  is of great significance to the Sikh religion. It commemorates the  creation of Khalsa, a fellowship of devoted Sikhs, and was founded in  1699 by Guru Singh and celebrates the community, prosperity, and  continued progress in the year ahead.   It is springtime, and so we celebrate this very important event in  the Sikh community.   I also want to talk about another event of the spring, one that you  just heard mentioned a moment ago from our colleague, Mrs. Axne of  Iowa, when she talked about the flooding that is occurring.   As chairman of the House Subcommittee on Readiness of the Armed  Services Committee, the question for the U.S. military is very, very  clear: Is the U.S. military ready for climate change?   Recent events indicate that there is considerable doubt. Just this  last year, Hurricanes Florence and Michael caused billions of dollars  of damage to Camp Lejeune and leveled much of Tyndall Air Force Base.   Perhaps a photo might be better than my words in describing the  destruction at Tyndall Air Force Base. Essentially, this key Air Force  base located on the Panhandle of Florida, on the Gulf Coast, was wiped  out.   We don't yet know how much it is going to cost to rebuild it. We do  know that the Air Force is trying to sustain operations there, and I am  told that by May they will be out of money to be able to sustain  operations.   We know that there is probably $3 to $4 billion of damage at this Air  Force base alone. Keep in mind that this base is located, literally, on  a sand spit adjacent to the Gulf, and, when hurricanes come through,  destruction is sure to occur.   Every marine knows this place, Camp Lejeune. It, too, was hit by a  hurricane, not the winds but the deluge that came with the hurricane.   Flooding wiped out a large portion of the base. As you can see, a  tree did something that no marine would ever want to have happen, and  that is to take out their barracks. This base, too, sustained  substantial damage as a result of the hurricane and the flood that was  precipitated by the hurricane.   This is also a $3 to $4 billion event. The rebuilding of Camp Lejeune  and Tyndall raises a serious question for those of us who must decide  on the appropriations: Should we even return to these locations which  we know are going to be hit once again and perhaps multiple times in  the future?   And if we decide to return and spend the $3 to $4 billion to repair  each of the bases, how will it be done? Will it be done in the  recognition that there is climate change, that the hurricanes will be  stronger, the deluge even more?   We must always build for resiliency.   Now, this isn't the only place that the military has sustained  significant risk this year. I am from California, and I know wildfires.  Camp Pendleton, on the far side of this continent, another marine base,  faced evacuation of the family housing units when fires occurred in the  hills above Camp Pendleton.   Naval Air Station Point Mugu and the Marine Corps Mountain Warfare  Training Center in the Sierra Nevada mountains also had to be evacuated  as wildfires came down into those areas.   In addition, beyond Camp Lejeune, beyond Tyndall Air Force Base, we  know that our coastal installations and their surrounding communities  are already experiencing significant flooding as sea levels rise.   The Army's Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site at the  Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific is threatened by sea level rise and is  not expected to exist in 20 years.   The Navy's principal Atlantic base, Norfolk/Hampton Roads, and the  Naval Academy are already experiencing flooding.   We know that melting polar ice in Arctic regions has already opened  up new sea lanes and new routes and competition for resources in the  Arctic Ocean.   Yet, today, it appears that the Department of Defense has not  developed a systematic strategy for ensuring that our U.S. national  interests in the Arctic and, indeed, the protection of our bases, key  military bases, here in the United States and around the world are  prepared for climate change.   I want to give you one more example. It was actually opened in a  discussion a moment ago by my friend from Iowa.   Now, this is not Iowa. This is Offutt Air Force Base, just across the  river from the photo you saw just a few moments ago of the flooding in  Iowa. It is on the Missouri River. This happens to be the Strategic Air  Command's Basic Center. This is our nuclear weapons system.                                time  1500    More than half of the base was underwater, and more than half of the  base today is not operable. Six years ago, the U.S. Air Force knew that  this Strategic Air Command base was subject to flooding. Indeed, the  flooding 6 years ago had come up to the edge of the runway. Last week,  it inundated the runway and half the base.   Back to my question: Is the U.S. military ready for climate change?  It would indicate, from these few examples, that the answer is no. So  what are we to do about it?   The United States military is one of the largest employers in the  world. It is also one of the largest consumers of energy. The  Department of Defense owns millions of acres of global real property,  including over 550,000 facilities valued at well over $1 trillion. The  Department is uniquely situated to enhance its readiness and resiliency  through effective energy policies, programs, and structures that are  resilient in the face of climate change.   Installations, bases, are where we generate the force, where we train  and sustain them and, in many cases, house critical operational  missions, such as the Strategic Air Command.   One way to enhance readiness is to consume less. In fiscal year 2017,  the Department of Defense consumed over 85 million barrels of fuel to  power ships, aircraft, combat vehicles, and contingency bases, at a  cost of nearly $8.2 billion. In many cases, through contract vehicles  such as energy-saving  [[Page H2820]]  performance contracts, these energy-saving and resiliency enhancements  can be made at no upfront cost to the Department of Defense.   In contested environments, such as Afghanistan, Syria, and Iraq,  better fuel consumption extends the range of, and mitigates the risk  to, our military. The resupply of energy is one of the most dangerous  things that occurs in military operations, and resupply convoys are  targeted. Naval vessels are vulnerable during at-sea replenishment. For  austere land-based sites in remote locations supporting contingency  operations around the world, lower fuel and water consumption rates are  an essential readiness enabler, helping that facility to maintain a  lower profile at far less risk.   It is essential that our bases and our facilities recover quickly  from extreme weather events and from energy disruptions that impact  mission capability.   Section 335 of the fiscal year 2018 National Defense Authorization  Act required the Department of Defense to report on the effects of  climate change on the Department and propose mitigation plans. We have  that report in hand. Only days after we received it, Camp Lejeune was  flooded; Tyndall was wiped out; and now Offutt is flooded.   We are not happy with the report that the military sent to the House  Armed Services Committee and the Subcommittee on Readiness because that  report did not meet the congressional reporting requirement that we  sent to the Department to describe future focused mitigations necessary  to ensure mission resiliency.   We are not going to stop. The military is going to come back to the  committee, and we are going to hammer home the necessity of resiliency  and the necessity, as every Boy Scout knows, to be prepared.   What do they need to be prepared for? Certainly, for the missions,  whatever those might be, whether it is the Strategic Air Command or the  Marines or the Air Force, but also to be prepared for the inevitable  effects of climate change.   To ensure that the military can perform its national defense mandate,  the Department of Defense must--must--plan for the vagaries and  exigencies that exist as a result of climate change.   The ``2014 Climate Change Adaptation Road Map'' that the Department  put out noted that rising global temperatures, changing precipitation  patterns, climbing sea levels, and extreme weather events will  intensify the challenges of global instability. Hunger, poverty, and  conflict are the inevitable results of climate change and its effects  on communities all around the world.   In the Department's words, climate change ``will likely lead to food  and water shortages, pandemic disease, disputes over refugees and  resources, and destruction by natural disasters . . . across the  globe.''   Not only are these climate-related events impacting installations and  base readiness, but they are also creating more frequent requests for  military support for disaster relief and humanitarian assistance.  Active Duty servicemembers, National Guard personnel, and Reserve  personnel are increasingly responding to assist communities in impacted  events here in the United States and around the world.   Climate change presents a myriad of readiness challenges, both here  at home and abroad. It is not only a future threat. By the events of  this year and last week, it is an event here and now. It is a threat  today; it is impacting the resiliency of our installations and our  operations; and it is seriously impacting the readiness of the  Department of Defense to meet its challenges all around the world.   We have our hands full, making sure that our military is ready in the  era of climate change.                            Healthcare in America     Now, if I might, Mr. Speaker, change subjects and pick  up another issue that is before us today. Joining me in this discussion  will be Mr. Payne from the beautiful State of New Jersey.   Just a moment, Mr. Payne. Let me lay out what we are going to talk  about here.   Today, the House Democrats unveiled new legislation to protect people  with preexisting conditions and also to lower healthcare costs. We know  that, over the last 2 years, President Trump has declared war on  healthcare, and the Democrats here in this House and in the Senate  intend to address that by lowering healthcare costs.   Last night, in a Federal court, President Trump radically expanded  his monstrous war on America's healthcare, asking the court not only to  strike down protections for people with preexisting conditions--not  only asking the court to strike down protections for people with  preexisting conditions--but also to eliminate the very last protections  and benefits provided in the Affordable Care Act.    If President Trump gets his way in the Texas v. U.S. lawsuit, he  would destroy the ban on lifetime and annual limits of care. He would  destroy the Medicare expansion and the tax subsidies that make health  insurance affordable for millions of America.   On the very first day of the 116th Congress, the House Democrats  voted to throw the full legal weight of the House of Representatives  against what President Trump is attempting to do in the Texas v. U.S.  lawsuit. Thanks to that vote, the House counsel has been able to  intervene as a party in the lawsuit to argue on behalf of the  healthcare of the American people. But more than 190 of my Republican  colleagues stood behind the President in his brutal assault on American  healthcare.   Unlike my colleagues on the Republican side, today, the Democrats of  Congress are introducing legislation to protect preexisting conditions  and make healthcare more affordable. We are taking another step forward  to deliver on our promises to reverse the last 10 years of our  Republican colleagues' effort to sabotage the Affordable Care Act, and  to lower the healthcare costs that American families need.   There are three parts to the legislation: lowering healthcare  insurance premiums with strengthened and expanded affordable  assistance; expanding the tax credits that make healthcare insurance  more affordable to more middle-income families; and making them more  sustainable to all those who are eligible.   Point 2 strengthens protections for people with preexisting  conditions, curtailing the Trump administration's effort to give States  waivers to undermine protections for people with preexisting conditions  and weaken the standards for essential health benefits.   Third, stop the insurance companies from selling junk health  insurance policies.   Finally, reverse the GOP's health sabotage that has needlessly driven  up premiums and uninsured rates.   We know we are going to have our hands full to get this past the  Senate and to the desk of the President, but we would hope, as this  debate develops, as time goes by and Americans realize what they are  losing as a result of the efforts of the Trump administration and many  of my Republican colleagues to deny them the healthcare that they  deserve as Americans, that we will ultimately be successful in this  legislation and that we will get the President to see clearly what he  is doing to the American people as he promotes, defends, and attacks  Americans through the Texas v. U.S. lawsuit that is currently underway.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask my colleague, Mr. Payne, if he could  join us with his comments. I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. Payne).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman so very much; he is  far too generous in his comments with regard to me. He is constantly  here joining in these discussions and putting forth the interests of  the constituents in his district in New Jersey and across wider  America. I thank the gentleman for raising those issues, and  particularly for pointing out the issue of preexisting conditions as it  affects women.   Before the Affordable Care Act, every woman was considered to have a  preexisting condition, and, indeed, they were charged higher premiums.  That is not the case with the Affordable Care Act in law, but if the  Texas case is successful, if the President is successful in his  arguments before the court and it is carried on, then those protections  for women, more than 50 percent of the American population, will be  gone.   Beyond that, the expansion of the Medicaid programs, those, too, will  be gone. For people with preexisting conditions, people who have  diabetes or high blood pressure, their protections will be gone.   So the effect on preexisting conditions, and particularly this case  that the President has put his full support behind, is an egregious  attack on the healthcare and the well-being of Americans, as Mr. Payne  so well pointed out. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman so much for  doing that.                            Armed Forces Readiness     Mr. Speaker, there are a couple of other things that I  do want to speak to today.   Today, the House Armed Services Committee had before it the Acting  Secretary of Defense as well as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff. Issues were raised during that committee hearing about  readiness, specifically about the efforts of the President to  circumvent the Constitution of the United States and to take unto  himself the appropriation power, which is clearly laid out in the  Constitution as the power of Congress.   Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution clearly says that there  shall be no money taken from the Treasury except by appropriation law.  That is the power of the purse that is given to Congress.   The Founders were very clear that, if the President would have not  only the power of carrying out the law, but also the power of  appropriation--that is, money to carry out the law--we would have a  completely different system. In fact, we would have an imperial  presidency. They didn't want that, and they wrote very clearly into the  Constitution that no money shall be taken from the Treasury without an  appropriation.   Now, the Congress acted on this issue, acted on the issue with an  appropriation bill, and Congress did not agree with the President.  Instead of the $5 billion, $6 billion that the President wanted for his  border wall, Congress said no and provided $1.3 billion for border  security, including some fences in some locations. Very clearly,  Congress said no to the President, and Congress appropriated money for  a specific purpose.   No sooner was that legislation signed by the President than the  President attempted to usurp the power of Congress and to appropriate  for himself some $8 billion by manipulating the existing emergency laws  that allow the declaration of emergency and money to be spent for that  emergency.   Okay. That is what he wanted to do. Be clear in understanding that  this is the attempt by the President to appropriate money in an  unconstitutional and, I believe, an illegal way.   Now, it is not just a constitutional issue; it is also an issue of  readiness for the military. We are talking about tens of millions of  dollars to rebuild Offutt Air Force Base, the home of the Strategic Air  Command.   We are talking about $3 billion to $4 billion to rebuild Camp  Lejeune, one of the two major domestic bases for the U.S. Marine Corps.    We are talking about $3 billion to $4 billion to rebuild Tyndall Air  Force Base in Florida, the home of the F-22 fighter jets and the new  and presumed home of the new F-35 multitask fighter.   So we should ask: If the President is able to divert $6 billion to $8  billion from the military construction account, which we call MILCON,  and use it for his border wall, where are we to find the money, the $3  billion to $4 billion to rebuild Tyndall, the $3 billion to $4 billion  to rebuild Camp Lejeune, and all of the other bases across the United  States and around the world that face climate change? Where are we  going to get the money?   Well, if you happen to be a deficit hawk, you are going to get  excited about the prospect it is going to be borrowed money.   The way in which the budget and the appropriation process works here,  critical programs that the military has deemed essential for the  readiness of our military and Congress has agreed to, authorized and  appropriated money for that purpose, those programs will be delayed,  and we will simply increase the deficit to do it so that the President  can fulfill his campaign promise of a big, beautiful border wall.   Last week, I was in Jordan on a military mission to look at our  troops there, to look at the situation in Syria and Iraq. Also, I was  in Iraq and specifically went to look at a program that the U.S.  Government had funded to build a modern 21st century border security  program for Jordan's military and Jordan's Government.   Over 300 miles between Jordan and Syria, in the most violent part of  the world, with ISIS, with refugees, with  [[Page H2822]]  military weapons, with drugs, all of that, we spent $345 million of  taxpayer money building a 21st century border security system, a system  that involves observation techniques of many kinds, a system that  involves observation towers at appropriate locations along that 300- plus-mile border, and quick response teams to go where there was an  incursion across the border. And by all accounts from our own military,  from Jordan's military, it is effective.   Now, the President wants $8 billion for 150 miles of fence and walls.  There is a better way, and as Democrats, we have been calling for this  better way for months and months. In fact, in the legislation that the  President signed, it is the better way.   It is not a big, beautiful wall with ``Trump'' written on it. It is,  in fact, a virtual system similar to what we built in Jordan, in the  most dangerous place in the world, and it works.   So we need to be very careful here, because that is $8 billion that  will not be available to make our American military installations all  around the world ready for the tasks that they have before them.   So as we ponder this issue, as we go through the appropriation  process this spring, and as we fight this constitutional battle with  the President over the founding mothers' and fathers' understanding of  what an imperial presidency could become if they have both the  appropriation power as well as the power to execute the law, they said,  no, the President cannot have that power.   As we fight this fundamental constitutional issue, we should also  keep in mind that there is a better way to protect our southern border,  or any border for that matter, and it is essential that we spend the  money that we have appropriated for the military to protect their  readiness and, in so doing, protect the security and safety of America.   So we will have this debate, and this debate will hopefully result in  the American public understanding what they should have learned in  grammar school about civics and about the separation of powers.  Unfortunately, our President seems to have missed that class.   But we are not going to let it go. This is not a Democratic or  Republican issue. This is an American constitutional issue.   So let us proceed. Let us proceed in full understanding of what is at  stake here: the rebuilding of the bases, yes, but, more importantly,  the very fundamental notion of the separation of powers that is  inherent in the Constitution. And, by the way, every Member of the  House of Representatives, every Senator, and every general, including  acting Secretaries of State, have taken an oath to defend and uphold  the Constitution. We would all do well to read Article I, Section 9.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
