 Mr. Speaker, today is a day of great progress and great  promise. I rise today to urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the  American Rescue Plan.   The American Rescue Plan will save lives and livelihoods. It will put  vaccines in the arms of Americans and provides $20 billion in a  nationwide vaccine plan.   It also puts children safely back in schools with a nearly $130  billion investment. It will put money in people's pockets by delivering  $1,400 stimulus checks, as well as expand reliable childcare and  affordable healthcare. It will extend unemployment benefits to 18  million Americans and so many Alabamians that I represent.   It will put people back to work by providing critical support for the  hardest hit small businesses, expanding PPP eligibility and much more.  It will give lots of needed money directly to localities, to local  cities and counties. In fact, $472 million of direct funding will come  to the State of Alabama in my district.   Mr. Speaker, I want my constituents to know and all Americans to know  that help is indeed on the way.
