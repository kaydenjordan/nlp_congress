 Mr. Speaker, I rise to salute the U.S. Navy's newest  vessel, the USS Little Rock, and her brave crew.   Commissioned this past Saturday, the new USS Little Rock was built in  Wisconsin and is a littoral combat ship that will operate in waters  close to shore.   The vessel carries with it the namesake of Arkansas' State capital  and the proud history of the former USS Little Rock.   Today, it is also fitting to honor the former USS Little Rock.  Completed in World War II, she was one of six vessels to be converted  to a guided missile cruiser. She was the first U.S. Navy ship to be  named for Little Rock, Arkansas.   The only World War II cruiser on display in the United States, the  former USS Little Rock is the sole survivor of the Cleveland class.   The USS Little Rock served with distinction as a flagship for both  the second and the sixth fleets.   I thank all of those who served on the former USS Little Rock. I wish  the new USS Little Rock the best as she carries out our Nation's  critical maritime strategy and protects our interests across the globe.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for the time.   I rise in strong support of H.R. 3312, a bipartisan bill. A majority  of the majority party and a majority of the minority party on our  committee reported this bill to the House floor. It is sponsored by my  friend, Chairman Blaine Luetkemeyer, who has spent years studying Dodd- Frank, seven long years of studying the impact of Dodd-Frank, and how  to improve it.   This bill removes a requirement that uses $50 billion as an asset  test to designate whether a banking company in this country is  systemically important and, if they are, subject them to higher  regulatory standards.   But instead of ending too-big-to-fail, Dodd-Frank's misguided  designation regime just entrenches it, Mr. Speaker.   Authorizing the government to designate large financial institutions  as systemically important creates a new class of firms that markets  will interpret and assume are too big to fail.   The SIFI designation, as noted by many Members on this side of the  aisle, is, in fact, arbitrary, and I respect my friend that other  numbers in statute may be arbitrary as well. But this one doesn't have  any economic basis on why the participants in designing Dodd-Frank  picked $50 billion.   But over the past 7 years, we have had witness after witness tell us  that we should look a different direction and not have an arbitrary  number of $50 billion.   Several Federal Reserve officials have expressed that similar view.  Mr. Frank, as noted, has expressed that view. So here comes Mr.  Luetkemeyer with an excellent idea, an idea of an activities-based  designation that the Fed has designed itself, Mr. Speaker.   The Federal Reserve has designed the metric we are using to say that  an institution is systemically important. It is activities-based so  that we can distinguish between levels of risk that might be  systemically important to our country.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for the time.   So activity-based standards have already been found effective by the  Federal Reserve. They work and they were used in evaluating  acquisitions on regional banking companies. So Mr. Luetkemeyer is on to  a good idea. Mr. Speaker, instead of using $50 billion that was  plucked out of thin air in the dead of night in the conference  committee in 2010, let's reflect on 7 years and operate in a better  way.    So I urge support of this bill, Mr. Speaker. I thank Mr. Luetkemeyer  for bringing it. I urge our Senators on the other end of this building  to look at this as a model for how we should reform Dodd-Frank in their  own bill.   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, this bill does not impact 99 percent, approximately, of  the banks. Most banks in this country have assets--about 89 to 90  percent of them--of $1 billion or under.                                time  1600    This bill is for the big banks. The big banks are doing quite well.  Last year, the banks made record profits of $171 billion. Community  banks grew at 8.3 percent, and big banks grew at a 4.8 percent rate.  They are lending to businesses at a record level.   So the contention cannot be that they are doing this because banks  are losing money. It has very little to do with how much money they are  losing. It has a lot to do with the fact that big banks would like to  be deregulated so that they can get back to the business as usual that  caused the crisis of 2008.   Mr. Speaker, there are 30 big banks this bill will impact worth more  than $5 trillion in assets. This bill is not needed because, if this  bill is implemented, it will cause the banks to no longer be placed  under the $50 billion threshold, except by way of regulation from the  prudential regulator, which won't happen easily.   MetLife is a pretty good example of what can happen. Currently,  MetLife is in court. They are tied up in court, probably indefinitely,  because the big banks have big bucks, and they are  [[Page H10227]]  going to fight being designated as SIFIs.   MetLife is fighting it. It is an insurance company, of course, but it  is fighting it. If they are going to fight the designation, you have to  have some way to put them under the stress test, under the living wills  test. This has to be done.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Poe of Texas). The time of the gentleman  has expired.   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself an additional 30  seconds.   If you don't have a trigger, it is not likely to be done, because the  banks are going to fight you all the way through the courts and tie you  up for years.
