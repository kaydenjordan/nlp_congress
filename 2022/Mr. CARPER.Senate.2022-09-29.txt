 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I am delighted to rise today to salute a  member of my committee staff who has made literally invaluable  contributions to not just the Congress but to our Nation and not just  for a couple of months or years but for literally decades.   Greg Dotson, the chief counsel for the Senate Committee on  Environment and Public Works, which I am privileged to chair, will be  retiring on September 30 following a distinguished career in service to  this country of ours. On this occasion, I want to take note of his  remarkable legacy and extraordinary service to the people of America.   As many of my colleagues will attest, true leaders in this body and  true leaders elsewhere are only as good as the team that works for  them. Like I say, I hire people smarter than me, and that is one of the  reasons I think I have had some success. But good leaders are always  looking for the best people they can find.   For many of us who are elected officials in this body and others,  those teams of staff members too often toil in the background and are  rarely recognized publicly for their service.   While all the members of the Environment and Public Works Committee  staff that I am privileged to lead are wonderful public servants, there  are sometimes rare individuals who stand out as having made an  extraordinary  [[Page S5523]]  impact on the American people and on this country as a whole. Greg  Dotson is one of those exceptional people. He has emerged as an  invaluable leader in the effort to address the urgent threat of climate  change and has dedicated his life to that vital calling.   Greg first joined this mission as a staffer to Congressman Henry  Waxman in 1996. Greg followed Congressman Waxman to the House Oversight  Committee and, later, the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which  Henry led.   During his nearly 20 years in the House, Greg Dotson helped lead a  team that produced the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009,  a landmark, comprehensive climate change and energy bill that passed  the House of Representatives in June of 2009.   He has worked on a number of major legislative achievements,  including the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009; the  Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007; the Energy Policy Act of  2005; the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996, and many, many  more. Greg also spearheaded vital congressional oversight and  investigative efforts with environmental significance, including high- profile inquiries into political interference with climate science, the  BP Deepwater Horizon disaster, and the energy market abuses of Enron.   After his illustrious service in the House of Representatives, Greg  went on to share his wisdom and passion with young people who are eager  to follow in his footsteps and protect our planet. In 2017, he became a  professor in environmental policy at the University of Oregon's  Environmental and Natural Resources Law Center, a role which has  enabled him to take the lessons of his congressional service and use  them to help inform the next generation of legal scholars and  environmentalists.   It was from there that he came to the Environment and Public Works  Committee in early 2021, when I was becoming chairman of the committee.  When we began a new Congress that year with a new Senate majority and a  new President who was committed to action on addressing climate change  and our Nation's infrastructure needs, while creating lots of jobs, we  knew that EPW needed a seasoned, thoughtful counsel who could help  guide our committee through this historic time. Greg was just the man  for the job.   As chief counsel, he played an invaluable role in helping negotiate  and craft the transformational bipartisan infrastructure law enacted  last year, working to find common ground with our Republican colleagues  and including remarkably strong climate investments in our  infrastructure legislation. He also led the charge on efforts to boost  electric vehicle infrastructure, clean up our air and our water, and  protect communities who are facing the worst consequences of our  climate crisis.   In addition, Greg played a leading role in efforts to boost the clean  energy revolution for our automotive industry. He worked with me to lay  out a vision for how the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency could  adopt standards to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the automotive  industry and eliminate tailpipe pollution from new cars by 2035.   The letter we ultimately sent to EPA Administrator Michael Regan was  met with applause from both auto manufacturers and environmental groups  alike. And as someone who has been here a few years, that doesn't  happen every day.   A few months after we unveiled our proposal, the Biden administration  followed up by announcing a new plan that adopted our recommendations  for how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from cars, from trucks,  while embracing zero-emission vehicles.   And by calling for half of the new vehicles sold in the United States  to be zero-emission vehicles by the year 2030 and adopting a  multipollutant approach--as we recommended--our Nation will reap major  health benefits for millions of Americans while accelerating market  trends to the clean cars of the future.   This was Greg's vision, and it will remain his legacy for years and  years to come. And just a few weeks ago, Greg was here on the Senate  floor with Mary Frances Repko, myself, and others on our team, our  colleagues as well--on the floor for the crowning achievement of his  decades of government service on climate crisis: the Inflation  Reduction Act. Greg's countless hours of work were on that landmark  bill and were critical to making possible the largest investment in  climate in our Nation's history.   Let me just say that again, the Inflation Reduction Act. Greg's  countless hours of work were on that landmark bill, and they were  critical to making possible the largest investment--the largest  investment--in climate in our Nation's history.   He didn't stop there either, going on to work tirelessly on the  methane emissions reduction program--methane is many, many times more  harmful than carbon dioxide with respect to climate--an initiative that  will have significant impact in our efforts to combat the threat of  climate change and safeguard our planet for future generations.   Throughout all of his dedicated service to our Nation and the  environment, Greg has been just as committed to his family. All of us  here in the Senate and, indeed, our Nation as a whole are grateful to  his wife Janine and to their two children, Dahlia and Bryce. I believe  they are today in Oregon, at their home in Oregon. We want to thank  them, the three of them, for generously sharing with us the time and  extraordinary talents of their husband and their father.   And when he wasn't here in Washington, DC, working tirelessly to make  history and improve the lives of the American people, Greg was at home  in an equally important role as husband and dad. Those are maybe the  two most important roles that all of us can hope for ourselves, and we  also hope that he can now begin to devote even more time to them in the  days ahead.   Greg's public service follows his own family legacy. His father was a  Navy man, like my own dad and many of my uncles. That dedication to the  greater good, to the betterment of society, which ran through his  family, is a beautiful family legacy that Greg continues today.   I am deeply grateful--I am deeply grateful--for his sage counsel and  know that he will continue to make this world a better place as he  returns to teach at the University of Oregon.   And so, in closing, I say to Greg something that we like to say in  the Navy when people do extraordinary things with their lives. We say:  Bravo Zulu, Bravo Zulu. So, Greg, to you and your family, Bravo Zulu.   Thank you, my friend. I bid you fair winds and following seas as you  prepare to set off on the next set of adventures that lie ahead. And I  know that many Members of Congress, along with their staffs, both past  and present, join me in this salute.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce, along  with the Senator from Maryland, Mr. Cardin; the Senator from  Connecticut, Mr. Blumenthal; the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr.  Markey; the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Merkley; the Senator from  California, Mr. Padilla; and the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr.  Whitehouse, a resolution to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the  Clean Water Act.   The Clean Water Act, which was signed into law on October 18, 1972,  is one of the most important environmental laws in the United States  and our Nation's principal safeguard against pollution and the  degredation of our Nation's water bodies. Five decades of Clean Water  Act implementation has improved our Nation's waterways, wetlands, and  water infrastructure, all while protecting public health and aquatic  ecosystems. This resolution recognizes the historic achievements in  improving water quality that have been made over the past 50 years.   Perhaps the most memorable example of improved water quality is  Ohio's Cuyahoga River. In 1969, the river was so polluted that it  actually caught fire. It is a memory I will never forget. Now, because  of the Clean Water Act, the Cuyahoga River has been cleaned up and is  home to over 60 species of fish.   Americans now have a law that seeks to protect them from industrial  pollution in our rivers and streams or the  [[Page S5561]]  indiscriminate destruction of our wetlands. Despite this progress,  there have been various challenges and changes to the implementation of  the law. Currently, there is a case before the Supreme Court, which  seeks to once again allow polluters to dump their waste into upstream  waters without consequence. I can think of no better way to commemorate  one of our greatest environmental achievements than to fight back  against this assault on clean water.   While we have come a long way since enacting the Clean Water Act 50  years ago, we must do more--not less--to deliver on the promise of  clean water in our country.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have nine requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate.
