 Madam Speaker, around the world, our adversaries are  watching a manufactured crisis play out.   This is the chaos dictators like Xi and Putin have been hoping for:  The leader of the free world on the brink of default is facing the very  real possibility that we won't even be able to pay our own troops.   My question for the majority party is simple: Haven't the American  people been through enough--over 1 million Americans are dead from a  pandemic that hit us 3 years ago, rising costs due to supply chain  disruptions, stresses on our education system, George Floyd murdered 3  years ago today, and January 6 that saw our Capitol under siege.   Americans do not need more pain, especially manufactured pain.   The GOP needs to come back to town, deliver for the American people,  and end this debt crisis.                            ____________________
