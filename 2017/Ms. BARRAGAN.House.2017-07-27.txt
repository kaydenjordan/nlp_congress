 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the security  minibus.   I actually happen to sit on the Homeland Security Subcommittee, and I  know what it is like to make sure that national security is our number  one priority.   I also happen to know that I have heard testimony from experts, and I  have heard bipartisan opposition to this wall in my committee. Because  when we hear from experts, they tell us a wall is not going to stop a  terrorist, and they tell us that the drug cartels are not going to be  stopped either, they are just going to build a tunnel under the wall.   So when you talk about homeland security, I know exactly what you are  talking about. The reality is that this $1.6 billion is just a waste of  taxpayer dollars. It is a dubious political promise that was made, and  now the American people are being asked to foot the bill.   Let me repeat. I sit on Homeland Security. The border on the south is  not our number one terrorist target. We know that what is there now is  already  [[Page H6487]]  an existing wall. We already have fencing there. Some of the areas we  are talking about are even just areas in the Rio Grande, where it is  not going to make the biggest difference.   If we are going to secure our borders, we could spend money on  technology and other areas, or we could secure our borders by putting  more money into port security, where there is a greater threat of  terrorism.   This is just another way to bully Congress into funding a border wall  that the majority of people don't want. I hope that my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle will not be bullied by this because it is  being packaged in with other bills that would otherwise get passed  without the partisanship.
