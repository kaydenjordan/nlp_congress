 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly about the  amendment just voted upon by this Chamber, an amendment brought forward  by Senator Paul.   As my colleagues know, the Paul amendment would have repealed the  2001 authorization for the use of military force, or so-called AUMF,  which authorized military operations against al-Qaida and the Taliban.  It would also repeal the 2002 AUMF, which authorized operations against  Saddam Hussein and Iraq. These repeals would take effect 6 months after  the adoption of the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act.   Senators of both parties owe it to the men and women of our Armed  Forces to debate in public the merits of continued conflict against  ISIS, al-Qaida, and the Taliban in places such as Afghanistan, Iraq,  and Syria, where the brave men and women who serve us and keep us safe  are currently engaged in service to our Nation and our security.   I am very sympathetic to my colleagues' concerns about the potential  consequences of repealing the 2001 and 2002 authorizations. I don't  want our troops fighting overseas to see our debate on this amendment  as a lack of support for their vital mission. I don't want to see our  enemies emboldened.   I, however, chose to support the Paul amendment, but my commitment to  our troops and my commitment to defeating our enemies is as strong as  ever. This body can and must immediately get to work to craft a legal  authorization relevant to our current conflict. That is why I supported  the Paul amendment, which would have provided a 6-month window to allow  Congress to demonstrate oversight, vigorous review of the status of our  military operations around the world, and to pass a new authorization  relevant to our current national security threats. In other words, it  would have required Congress to do its job.   Although the Paul amendment was tabled, I look forward to continuing  to discuss this important and pressing issue with my colleagues on the  Foreign Relations Committee, where it should more appropriately be  debated, and bringing it forward for a final vote in this Chamber.   If we are to do our job under the Constitution of the United States,  we owe those who fight and serve and strive to keep us safe nothing  less than clarity about Congress's willingness to do its job under the  Constitution and our willingness to consent to the actions that are  essential to keeping us safe.                                     DACA    Mr. President, debating and passing a new AUMF is not the only policy  area in which Congress needs to get to work. Because of the difficult  decision by the Trump administration to end the Deferred Action for  Childhood Arrivals Program, or DACA Program, Congress has just 6 months  to pass a legislative fix for the nearly 800,000 Dreamers in the United  States today.   Let me start by thanking many other colleagues who have already come  to the floor to give a voice to our Nation's Dreamers. I am proud to  stand with them and speak to this important issue today.   Since 2012, the DACA Program has helped more than 750,000 Dreamers  work, study, and contribute to our society free of the constant fear of  being forced to leave the only home they have ever known. Many of these  young men and women are our classmates, coworkers, colleagues, and  folks who are just as American as any one of us because that is what it  means to be an American, whether you have been here a month, a year, a  decade or seven generations. Those who are willing to serve, to  contribute, to engage in our society, to pay taxes, to play by the  rules, we welcome as Americans. These are people who were brought to  our country as children without authorization but through no fault of  their own.  [[Page S5261]]  In my view, they deserve the opportunity to demonstrate that they want  to contribute to our community and our country and to come forward and  live their lives out of the shadows and as proud Americans.    DACA provided these Dreamers with that security, but the President's  announcement to end the program has left them in a state of uncertainty  and fear. I am eager and willing to work with my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to pass comprehensive immigration reform, but  targeting this group of overwhelmingly hard-working and tax-paying  Dreamers is not the way to fix our broken immigration system. In my  view, it is, in some ways, a capitulation to the harshest, most  nativist, anti-immigrant forces in our country.   I believe Americans are strengthened by welcoming immigrants and  refugees into our country. I believe this as someone who understands  that immigration has strengthened our economy. I believe this because I  know America was founded largely as a nation of immigrants and thrives  because of its diversity, not in spite of it. I believe this as well  because of my faith, which calls on all of us to welcome the stranger  and the foreigner. Dreamers frankly aren't strangers at all. They are  already our neighbors whose lives and freedom are now in jeopardy. We  are talking about young men and women serving in our military,  graduating near the top of their classes, working as doctors, teachers,  engineers, and first responders.   When we talk about Dreamers, I think it is important to talk about  specific people, so allow me to share with you the stories of three  young Dreamers in Delaware. First, we are talking about Estephany  Martinez-Gonzalez, a current sophomore at Delaware State University who  is studying criminal justice and plans to join our law enforcement  community as a police officer. She was brought to Winder, GA, in 2003,  when she was just 8 years old. She and her sisters today are all  enrolled in college, and Estephany even earned a scholarship due to her  high achievements in high school.   When we talk about Dreamers, we are talking about Roman Guadarrama, a  30-year-old Delawarean who has been in the United States since 1994. A  young soccer star, he was being scouted for collegiate scholarships  while in high school, but he never saw college as a possibility for him  because he knew he was undocumented. In 2013, taking advantage of the  opportunity offered by the previous administration, he stepped forward  and enrolled in DACA, was able to obtain a driver's license and take  classes at Del Tech College in my home State of Delaware. The DACA  Program, he says, gave him a whole new outlook on his future and  allowed him to finally pursue his dreams in the country he knows as  home.   When we talk about Dreamers, we are talking about people like Indira  Islas, pictured here to my right. Indira came to the United States at 6  years old, in 2004, with her parents and two younger sisters. Now a  college student at Delaware State University, Indira has said:         Home to me is Gainesville, Georgia. It always has been and       it always will be. It is home because I poured out my heart       into that town.    She is studying in Delaware to become a pediatric oncologist, as her  own parents once were, but fears that her family could be torn apart  before she is able to fulfill her dream of treating children with  cancer.   Delaware alone, our small State--one of the smallest of the 50--is  home to 1,400 Dreamers just like Estephany, Roman, and Indira. Without  them, the United States would lose nearly $90 billion in GDP every  single year. Let me say that again, without the Dreamers, studies  suggest that we would lose tens of billions of dollars in American GDP  every year. The economic impact would be significant in every State  across the Nation because of the role Dreamers have played in our  Nation's economic, social, and cultural fabric. Now, some States may be  more remote and rural and have a smaller population of Dreamers;  whereas, in others they are very large, but across the country as a  whole, it is undeniable they have contributed to our economy.   Just listen to the American CEOs who came forward last week to voice  their support for finding some legal path forward for these Dreamers.  From the Koch brothers to Mark Zuckerberg, U.S. business leaders  respect and appreciate the hard work, the contributions, and the  potential of our immigrant brothers and sisters known as Dreamers.   It is not just their economic contributions that moves me to speak  this morning; Dreamers also help keep us safe. That is because  approximately 900 men and women in the U.S. Armed Forces are able to  participate in serving our Nation because of the DACA Program. Most of  these individuals applied for the Military Accessions Vital to the  National Interest, or MAVNI, pilot program which selects immigrants who  possess vital skills for our national security to serve in the  military. These very individuals include physicians, nurses, and those  with skills in critical Middle Eastern and Asian languages like Arabic  and Chinese. They are vital to the success of the U.S. military and to  our national security. Should we have recruited them, trained them,  supported them, deployed them, and now because of an abrupt change in  national policy reject them and deport them? I think not.   Dreamers like Indira are American. They grew up here, they have gone  through a rigorous process to become a part of this program, and they  want, from this point forward, to play by the rules and to succeed. I  am calling on my colleagues in Congress to protect the lives of our  Dreamers and pass the Dream Act. I am grateful to Senators Durbin and  Graham for their bipartisan efforts to move this bill forward, and I am  proud to join them in supporting this effort.   We know we can't count on the administration at this point to protect  the 800,000 Dreamers who know no home but the United States. As is  appropriate, the job falls to us, to Congress, to take up this issue,  to act, and to legislate. We cannot let them down.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
