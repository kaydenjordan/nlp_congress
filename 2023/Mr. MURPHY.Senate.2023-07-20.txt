 Mr. President, I rise to oppose this amendment, and I  want to tell my colleagues why.   This amendment creates the illusion of solving our problem, while  having very little political impact and likely doing more harm than  good.   It is a legitimate worry to consider the amount of U.S. oil under our  lands that goes and is shipped to China because in 2022, the United  States did export over 83 million barrels of oil to China. That was a  new record. It was a new record in part because 10 years ago, we didn't  ship any oil overseas because we had a national security policy to keep  U.S. oil here. But lobbying by the oil industry changed that policy,  and so today, we are sending 83 million barrels of oil a year to China.   This amendment doesn't really change that because--do you want to  know how much of that comes from the SPR? Less than 2 million barrels,  1 to 2 percent. So you are still going to have 80 million-plus barrels  of oil from the private sector being sent to China every year.  [[Page S3445]]    ExxonMobil alone made $60 billion in profits last year, much of that  off sales of oil to China. This amendment allows for the oil industry  to keep making those billions off of selling oil to China, only  stripping out sales from the SPR. That is a great deal for the oil  industry, but it gets better.   When President Biden sold oil from the SPR last year, it helped cut  the cost of a gallon of gasoline by up to 30 cents. That hurt oil  industry profits. So, of course, the oil industry wants policies that  restrict the sale of oil from the SPR, while letting them sell oil to  whomever they want, including China.   This amendment claims to solve a problem while mainly having the  result of padding and protecting oil industry profits, and I would urge  opposition.
