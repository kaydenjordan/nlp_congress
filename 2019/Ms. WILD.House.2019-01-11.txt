 Mr. Speaker, this shutdown is tearing at the fabric of our  society, and one of the clearest examples is the lack of funding for  the Justice Department.   As a practicing attorney for the past 30+ years, I know that many  people, when facing some of the most challenging times of their lives,  often depend on Justice Department services. When we fail to provide  those resources, our fellow citizens are forced to suffer in silence.   This lack of funding has led the Violence Against Women Act to  expire, jeopardizing protections for domestic abuse and sexual assault  victims. Constituents in my district, who provide assistance to these  survivors through such fine organizations as Turning Point of Lehigh  Valley, and the Crime Victims Council, have said that their programs  could soon be at risk.   And because of Washington's failure to fund programs like the Victims  of Crime Act Assistance Grant Program, organizations that look out for  children suffering abuse aren't getting the resources they need either.   As promised, when this shutdown began, I will be making regular  charitable contributions to individuals and agencies in my district who  are adversely affected by the shutdown, but that will, by no means,  offset loss of Federal funding.   Our constituents are suffering, and they need us to act.                            ____________________
