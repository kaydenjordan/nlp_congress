 Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this dangerous budget  proposal.   With many working families and businesses still struggling to adapt  to a rapidly changing economy, our top priority in Congress should be  to help expand opportunities and sustain long-term economic growth and  security so no American is left behind as we forge new paths ahead.                                time  1430    To spur robust job growth, we must invest in our education system to  provide the training and skills workers need to be prepared for the  jobs of today and tomorrow.   We should invest in infrastructure that will put people to work and  make our communities better places to do business, and we should invest  in growing a strong middle class, the backbone of our economy.   But instead, we are debating a budget that will go nowhere in the  Senate simply so it can be used as a vehicle to give the wealthiest  Americans a massive tax cut on the backs of middle class families.   This reckless budget cuts early childhood, K-12, and higher education  programs, as well as job training and apprenticeships. It guts  nutrition assistance, which provides benefits to more than 43 million  Americans a year, almost half of whom are children. It continues the  destructive cycle of neglecting our already crumbling infrastructure,  even though we know the longer we wait, the more costly repairs will be  in the future and the less economically competitive our communities  will be.   Slashing programs that help working families in order to line the  pockets of the wealthiest Americans has never led to jobs or economic  growth, and it never will. Every dollar we spend is a reflection of our  values, which is why I am deeply disappointed that this budget  demonstrates an utter disregard for middle class Americans, a lack of  vision for what our future could look like with smart, targeted  investments, and a complete lack of empathy for the most vulnerable.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
