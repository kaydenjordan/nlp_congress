 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the  late Lieutenant, Junior Grade, John Joseph Wiley and the 129 men  tragically lost aboard the USS Thresher.   This submarine departed its port on April 10, 1963, for a test dive.  Unfortunately, it never returned.   John Joseph Wiley of Altoona, Pennsylvania, was among the lost. After  graduating from the United States Naval Academy, he was selected for  the Naval Nuclear Power Training Unit. The USS Thresher was the first  and the last submarine to which he would report.   This week, a new memorial honoring those lost aboard the USS Thresher  will be dedicated at Arlington National Cemetery. More than half a  century after the tragic disaster, our Nation has not forgotten the  sacrifice of Lieutenant John Joseph Wiley and those Americans who died  with him.                            ____________________
