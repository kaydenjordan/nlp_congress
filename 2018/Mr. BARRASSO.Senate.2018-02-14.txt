 Mr. President, it seems as though just about every day  we get more good news about the tax relief law that Republicans passed.  This week, the news is getting even better for a lot of people all  across the country.   By the end of this month, 90 percent of workers across the country  will see more money in their take-home paychecks. It doesn't matter  where they are. They can be in Meeteetse, WY, and they will see an  increase in their paychecks this week. That is because this Thursday,  February 15, is the deadline for employers to start using the new IRS  tax withholding tables. The IRS tells employers how much money to  withhold from people's paychecks so that their taxes work out pretty  close at the end of the year. That is the way it is set up. Well, the  IRS looked at the new tax law and saw that people are going to be  paying lower taxes at the end of the year, so they put out the new tax  tables. They told businesses to adjust how much money to withhold from  a person's paycheck and to do it by February 15, tomorrow. For 90  percent of Americans, this tax amount is going to be lower, which means  their paychecks are going to be larger. A tax cut is the same as a  raise. That is what we are seeing all across the country--people  getting a raise in their pay.   Some people have already gotten a paycheck with the new, higher  wages. Others are going to get it very soon. The website Yahoo Finance  crunched the numbers. They found that a typical worker making $60,000 a  year will get an extra $112 in their paychecks every month because of  the tax law. That is over $1,300 for the year. To me, that is very good  news for American workers.   I was at home in Wyoming this past weekend, traveling around the  State, and I am hearing about it in all the different communities I go  to. People are saying: This has been better for me and my family  personally.   On top of this, a lot of workers are getting special bonuses and  raises because of the tax law. So not only are they getting more money  because of the fact that the tax rates have been lowered, additionally,  they are getting more money because they have gotten a raise or a  bonus. It seems there are about 4 million hard-working Americans who  are getting bonuses of hundreds or even thousands of dollars as a  result of the new tax reform law. They are also getting extra money in  their retirement plans. They are getting higher starting wages. We are  seeing many places increasing the starting wages, some up to $15 an  hour. More than 300 companies have said they are increasing all of  these kinds of compensations as a direct result of the tax law.   In my home State of Wyoming, people across the State are getting  bonuses--bonuses. These are people who work at Home Depot, Lowe's,  Walmart, Starbucks, Wells Fargo, and other businesses that have  familiar names to people across the country. They are also people who  are working in smaller businesses, like the Jonah Bank in Wyoming. It  has branches in Casper and in Cheyenne. It is not a nationally known  bank, but it is very important in our State and in our communities.  Every employee of this bank is getting a $1,000 bonus. The bank is also  increasing its giving in the communities in which it has branches.  Workers benefit, and the community benefits.   That is what happens when we change the tax law so Washington gets  less and taxpayers get to keep more. That is why I voted for this tax  law--to give the kind of tax relief that made these bonuses and these  pay raises possible. It is good for Wyoming, and it is good for people  all across the country.   It is interesting--it is even good for people in States whose  Senators voted against the tax law. Ninety percent of people across the  country are seeing the benefits no matter which State they are from.   There is a business in Grand Rapids, MI, called the Mill Steel  Company. They said last week that they are giving an extra $1,000 to  their workers because of the tax law that every Republican voted for  and every Democrat voted against. Now, 400 people at that company are  getting a bonus.   Michigan has two Democratic Senators. They both voted against the tax  relief law. It still led to $1,000 bonuses for these 400 workers. What  do the Senators have to say about it now? Are they proud that they  voted against the tax law? Are they glad they said no to these sorts of  raises that made it possible for people in their home States to get the  bonuses?   We know what Nancy Pelosi thinks. She went out and first she talked  about how the tax law was Armageddon, and then she said it was the end  of the world. Most recently, she said all the benefits people are  getting under the tax law, in her words, are just ``crumbs.''  ``Crumbs,'' she said. For her, it may be different, but for a lot of  Americans, a $1,000 bonus--certainly for the people in my home State of  Wyoming--is much more than crumbs. An extra $1,300--I talked about the  worker earlier--in that paycheck is much more than crumbs. For a person  with a starting wage of $15 an hour, that is more than crumbs.    It is bad enough Democrats tried to keep people from getting the  extra money--Democrats voted against it because they didn't want people  to get the extra money, it seems to me. It is hard to believe they  would continue this way and take pride in voting against it, but they  did. Now it seems like Democrats want to insult people by saying what  they are seeing and what their benefits are, are resulting in crumbs.  It is completely unfair, and I think it is disrespectful to the  American people.   These are just some of the cash benefits workers are getting from the  tax law. Republicans predicted, during the debate over this law, there  would be other benefits as well. We said businesses would pay less in  taxes, and some of them would be able to additionally cut prices for  consumers--let people buy things more cheaply.   Americans are starting to see this prediction come true as well. One  of the first places they are seeing it is in their utility bills. Gas,  electric, and water utilities are cutting their rates because their  taxes are going down under the law. In Vermont, the State's only  natural gas utility company is cutting rates by more than 5 percent  because of the tax law. Both of the Senators from Vermont voted against  the law, but it is the law Republicans passed that caused these rates  to go down. In fact, people living in at least 23 States and the  District of Columbia are going to be paying lower utility bills because  of the tax relief law. Another 26 States are looking into cutting  rates. Rates are going down in California, Maryland, New York,  Massachusetts, Connecticut--States where every Democratic Senator voted  against the tax law.   What do these Democratic Senators have to say now? Are they proud of  the fact they voted against the tax cuts that made it possible for  people to have lower utility bills in their States? When people's  monthly bills get cut, it is like a pay hike--more money in their own  pockets. They have more money to either save or to spend on other  things or to invest.  [[Page S946]]    The owner of a gym in Cincinnati, OH, spoke with his local television  station about what tax relief means for him. He said:         When people have that extra money to spend, they spend it.    Some save it.         They go out to eat. They buy gym memberships. And they       enjoy themselves.    People have that extra money to spend now, today, because of the tax  law Republicans passed. They have the extra money despite every  Democrat in this body voting against tax relief. Every one of them said  no. They all voted no. Democrats who voted no to tax relief for  American families essentially voted yes to keep the extra money in  Washington so they can decide how to spend it.   I have much more faith in people at home in Wyoming deciding how to  spend their money than any faith I have in Washington, DC. For so many  Americans, every dollar helps, and they are not crumbs. Democrats may  not know the difference, but the American families do. People in every  State of this country know the difference.   The American people understand what Republicans did with this tax  law. They are seeing more money in their paychecks, more take-home pay,  more money to decide what to spend and what to invest and what to save.  They know Republicans promised to cut people's taxes. People know  Republicans delivered on the promise. They know the benefits they have  gotten already, and they are confident the economy will continue to  grow stronger day by day.   People across the country also know the fact that every Democrat  voted against this law, voted against giving them a tax break, voted  against allowing them to keep more of their hard-earned money. The  American people know who took their side, who voted for the American  public versus who said no. Hard-working Americans asked us to do a job  for them. Republicans are doing the job; Democrats in Washington  certainly are not. Republicans are going to keep doing that job for the  American people--a job we have promised and a job which we have  delivered.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
