 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 4577) to establish a working group to determine  ways to develop a domestic canine breeding network to produce high  quality explosives detection canines, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4577         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Domestic Explosives       Detection Canine Capacity Building Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Behavioral standards.--The term ``behavioral       standards'' means standards for the evaluation of explosives       detection working canines for certain factors, including       canine temperament, work drive, suitability for training,       environmental factors used in evaluations, and canine       familiarity with natural or man-made surfaces or working       conditions relevant to the canine's expected work area.        (2) Medical standards.--The term ``medical standards''       means standards for the evaluation of explosives detection       working canines for certain factors, including canine health,       management of heredity health conditions, breeding practices,       genetics, pedigree, and long-term health tracking.        (3) Technical standards.--The term ``technical standards''       means standards for the evaluation of explosives detection       working canines for certain factors, including canine search       techniques, handler-canine communication, detection testing       conditions and logistics, and learned explosive odor       libraries.       SEC. 3. DOMESTIC CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT.

Such standards may be revised by       the Administrator of the Transportation Security       Administration, as necessary.       SEC. 5. NONAPPLICABILITY OF FEDERAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE ACT.         The Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App.) shall       not apply to the working group established under this Act.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Rogers) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Vela) each will  control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alabama.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and to include any extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Alabama?   There was no objection.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and to include any extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Alabama?   There was no objection.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of passage of my bill, H.R.  4577, the Domestic Explosives Detection Canine Capacity Building Act of  2017.   This legislation creates a working group on behavioral, medical, and  technical standards for explosives detection working dog breeding and  training programs.   This group will consist of the Transportation Security  Administration, the Office of Science and Technology, private sector  canine vendors and breeders, industry associations, leading  veterinarians, and academics with firsthand knowledge of the subject  matter.   The group's final report on standards should reflect the latest in  canine science and will be presented to the TSA Administrator for  further breeding development as well as canine procurement.   This bill is common sense. Canines are far more efficient than any  machine and much more cost effective. The use of detection canines by  the TSA is critical in keeping passengers over American skies safe.   With this in mind, why then, Madam Speaker, does the TSA procure the  majority of its canines from European vendors in conjunction with the  Department of Defense?   American canine breeders produce exceptional working dog lines, but  the TSA's arcane procurement rules and training requirements create  barriers to entry for American breeders and especially private sector  vendors.   With the passage of H.R. 4577, the TSA will be required to  incorporate findings and standards from the working group into its  procurement process to create greater consistency and transparency for  private sector vendors.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  commonsense bill and pass H.R. 4577, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko), who is the chairman of the  Transportation and Protective Security Subcommittee of the Committee on  Homeland Security.    Madam Speaker, this is an area that we have  spent a lot of time on in the Committee on Homeland Security over  several years, and I can state without equivocation that there is no  technology that is more effective at detecting explosives in our  transportation systems than these canines.   It is a shame that we have allowed ourselves to become so heavily  dependent on European providers for this very essential asset. This  bill will go a long way in helping our country establish its own  production of these essential assets for our use in keeping our country  safe and secure.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back  the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Rogers) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 4577, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
