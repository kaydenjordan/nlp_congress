 Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had  I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 382.   (By unanimous consent, Mr. Sean Patrick Maloney of New York was  allowed to speak out of order.)       Moment of Silence Honoring Servicemembers Killed in Mississippi    Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, last week, we  learned the terrible news that we had lost 16 of the very best and  brightest members of the United States Marine Corps and the United  States Navy when the plane they were traveling on crashed in  Mississippi.   I stand here with my colleagues who lost citizens of their districts,  in particular, the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Palazzo) and the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Jones). This is, of course, a  national tragedy, though.   The gentleman from North Carolina represents Camp Lejeune, where six  marines and one Navy corpsman were stationed. Those seven  servicemembers include Staff Sergeant Robert Cox, Staff Sergeant  William Kundrat, Sergeant Chad Jenson, Sergeant Talon Leach, Sergeant  Joseph Murray, Sergeant Dietrich Schmieman, and Petty Officer 2nd Class  Ryan Lohrey.   I, of course, represent Stewart Air National Guard Base, where nine  marines who lost their lives in that terrible crash were stationed.   In my time in Congress, I have had many opportunities to visit with  the brave men and women who serve our country and were based at Stewart  Air National Guard Base. As you know, they are all truly American  heroes.   Those we lost are as follows: Major Caine Goyette, Captain Sean  Elliott, Gunnery Sergeant Mark Hopkins, Gunnery Sergeant Brendan  Johnson, Staff Sergeant Joshua Snowden, Sergeant Julian Kevianne,  Sergeant Owen Lennon, Corporal Daniel Baldassare, and Corporal Collin  Schaaff.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of my colleagues standing behind me, all of  our communities, and our Nation, I ask for a moment of silence for  these 16 brave servicemembers who made the ultimate sacrifice for our  freedom.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, 5-minute voting will  continue.   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the resolution.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.                                Recorded Vote     Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained.
