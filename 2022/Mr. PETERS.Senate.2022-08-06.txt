 Mr. President, this motion is meant to delay or kill this  bill. If adopted, it would harm the IRS's ability to carry out its  duties by preventing the Agency from hiring new workers.   Federal employees are returning to in-person work, but Agencies need  flexibility that telework and remote work provide to compete with the  private sector, retain qualified workers, and serve the American people  effectively.   Telework can also ensure Federal employees can continue to serve the  people and stay safe if COVID variants or other public health threats  disrupt in-person work.   Remote and telework options allow the IRS to hire the workforce they  need across the entire country so they can crack down on tax cheats and  make sure big corporations are paying their fair share.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this motion so we can pass this bill  today.                              Order of Business    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following disposition of  the Collins motion to commit, the following amendments be the next  Republican amendments in order: Kennedy amendment No. 5387, and Rubio  motion to commit.    Mr. President, this motion is just another effort to  delay or kill this incredibly important bill and would effectively  remove the requirement for students to be vaccinated against COVID-19  in DC public schools.   Vaccines have proven to be effective at preventing the spread of this  harmful disease, and DC public schools now require FDA-approved COVID- 19 vaccines for eligible students, just like they do for measles and  hepatitis A and hepatitis B.   The requirement for DC public school students to be vaccinated  against this virus was enacted by the District of Columbia's City  Council, a body that was duly elected by 700,000 Americans living in  our Nation's Capital. This motion would unnecessarily meddle with  local, Washington, DC, government and delay or kill this vital bill we  are here to pass today.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this measure.                           Vote on Motion to Commit     Mr. President, communities all across the country are  suffering from exposure to PFAS--commonly used chemicals that do not  break down and have been linked to serious health problems.   This amendment would strike a provision in the bill that would help  DHS repair and upgrade its facilities to protect surrounding  communities and frontline DHS personnel from these harmful chemicals.   This amendment, instead, seeks to continue the past administration's  efforts to fund and construct an ill-conceived border wall on the  southern border.   I agree that we need secure borders, but we need smart and cost- effective security measures, including technology and adequate  personnel levels to meet our border security needs.   We should be working together in a bipartisan manner to develop smart  investments in border security.   Let's secure our southern and northern borders instead of throwing  taxpayer dollars to build a costly and ineffective wall.   I urge my colleagues to vote no.
