 Madam Speaker, I rise to support H. Res. 576-- Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives with respect to  the whistleblower complaint of August 12, 2019, made to the Inspector  General of the Intelligence Community.   Allegations that the President of the United States sought to enlist  a foreign government to interfere in our democratic process by  investigating one of his political rivals, and may have used the  withholding of Congressionally appropriated military aid, days earlier  as intimidation, is a clear problem. We must have all  [[Page H7928]]  of the facts so that we can do what is required under law and get to  the bottom of what actually took place. This is not a partisan matter.  It is an American matter that must be investigated so that we can  continue to protect our democracy against outside attacks.   This resolution expresses the sense of the House that the  whistleblower complaint received on August 12, 2019, by the Inspector  General of the Intelligence Community should be transmitted immediately  to the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate and the Permanent  Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives.   Our Constitution demands respect for the rule of law. As a Member of  Congress, I will continue to uphold our American principles and values.  I urge passage of this resolution.
