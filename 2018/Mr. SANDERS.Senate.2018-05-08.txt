 Mr. President, I would like to recognize a  remarkable Vermonter, Natalee Deaette, who was recently selected as a  2018 Truman scholar. Natalee is one of just 59 outstanding college  students from across the country who was honored this year by the Harry  S. Truman Scholarship Foundation with this prestigious graduate  fellowship for young people who are pursuing careers as public service  leaders.   Natalee is a member of Boston College's class of 2019, where she  studies applied psychology and human development, with a focus on  community advocacy and social policy and a minor in managing for social  impact. She is involved in BC's Undergraduate Government and Emerging  Leader Program, the McGillycuddy Logue Fellows Program, the Montserrat  Coalition, Appalachia Volunteers, and the Global Medical Brigades.  These are all very notable activities and achievements that demonstrate  the depth of Natalee's commitment to her community.   What makes Natalee's story all the more impressive is that she broke  through significant barriers to get to this place in her life. Natalee  is a native of the most rural and economically challenged area of  Vermont, where college graduation rates are well below the State and  national averages. She is herself a first-generation college student  and understands just how difficult it can be to navigate the world of  higher education.   While in high school, Natalee greatly benefited from participating in  Johnson State College's acclaimed Upward Bound program, which helps  motivated first-generation high school students prepare for college  success. The experience so influenced Natalee that she has worked for  the program for the past 3 years. She also credits Upward Bound for  inspiring her to pursue a career in public service and addressing  educational inequity among disadvantaged youth, particularly those from  rural areas.   I, like many Vermonters, am enormously proud of all that Natalee has  already accomplished, and we look forward to what she will achieve in  the future. I join with Natalee's friends and family in congratulating  her for being named a Truman scholar and wishing her the best of luck  in her future endeavors.
