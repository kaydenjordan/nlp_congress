 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Matt Pedigo of Allen County,  Kentucky, who recently retired as general manager of the Citizen-Times  newspaper in Scottsville.   After 22 years of reporting on the community he loves, Matt decided  to put down his pen and pursue other ventures. At a time when many  people are distrustful of the agenda of the media, Matt has been a  shining star over the years, accurately reporting on current events and  happenings in Allen County.   Through numerous interviews and conversations with Matt during my  years in public service, I grew to appreciate his work ethic, knowledge  of the issues, and passion for sharing the news with his community.   While he may be retiring, I know from my interactions with Matt that  he is not finished making positive contributions to the community of  Allen County and south-central Kentucky. I wish him nothing but the  best in a well-earned retirement from journalism.                            ____________________
