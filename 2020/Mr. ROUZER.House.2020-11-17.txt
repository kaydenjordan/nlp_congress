 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This bill recognizes that 2020 has been an unusual year with multiple  and layered disaster declarations, and it would adjust the Federal cost  share for disasters declared this year, including for COVID.   H.R. 8266 would also clarify the types of FEMA assistance available  for the COVID response, including testing, food distribution, and  personal protective equipment, and it would strengthen oversight of  these funds.   Mr. Speaker, I commend Chairman DeFazio for his work on this bill, as  well as his staff, and many other Members who have contributed. I urge  support of this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Byrne).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Graves), my good friend, who I understand has a little  different viewpoint on this bill than some of us but definitely  deserves the right to be heard.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), the chairman, to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves), my friend.    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 8266 will help communities recovering  from recent disasters and support the nationwide effort to respond to  the COVID pandemic.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this important legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 4611, the Ocean Pollution Reduction Act II.  This bill would modify and simplify the city of San Diego's required  permitting process under the Clean Water Act to operate the city's  Point Loma Wastewater Treatment Plant.   The bill would make permanent a regulatory exemption under the Clean  Water Act, and, in exchange, the city would promote water recycling and  conservation efforts at its facility. This would result in increased  water supply for the region and reduce treated wastewater discharges to  the ocean.   The bill will help ensure that San Diego has long-term certainty for  its water supply, all while saving the city and regional ratepayers  millions of dollars by simplifying our permitting process.   I urge support of this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, the simplified permitting  process under H.R. 4611 will provide more certainty to communities in  the San Diego area, will increase water recycling and conservation  efforts there, as well as reduce treated wastewater discharges into the  Pacific Ocean.   I urge support of this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 8326 ensures that recipients of Economic  Development Administration grants consider childcare availability as  they develop comprehensive economic development strategies.   These strategies currently incorporate various considerations, and  this legislation would ensure childcare availability is also  considered, which obviously helps women to contribute to the workforce.   I urge support of this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my  time.                                time  1600     Mr. Speaker, in closing, H.R. 8326 will ensure that  childcare availability is incorporated in the economic development  strategies that are required for EDA grants.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5919 directs GSA to provide rent relief to the  National Children's Museum currently housed in the Federal Ronald  Reagan Building and International Trade Center. This bill will provide  the National Children's Museum with similar relief afforded to other  congressionally designated museums. I want to thank the fine gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis) for working with Ms. Norton on this  bipartisan piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis), who is my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, H.R. 5919 will provide much- needed rental relief for the National Children's Museum consistent with  the policy for other congressionally designated museums.   Mr. Speaker, I again want to thank Ranking Member Davis for his work  on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge its support, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 1869, the Secure Federal LEASEs Act, would require  entities that lease commercial space to high-security Federal agencies  to identify any foreign ownership interest in the property.   In 2017, the General Accountability Office issued a report revealing  that there was insufficient information on the ownership of certain  high-security federally leased buildings.   The GAO recommended additional information be collected and reported  to tenant Federal agencies to determine if security precautions are  necessary. The General Services Administration, GSA, has already taken  steps to address the vulnerabilities raised by GAO, and this bill will  help support those efforts.   S. 1869 would require Federal agencies with leasing authority to  collect this information to improve the security of Federal facilities.   I thank the sponsors of this legislation for working with us on  amendments to this bill that will help to ensure its effectiveness.   Mr. Speaker, S. 1869 will help identify any foreign ownership  interest in proposed leases for high-security agencies and improve the  security of sensitive Federal facilities.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this legislation, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
