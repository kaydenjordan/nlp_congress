 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 6,  the American Dream and Promise Act of 2019.   For so many, this day is a long time coming. It would not be possible  without so many amazing people and organizations, including in my home  State of Arizona, who never stopped fighting, who never gave up hope on  this dream.   We are here today to pass a bill that will provide permanent  protections and a pathway to citizenship for our Dreamers, a solution  that is long overdue, one that will lift up 2 million people across our  Nation. For many, giving them a permanent place in the only home, the  only country that they have ever known.   But this bill does more than the right thing. It does a smart thing.  Make no mistake, this is an economic stimulus bill. The economic gains  in communities across the country will be significant, and fewer stand  to benefit more than my community.   The Phoenix metro area ranks among the top areas that will experience  real economic benefit from the passage of this bill. When we bring  stability to eligible immigrants, we bring stability to our local  economies as well.   The American Dream and Promise Act of 2019 is a case of doing both  the right thing for people and doing the right thing for our economy.   Dreamers are an integral part of our community, our neighbors, our  coworkers, our friends. They are woven into the social and economic  fabric of our entire region, and we have a responsibility to make sure  that they can continue to contribute and participate fully without  fear.   When our Dreamers succeed, our communities will be stronger.
