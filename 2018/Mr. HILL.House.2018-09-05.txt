 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the life of a  teacher who continues to have an indelible impact on Arkansas, Margie  Towery, who is this year's Greenbrier School District Teacher of the  Year.   Margie has dedicated her life to serving and educating Arkansas'  youth.   This is her 26th year of teaching, including seven at the nearby  University of Central Arkansas.   Margie is a big advocate for STEM education, particularly for young  girls, and even takes her students to local universities to participate  in their STEM activities.   She started and led the Rhetoric Society at the high school until she  became a full-time sponsor of the student council.   Teachers like Margie prove that education is one of the best  investments that America can make.   I am proud to represent her and all the teachers of central Arkansas  who are making a difference for our youth.                         Arnold Hameister Retirement     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of a man  who has had a major impact on conservation and preservation throughout  Arkansas, Mr. Arnold Hameister.   Arnold recently retired after 37 years of service to the Arkansas  Forestry Commission.   He started his career with the Forestry Commission in 1981 as a tower  operator in Heber Springs, and 6 months later became a full-time  ranger.   Arnold then moved his family to Conway, where he served as the county  ranger until he was hired by Best Management Practices as a specialist.   He ended his decades-long career as the program coordinator for water  quality.   Arnold and his family were recently honored at a celebration at the  Department of Agriculture headquarters in Little Rock.   Arnold's service to the State of Arkansas and to environmental  conservation will never be forgotten, and I join all Arkansans in  congratulating him on a remarkable career and a well-deserved  retirement.                          Recognizing Tamika Edwards     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my friend, Tamika  Edwards, who has just been named executive director of the Social  Justice Institute at Philander Smith College.   Tamika has served her State and her country tirelessly throughout her  whole career from her work as a former aide to U.S. Senator Blanche  Lincoln, to her role as the Director of Governmental Affairs for  Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families.  [[Page H7832]]    A native of our hometown, Little Rock, Ms. Edwards is a graduate of  the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff and a two-time alumna of the  University of Arkansas at Little Rock, most recently in 2012 with her  law degree.   Ms. Edwards' passion for ensuring all voices are heard will serve her  well as she oversees the Social Justice Institute's crucial work of  educating students and the community in advocating for equal  opportunity, treatment, and respect.   So, again, I would like to congratulate Ms. Edwards on her new  position of leadership, and I look forward to working with her.                            Recognizing Neomi Rao     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Neomi Rao, the  current Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory  Affairs, for her important work in reducing the power of the Federal  administrative state.   Beginning in 2013, I outlined how our economic recovery was subpar in  comparison to post-World War II recoveries, in part due to the wet  blanket of the avalanche of Federal costs imposed by the previous  administration.   In Arkansas, we have seen Federal regulatory agencies have  devastating economic effects on our farmers, our small business people,  nonprofits, schools, colleges, and State agencies.   Then comes Neomi Rao, and in her first year as administrator of OIRA,  she led the way with the delay or withdrawal of 1,579 planned  regulatory actions, leading to almost $8 billion in lifetime savings  for the economy and the American people.   These successes have not stopped in 2018, where she has been working  with every agency to set a negative regulatory cost allocation to  provide our local businesses, farmers, and schools the relief that they  need.   I commend Administrator Rao for her work at OMB in cutting red tape  in Washington and giving control back to our States, our local  communities, and our hardworking taxpayers.                            ____________________
