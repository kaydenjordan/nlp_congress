 Mr. Speaker, as with any massive spending package, the  Democrats' $3.5 trillion--it may be getting smaller--reconciliation  bill does have some good items in it that we could agree on in a better  package, such as critically important disaster relief funds for fires,  flood, and other recovery efforts.   Unfortunately, tucked amongst this are some necessary programs but  also attempts by the Democrats to once again circumvent the Hyde  amendment, originally passed in the House in 1976, and which would  force American taxpayers to fund elective abortions.   In the reconciliation bill, there are millions of dollars worth of  public health grants not Hyde-protected. This bill also mandates  abortion coverage in the Affordable Care Act for plans covering  individuals above the poverty line.   Additionally, it sets aside $1.75 billion for public health  activities that would allow the CDC to construct facilities that  perform elective abortion and trains others to do so.   If this bill is adopted as currently written, violating the Hyde  amendment, all Americans will have to pay for abortions regardless of  their State's policies or their own moral or religious convictions.                            ____________________
