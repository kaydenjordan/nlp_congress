 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the  nomination of Betsy DeVos for Secretary of Education. My mom was a  public schoolteacher, and she taught second grade until she was 70  years old. She loved teaching. Her favorite unit was actually the  Monarch Butterfly Unit, where she would dress up as the monarch  butterfly, and she would teach the kids about metamorphosis. The  costume she wore, she would also wear to the supermarket afterward. She  was dressed as this big monarch butterfly, with little antennae on her  head and a sign that said: ``To Mexico or bust'' because that is where  the monarch would fly on its way from Canada through Minnesota and  down. It was the night before my mom's funeral at the visitation where  I met a family who came up to me, and the mom was sobbing. I didn't  know what was going on. I had never met them. They had their older son  with them who had pretty severe disabilities. She said: You know, your  mom had my kid here in school when he was in second grade. Now he was  grown up. She said: He always loved that Monarch Butterfly Unit. After  he graduated, your mom would continue to go to the grocery store, and  that was why she would go to the store every year. He had gotten a job  bagging groceries. She would stand in the line in her monarch butterfly  outfit for years and give him a big hug when she got to the end of the  line. That was my mom. She loved her kids and she was a devoted  teacher.   I went to public school through elementary to high school. My  daughter went to public school. I learned that basic right we have in  this country; that every child should have the right to an education.  That led me to the conclusion--after reviewing the record of the  hearing and talking to my colleagues on the committee--that this  nominee and I do not share the same value when it comes to that public  education. I note that two of my Republican colleagues, Senators  Collins and Murkowski, have come to the same conclusion. One of the  most troubling examples of Mrs. DeVos's views came when she was  questioned by two of my colleagues. I note Senator Murray is here. We  thank her for her leadership on the Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions Committee. Two of my colleagues, Senators Maggie Hassan and  Tim Kaine, asked the nominee about whether schools should meet the  standards outlined in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act  or, as it is known, IDEA. Mrs. DeVos said she would leave the decision  of whether to offer equal educational opportunities to the States. This  is simply unacceptable. It is not the kind of leadership we need. This  is not why we have IDEA. I think most education professionals and  people who are experts in this area would know that is not the answer.   I occupy the Senate seat that was once held by Minnesota's own Hubert  Humphrey. He was someone who was never at a loss for words. He  delivered a speech to the Minnesota AFL-CIO 40 years ago. One line of  that speech is just as appropriate and meaningful today as it was back  then. He said:         The moral test of government is how that government treats       those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who       are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who are       in the shadows of life, the needy, the sick and the disabled.    I submit that Mrs. DeVos's opposition toward providing equal  education opportunities to students with disabilities does not meet  that moral test. Her views are at odds with decades of bipartisan  support for IDEA.   In 1975, when Congress passed the original version of IDEA, half of  all children with disabilities were not receiving appropriate  educational services, and 1 million children with disabilities were  excluded entirely from the public school system. In an impassioned  floor speech, then-Senator and later Vice President Walter Mondale of  Minnesota talked about the need for IDEA. Before the 1975 law, disabled  children were placed in segregated schools and classes with little  emphasis on an education, training, or development. Many parents also  gave up on the poor services offered by the public schools. As a  result, disabled students remained at home. To tackle this problem,  Republicans and Democrats came together to pass legislation ensuring  that students with disabilities would have equal access to public  education, just like all other kids. The law guaranteed and continues  to guarantee today--the Federal law--that students  [[Page S693]]  with disabilities get a free and appropriate public education. It is  not a State-by-State requirement. It is a Federal requirement.   In 1975, both Minnesota Senators played a significant leadership role  in enacting this groundbreaking civil rights legislation. Senator  Humphrey called IDEA one of the most significant pieces of legislation  and a major commitment in this Nation's commitment to its children.  Then-Senator Mondale argued that this landmark legislation holds a  promise of new opportunity for 7 million children in this country. When  Congress first enacted this law in 1975, this was not a partisan issue.  The law passed both Houses with overwhelming majorities. The Senate  voted in favor of the landmark legislation by a margin of 87 to 7; the  House, by a vote of 404 to 7. Bipartisan support for IDEA grew stronger  over time.   In 1991, President George H.W. Bush signed into law a bill that  reauthorized the Disabilities Act. That bill was introduced by former  Democratic Senator Tom Harkin and former Minnesota Republican Senator  Dave Durenberger. The reauthorization was so uncontroversial that it  passed by a voice vote in both the House and the Senate. Members from  both parties supported IDEA when it was reauthorized again in 2003.  Every single member of the Minnesota delegation, all 10--Democrats and  Republicans alike--supported IDEA's reauthorization that year. For four  decades, IDEA has garnered support from both sides of the aisle because  we all understand the need to support the most vulnerable among us.   Every Member of Congress knows a family member or a person who has  been affected by disability. For a lot of lawmakers, this is personal.  When my daughter was born, she couldn't swallow for nearly 2 years. She  had a feeding tube, and the doctors didn't know what was wrong with  her. It ended up being a temporary problem and not a permanent  disability, but those 2 years I still look back at as a gift. They were  a gift that brought our family closer together, but they were a gift  because they made me understand what parents of kids with disabilities  face every single day. This wasn't just a temporary thing for the  parents I met. This was something they face every single day.   Since the passage of IDEA, our Nation has moved to fulfill the  promise of providing a high-quality education to kids with  disabilities. Today, more than 4.7 million children with disabilities  rely on IDEA to protect their access to high-quality education. Over  the last 40 years, the Democratic and Republican Members who have come  before me have all fought to preserve those critical rights and  opportunities.   These are American values. But they are especially near and dear to  our State, where we have this long and proud tradition of working to  ensure that people with disabilities have access to the same basic  resources and opportunities as everyone else. This is not just the  original work by Senators Humphrey and Mondale, carried on, of course,  by Senator Durenberger and others, but it happened in our State as  well.   To cite a few examples, it was the Minnesota Ramp Project that  introduced a new American model for building statewide standardized  wheelchair ramps. Minnesota was the State that sent Paul Wellstone to  the Senate, where he fought long and hard for mental health parity. My  State is also home to some of the most innovative centers for the  disabled in the country, including PACER, the Courage Center, and ARC.   When it comes to educating children with disabilities, Minnesota has  also been one of the Nation's leaders. In 1957, our State became one of  the first States in the Nation to pass a law requiring that special  education services be provided to children and youth with disabilities.  In our State, from birth to adulthood, kids with disabilities have  access to the quality of life they deserve.   Through IDEA, our State is able to receive Federal funding for early  intervention services that help diagnose disabilities or developmental  delays among infants and toddlers. Minnesota also provides each child  with a disability and their family a personalized K-12 education plan  and the support needed to transition from high school to postsecondary  education.   These civil rights protections and funding under IDEA have also been  an area of bipartisan cooperation among members of the Minnesota  delegation. We would like to see even more funding. We don't see us  move backwards. At least one Minnesota Republican has cosponsored every  version of IDEA and its reauthorization over the last 40 years. We have  never had a Secretary of Education who has put these commonsense  bipartisan benefits at risk.   Today, over 124,000 Minnesota children rely on the protections in  IDEA. I have heard from families in my State, and so many of them tell  me how that Federal law has made a real difference in their lives. A  mom from Watertown, MN, told me all about her son who was born with  Down syndrome. She is so thankful for the Federal law because this  protection ensures that he can have everyday experiences like other  kids.   It allows her son to be fully integrated with the rest of the  students in his high school. As a result, he has developed many  friendships and a strong social network. When she asks her son whether  he likes school, he always says a resounding ``yes.''   A mother of two autistic kids who are deafblind, reached out to me  from Farmington, MN. She tells me that she depends on IDEA because the  law gives her an opportunity to participate in designing individualized  education programs for her children. These programs allow her to tailor  the best possible educational plans.   A woman from Lakeville, MN, told me that when her son was born with  intellectual and developmental disabilities in the late 1980s, and she  was so worried about what his future would look like. But because of  IDEA, he received specialized services at school while still being  included in activities with the rest of his peers. Today, she tells me  that he is a successful young adult who happily lives, learns, and  works in his community.   During my time in the Senate, I have worked to share those Minnesota  values that you hear resonating in those letters across the country.  That is why I helped lead the push in Congress to successfully pass  bipartisan legislation with Senators Burr and Casey called the  Achieving a Better Life Experience Act, or ABLE Act, a law that will  help people with disabilities and their families better plan for their  futures. It is a law that President Obama signed.   We have made progress in removing barriers and empowering people with  disabilities. Of course, we know that the ABLE Act alone is not enough.  We still need to ensure that the Federal Government lives up to its  promise to support education for those with disabilities by enforcing  and protecting the IDEA and fully funding special education. Providing  equal educational opportunities for children with disabilities is an  issue that cuts across partisan lines.   It is an issue of decency and an issue of dignity, and I believe it  is an issue that we must all stand behind as Americans. I cannot  support a nominee that would jeopardize the education of millions of  disabled children across our country or someone that is not fully  informed at her own hearing about such an important law. We have  continuously maintained and strengthened educational laws for children  with disabilities because every child deserves a chance to succeed.   I think about my mom and all those years of teaching--teaching 30  second graders at age 70. I think about that boy, who is now a man, who  in the second grade had her as a teacher. He had severe disabilities,  but she did everything to make his learning experience as good as all  the other kids that were in that class.   I think of how he loved that butterfly unit and felt the passion that  my mom brought to teaching it. In her own free time, she would go visit  him at his job at that checkout line in the grocery store in her  butterfly outfit. That was integrating kids with disabilities into our  school systems. That is what special teachers and special education  experts who see all children as special are all about.   Thank you. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing Mrs. DeVos's  nomination.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, the Senate recently voted to confirm  Representative Mike Pompeo to be the Director of the CIA. While I do  not agree with many of the views that Congressman Pompeo has expressed  in the past, I have worked with him on legislation, and I know that he  is a dedicated and experienced public servant. I believe he is  qualified to lead the CIA at a critical time in our country's history.  I was also extremely concerned about the nature of the President's  press conference in front of the CIA memorial wall that honors those  who lost their lives while in service. This press conference occurred  before Representative Pompeo was confirmed by the Senate, and it  provided an additional reason for putting seasoned leadership at the  Agency without delay.   Like many of my colleagues, I was concerned about Congressman  Pompeo's past views on torture. That is why I personally asked  Representative Pompeo about the use of torture, and as he did at his  hearing, he stated unequivocally that he would not use illegal enhanced  interrogation techniques at the CIA. Senator Feinstein and I have  requested and received written confirmation to reinforce the commitment  he made at his hearing to uphold laws that ban torture. As a member of  the Senate Judiciary Committee, I intend to exercise robust oversight  to ensure that these laws are upheld.   I am opposed to torture. In 2007, I voted against Michael Mukasey for  Attorney General because of his views on waterboarding. In 2015, I  voted to strengthen the legal prohibition on torture by limiting  interrogation techniques and requiring that the Red Cross has access to  all detainees. I have also introduced bipartisan legislation, the  Torture Victims Relief Act, to support torture treatment programs in  the United States and abroad to help torture survivors recover from  their trauma and rebuild productive lives.   The 1984 United Nations Convention Against Torture has been ratified  by 157 countries, including the United States. The world continues to  look to America for its steadfast leadership and we must continue to  fight against the practice of torture and other cruel and inhuman  treatments.                            ____________________     Mr. President, my mom was a second grade teacher, and  she taught second grade until she was 70 years old. That was her life's  work.   I went to public school, and I sent my daughter to public school. It  has really been the core of how I ended up in the Senate.   After a close review of Mrs. DeVos's confirmation record and the  hearing, I have concluded that, like all of my colleagues on the  Democratic side and two of our colleagues on the Republican side, I  cannot support her. I don't believe she is prepared for this job, and I  don't believe she is committed to the kind of public education that got  my family from an iron ore mine in Northern Minnesota to the U.S.  Senate.   My question of Senator Murray is that one of the most troubling  examples of this lack of preparation came  [[Page S818]]  when Mrs. DeVos was questioned by my colleagues Senator Hassan, who  just spoke, and Senator Kaine about whether schools should meet the  standards outlined by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.  She said she would leave this decision to the States.   As I noted yesterday, I occupied the Senate seat once held by  Minnesota's own Hubert Humphrey. He was someone who, of course, was  never at a loss for words.   He delivered a speech at the Minnesota AFL-CIO 40 years ago, and one  line of that speech is just as appropriate today as it was back then.  He said: ``The moral test of government is how the government treats  those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the  twilight of life, the elderly; and those who are in the shadows of  life, the sick, the needy and the handicapped.''   These civil rights protections and the funding that we have seen  under IDEA have always been an area of bipartisan cooperation. I have  heard from so many parents in my State.   A mom from Watertown with a son who was born with Down syndrome says  that thanks to IDEA, this law has given her the opportunity for her son  to participate in a normal education.   For a woman from Lakeville, her son was born with developmental  disabilities in the late 1980s. She was so worried about what his  future would be. Then that law was put into place, and today he is a  successful young adult who happily lives, learns, and works in his  community.   So my question of Senator Murray is what her views are of the  nominee's qualifications when it comes to the Individuals with  Disabilities Education Act and the concern that she has heard from  others in her State as well as across the country when it comes to this  very important issue for our children.    Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues and  make remarks on Senator Sessions' nomination to serve as Attorney  General. I will be coming back later this evening to focus on voting  rights and some of the other issues at hand--freedom of the press,  antitrust. I am actually the ranking member on that subcommittee, and  while Senator Sessions has assured me that if confirmed, he will keep  the independence of that part of the Justice Department away from  outside influence from the White House, I am very focused on that  because I think we have seen a wave of mergers, and I want to address  that more in depth later.   I worked successfully with Senator Sessions on a number of UC's over  the years such as adoption and human trafficking. We have worked  together well, and if he is confirmed, I am sure we will find some  areas of common agreement. I am not supporting him, however, and I have  told him this in person and I have talked about it at the Judiciary  Committee because of my concerns relating to some of his views on some  of the core functions of the Justice Department, and that is enforcing  voting rights, the handling of immigration issues, the freedom of the  press, and the Violence Against Women Act.   Now, he has assured me that he will keep the Office on Violence  Against Women funded--which I appreciate--in the Justice Department,  but I was very concerned that he had actually voted against the  Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization recently. It was something  that the majority of Republican Senators voted for and every single  woman Senator, Democrat or Republican, voted in favor of.   As a prosecutor and a U.S. Senator, one of my main criminal justice  priorities has been enforcing and reauthorizing VAWA or the Violence  Against Women Act. It is a bill that took roots in my State, thanks to  the efforts on the initial bill of former Senator Paul Wellstone and  his wife Sheila. Both of them tragically died in a plane crash, and we  miss them very much. But Paul and Sheila's legacy lives on in the work  of the Violence Against Women Act.   It has a long history, as the President knows, of bipartisan support.  Since it was first passed in 1994, we have made great strides in  raising awareness that these are serious crimes, not shameful secrets.  Since the enactment of the Violence Against Women Act, annual domestic  violence rates have fallen by 50 percent, but the statistics make clear  that domestic violence, stalking, and sexual assault are still a major  problem in America. According to data from the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention, for every minute, 20 people in the United  States are victims of physical violence by an intimate partner. That is  about 10 million people every year.   Millions more individuals are the victims of stalking crimes each  year, with approximately 15 percent of women at some point during their  lifetime experiencing stalking, during which they feel very fearful or  believe that they or someone close to them could be harmed or killed.   I would like to note briefly that I am pleased that the Senate  recently passed the resolution that Senator Perdue and I introduced on  stalking to raise awareness. I have been confronted by these issues of  domestic violence and stalking since before I became a Senator. In  fact, that is when I was Hennepin County attorney. That is the largest  prosecutor's office in our State. I managed an office of about 400  people. With that big office handling everything from representing our  State's biggest public hospital to violent murder cases, the poster  that you saw when you walked into our office and down the hallway so  that everyone could see it was a picture of a woman who was beaten up.  She had a Band-Aid over her nose, and she was holding a little baby  boy. The words read: Beat your wife, and it is your son that goes to  jail. Why? That poster reminds everyone that domestic violence and  sexual assault just don't hurt the immediate victims. They hurt  children, families, and entire communities. We know that kids who see  violence happen are twice as likely to commit it themselves and to  continue the cycle. That is why I worked with Senator Leahy along with  Senator Crapo to make sure that the Violence Against Women Act was  reauthorized.   What does this legislation do? The legislation ensures that law  enforcement has the tools to prosecute domestic and sexual violence and  ensures that victims have the support they need to get back on their  feet. But we also made some important updates on the law, including  addressing the problem of above average levels of domestic violence in  tribal areas, by allowing tribal courts to prosecute and to handle  cases with people who are tribal members and in very specific cases  when violence is committed on the reservation.   Providing a uniform nondiscrimination provision was also included to  ensure services are available to everyone who needs them, including  victims in same-sex relationships. The new bill included stronger  housing protections for victims and increased accountability for grant  recipients. It also strengthened and updated anti-stalking laws to  better address the new technologies that predators are using to harass  their victims. This was a bipartisan provision that I authored with  Republican former Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas.   As I said, all 20 women Senators supported this critical legislation,  and it passed with bipartisan support on a vote of 78 to 22, with  support from a majority of Senators in Senator Sessions' own party, not  to mention men and women across the country.   The reason Senator Sessions had for not voting for the bill was that  it was the tribal provisions that he didn't like because of the dual  jurisdiction. That just doesn't hold up for me, given what I have seen  in my State.    Now, what does this really mean to people? Let me end this portion of  my remarks with two stories. The first is about a case that our office  handled, and a prosecutor in our office who was very well thought of  handled it in our office, involving two immigrants. This was a case  where this man was from Russia, and he beat up his wife repeatedly over  the years. They had a little daughter. One day he killed his wife, and  then he went to Home Depot and he bought a saw. And then he basically  dismembered her and put her in a garbage bag and brought her to another  State and dumped her in a river. He left the head in his trunk, and he  brought it back to the Twin Cities. He eventually confessed to his  crime.   The family gathered--and they were a very small family. The mom and  dad came from Russia, and then there was the little girl who had been  left behind with really no parent to take care of  [[Page S848]]  her anymore. I went to meet with the family before the funeral with our  prosecutor and our victim witness advocate. I heard the story then that  at the airport--the little girl had never met her deceased mother's  twin sister. They were identical twins. And as they got off the  airplane and her grandparents and that aunt got off the airplane, the  little girl ran up to that aunt and grabbed her and said ``Mommy,  Mommy'' because she thought that it was her mother and that her mother  was still alive.   Those are the victims of domestic violence. It is not just the  immediate victim; it is everyone around them.   Or, the case in Lake City, MN, of Officer Shawn Schneider, an  incredibly brave police officer who was called one day to a domestic  violence case. It was a man who was clearly affected by mental illness,  who was threatening his 17-year-old girlfriend, and the cop went up to  the door, and there he was. He had his bullet proof vest on, but the  man shot the police officer in the head, and he died. I attended that  funeral.   When I was there, I saw their young family, the two young little boys  and this little girl. I heard the story about the last time they were  in their church for the nativity play, and the dad was sitting there-- the police officer--in the pew, watching his family and his children  perform. The next time they were in the church was when that little  girl with the blue dress covered in stars was walking down the aisle  for her dad's funeral.   That is domestic violence. It does concern me that we did not get  support from the nominee. I do appreciate that he said he would  continue to fund the Office on Violence Against Women, and I believe  that that is very important to the functioning of the Justice  Department.   Since its inception in 1995, the Office on Violence Against Women has  provided financial and technical assistance to communities nationwide-- very important to the Department of Justice.   The last thing I want to mention--and I will come back again to some  of these other priorities that I think are important, if Senator  Sessions is confirmed, to continue to be a focus in the Justice  Department, as well as other concerns that I have--is the funding of  the COPS program. Republican Senator Murkowski and I are leading that  effort. We have always had, especially in the House of Representatives,  bipartisan support for the COPS program.   During Senator Sessions' hearing, I made a special note to discuss  that issue with Chuck Canterbury, who is the president of the Fraternal  Order of Police, and we had a good discussion about that. He stated  that he shared my view that this is a very important program,  particularly with the sharp decrease in staffing levels we have seen  for law enforcement around the country in recent years, including  training funding--something that is really important.   The Community Oriented Policing Services, or the COPS program, was  established many years ago. It helped to place more than 129,000 police  officers on the beat in more than 13,000 State, local, and tribal law  enforcement agencies. In fiscal year 2015, the COPS office was able to  award grants to just 209 of the over 1,000 law enforcement agencies  that applied. It translated into about 915 officers, which is still a  lot, but, in fact, there were requests for over 3,000 officers.   I think we can all agree, and hope the administration agrees, that  this is a very important program. I will continue to work with Senator  Sessions, if he is confirmed, to make sure we have the support from the  administration for this program, which, again, is one of the top  priorities of the Fraternal Order of Police and other police  organizations across the country.   I look forward to discussing other issues when I return, but for now,  I yield the floor. Thank you.    Madam President, I first want to say a few words about  the Senator from Massachusetts and her passion and what she has brought  to this Chamber. While I know she has not been allowed to complete her  remarks today, I know that will not silence her, and we look forward to  hearing from her tomorrow and many days in the future on so many  topics.   I also wanted to say something about my friend from Utah. We have  worked together on so many bills. I have seen firsthand that he means  what he says about treating this Chamber with the dignity that we all  deserve and that the American people deserve.   Also, I was especially impressed by the words from the Senator from  Florida. When I see the majority leader and the Democratic leader over  there talking in the corner now, I think that is a good sign, because I  have never seen a time where the Senate is more important, as the  Senator from Florida was mentioning.   This is a moment in time where the Senate will not just be a check  and balance, but it is also a place for compromise. The one issue where  I would differ slightly with my friend and colleague from Utah is that  this isn't just about Democrats responding with surprise or anger to  the election of a new President. There have been a lot of things said  in the last few months, including calling judges ``so-called judges''  and some of the discussions and comparisons to foreign leaders, and  things that we have heard from the White House in the last few weeks,  including the order that was issued that some of our Republican  colleagues expressed a lot of concern about and that the Senate wasn't  involved in and that a lot of law enforcement people weren't involved  in.   There have been reasons that people's passions are high, and there  are reasons that are good ones because we care about this country. So I  hope people will see that in perspective for why people are reacting  the way they do.   As for the Senator from Alabama, as I would call him for the purpose  of these remarks, I am someone who has worked well with him. We have  done bills together on adoption, and we have worked together on  trafficking, and I am proud of the work I have done with him. We have  also gone to the State of the Union together every single year, and I  value his friendship.   I came to the conclusion that I couldn't support him not for personal  reasons, but because of some of the views he has expressed in the past  and his record on the Violence Against Women Act, his views on  immigration, and his views relating to voting rights.   I think many of our colleagues, especially those who serve on the  Judiciary Committee, feel the same way--that this wasn't personal, but  we simply had a deep disagreement with some of his views on certain  issues.   Today I thought I would focus on the voting rights issue. I spoke  earlier about the Violence Against Women Act, and I think that is a  good place to start as we work together going forward. We have seen an  attack on America's election system; we have had 17 intelligence  agencies talking about the fact that a foreign country tried to  influence our election. It is the core of our democracy. I know the  Senator from Florida himself has said that this time it happened to one  candidate, one party, and the next time it could be another party,  another candidate. So this idea of voting--this idea of the freedom to  vote--is the core of our democracy.   One of the most important duties of the Justice Department--and that  is the office for which the Attorney General would run--is safeguarding  voters' access to the ballot box. This issue is important in my State.  We had the highest voter turnout of any State in the country in this  past election, and part of the reason we had such a good turnout is  that we have good laws that allow for people to vote. It allows for  same-day registration. We make it easy for people to vote; we don't  make it hard. For me, that is one of the major duties of the Justice  Department, and that is to enforce our voting rights.   I will never forget when I traveled to Alabama in the last few years  with one of the leaders, Congressman John Lewis, who was one of the 13  original Freedom Riders. In 1964 he coordinated the efforts for the  Mississippi Freedom Summit, recruiting college students from around the  country to join the movement, to register African-American voters  across the South. People from my State went, and people from every  State in this Chamber went there for that March.   On March 7, 1965, Congressman Lewis and 600 other peaceful protestors  attempted to march from Selma to Birmingham to protest violence against  civil rights workers. As they reached the crest of the Edmund Pettus  Bridge, they saw a line of troopers blocking their way. At the end of  the bridge, those peaceful marchers were attacked, just for calling for  the right to vote. John Lewis's skull was fractured, and he still bears  that scar to this day.   The weekend that I went back there, 48 years after that bloody  Sunday, was the weekend that the police chief of Montgomery actually  handed Congressman Lewis a badge and publicly apologized for what  happened to him that day, 48 years later. But as moving as that apology  was, we still have a duty to make sure that those sacrifices were not  in vain. We also need to make it easier for people to actually vote,  and that is a promise still unmet in America over 50 years later,  whether it is lines at voting booths or whether it is laws in place  that make it harder to vote.   I just look at this differently, having come from a high voter  turnout State, a State where we have same-day registration, and when we  look at the other high voter States that have that same-day  registration station--Iowa, the Presiding Officer's State is one of  them; that is not really a Democratic State, yet they have a high voter  turnout and people participate and feel a part of that process. New  Hampshire, Vermont, these States are truly split, but what we want to  see is that kind of participation.  [[Page S860]]    A couple of months after I was in Selma, the Supreme Court handed  down its decision in the case of Shelby County v. Holder. In this  decision, the Justices found that a formula in section 4 of the Voting  Rights Act was unconstitutional. This formula was used to decide which  States and localities needed to have Federal approval for any changes  made to their voting rights laws, endangering the progress made over  the past 50 years.   According to a report by the Brennan Center for Justice, following  the Shelby County decision, 14 States put new voting restrictions in  place that impacted the 2016 Presidential election. Three other States  also passed restrictive voting measures, but those laws were blocked by  the courts. So the harm is very real and very serious, and we can't sit  by and just let this happen.   Specifically, we need a Department of Justice that will vigorously  enforce the remaining sections of the Voting Rights Act as well as the  National Voter Registration Act and the Help America Vote Act.  Currently, a majority of the States are not complying with the National  Voter Registration Act, leaving voting rolls outdated and preventing  eligible voters from casting their ballots. Without a Department of  Justice that makes the enforcement of these laws a priority, the rights  of voters will continue to be infringed.   Congress also needs to take action through legislation to make right  what came out of that Supreme Court decision. Effectively throwing out  the preclearance provision of the Voting Rights Act just doesn't make  sense. As Justice Ginsberg put so well in her dissent, ``Ending  preclearance now is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm  because you are not getting wet.''   Those marchers in Selma sacrificed too much for us not to fight back.  That is why I cosponsored legislation last Congress that would amend  the Voting Rights Act.   I am under no illusion that amending the Voting Rights Act in  Congress will be easy. It won't be. We have seen some bipartisan  support. In fact, Congressman Sensenbrenner, from my neighboring State  of Wisconsin, who sponsored the reauthorization in 2006, called for  Congress to restore the Voting Rights Act. As he put it, ``the Voting  Rights Act is vital to America's commitment to never again permit  racial prejudices in the electoral process.''   Another issue I want to focus on this evening that I raised in  Senator Sessions' hearing is the fundamental importance of freedom of  the press. My dad was a newspaper reporter, and up until a few years  ago, he was still writing a blog. So I am especially sensitive to, and  concerned about, maintaining the press's role as a watchdog.   On a larger note, the role of journalists is critical to our Nation's  democracy. That is why our Founders enshrined freedom of the press in  the First Amendment. When we look at what we are seeing in the last few  years in our country, what concerns me is this assault on democracy. We  have voting rights issues with people unable to vote, with lines, with  restrictive voting laws passed as opposed to finding ways to allow more  people to vote. We have outside money in politics. Recently, we have  some of the things being said about judges, and now we have some  assault on this notion of the freedom of the press.   Thomas Jefferson said that our first objective should be to leave  open ``all avenues to truth,'' and the most effective way of doing that  is through ``the freedom of press.'' This is still true today. Freedom  of the press is the best avenue to truth. In fact, these values are  more important now than ever, at a time when people are not exactly  valuing the freedom of the press.   I believe there are two distinct roles journalists will hold that  Congress must preserve and strengthen in the coming years. The first is  providing the people with information about their government. Sometimes  this is as simple as covering the passage of a new law in a public  forum. This work doesn't just lead to a better, informed public. It can  also lead to important actions.   Thanks to excellent reporting from across the country, Americans have  been energized in the past. For instance, just a few weeks ago there  was an attempt to gut the Office of Congressional Ethics over in the  House. That came out, people were outraged, it was reported on, and  they backed down.   The second role we must preserve is journalists' responsibility to be  fact-checkers. They research, they provide context, and, when they need  to, they correct. We need newspapers and media to stand up for what is  true and what is factual. Unlike what was recently said--not in this  Chamber--the press cannot simply keep its mouth shut. The American  people deserve the truth, and we are all relying on journalists to keep  digging for it. I take this personally and seriously.   In Senator Sessions' hearing I asked him whether he would follow the  standards now in place at the Justice Department, which address when  Federal prosecutors can subpoena journalists or their records and serve  to protect reporters engaged in news-gathering activities. The previous  two Attorneys General both pledged not to put reporters in jail if they  were simply doing their job under the law.   The Senator from Alabama did not make that commitment. When I asked  him about this in his hearing, he said he had not yet studied those  rules. He also did not make a commitment when I later asked him to do  that on the record.   The Senator from Alabama has also raised concerns in the past about  protecting journalists from revealing their sources, including opposing  the Free Flow of Information Act when it was considered by the  Judiciary Committee in 2007, 2009, and 2013. So at this time, when our  freedom of the press has been under attack at the highest levels of  government, I believe it is critically important that our Justice  Department continues to function as an independent voice that will  protect the ability of journalists to do their job.   Lastly, I want to take a moment to focus on the importance of the  Antitrust Division at the Department of Justice. As ranking member of  the Antitrust Subcommittee, I am concerned about the state of  competition in the marketplace. I wish to take a few minutes on this  issue.   I did ask Senator Sessions about this at his hearing, and he said he  was committed to an independent division in the Justice Department and  to continue that work without outside influence. I continue to believe  that this issue will be important because of the massive amount of  mergers we are seeing. The legal technicalities behind our antitrust  laws will not be familiar to most Americans, but effective antitrust  enforcement provides benefits we can all understand. When companies  vigorously compete, they can offer consumers the lowest prices and the  highest quality goods and services.   Senator Sessions has stated that he will support the independence of  that division, and I want to make clear how critical this is. It is  absolutely essential that our next Attorney General enforces our  antitrust laws fairly and vigorously, and that this person protects the  integrity of the Antitrust Division's prosecutorial function from  inappropriate influence. This is because vigilant antitrust enforcement  means more money in the pockets of American consumers. The Attorney  General can do this by identifying and preventing competition problems  before they occur, like stopping a merger that would allow a few  dominant players to raise prices, or, when a merger is allowed to move  forward, putting conditions in place to protect competition.   The next Attorney General will also be able to stop price-fixing  cartels that hurt consumers by artificially inflating prices for goods  such as auto parts, TVs, and tablet computers. Last year alone, the  Justice Department obtained more than $1 billion in criminal antitrust  fines. Anticompetitive practices have serious impacts on consumers; for  example, pay-for-delay settlements that keep cheaper generic drugs from  coming onto the markets. Estimates suggest that eliminating those  sweetheart deals would generate over $2.9 billion in budget savings  over 10 years and save American consumers billions on their  prescription drug costs. That is why Senator Grassley and I worked on  bipartisan legislation to give the Federal Trade Commission greater  ability to block those anticompetitive agreements. Our Preserve Access  to Affordable Generics Act would increase consumers' access to cost- saving generic drugs.  [[Page S861]]    The bottom line is this. Antitrust enforcement is needed now more  than ever. We are experiencing a wave of concentration across  industries. Just last year, then-Assistant Attorney General for  Antitrust Division Bill Baer, a lifelong antitrust practitioner, said  his agency was reviewing deals with such antitrust concerns that they  should never have made it out of the corporate boardroom.   Not only will antitrust violations mean higher prices for Americans  and less innovation, but the indirect effects are equally troubling.  There is concern that undue concentration of economic power would  exacerbate income inequality. There is also concern that concentration  can hurt new businesses, stifling innovation. Why would you innovate if  there is just one or two firms? Only effective antitrust enforcement by  the Attorney General will prevent those harms, and effective  enforcement can occur only if the Department of Justice makes  enforcement decisions based on the merits of the individual case,  rather than politics.   Traditionally, the White House has not interfered with antitrust  enforcement decisions, but recent reports indicate that the President  has discussed pending mergers with CEOs during ongoing antitrust  reviews. Some companies have also publicly reported their conversations  with and their commitments to the President. In both Senator Sessions'  hearing and in a follow up letter, I raised this issue with him. The  Senator from Alabama said: ``It would be improper to consider any  political, personal, or other non-legal basis in reaching an  enforcement decision.''   That is the correct answer. I plan to rigorously protect the  Antitrust Division's prosecutorial integrity to make sure it is  principled and is done right. Antitrust and competition policy are not  Republican or Democratic issues. A merger in the ag industry could have  an effect on farmers in Iowa, as the Presiding Officer knows. These are  consumer issues, and these issues could not be more important to all  Americans. We can all agree that robust competition is essential to our  free-market economy and critical to ensuring that consumers pay the  best prices for what they need.   I want to switch gears and conclude today by speaking about the  President's Executive order regarding refugees, especially those from  Muslim countries, which has caused so much chaos across our country  over the past several weeks.   While I know Senator Sessions was not involved in writing the  Executive order, it is very important that going forward, obviously,  the Attorney General and the Department of Justice's Office of Legal  Counsel have a responsibility to review Presidential Executive orders  and assure they are legal and done right.   I sent a letter, with Senators Durbin, Whitehouse, Franken, Coons,  and Blumenthal, and we asked Senator Sessions what he would have done  if the President's Executive order came across his desk. As a former  prosecutor, I have long advocated for thorough vetting and supported  strong national security measures.   I believe that the No. 1 priority should be making people safe. While  working to strengthen biometrics and other security measures is a good  goal, this is not the way our government should work--that an order  should be put out there without properly vetting it and figuring out  the effect it would have on a four-year-old girl who is in a refugee  camp in Uganda. That happened.   In my State, there was a mom who had two children, a Somali mother in  a refugee camp. She got permission to come over to our State and to our  country as a refugee. But she was pregnant, and when she had that baby,  that baby did not have permission to come with her. So she had a  Sophie's choice: Does she leave the baby in the refugee camp with  friends and go to America with her two other daughters, or do all of  them stay in the refugee camp in Uganda? She made a decision that she  would go with her two older girls, that that would be the safest thing  for them.   For 4 years, she worked to get the child that was left behind in the  refugee camp to America to be reunited with her sisters. The baby, who  is now 4 years old, was to get on a plane on the Monday after the  President's Executive order was issued. The 4-year-old could not get on  that plane.   Senator Franken and I got involved. We talked to General Kelly. He  was more than generous with his time. They made an exception, and the  4-year-old is now in Minnesota. But it should not take a Senator's  intervention--as many of my colleagues know that have worked on these  cases--to get a 4-year-old who is supposed to be reunited with their  family, something that our government had worked on for 4 years and  Lutheran Social Services in Minnesota had worked on for 4 years.   If Senator Sessions is in fact confirmed as the next Attorney  General, these are actual issues he is going to have to work on, and  beyond that, we have the issue of how people in our country are afraid.   We have 100,000 Somalis in Minnesota. We have the biggest Somali  population in the country. A man who works for me started with my  office 10 years ago and has been our outreach to the Somali community.  He was just elected to the school board.   We have Somalis elected to our city council. They are part of the  fabric of life in our State. Congressman Emmer, who actually took the  seat held by Michele Bachmann, is the cochair, along with Congressman  Ellison, of the Somali caucus in the House of Representatives. We have  not seen this as a Democratic issue or a Republican issue in our State.  We have welcomed these refugees.   We have the second biggest population of Hmong in the United States  of America. We have the biggest Liberian population. We have one of the  biggest populations of people from Burma. We have 17 Fortune 500  companies in our State. When these refugees come over, they are legal  workers, and they are a major part of our economy. So it is no surprise  that during the last year, when we heard the kind of rhetoric that we  have heard, people have been concerned--not just the refugees  themselves, not just their friends and family, but a lot of people in  our State. The churches have gotten involved--all kinds and every  denomination in our State--to stand up for our Muslim population. Why?  Because they have all heard the story. One of my most memorable stories  was from a family whom I heard about when I was visiting with some of  our Muslim population in Minneapolis. This was a story of two adults  who actually had been in our State during 9/11. And during 9/11, George  Bush stood up and he said: This isn't about a religion. This is about  evil people who did evil things, but it is not to indict a religion.    His U.S. attorney at the time, the Republican U.S. attorney, went  around with me--the elected prosecutor for the biggest county in our  State--and we met with the Muslim population and assured them they were  safe and told them to report hate crimes. The family, these two adults,  they were there then. Nothing bad happened to them. No one called them  a name.   Fast-forward to this summer. They are at a restaurant with their two  little children. They are just sitting there having dinner.   A guy walks by and says: You four go home. You go home to where you  came from.   The little girl looked up at her mom, and she said: Mom, I don't want  to go home and eat tonight. You said we could eat out tonight.   The words of an innocent child. She didn't even know what that man  was talking about because she only knows one home. That home is our  State, and that home is the United States of America.   If Senator Sessions is confirmed for this position, he is going to  have an obligation to that little girl who was in that restaurant and  to all of the people in our country because this is the Justice  Department of the United States of America.   As a former prosecutor, I know a big part of that job is prosecuting  cases and doing all we can to keep America safe from evildoers, but it  is also about keeping our Constitution and our rights safe.   Madam President, I yield the floor.
