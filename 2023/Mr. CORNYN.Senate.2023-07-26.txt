 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, on Monday, President Biden's Department of  Justice filed suit against my State, Texas, over our efforts to secure  our border. Of the 2,000-mile southern border, Texas has a 1,200-mile  border with Mexico; and, of course, that has been the epicenter of the  humanitarian and public safety crisis that we have seen get nothing but  worse over the last 2 years.   It is almost laughable, if it wasn't so serious. The administration  filed suit over what it called humanitarian concerns, which is more  than a little ironic. This is the same administration whose policies  have ushered in an unprecedented humanitarian and public security  crisis at the southern border.   I have talked previously about the 300,000 children--unaccompanied  children--who have been placed with sponsors in the interior of the  United States by the Biden administration during the last 2\1/2\ years  and the fact that the administration has lost track of at least 85,000  of those 300,000 children. When they were contacted or attempted to be  contacted by the Office of Refugee Resettlement and Health and Human  Services, 30 days after they were placed with a sponsor, there was no  answer and no followup by the administration.   This is the same administration that turned a blind eye when  countless young migrants were being exploited on American soil. The New  York Times has run two investigative pieces pointing out that,  essentially, the administration doesn't know where any of these 300,000  unaccompanied children are--whether they are going to school, whether  they are getting their healthcare attended to, whether they are being  recruited into gangs or sexually abused or otherwise neglected. They  don't know, and, apparently, they don't care because, if they did care,  then they would make the effort to find out and do something about it.   Vice President Harris was designated as the administration's border  czar during this unprecedented crisis, which has taken a devastating  toll on migrants, law enforcement, and border communities, and it has  affected every city in the country, from New York to Washington, DC, to  Chicago. Every State, in a sense, has been affected by the border  crisis and has become a border State in that sense.   Vice President Harris, despite her effort to do anything to address  this crisis at the border, has had the audacity to criticize Governor  Abbott's actions as ``inhumane,'' ``outrageous,'' and ``un-American.''  Of course, she can't be bothered to actually go to the border and find  out what is happening there on her own.   Now, there are a lot of misconceptions about the border. People who  haven't been there haven't learned for themselves or from the experts  at Border Patrol and the nongovernmental organizations that do their  best to try to take care of these people. Vice President Harris simply  hasn't bothered to learn, yet she has the audacity to criticize  Governor Abbott for doing what he has to do because of the failure of  the Biden administration to do its job. The unavoidable reality is we  wouldn't be in this situation if it  [[Page S3565]]  weren't for President Biden abdicating his responsibilities.   This is an international border, as we all know. That, by definition,  is the Federal Government's responsibility, but the Biden  administration has simply, as I said, abdicated its responsibilities,  with tragic consequences. Unlike President Biden, Governor Abbott took  action. His constituents--my constituents--30 million Texans, insisted  upon it, and he put measures in place to try to deter migrants from  attempting the dangerous journey from their home across the border into  the United States.   We know, particularly now with temperatures in the triple digits,  that migrants face a brutal environment: heat, dangerous waters,  treacherous terrain. And, sadly, many migrants do not survive the  journey.   Does President Biden understand that, last year alone, at least 748  people died making their way across the southern border?   I know he has never been to Brooks County, which is the location of  one of the interior checkpoints where the coyotes will drive people up  from the stash houses along the border, short of the checkpoint, and  tell the migrants, ``Get out of the vehicle, and here is a gallon jug  of water''--and maybe a candy bar--``and meet me on the top side, on  the north side of the border checkpoint,'' in order to evade the  interior checkpoints.   Well, Brooks County had so many migrants who died under those  circumstances, making that trek around the checkpoint, that they didn't  have the money to actually bury the bodies, and so we actually had to  try to provide some additional resources to help them do that.   Again, the hypocrisy of the Biden administration complaining about  the State trying to do its best to deal with a vacuum when it comes to  Federal responsibility is absolutely ridiculous. So 748 people, we  know, died trying to come across the southern border, and they are  complaining about efforts to try to deter or dissuade people from  making that dangerous trip in the first place. That is what Governor  Abbott is trying to do and being criticized by the very people who are  not doing their job.   If the President is unhappy with the actions Texas has taken, there  is a clear solution: Do your job. If the President and his  administration did their job, there would be no need for the State to  use its resources and its tax dollars to do the job that the Federal  Government should be doing. Until then, Governor Abbott has every right  to use the powers available to him to keep our State safe, to protect  our citizens. That is his right as an elected head of a sovereign  State.   I want to make a point of thanking all the countless Federal, State,  and local law enforcement officers as well as the National Guardsmen  from Texas, the Department of Public Safety, and others who have been  deployed to the border for their tireless work to protect our State and  our country. They deserve our commendation and our appreciation, not  criticism, particularly when it is so misguided and unfair.   The Biden administration may not appreciate the efforts of the State  of Texas, but the vast majority of us see, understand, and are grateful  for everything Texas guards, local law enforcement, DPS, and others are  doing to keep our country safe.                                   S. 2226    Mr. President, on another matter, the Senate is in the process of  fulfilling one of its most important responsibilities, and that is  protecting the safety and security of our Nation by advancing the  National Defense Authorization Act.   I want to commend Senator Reed and Senator Wicker, the chairman and  ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, for their leadership on  this bill and for maintaining the bipartisan process that has  historically guided this legislation.   Congress has managed to overcome partisan differences to pass a  Defense authorization bill for each of the past 62 years. That is quite  an accomplishment, and I hope we can build on that record of success  again this year.   Our colleagues on the Armed Services Committee compiled a strong  bill, and I am glad the Senate now has an opportunity to try to improve  it further by offering and voting on various amendments.   Yesterday evening, the Senate adopted a bipartisan amendment I  introduced with Senator Casey, the Senator from Pennsylvania, to  strengthen our ability to counter threats from China. It does this by  providing greater visibility into certain investments American entities  are making in China and other countries of concern. Our amendment  received overwhelming bipartisan support. It passed by a vote of 91 to  6, which is incredibly rare these days.   I want to express my gratitude to Senator Casey and all of our  colleagues who worked together--particularly on the Banking Committee  and others--and thank them for supporting this amendment and working  with us to overcome this initial hurdle.   We know when this bill goes to conference with the House of  Representatives, there will be other discussions about this topic, but  it is important that we have a strong vote on this outbound investment  transparency provision because we need to know what American companies  are doing to help grow the economy of our chief competitor on the  planet, which is using that strong economy, by the way, to arm itself  and threaten its neighbors in the region. We need to know--and this  legislation will allow us to know--exactly what is going on so we can  consider whether other policy provisions are necessary.   We know the House passed its own version of the NDAA last month, but  it didn't include any provisions on this outbound investment issue. So  I am confident in the coming weeks Members of the House and the Senate  will need to iron out the differences between our two versions. And it  is absolutely critical that this outbound investment transparency that  the Senate so enthusiastically supported be part of that final  conference report.   We all know the Chinese Communist Party has become increasingly  aggressive in its efforts to gain power and influence. Through  intellectual property theft, forced technology transfers, and predatory  lending practices like the Belt and Road Initiative, China has grown  its economic power and is using these same methods to pursue global  military dominance.   In China, there is no bright line separating the military and  civilian sectors. This is part of an intentional strategy known as  Military-Civil Fusion, which promotes the development of dual-use  technologies. In other words, it can used in the private sector, and it  can be used by the People's Liberation Army.   In short, the Chinese Communist Party is investing in technologies  that bolster both its military strength and its economic power. And  unfortunately, many American entities are fueling the success of  Chinese Military-Civil Fusion, maybe even without knowing really what  they are doing.   In testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, an open  hearing--an unusual open hearing--I heard some concerning figures that  illustrate just how big this problem is.   At the end of 2020, U.S. investments in Chinese companies had a total  market value of $2.3 trillion. That is foreign investments from the  United States into the People's Republic of China worth $2.3 trillion  in 2020. That included $21 billion in semiconductors, $54 billion to  Chinese military companies, and a whopping $221 billion in artificial  intelligence.   There has been a lot of discussion here in the Senate and in  Washington, DC, about what is the future of artificial intelligence.  Well, American companies have been investing a lot of money in China  and helping them develop their artificial intelligence capabilities.  And we know this authoritarian country, under the leadership of  President Xi, does not have benign intentions. We need to be very  careful about exactly how much and in what sectors the American  business community is investing in China when they are our No. 1 global  competitor.   Intentionally or not, American companies are bankrolling the Chinese  Communist Party's military rise. They are pouring huge amounts of  capital into capabilities that could be used against the United States  and certainly against our allies.   These few data points are deeply concerning. But the truth is, these  are just a few pieces of the puzzle. We can't see the full picture, but  we need to.  [[Page S3566]]    Currently, there are no requirements for companies to report billion- dollar investments in Chinese companies. The full extent of U.S.  investments could be much larger and more concerning, but we simply  don't have the information.   That is exactly why Senator Casey and I offered this amendment and  why the Senate adopted it so overwhelmingly, 91 to 6. A strong  bipartisan support for this amendment is evidence that this bill  strengthens our national security without impacting the free market. We  are not interested in decoupling from China, as some people have  advocated. And I think Secretary Blinken and Secretary Yellen, who have  used the word ``derisking''--it is an appropriate use of that term. We  are trying to derisk our economies in our two countries so, hopefully,  it will never come to any open conflict.   We want to make sure that we are strong enough to deter China from  ever even thinking about invading Taiwan, for example.   But as our colleagues know, the requirement of providing notice of  U.S.-based investments in China does not apply to every investment  under the Sun--the one we just voted on. It is a highly targeted  amendment and only applies to sensitive technologies like  semiconductors, artificial intelligence, and hypersonics.   These are the technologies and capabilities that pose the greatest  national security risk to the United States of America. And to be  clear, it does not stop investments from happening or interfere with  other investments by American companies in the People's Republic of  China. It simply requires companies or other entities to share  information about investments in certain technologies.   This is all about transparency. It will help the United States see  and understand the threats from China and other countries of concern so  we can act accordingly.   Some of our colleagues said: Well, we need to do more. I agree. But I  think this is an important first step. And certainly when we say  politics is the art of the possible, this is what is possible now. And  I would hope, with additional information that is generated from these  transparency measures, we can make a decision at some later point  whether different policy needs to be applied. But for now, this  represents an important first step.   The reality is, things like sanctions to restrictions, to an outright  ban on investments don't have the political support on both sides of  the aisle in both Chambers that they need in order to become law. So  rather than adopt an all-or-nothing approach, which will end up leaving  us with nothing, we decided to again engage in the art of the possible.  And this amendment demonstrates that that is achievable.   The outbound investment provision promotes our national security,  protects the free market, and it provides much greater visibility into  the threats posed by our most formidable potential adversaries.  Outbound investment transparency is absolutely crucial to our ability  to understand what is happening in China and to counter any threats.   I urge my colleagues in the Senate and the House as well to fight to  preserve this language during the conference process.   But, in closing, let me just again thank Chairman Reed and Ranking  Member Wicker and all of our colleagues on the Armed Services Committee  for all the work that has gone into this bill so far. I know we are not  through. We are going to have a number of votes today and tomorrow. But  they provided us a strong foundation and a strong base to build on. And  I am glad those of us who are not on the Armed Services Committee have  a chance to offer our suggestions and improve the bill by the amendment  process.    With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
