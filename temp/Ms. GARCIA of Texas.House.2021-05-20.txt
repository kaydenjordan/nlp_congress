 Madam Speaker, I rise today to emphasize the  importance of the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit for  my constituents in my district. Because of the severe winter storms  earlier this year, Texans can still file their tax returns until June  15--I repeat, until June 15.   Single filers who make $75,000 or less annually and heads of  household who earn $112,500 annually could benefit from the full earned  income tax credit and child tax credits if they file their taxes on  time.   In my district alone, President Biden's new 1-year expansion of the  child tax credit will lift 213,500 children out of poverty. That means  that 95 percent of the children in my district would benefit.   Because of this, I am urging all of my constituents to file their  taxes even if they don't normally do so. Working families and children  need these dollars now more than ever.   I am glad that the improved and expanded child tax credit will be  arriving soon to help families in my district and in Texas.                            ____________________
