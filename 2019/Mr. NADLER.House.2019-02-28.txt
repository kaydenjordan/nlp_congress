 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on H.R. 1112, the Enhanced Background  Checks Act of 2019.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I am pleased that today we are considering H.R. 1112,  the Enhanced Background Checks Act.   Yesterday, the House passed H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks  Act, an important bill to expand our national firearms background check  system to include virtually all gun transfers.   However, there are also steps we can take to make the current  background check system more effective at blocking the sale of guns to  individuals who are ineligible to purchase and possess them.   That is why I support H.R. 1112, a bill that addresses a dangerous  shortcoming in the current firearms background check law.   In most cases, a licensed gun dealer receives notification within a  few minutes, often 90 seconds, from the National Instant Criminal  Background Check System, sometimes called the NICS, that a prospective  buyer has passed or failed the background check.   In a small percentage of cases, NICS examiners may require additional  time to complete the background check if information is missing or  unclear in a prospective buyer's record. For example, there may be on  the record a notation that the prospective buyer was arrested but no  notation as to whether the buyer was acquitted or convicted. That would  have to be looked into further.   However, under current law, a licensed gun dealer conducting a  background check on a prospective purchaser is permitted to sell the  firearm to the purchaser if there has been no determination from NICS  after 3 business days, even though NICS has not indicated that the  person has actually passed the background check.   Often, we refer to this as a default proceed transaction.   These are the very cases that ought to be investigated. In 2017  alone, the ATF determined that over 4,000 default proceed firearms  transfers went to purchasers who should not lawfully have gotten them  because they could not lawfully own a firearm.   If NICS is unable to return an instant determination, and especially  if there is no report after 3 days, there is real cause for concern.   One notable example of the tragic consequences of this loophole is  the hate crime murder of nine people at the Emanuel African Methodist  Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015.   In that tragedy, the shooter was not legally allowed to possess a  firearm as a result of drug charges, but he still was able to purchase  his gun from a licensed dealer, who made the decision to transfer after  3 business days had elapsed, despite not having received a definitive  response from the background check system.   The bill before us today, H.R. 1112, would strengthen the background  check procedures Federal firearms licensees or dealers must follow  before selling or transferring a firearm.   Under this bill, the initial period a gun dealer must wait for an  answer from the NICS is extended from 3 days to 10 days. If, after 10  days, the NICS system has not returned an answer to the dealer, the  prospective purchaser may file a petition with the attorney general,  which should help resolve most applications in short order.   If an additional 10 days elapses without a response from NICS, the  licensed firearms dealer then may sell or transfer the firearm to the  prospective purchaser without the background check completion, if the  dealer has no reason to believe that the purchaser is prohibited from  obtaining a firearm under Federal, State, or local law.   The additional time for checks to be completed will help prevent the  transfer of guns to individuals who are ineligible to possess them and  will make us safer.   I want to remind everyone that, in 90 percent of the cases, the NICS  system gives the answer within 90 seconds. So we are talking about a  small number of cases, but a number of cases where we know there have  been tragic results. We want to stop that.   I commend our colleague Congressman  Jim Clyburn, the distinguished  Democratic whip, for introducing this bipartisan bill, which is a  sensible and necessary approach to addressing this dangerous  shortcoming in current law.    Madam Chair, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill  today, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 7 minutes to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), the distinguished Democratic whip.   (Mr. CLYBURN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Madam Chair, I yield the gentleman from South Carolina an  additional 1 minute.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Bass), the chair of the Crime, Terrorism and Homeland  Security Subcommittee.    Madam Chairman, I yield the gentlewoman from California  an additional 30 seconds.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Underwood).    Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Georgia (Mrs. McBath), a member of the committee.    Madam Chair, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Madam Chair, I heard the argument from the other side a moment ago  that people adjudged ineligible for the system by the VA, that their  names  [[Page H2281]]  should not be given into the system so that they may purchase firearms.   I would point out that one of the largest sources of mortality among  veterans is suicide. Veterans are, I think, the highest group in our  society in terms of suicide rate. So it really makes sense to make it  easier for people adjudged not to be proper to have a gun to have a gun  if you are worried about suicides. That argument is, frankly,  nonsensical. I am very glad the VA helps protect our veterans by  participating in the system.   Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island  (Mr. Cicilline), a member of the committee and the chairman of one of  our subcommittees.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, at this time I would like to address a concern that has  been raised by one section of the bill that is unrelated to the changes  to current law to address the Charleston loophole.   Section 3 of the bill replaces outdated and offensive terminology in  the categories of individuals who are ineligible to purchase or possess  firearms under current law. Among those included, there are individuals  subject to such prohibitions because, as stated by the current law,  they are ``adjudicated as a mental defective.''   At the Judiciary Committee's markup of the bill, we agreed with our  ranking member, Representative Collins, to replace this offensive  language and to insert different terminology in the bill as a  placeholder as we work to develop alternative language that does not  alter the scope of who is included in these prohibitions and to work  with stakeholders who have an interest in how this would be  accomplished.   We have heard from various advocates in the mental health, disability  rights, and veterans communities who have expressed their desire to  develop an acceptable alternative. We agree.   Yesterday, the Veterans of Foreign Wars brought their concerns  related to this issue to our attention. The VFW agrees that the current  terminology is archaic but is concerned about a potential unintended  consequence of replacing it.   Their concern is that replacing these terms with ``mental illness,''  ``severe developmental disability,'' or ``severe emotional  instability'' could result in some veterans who are not now included  being added to the NICS index due to their receipt of VA care or  benefits for mental illnesses such as PTSD or traumatic brain injury.   It is not the intent of the changes in this terminology made by  section 3 to alter the scope of those currently considered to be  ``adjudicated as a mental defective.'' It is the intent simply to  replace that offensive language, but not to change the underlying law.   We will work with stakeholders, including the VFW, the mental health  community, and the disability rights community to address the concerns  related to this outdated terminology in a manner that does not change  the scope of present law as this bill proceeds.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, our mistake was in accepting the amendment from the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins). The amendment dealt with the  underlying language of the underlying law, not with the bill. We should  have insisted that an attempt to correct that language be in a separate  bill.   The gentleman from Georgia is now telling us that we should kill this  bill that will save so many lives because we have not figured out  acceptable language to replace existing bad language in the existing  law that had nothing to do with this bill.   We should pass this bill.   We will work as we go forward to see if we can come up with  acceptable language, but in any event, we should pass this bill and  deal with the separate problem of bad language in the underlying law  separately.   Madam Chair, how much time do I have remaining?    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Kelly).                                time  1000     Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a member of the committee.    Madam Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, this is an important bill that addresses a significant,  and tragically demonstrated, threat to public safety.   Today is the 25th anniversary of the implementation of the Brady  Background Check Act. This lifesaving law has served us well, helping  to prevent firearms from getting into the hands of those who are  legally prohibited from possessing and purchasing them. But we know  that some aspects of this law and the system that implements it must be  updated and improved.   Let's remember what this bill does. All this bill does is give the  FBI additional time--gives the NICS system additional time--to complete  a background check in the 8 or 9 percent of cases where it is not done  within 90 seconds. If you haven't gotten a background check back in 3  days, under this bill, you can't get it automatically, and you can't  get the weapon automatically.   They have 10 days to do it. If after 10 days they still haven't done  it, then you can petition the Attorney General. And if they still don't  do it, get your firearm within 10 days. That will save a lot of lives.   We hear about mass shootings, but we also should remember that we are  not talking about just mass shootings. Thirty-four people a day are  killed in this country by guns--34 a day. Every other industrialized  country in the world: 90 deaths with guns a year, 120, 170. The United  States: 39,000.   How are we different? Are we thousands of times more mentally ill  than people in Europe or Japan? No.   Are we more vicious? No.   Are our habits more degraded? No.   The difference is that this country is awash in guns. The difference  is that, in this country, people who are dangerous can get guns.   These are modest steps. We should take much more advanced steps. We  should ban assault weapons. We should ban large capacity magazine  clips. But we are not doing that. We are starting with very moderate  steps.   This is a very moderate step to improve the background check system.  With all the rhetoric we hear, that is all it does. It gives a little  extra time to make sure that someone who is dangerous, whose possession  of a firearm is illegal, cannot get it.   Enacting this bill will save lives. I urge my colleagues to ignore  all the nonsense rhetoric about extraneous considerations. Join me in  supporting this bill today. Join me in supporting saving lives. Join me  in making the United States a little safer to live in.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I support this amendment, which requires the FBI to report on the  number  [[Page H2287]]  of petitions it was not able to resolve with a determination within 10  days.   We know that providing more time for checks to be completed in the  instances that more time is needed will help prevent guns from getting  into the hands of those who are ineligible under current law from  purchasing and possessing the guns.   The goal of this bill is to do just that, and to allow individuals  whose checks take longer than 10 days to complete the opportunity to  petition for their case to be reviewed within another 10-day period.   Madam Chair, the report required by this amendment will help us  oversee the implementation of this new process and the changes  instituted by this law. I urge my colleagues to support this salutary  amendment.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I support this amendment to require the GAO to submit a report to the  relevant congressional committees analyzing the extent to which the  additions required by this bill prevent firearms from being transferred  to prohibited persons.   It will be important for us to get information about the  implementation of the law and its impact on so-called default proceed  transactions. The amendment also requires that the GAO report its  findings after 90 days and again after 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years.   I think it is always a good idea to actually track the effect of new  legislation and see how effective it is.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  amendment, and I commend the sponsor for doing so.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise in support of this amendment, and this completely takes care  of Mr. Collins' concern, whether he realizes it or not. Because this  says that the transfer can take place for 25 days after the transfer  becomes legally permissible.   In other words, under the longest timeframe, the background check  doesn't come back within 10 days. The purchaser waits a few days, and  then petitions the attorney general. It takes another 10 days. Then it  becomes legally permissible.   This says the transfer can take place for 25 days after that. So  there is no way that this doesn't take care of the problem that Mr.  Collins raised, and then some.   The current procedures in place do not take into account the longer  waiting period in the petition process that H.R. 1112 requires. This  amendment more than takes care of that. It is a salutary amendment. It  makes the system work, and I can't understand anybody, whether they  support the bill or not, who wouldn't want to support this, so I  support the amendment.
