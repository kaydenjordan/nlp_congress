 Mr. Speaker, if we lose the Second Amendment, then the  First will fall. I want to remind my colleagues of a simple fact that  is far too often swept under the rug by the left. Americans have a  right to obtain a firearm for lawful purposes.   I will say it again louder for those on the left, sleeping in the  back. Americans have a right to obtain firearms. This is my right. And,  Mr. Speaker, this is your right. But let me be clear to everyone in  this Chamber: You will not take this right away from us.   I know it is easy to be sucked into the D.C. bubble, but outside of  here, in real America, when we say, ``Come and take it,'' we damn well  mean it.    This bill would unconstitutionally place the burden of proof for  firearms purchases and transfers on American citizens instead of  placing the burden firmly where it belongs, on the shoulders of the  government.   But let us be clear. The left is not here today to debate this bill,  nor are they here to legislate in the best interests of the American  people. They are here to shove it down our throats. My colleagues and I  on the right have been called here to defend one of our most  [[Page H1305]]  sacred rights because you, Mr. Speaker, think that the Constitution is  just another piece of paper to tear down the middle of and toss aside.   I speak for millions of Americans. I specifically speak for 700,000- plus Americans in my district when I say that if you think this  bastardization of the Constitution will be met with silence, then you  know nothing of the America I know. You want my guns; I know it. We all  know it. Well, Mr. Speaker, you can come and take them.
