 Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize two brave police  officers in my district for their outstanding actions and bravery.   Sergeant Matthew Christopher Webb and Corporal William Gianakopolous  exemplify the best of our Nation.   Webb and Gianakopolous responded to a house fire and an armed man  following a woman during the very same shift.   At 1 a.m. on July 6, Webb and Gianakopolous helped evacuate residents  and a family pet from a fire where they bravely went into the burning  structure several times.   Then at 5 a.m. on the same day, they responded to a call of a man  following a woman where the officers found him hiding with two knives  in his possession.   Mr. Speaker, Officers Webb and Gianakopolous, exemplify courage,  commitment and honor that our Nation, State, and south Jersey deserve,  and we thank them for their heroism.   The virtue and integrity of the majority of our hard-working men and  women in blue cannot go unnoticed, especially in these trying times.   William and Matthew, thank you. May God bless you and God bless  America.                            ____________________
