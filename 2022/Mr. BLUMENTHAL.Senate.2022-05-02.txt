 Mr. President, as a member of the Senate Armed  Services Committee, I would like to recognize an outstanding public  servant, Mr. Ralph White, who has dedicated his career to providing  bidders for government contracts with an inexpensive and expeditious  means to seek accountability within the government contracting process.  Mr. White will retire on May 29, 2022, after a distinguished, 39-year  career in public service, including serving 33 years at the Government  Accountability Office--GAO--where he is currently a managing associate  general counsel for the procurement law division.   As a Senate staffer during the beginning of his career, Mr. White was  instrumental in the drafting of the Competition in Contracting Act of  1984, which establishes statutory authority for GAO's bid protest  function, under which thousands of bid protests are filed each year.  Since joining GAO in 1989, Mr. White handled bid protests as a writing  attorney/hearing officer, as an assistant general counsel leading a  team of GAO attorneys, and since early 2010, as a managing associate  general counsel leading GAO's bid protest forum. Since becoming a  managing associate general counsel, Mr. White has successfully led  GAO's procurement law division through numerous large and complicated  bid protests and has been recognized by the government contracting  community as a preeminent legal mind in this field. In recognition of  this expertise and knowledge, he is regularly sought out to speak and  provide insights into the bid protest process throughout the  government, academia, and industry. Throughout his tenure, Mr. White  has managed the resolution of protests that have touched upon nearly  every aspect of federal procurement spending. In addition, Mr. White  has received numerous awards during his GAO career, including GAO's  Distinguished Service award in 2013 and the General Counsel's Award in  March 2010 for outstanding leadership on several initiatives relating  to GAO's bid protest process, as well as contributions to many  significant bid protest decisions.   Thanks to the dedication and expertise of Mr. White, our government  contracting process provides bidders with an inexpensive and  expeditious means to report violations of procurement law and  regulation, to the benefit of all that value transparency,  accountability, and functionality in government.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I rise to recognize Mr.  John James Lenehan, Jr., a remarkable man and Korean war veteran who  graduates from college on May 21, 2022, at the age of 88.   The son of Irish immigrants, Mr. Lenehan was born on April 5, 1934.  He was raised alongside his four siblings in a one-bedroom apartment in  Queens. Upon graduating from high school, Mr. Lenehan was drafted into  the U.S. Army, serving at Fort Dix. Thanks to the GI Bill, he was able  to pursue his dream of higher education and enrolled at Fordham  University. Mr. Lenehan took night classes while working at KLM  Airlines, where he met his future wife, Lillian. When KLM transferred  Mr. Lenehan to the Houston office, the couple moved to Texas the day  after their wedding, and Mr. Lenehan had to pause his studies.   The Lenehan family lived in Wallingford, CT, for 6 years. While  there, Mr. Lenehan began working for Xerox, where he quickly gained  recognition for his determination. During this time, he took several  classes at Sacred Heart University and Yale University, but never had a  sufficient chance to complete his degree. He eventually retired in  1991, only to start a new company with his wife before long. Mr.  Lenehan retired a second time, moving with Mrs. Lenehan to a cottage in  the west of Ireland.   Last spring, Mr. Lenehan decided he wanted to make the time to obtain  his college degree, so he wrote to the president of Fordham University,  requesting the opportunity to finish his studies nearly 70 years after  he began. The university accepted him, and this month, Mr. Lenehan will  achieve his dream of completing his undergraduate education. He will be  Fordham University's oldest ever graduate when he receives his diploma  on May 21, 2022.   Mr. Lenehan's lifelong commitment to pursuing his studies and  supporting his family will be an enduring legacy. He and his wife  instilled a love of learning in their children that they in turn have  passed on to their own children. I now join his 6 children and 13  grandchildren in saluting Mr. Lenehan. I applaud his many  accomplishments and hope my colleagues will join me in congratulating  Mr. John Lenehan, Jr., on this milestone of his graduation.                            ____________________
