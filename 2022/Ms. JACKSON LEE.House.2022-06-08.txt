 Madam Speaker, no 9-year-old should be sentenced to  a death sentence. No grandmother shopping at a grocery store should get  a death sentence. No mother who testified today should lose her son.   Vicious gun violence that has no rhyme and no reason. Yes, I am  excited about this historic moment. H.R. 7910, the Protecting Our Kids  Act, is, in fact, a solution to horrible and vicious problems.   It is clear, as I stand next to the children, they should not have  died. As I stand next to those from Buffalo, they should not have died.  As we know about those who were seeking medical care in Tulsa, they  should not have died.   I have no problem with saying that we build on this, and as Ronald  Reagan said to us, he at the time saw no reason for an AK-47 to be used  for hunting or defending one's home.   Dr. Guerrero, a pediatrician, said that he raced to the hospital, and  as he raced to the hospital, he found parents outside yelling  children's names in desperation, sobbing as they begged for news of  their related children. Or the mother who ran barefoot all the way to  Robb Elementary School, begging and crying for a child. Or Miah, who  had the wherewithal to watch as her teacher was shot dead, she marked  herself with blood because she was attempting to save her life.   These children, these Americans, our loved ones, this should not  happen again. So, this bill that has a package of storage bills, that  has a package of munitions, that deals with the age, deals with a  number of items, trafficking, ghost guns, bump stocks, this is a way to  go.                                time  1500    I hope, as we go in the future, we are not afraid of a 7-day waiting  period or an assault weapon ban. This is the way to go.    Madam Speaker, this is the way to go.   I thank Chairman Thompson and Chairman Nadler.   This is the way to go. Should they be given a death sentence? Where  is the responsible gun owner that can stand with me and declare that  they should live? You are out there.    Madam Speaker, we need humanity and courage.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7910, the ``Protecting Our  Kids Act.''   Our country is experiencing a crisis of gun violence. It is critical  that Congress act now to protect our children and our communities by  supporting H.R. 7910. This multifaceted legislation is a combination of  humanity, courage, decency, and action.   I traveled to Uvalde and listened to the grieving parents and  families of children and teachers slaughtered at Robb Elementary. We  can no longer standby idly as our children suffer such life-changing  trauma.   As I stand here today, I am reminded of the immortal words of the  conscience of Congress, Representative John Lewis, following the 2016  Pulse Nightclub massacre. He said:   ``This is the fight. It is not an opinion. We must remove the  blinders, the time for silence and patience is long gone.''   He asked--``Where is the heart of this body? Where is our soul? Where  is our moral leadership? Where is our courage?''   Far too many have died by gunfire since Representative Lewis asked,  ``Are we blind?'' I ask this body today: Where is our courage? Are we  still blind to this horror? What will it take for us to act?   As a Texan, I understand how deeply guns are embedded in our culture.  Though, I equally understand how our children are impacted by the  presence of guns in our communities.   My heart was touched by Kimberly Vaughan, a 14-year-old student, was  the youngest victim to die along with eight schoolmates and two  teachers, at Santa Fe High School in Texas in 2018. The shooter gained  access to his father's shotgun and pistol, kept in a closet, to carry  out the murders.   To commemorate Kimberly Vaughan, I introduced a provision of H.R.  7910 that expands the requires safe firearm storage devices to be made  available at the point of sale--for both rifles and shotguns--which  will train new gun owners on the value of safe storage and remind  seasoned gun owners that safe storage goes hand-in-hand with  responsible gun ownership.   There are now more guns held legally and illegally in the U.S. than  there are people. While gun violence touches every corner of America,  Texas has suffered some of the deadliest mass shootings in history.   Despite the escalating gun violence statistics, which have left  innumerable families and communities broken and afraid, Congress has  still failed to act.   Instead, lawmakers in several states, including in my state of Texas,  have reconvened after mass shootings to soften gun laws, most notably,  passing permit-less carry legislation.   I have been dismayed by those who repeatedly offer thoughts and  prayers, then fail to act. Our top priority as lawmakers should be  protecting our communities. Yet, we have relinquished that duty through  inaction.   Now is the time for action. We cannot wait any longer. I call upon  each of my colleagues, on both the right and left, to muster your  courage and join me in support of H.R. 7910--life-saving legislation,  which represents the hard work of so many dedicated members of  Congress.   I thank House Judiciary Committee Chairman Nadler and Representative  Mike Thompson, Chair of the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, for  working with me on this bill and recognizing the urgency and necessity  of bringing it to the floor.    Madam Speaker, I could not sit idly by to hear the  abuse of the Second Amendment that Judge Scalia would not recognize;  and that is, that there are no restrictions.    I believe Judge Scalia would look at these dead babies and realize  that the Constitution and the Second Amendment that is protected,  untouched, would ask you the question, is there no sense of  responsibility to be able to provide restrictions to save lives?   How dare you suggest that we cannot provide the kind of laws in  Protecting Our Kids Act that provides the incentives and guidelines to  save lives?   Ask the mothers and fathers of these babies. The Second Amendment is  not absolute. It does allow restrictions; just as President Reagan  said: He sees no reason for an AK-47, at that time, to be used for  sport or to be used for anything else.   Support our babies and vote for this act. Where is your  responsibility and courage?    Mr. Speaker, I come tonight to pay tribute to the  Wheeler Avenue Baptist Church in Houston, Texas, celebrating its 60th  anniversary--its diamond anniversary--and to thank the senior pastor,  Dr. Marcus Cosby, and, of course, the pastor emeritus, the world  renowned Rev. Dr. William A. Lawson.   The leadership of Pastor Cosby is founded in his own spiritual  grounding and as well his commitment, dedication, and respect for  Pastor Lawson and his family.   It is an interesting church now called the cathedral, and it is a  place where people can come for refuge. It is a place of intellect and  genius because of its many members of great talent.   But, oh, they are the Good Samaritans. They are reminded as a church  body that it is their goal and their responsibility to feed the hungry  and those without clothes, those who need housing, and as well to open  its doors to civic participation.   This is a place that was founded by Pastor Lawson and his wife, the  late Audrey Lawson, in their living room 60 years ago as Pastor Lawson  was, in fact, being the Pastor for TSU's, Texas Southern University,  students.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Wheeler Avenue Baptist Church because  they are a church of action, service, and love of God. Bless them for  their 60th anniversary.                            ____________________
