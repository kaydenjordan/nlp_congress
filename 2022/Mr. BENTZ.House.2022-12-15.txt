 Madam Speaker, let me ask this question: Will the United  States be the better for adding Puerto Rico as a State?   The answer is perhaps.   The answer also is that we need to address the issue, and we need to  address the issue correctly.   I had the privilege of sitting through a discussion of this bill 6  months ago. I was surprised when it abruptly appeared this morning,  because back then I pointed out that as a practicing attorney, I have  had many occasions to put together large business deals, and we used  incredible care to bring those deals together.   Yet, when I see something that is dealing with not only the 3.2  million people in Puerto Rico but also the 340 million people in the  United States being treated with such a cavalier nature, then I have to  ask:   Why do such a disservice not only to the United States but also  Puerto Rico?   I asked that question in committee.   The bill fails to talk about and address U.S. sovereignty, U.S.  elections, government benefits, taxation, immigration, and a myriad of  other important issues, all of which need to be addressed. This is not  to suggest that Puerto Rico at some point shouldn't be a State.   The question is: How do we go about doing it?   Because if we are going to add two more Senators and a number of  other Representatives, if we are going to upset the structure of our  Nation with this addition, then why aren't we doing the proper study to  get it right?   Because there is no reason for us to jump into something like this  and upset the rest of our Nation.   Why would we do such a thing?   It makes no sense.   I was sad to see this bill appear here today because I don't like  getting up and talking this aggressively about hard work that has been  done by the people of Puerto Rico and my good friends in the  delegation. But the truth has to be called out. If we are going to add  another State to this Nation, then let's do it right.
