 Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, today I rise to honor the memory of a great  man who had a profound impact on our local community. Mr. Donald Louis  Crutch was a father, husband, Rotarian, and dedicated member of the  community.   His wife, Lisa, was his high school sweetheart and together they  raised four great children: Tiara, Dontai, Taniyah, and DaVontai, and  he leaves behind a large and loving family of cousins, nephews, nieces,  uncles, aunts, and friends. His contributions will be forever  remembered.   He was the founder of two nonprofit organizations: the National Pink  Tie Organization, and the Honor Guards of America. You could always  find Don wearing a hot pink shirt in support of those battling cancer,  and he would never accept less than six lemons in his ice tea.   It was these little things like his megawatt smile and warm handshake  that made him a pillar of our community.   While we miss Don greatly, his legacy will live on.                            ____________________
