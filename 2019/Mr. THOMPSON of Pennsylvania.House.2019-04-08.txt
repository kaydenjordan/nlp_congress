 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on  the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order  that a quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, April is Invasive Plant  Pest and Disease Awareness Month. These species, commonly known as  hungry pests, begin to emerge in the warmer months and can be spread  easily by the public.   They attack trees, plants, and agriculture products, and it costs the  United States nearly $40 billion each year in damages and extermination  efforts. The transfer of these invasive species hurts our American  farmers and contributes to the destruction of forests and public lands.   In Pennsylvania the spotted lanternfly is a threat to apples, grapes,  peaches, stone fruits, and various tree species--specially hardwoods-- throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.   Pests can be spread by human activities like moving into a new home,  traveling in the U.S. or internationally, mailing plants and food, and  moving untreated firewood. The USDA offers a free checklist for those  moving into a new household that would help reduce the risk of  spreading hungry pests into their new home.   Mr. Speaker, it is important to be mindful of these risks and utilize  the great resources available to reduce the spread of invasive species.                            ____________________
