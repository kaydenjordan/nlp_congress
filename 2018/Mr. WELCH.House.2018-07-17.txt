 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, Lake Champlain is one of the natural wonders  of New England and, indeed, an international treasure. It is a  watershed that includes New York, Vermont, and the Province of Quebec.   To protect this unique natural and economic resource, Congress  enacted legislation in 1990 under the bipartisan leadership of Democrat  Patrick Leahy and Republican Jim Jeffords that led to the creation of  the Lake Champlain Basin Program.   Over the years, the basin program has worked with private  organizations, local communities, and individuals on both sides of the  border to coordinate and fund efforts that benefit the Lake Champlain  Basin's water quality, fisheries, wetlands, and wildlife recreation. It  has been a great example of a locally driven program working from the  ground up with the help of a Federal partner.   It has been a tremendous success, and the purpose of this amendment  is to maintain the funding at the level that it was at before. I have  joined 28 years later after Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy and  Republican Jim Jeffords with my Republican colleague from across the  lake, Representative Stefanik, in this amendment. It is important to  both sides of the lake and the Province of Quebec, who is not here  represented, but here in heart.   So I ask for the support of this amendment, and I want to say to my  colleague, Elise Stefanik, from across Lake Champlain, that we think  the view of New York is beautiful, and we share a commitment to  maintaining the beauty of that lake.   Mr. Chair, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman  from New York (Ms. Stefanik).    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman as a good partner, as  well, and I thank Mr. Calvert for his consideration.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, across the country, an invasive beetle known  as the emerald ash borer has been wreaking havoc on ash trees. It was  first discovered in 2002 in Michigan, but since then, it has spread to  33 States, killing millions of trees, inflicting severe harm on the  forest products industry, and costing municipalities and property  owners millions of dollars.                                time  2245    Ash trees infested with the emerald ash borer suffer nearly 100  percent fatality rates over a 3- to 5-year period. At this point, there  is no known effective treatment.   Earlier this year, the emerald ash borer was discovered in Vermont.  While the discovery was not a surprise, the news is devastating.   Forests are a central part of our economy, our landscape, and our way  of life. It is going to be difficult to eradicate the pest, but there  are steps we can take to contain its spread.   Mr. Chairman, I thank the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Carter, and  Ms. McCollum for acknowledging the threat this invasive species poses.   The report language accompanying the bill recommends a $19.5 million  increase to forest health management under the State and private  forestry account for addressing high-priority invasive species, pests,  and diseases, including the emerald ash borer. I support that increase.   My amendment specifies that, of this amendment, at least $5 million  should be used to help mitigate the spread of and eradicate the emerald  ash borer.   Ultimately, a successful response will require a strong partnership  between Federal, State, and private sector stakeholders. This amendment  is a good first step to ensure the Federal Government is doing its  part.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Carter, I thank Ms. McCollum,  and I thank the Appropriations Committee for their support, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
