 Mr. Speaker, is this institution broken or has our  leadership fled the field?   This rule will deprive the House of having a debate on the Dreamers.  Eighty-two percent of the American people think these innocent kids who  came here should be given legal status.   The leadership has refused to allow us to debate. With the help of  Mr. Denham, in a courageous display of independence, he has a discharge  petition, the last remaining tool for a majority of this House to say  to leadership: Give us a vote. Let us debate.   But in an act of extraordinary irresponsibility--and I would say  cowardice--the leadership is quelling, crushing, and incinerating the  last vestige of independence in their own party.   This rule takes away from the House that tool to rise up and say: We  are ready to work for the American people and give legal status to the  Dreamers.   That is a disgrace. That is a reason why, if we care about ourselves  as an  [[Page H5378]]  institution responsible to the people who elected us, we will assert  our insistence that we vote. Vote ``no'' on this.
