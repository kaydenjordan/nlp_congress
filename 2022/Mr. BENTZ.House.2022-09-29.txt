 Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article titled,  ``Lina Khan's Unfair and Deceptive Approach to Antitrust.''              [From U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Sept. 20, 2022]           Lina Khan's Unfair and Deceptive Approach to Antitrust                             (By Sean Heather)         In a recent speech at Fordham University, Federal Trade       Commissioner (FTC) Chair Lina Khan outlined an aggressive new       approach to the agency's competition policy. Under her       leadership, she explained, the FTC will interpret ``unfair       methods of competition'' broadly, block mergers that could       reflect an ``incipient'' trend toward monopoly, reject       efficiency defenses, and contend that ``conglomerates'' harm       consumers, irrespective of economic evidence. In Khan's view,       her agenda is ``fundamentally conservative'' because it shows       ``respect for the rule of law'' as reflected in congressional       intent.        Khan's speech hearkens back to George Orwell's Ministry of       Truth, where words apparently lose all meaning. Khan's agenda       rejects the rule of law in favor of a progressive policy       agenda that grants the government total discretion to       challenge any merger for any reason whatsoever, ignoring       basic economics, history, and decades of precedent from the       Supreme Court.        Most troubling is the fact that Khan's agenda would allow       the agency to challenge any private conduct that conflicts       with progressive notions of fairness. Section 5 of the FTC       Act directs the agency to combat ``unfair methods of       competition.'' Historically, the agency has tied this       authority to what's in the consumers' economic interest,       which hews closely to the other main antitrust statutes,       namely the Sherman Act and Clayton Act. As a result, the FTC       provided Section 5 with context, guardrails, and       predictability, which are all integral to the rule of law.        Under the FTC's new leadership, however, anything goes. The       FTC's new strategic plan condemns ``unwarranted health,       safety, and privacy risks'' and seeks ``equity for       historically underserved communities.'' These issues, while       important, lie far outside the FTC's statutory authority or       competence. Yet under Chair Khan's reading of Section 5, the       FTC can do whatever it pleases. Without guardrails, for       example, the FTC could condemn as ``unfair'' a merger that       would result in job losses even if that merger would lower       costs and lead to lower prices for consumers. Congress never       envisioned the FTC to serve as the morality police over the       market.                            Cherry-picking History         In fact, the last time the FTC embarked on a path of       overreach of this scope was the 1970s. As a result, the       Washington Post editorial board labeled the agency the       ``National Nanny'' and Congress nearly eliminated the agency       altogether. Similarly, Chair Khan's approach conveniently       sidesteps this period of tremendous overreach and willfully       ignores the succeeding decades of precedent and economic       learning. According to her, the amendments to Section 7 of       the Clayton Act show that Congress was concerned with any       trend toward mergers and that, therefore, the agencies and       courts erred in accounting for the possibility that a merger       might increase efficiency. Khan points to Supreme Court cases       from the 1960s to support her position and, in fairness, she       is correct that in an earlier time in our history mergers       were reflexively viewed more skeptically--but that was prior       to now decades of reliance on sound economic analysis that       accompanies merger review.        Chair Khan, however, seeks to divorce economic analysis       from antitrust law. In those intervening decades, economists       came to understand that relatively few mergers actually       threaten competition, whereas most mergers, particularly       vertical mergers, have pro-competitive benefits such as       improved capital flows and greater efficiency. Across       political administrations, the antitrust agencies tailored       their enforcement activities to target those mergers that       posed a genuine risk to competition. Consistent with economic       learning and experience, the Supreme Court interpreted the       antitrust laws more permissively to allow the private sector       more freedom to operate.        By returning to the worldview prevalent in the 1960s, Chair       Khan's FTC would seriously damage the economy's dynamism. By       blocking mergers that increase concentration only slightly,       the FTC would prevent startups from obtaining the capital and       technical expertise that they need to grow and thrive. By       replacing Section 5's guardrails with amorphous standards       subject to the shifting winds of politics, the FTC would       eliminate the certainty and predictability that businesses       need to plan and invest. And by barring use of the efficiency       defense, the FTC would force companies to incur more costs to       produce the same products--costs that would be passed along       to consumers.     Mr. Speaker, I support title II of this bill, and,  actually, I would vote for it if it was set up as a separate bill as it  once was.   I would not support title III.   The real issue is title I and the $1.4 billion that it would provide  to the Department of Justice and the FTC.   The assertion is that it would not or is not supported by the record.  Let me explain, however, what has not happened that should have in  order to make this $1.5 billion supportable. And what hasn't happened  is we have not had Chairwoman Lina Khan appear before us in our  Committee on the Judiciary. It seems odd that we wouldn't find out how  this money is going to be spent before we allocate it to the purposes  reflected in the Record.   Let me just read from a recent speech at Fordham University:   ``Chair Lina Khan outlined an aggressive new approach to the agency's  competition policy. Under her leadership, she explained, the FTC will  interpret `unfair methods of competition' broadly, block mergers that  could reflect an `incipient' trend toward monopoly, reject efficiency  defenses, and contend that `conglomerates' harm consumers, irrespective  of economic evidence. In Khan's view, her agenda is `fundamentally  conservative' because it shows respect for the rule of law as reflected  in congressional intent.''   To quote the U.S. Chamber of Commerce: ``Khan's speech hearkens back  to George Orwell's `Ministry of Truth,' where words apparently lose all  meaning. Khan's agenda rejects the rule of law in favor of a  progressive policy agenda that grants the government total discretion  to challenge any merger for any reason whatsoever, ignoring  [[Page H8262]]  basic economics, history, and decades of precedent from the Supreme  Court. Most troubling is the fact that Khan's agenda would allow the  agency to challenge any private conduct that conflicts with progressive  notions of fairness. Section 5 of the FTC Act directs the agency to  combat `unfair methods of competition.' Historically, the agency has  tied this authority to what is in the consumers' economic interest,  which hews closely to the other main antitrust statutes, namely the  Sherman and Clayton Act. As a result, the FTC provided Section 5 with  context, guardrails, and predictability, which are all integral to the  rule of law.   Why didn't we have Chairwoman Khan appear before us and explain why  she wants to vary so dramatically from what has been the law for the  past 30 years.   ``Under the FTC's new leadership, however, anything goes. The FTC's  new strategic plan condemns `unwarranted health, safety, and privacy  risks,' and seeks `equity for historically underserved communities.'  These issues, while important, lie far outside the FTC's statutory  authority or competence. Yet under Chair Khan's reading of Section 5,  the FTC can do whatever it pleases. Without guardrails, for example,  the FTC could condemn as `unfair' a merger that would result in job  losses even if that merger would lower costs and lead to lower prices  for consumers.''   Mr. Speaker, this is a bill whose time is not right. We don't know  how the money is going to be spent, and I urge a ``no'' vote.
