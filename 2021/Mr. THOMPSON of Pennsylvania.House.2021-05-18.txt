 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor  Ely Blaisdell of South Fork, Pennsylvania. Ely has accepted a fully  qualified appointment to the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy in New York.   Ely is a senior at Bishop Carroll Catholic High School. He has two  siblings, Eban and Margaret. He is the son of Michael and Karen  Blaisdell. He is the grandson of the late Herbert and Carolyn Kessler  and Eva Stahr-Kessler, all of Johnstown; and Margaret and the late Mark  Blaisdell of Wilmore, Pennsylvania.   Ely is following in the footsteps of two of his uncles, Dan Kessler  and Paul Kessler, who graduated from the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy  in 1979 and 1975, respectively.   Madam Speaker, Ely Blaisdell is a dedicated member of his community.  His passion for service and his commitment to his education will serve  him well as he heads to Kings Point, New York.   Good luck to him as he enters this next chapter of his life, and I  thank him for his service to our country.                            ____________________
