 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the American  Grown Flower and Foliage Month resolution. This resolution is  cosponsored by Senator Padilla and Senator Sullivan, and I want to  thank them for joining me in introducing this resolution.   This resolution designates July 2021 as ``American Grown Flower and  Foliage Month'' and recognizes the important contributions of all those  involved in the flower and foliage industry make to our Nation, and  also notes the long history that flowers have in our Nation and  society.   Every year, thousands of households in the United States purchase  fresh cut flowers and foliage from more than 16,000 florists and floral  establishments. American consumers spend $35 billion per year on floral  products each year.   California is the cut flower capital of the United States, producing  nearly 75 percent of American-grown flowers. While the majority of  Americans would prefer to buy locally grown flowers, only 20 percent of  the flowers sold in the United States are grown domestically.   Flowers are used for all types of occasions. They help us celebrate  major life events, and help us to mourn. The flower and foliage  industry is also a major employer in the United States. This industry  supports hundreds of growers, thousands of small businesses, and tens  of thousands of jobs in the United States.   Our resolution encourages consumers to look for the `Certified  American Grown' label to support local farmers this month and  throughout the year. If consumers are able to differentiate between  American-grown flowers and those that have been imported, many would  choose to purchase U.S.-grown flowers and support the U.S. industry.   This resolution is an important way to recognize a major part of the  agricultural industry in the United States, and I encourage my  colleagues to move to pass this resolution to commemorate this  important month as ``American Grown Flower and Foliage Month.''   Thank you Mr. President. I yield the Floor.                            ____________________
