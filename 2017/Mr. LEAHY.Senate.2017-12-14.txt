 Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Connecticut  for his words. The Senator from Connecticut is a former prosecutor who  knows law enforcement backward and forward. I can only imagine the  grief felt in his State. As a neighboring New England State, I recall  the vigils, the  [[Page S8022]]  people coming to pray, and the sadness from what happened in our  neighboring State of Connecticut. But as so many have said, we can  express grief--and we should--but we have to do what the Senator from  Connecticut and others have suggested, which is actually take some  steps that might stop these things. So I applaud him for what he said.   Let me speak on another issue. This week, we voted on three circuit  court nominees, just one step below the Supreme Court. All three of  these nominees are extreme. One is objectively unqualified. The fact  that we are so quickly casting floor votes on these troubling  nominations, all of whom were reported out of the Judiciary Committee  just last week, is a symptom of the Republicans' willingness to abandon  decades of Senate tradition so that this body can serve as a  rubberstamp for President Trump's nominees. The Senate will not be the  conscience of the Nation or the check and balance it was always  designed to be, but instead, a rubberstamp for the President.   Let me just cover a couple of things. Don Willett is a sitting  justice on the Texas Supreme Court. That should mean something. Sitting  judges have an obligation to exercise good judgment; to not say  anything that would lead individuals to question their impartiality. A  question I ask nominees all the time is: Can someone who comes into  your court--whether they are Republican or Democrat, plaintiff,  defendant, rich, poor, whatever--look at you and say: Well, at least  this judge is going to show impartiality. Maybe I will win or maybe I  will lose, but it will not be because the judge wasn't impartial. When  you look at this sitting justice, Don Willett, he fails the standard of  impartiality.   A few weeks ago, I questioned him about his tweet telling a young  transgender woman, who was interested in playing softball to ``Go away,  A-Rod.'' Justice Willett claimed that this tweet was in jest. But, let  me say it again--a sitting justice telling a transgender teen to ``go  away'' sends an unmistakable message to marginalized, vulnerable  communities: Not all are welcome in my courtroom. Well, that is not a  laughing matter.   This was not the first time that Justice Willett has worn his bias on  his sleeve. As an aide to George W. Bush while he was Governor of  Texas, he objected to then-Governor Bush declaring a ``Business Women's  Week.'' He opposed the proclamation's mention of ``glass ceilings, pay  equity . . . [and] sexual discrimination/harassment.'' He dismissed  these very real barriers to women in the workforce as ``hype.'' For  these and other reasons, I seriously question his judgment or that he  would be seen by people coming into his courtroom as impartial.   Then we have James Ho, who is another troubling nominee. His views on  social issues are, not surprisingly, extreme. He has even offered  effusive praise for Jeff Mateer, another Trump nominee who has publicly  proclaimed that transgender children are part of ``Satan's plan.'' Even  as a judge, he has complained about the Supreme Court. Remember, these  judges are supposed to follow the precedent of the Supreme Court. He  has complained about the Supreme Court's Obergefell decision. He said  that it is going to lead to ``people marrying their pets.'' I don't  think any legal scholar anywhere from the right to the left would agree  with that interpretation. Mr. Ho praised Mateer for ``protecting and  enforcing the . . . civil liberties of every Texan.'' Well, it is not  every Texan--just those he agrees with.   Of course, this race to confirm Mr. Ho that is zipping through here  means that we will not have fully vetted him for this lifetime  appointment. When he served in the Justice Department's Office of Legal  Counsel, he authored a memorandum that was cited in one of the shameful  ``torture memos.'' These torture memos have turned out to be a blot on  the conscience of the United States. Mr. Ho has refused to answer  questions about his involvement, despite the fact that the torture  memos are now very much in the public domain. Unfortunately, these  kinds of non-answers are considered sufficient as of late, since  Republicans are more interested in rubberstamping President Trump's  judicial nominees than asking serious questions of them as a coequal  branch of government. I cannot believe that any Republican leadership  would allow a nominee of a Democrat who would have been involved in the  drafting of a key and controversial memorandum to be confirmed unless  they are willing to answer questions about it.   Then we have Steven Grasz, whom the American Bar Association  unanimously rated him as unqualified for the Federal bench. In the past  40 years, I recall seeing a unanimously unqualified rating only a few  times, and those people never made it through. After an exhaustive  review including more than 200 interviews about Mr. Grasz, the ABA  concluded he could not separate his personal beliefs from his duties as  a judge--a fundamental obligation of a judge. This is almost  unprecedented to have a rating like this.   To have at least a qualified rating from the ABA is a basic  qualification for a nominee to the Federal bench. Certainly,  Republicans would insist on it if it was a Democrat's nominee. The  Republicans made it very clear that if a Democrat nominated somebody  who got a ``not qualified'' rating--I don't recall it happening, but if  they did--they made it very clear that person would never be  considered. Well, here is somebody who is declared ``not qualified,''  and yet they whipped him through. You would think ``qualified'' would  at least be the bottom line for a nomination. You would think whoever  is President, they are at least nominating somebody who could hit the  threshold of being considered qualified.    Republicans are now casting aside the ABA as a biased institution;  some have accused the ABA of opposing Mr. Grasz simply because of his  opposition to abortion. Well, that is absurd. The ABA has rated 46 of  President Trump's 50 nominees as ``qualified.'' Let's not delude  ourselves, does anyone think that any of the 46 Trump nominees that the  ABA rated as qualified support abortion rights? They would never get  out of the White House if they did. So that argument--like so many  others used to support these extreme nominees--does not pass the laugh  test.   As the longest serving member of the United States Senate and a  former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I have spoken up about the  steady erosion of the Committee's norms and traditions. The Committee  has processed un-vetted, extreme nominees at an unprecedented rate.  President Trump will have four times as many circuit court nominees  confirmed in his first year than did President Obama. The reason  President Trump has four times as many circuit court nominees confirmed  in his first year than did President Obama is because Republicans  removed any and all guardrails on our confirmation process--the  guardrails they insisted on when there was a Democratic President. No  matter how careful the Democratic President was in picking that person,  they had to have these guardrails. I thought, actually, the guardrails  made sense.   The second you have a President who nominates extreme judges, they  decided we don't need those guardrails anymore because President Trump  would never make a mistake. Nominees have had hearings scheduled before  we even had the ABA ratings. Multiple circuit court nominees are  regularly stacked on single panels. That is something Republicans  insisted should not be done when there was a Democratic President. Now,  unfortunately, the chairman--who is a friend of mine and a man I  respect--has reversed his own blue-slip policy. He has begun to advance  nominees without favorable blue strips from both home State Senators.  That is the first time this has been done in the last two Presidents.   I fear we are doing lasting damage to our nomination process. I fear  we are making the advice and consent process a completely laughable  exercise. The three nominees who are set forth this week are evidence  of that.   I am going to vote no on each of them because they are not qualified.  I have voted for many Republican nominees. I might disagree with them  philosophically, but they were qualified, just as I voted for many  Democratic nominees. Some I disagreed with, but they were qualified.  These nominees aren't qualified. They are extreme. I want the standard  I always asked for; that whoever you are, when you come into a  courtroom, you can look at the  [[Page S8023]]  judge and say: OK, whether I am a plaintiff or defendant, rich or poor,  facing the State as the respondent, no matter my political background,  I am going to be treated fairly. I will win or lose my case on the  merits, not on the judge's bias.   We are closing our door to that. We are closing our door to it when  the President of the United States turns the selection process over to  an extreme political, partisan group and then asks Republicans to  rubberstamp it. I respect my Republican colleagues, but I can't imagine  many of them ever standing for a Democratic President doing anything  like this. I wouldn't.   I wish they would bring the Senate back to where we should be, where  we can be, and where the country is better off when we are.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Connecticut  for his words.

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, those of us who remember the massacre at El  Mozote, El Salvador, are reminded that last week was the 36th  anniversary of that horrific tragedy.   For those who are not aware, on December 11, 1981, Salvadoran  soldiers, including an elite battalion trained and equipped by the  United States, systematically murdered more than 900 innocent men,  women, and children. The Salvadoran military high command falsely  denied the crimes had occurred, and their denials were echoed by the  U.S. Embassy and the State Department. For more than 35 years, the  perpetrators of the massacre avoided justice, due to the cover-up and  an amnesty law passed in 1993, but in 2016, the Salvadoran Supreme  Court overturned that law and the case was reopened. Let us hope that  those who ordered, participated in, and covered up those crimes against  humanity will finally receive the punishment they deserve.   On December 2, good friend Congressman Jim McGovern traveled to El  Salvador. More than any other Member of Congress, Jim has been a  tireless advocate for human rights and justice in that country. After  returning to Washington, on December 11, Jim spoke about the El Mozote  massacre in the House of Represenatives. I ask unanimous consent that  his remarks be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:           [Five-Minute Special Order, Monday, December 11, 2017]                 36th Anniversary of the El Mozote Massacre                        (By James P. McGovern (MA))         Mr. Speaker, thirty-six years ago, nearly one thousand men,       women and children were murdered by Salvadoran soldiers in El       Mozote, El Salvador. It's considered one of the worst       massacres in modern Latin American history.        On December 2nd, I traveled to El Mozote with a delegation       led by the Washington Office on Latin America. Four hours       after leaving San Salvador, we arrived at El Mozote in the       northern region of Morazan, near the border of Honduras.        Three decades ago, El Mozote included about 20 houses on       open ground around a square. Facing the square was a church       and, behind it, a small building known as ``the convent,''       used by the priest to change into his vestments when       celebrating Mass. Nearby was a small school house.        Our delegation sat in the town square with survivors and       victims of the massacre. We listened to their stories, shared       prayers for their loss and suffering, toured the grounds       where this atrocity took place, and visited memorials the       community built to commemorate and preserve this tragic       history. We also heard from lawyers with Cristosal, a U.S.-      based NGO providing legal aid to the association of victims       and survivors.        On December 10, 1981, the Salvadoran army brigade based in       San Miguel and the Atlacatl Battalion, an elite infantry unit       based in San Salvador, arrived in El Mozote. Over the next       two days, these troops methodically and viciously murdered       the town's residents and those of nearby villages.        On the morning of December 11th, troops assembled the       people in the town square. They separated the men from the       women and children and locked them in separate groups in the       church, the convent, and various houses. According to eye-      witness accounts, they then interrogated, tortured, and       executed the men at several different sites.        Around noon, they began taking the women and girls in       groups, separating them from their children and machine-      gunning them after raping them. Many families were ordered to       remain in their homes while soldiers set fire to the houses.        Over 140 of the children, some mere infants, were jammed       into ``the convent'' next to the church. There, soldiers       blocked the doors, aimed guns through the windows, and fired       into the mass of children, murdering them all in cold blood.       They then threw an incendiary bomb into the building,       collapsing the roof and adobe walls.        I walked with members of the community to the site where       the children were murdered. A garden cultivated in their       memory blooms on the site where they perished. A mural on the       side of the church facing the garden depicts tiny angels       ascending to heaven.        Beneath the mural are plaques with the names and ages of       the children killed so brutally. They range from zero to       sixteen years. Walking on such hallowed ground, I was deeply       moved and outraged by the atrocity that took place there.        In October 1990, the Salvadoran courts opened an       investigation into the El Mozote  [[Page S8044]]       case, and in January 1992, the civil war ended with peace       accords signed between the Salvadoran government and FMLN       guerrillas. In November 1992, the U.N. Truth Commission on El       Salvador supervised exhumations of El Mozote remains by       Argentine forensics experts, confirming that the stories told       by survivors were indeed true. Then, everything was cut short       when the Salvadoran congress passed a sweeping amnesty law in       1993.        However, last year, in July 2016, the Salvadoran Supreme       Court overturned the amnesty law as unconstitutional. And in       October 2016, a judge reopened the El Mozote case and began       taking testimony, which continues today.        There are many reasons why we in Congress should be engaged       in the search for justice in the El Mozote case.        First, in the post-war period, the U.S. has supported a       strong and independent judiciary in El Salvador, capable of       prosecuting corruption and human rights abuses. El Mozote is       viewed as an exemplar case on whether this is possible to       achieve.        Second, in the 1980s, the United States armed, trained and       equipped the Salvadoran armed forces, in particular, the       Army. At El Mozote, U.S. guns and bullets were used to       massacre infants, children, women and men.        Third, the U.S. established and trained the Atlacatl       Battalion. Ostensibly an elite rapid reaction counter-      insurgency force, it was a major actor in the mass murder at       El Mozote; nine years later, the unit also murdered six       Jesuit priests and two women at the University of Central       America in San Salvador.        Finally, at the time of the massacre, the Salvadoran High       Command denied that it had happened. The U.S. embassy and       State Department echoed those denials and denigrated the       Washington Post and New York Times reporters who traveled to       El Mozote and published detailed stories about the massacre.        Mr. Speaker, the U.S. should support the Salvadoran judge       presiding over the El Mozote case and the Attorney General's       Office, including releasing all information in our military       and intelligence files relevant to that period of the civil       war. It would be a significant contribution to ending the       culture of impunity in El Salvador.                            ____________________
