 Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for vote  No. 183 on confirmation of the nomination of A. Marvin Quattlebaum,  Jr., to be a U.S. circuit judge for the Fourth Circuit. Had I been  present, I would have voted yea on confirmation of the nomination, as I  did in the Judiciary Committee.   Further, I was necessarily absent for vote Nos. 184 and 185, relative  to the nomination of Julius Ness Richardson to be a U.S. circuit judge  for the Fourth Circuit. Had I been present, I would have voted yea on  the motion to invoke cloture and yea on confirmation of the nomination,  as I did in the Judiciary Committee.                            ____________________
