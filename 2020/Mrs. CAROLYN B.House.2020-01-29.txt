 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, I thank the  chairwoman for yielding and for being such a leader on this issue and  so many others.   I rise in strong support of H.R. 3621, and I want to thank my  colleague, Ms. Pressley, for her hard work on this bill.   Our credit reporting system is deeply flawed, and it affects millions  of consumers every day. When there is an error on a consumer's credit  report, it can harm their credit for years. Maybe their credit report  says that they didn't pay a bill when they did, or maybe they confused  them with another person.   These kinds of basic errors should be easy to fix, but unfortunately,  they often take years to sort out. And in the meantime, consumers are  being wrongfully denied credit or paying higher rates than they should.   This bill will solve these problems by reforming the dispute process  in order to give consumers more rights and more opportunities to  challenge bad information on their credit reports.   It also helps consumers who have burdensome student loans by removing  negative credit information as soon as they can demonstrate that they  have a history of timely repayment. This is incredibly important.   Finally, I want to thank Chairwoman Waters for her tireless efforts  on this  [[Page H659]]  issue. She has focused on credit reporting for years, and I am very  proud she was able to shepherd so many bills to the floor.   I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill.
