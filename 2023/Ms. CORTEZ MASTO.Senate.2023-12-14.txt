 Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the  life of Harvey James Munford, an exemplary Nevadan that served his  State as an educator and coach for 36 years and as an elected State  assemblyman for over a decade. Mr. Munford peacefully passed away at  the age of 83 on October 26, 2023, at his Las Vegas, NV, home.   Mr. Munford led a remarkable life with many professional and personal  achievements. As the first African American to attend Montana State  University Billings, Mr. Munford showed exceptional courage while  paving the way for other African Americans to follow in his footsteps.  Mr. Munford attended college on a basketball scholarship, but he never  neglected his studies and earned a bachelor's degree in biology and  physical education. He went on to earn a master's degree in political  science and guidance and counseling, also at MSU Billings. In 1994, Mr.  Munford was honored with an induction into the MSU Billings Athletic  Hall of Fame.   Mr. Munford's athletic talent extended far beyond college, as he  played professional basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers and was  drafted for professional football by the Los Angeles Rams. However, Mr.  Munford's passion for education caused him to relocate to Las Vegas,  where he served as an educator for the Clark County School District,  College of Southern Nevada, and University of Nevada, Las Vegas. During  his decades-long career in the Clark County School District, Mr.  Munford had the opportunity to accompany over 200 students to  Washington, DC, to explore the Nation's Capital and experience  firsthand how the Federal Government works.   After officially retiring as an educator, Mr. Munford became a public  servant and was an elected State assemblyman for Clark County District  6, where he served from 2004 to 2016. During his time as a legislator,  Mr. Munford was a passionate civil rights and education advocate. He  helped pass numerous bills, including multicultural education and the  passage of Juneteenth as an official holiday in the State of Nevada. It  is evident Mr. Munford's work in the State assembly was guided by his  desire to have a positive lasting impact on the lives of all Nevadans.   Beyond Mr. Munford's extensive professional achievements, he was a  dedicated family man. Mr. Munford was married to his wife Viviana for  29 years and had five children and stepchildren, in addition to 12  grandchildren and one great-grandchild. Mr. Munford was also a talented  organist and equine trainer, and he enjoyed watching old Western  movies, historical documentaries, and sports.   Mr. Munford was a husband, father, grandfather, educator, civil  servant, civil rights activist, athlete, and Nevadan. Mr. Munford left  a positive lasting impact on the lives of many Nevadans, and I ask my  colleagues to join me in remembering Mr. Munford for his significant  impact in the State. I celebrate Mr. Munford's legacy, and I extend my  deepest condolences to his family and friends.                            ____________________
