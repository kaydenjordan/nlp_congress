 Madam President, I did not vote for Rex Tillerson to be  Secretary of State. Although Mr. Tillerson was a successful corporate  executive, I did not believe that heading the world's largest oil  company was the right resume for the Nation's top diplomat. Mr.  Tillerson is a man of substantial intellect who wanted to do the right  thing, but his record as Secretary of State speaks for itself. He did  not do well, and the country, the State Department, and its employees-- including some of our most experienced diplomats who felt they were no  longer relevant--paid a substantial price.   For that reason, it is imperative that the next Secretary of State  has the qualities and professional track record to restore the  preeminent role that the Department has traditionally played in U.S.  foreign policy.   It is also for that reason that today I intend to vote against the  nomination of CIA Director Mike Pompeo to be Secretary of State.   By all accounts, Mr. Pompeo, like Mr. Tillerson, is a man of  substantial intellect, and my conversations with him have seemed to  confirm that. As we have learned, that alone is not enough to qualify  one for a job that should be filled by someone who has proven that he  or she understands and is skilled in the art of diplomacy and whose  beliefs are consistent with fundamental American values. As the  country's top diplomat, the Secretary of State should be a vocal and  persuasive advocate for diplomacy to avoid conflict and crises.  Unfortunately, I believe Mr. Pompeo's record falls far short.   Mike Pompeo has made no secret of his strong support for President  Trump, whose saber rattling, provocations, and so-called America First  policies would more accurately be described as ``America Alone.'' The  President has called for drastic cuts in the State Department's budget  and personnel that would sharply diminish its role in diplomacy and  development. He would weaken international organizations and alliances  that serve our interests and undermine U.S. global leadership at a time  when China and our other competitors are seeking every opportunity to  expand their global reach. Unlike Secretary of Defense Mattis who, in  response to the White House's proposed cuts, has been a strong advocate  for the State Department's mission and budget, I am not aware that Mr.  Pompeo ever publicly expressed a view either way until his confirmation  hearing.   Mr. Pompeo supported the invasion of Iraq, and he has defended the  use of torture, two of the most profoundly misguided foreign policy  decisions since the Vietnam war. As far as I know, it was not until  this week, when his nomination was in jeopardy, that he said the Iraq  war that he had long defended was a mistake, a mistake that claimed the  lives of thousands of  [[Page S2455]]  American soldiers and sowed chaos in the Middle East. The fact that he  has insisted that waterboarding is not torture and, by implication,  acceptable should by itself be disqualifying for the job of Secretary  of State.   He has supported keeping open the Guantanamo detention facility,  arguing that detainees ``should stay right where they are'' and that  the facility ``is the right place for [detainees] from both a security  and legal perspective.'' That is as wrong as it is disturbing. The  indefinite detention without trial of detainees at Guantanamo  contradicts our most basic principles of justice, degrades our  international standing, and harms our national security. Mr. Pompeo's  position is particularly troubling, given the President's expressed  intent to send new prisoners to Guantanamo for the first time in more  than a decade.   Mr. Pompeo has opposed what he called the ``disastrous'' Iran nuclear  agreement, and he appears to favor withdrawing from it despite the  International Atomic Energy Agency's determination that Iran is in  compliance and support for the agreement from a wide spectrum of  diplomatic, scientific, and national security experts. As far as I am  aware, he has offered no realistic alternative, and the consequence  would be to isolate the United States from our closest allies and to  risk Iran restarting its centrifuges and quickly obtaining a nuclear  weapon.   During the negotiations to halt Iran's nuclear program, Mr. Pompeo  supported military strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities,  reportedly arguing that it would take ``under 2,000 sorties to destroy  the Iranian nuclear capacity,'' which he described as ``not an  insurmountable task for the coalition forces.'' It might not be  insurmountable, except for the fact that it would be the end of the  coalition since few, if any, of our partners would join us. Beyond  that, the unilateral use of preemptive military force on that scale in  a volatile region in which Russia has its own security interests could  ignite a regional war with far-reaching, possibly catastrophic,  consequences.   While the world's scientists overwhelmingly warn of the long-term  dangers of climate change, Mr. Pompeo is an unabashed climate change  sceptic. He has said that the Paris Climate Agreement, which is  supported by practically every country including China, amounted to  ``bowing down to radical environmentalists.'' That is extremist  rhetoric about what many believe to be the most serious challenge  facing our planet, a challenge that can only be met through diplomacy,  and it belies a disturbing intolerance for opposing views.   Mr. Pompeo has accused American Muslim leaders of being ``potentially  complicit'' in acts of terrorism that they do not specifically condemn.  He has said that Muslims ``abhor Christians'' and that they ``will  continue to press against us until we make sure that we pray and stand  and fight and make sure that we know that Jesus Christ is our savior  and is truly the only solution for our world.'' It would be hard to  think of a more effective way to alienate the Muslim community, without  whose help we cannot effectively counter violent extremism.   As a Member of Congress, Mr. Pompeo cosponsored legislation to ban  all refugee admissions, regardless of country of origin, even though  people seeking safety are already subjected to a rigorous vetting  process. It should alarm each of us that the nominee to oversee the  bureau charged with protecting refugees, migrants, and other vulnerable  people uprooted by conflict--a tradition we take pride in--would take  such a crass, ideological approach to our country's refugee admissions  policies.   Mr. Pompeo has suggested that the Federal Government should collect  records of American citizens' communications, without warrants and in  bulk, and combine them with ``publicly available financial and  lifestyle information into a comprehensive, searchable database.''  Think about that, at a time when the public is already outraged by  Facebook's and Cambridge Analytica's misuse of personal data.   As a Member of Congress, Mr. Pompeo criticized President Obama for  going to Cuba, accusing him of making ``unilateral concessions.'' It is  true that the restoration of diplomatic relations with Cuba--which was  overwhelmingly supported by the people of both countries--did not  include an agreement by the Cuban Government to hold free and fair  elections, nor to stop persecuting opponents of the government. No one  who knows Cuba expected that. But if free and fair elections and  respect for human rights are Mr. Pompeo's prerequisite for having an  embassy and an ambassador in a foreign country, we will need to close a  lot more embassies than the one in Havana.   We could begin with our embassies in China and Russia, Saudi Arabia  and Egypt would be next, then Jordan and Morocco, Honduras, Vietnam-- the list goes on. The fact is we need embassies staffed with qualified  personnel, including in countries whose governments we disagree with,  so our diplomats can work to protect our interests and the interests of  Americans who travel, study, work, or serve there. That is diplomacy  101.   Mr. Pompeo opposes LGBT rights and has no record of defending civil  society activists and independent journalists who risk their lives  speaking out against corruption and abuses of human rights by foreign  security forces, particularly in countries we consider friends or  allies. He has also worked against women's reproductive rights,  including cosponsoring radical legislation that would make abortion  illegal nationwide, even in cases of rape. He voted to defund Planned  Parenthood and for the ``global gag rule,'' which prevents foreign  nongovernmental organizations from receiving U.S. funds if they use  their own money to provide safe abortions or even information about  abortion services in their country.   I take no pleasure in opposing Mr. Pompeo's nomination. I wish I  could vote for him, as I am the ranking member of the Appropriations  Subcommittee on the Department of State and Foreign Operations. I  strongly support the State Department, its mission, its personnel, and  its programs. I have consistently defended its budget when others here  or in the White House sought to cut it.   I am pleased that Mr. Pompeo has said he wants to fill the vacant  senior leadership positions at the State Department and that he  recognizes that the United States has a duty to ``lead the calls for  democracy, prosperity, and human rights around the world.'' But his  record in Congress and his staunchly ideological views raise grave  concerns about the policy direction he would give to those senior  leaders. Given his record and beliefs, there is little reason to  believe that he will be an effective or consistent defender of  democracy and human rights abroad, particularly in the face of  President Trump's abandonment of those values and principles.   In many other respects, Mr. Pompeo's testimony before the Foreign  Relations Committee had all the characteristics of a ``confirmation  conversion,'' when he contradicted many of his previous statements and  positions. As Senator Menendez asked, Which Pompeo are we voting for?  The job of Secretary of State is too important, especially with Donald  Trump in the Oval Office, to roll the dice and discount everything Mr.  Pompeo has said in the past.   If Mr. Pompeo is confirmed, as it appears he will be, I will make  every effort to work with him to advance our foreign policy and  national security interests, as I did with Secretary Tillerson after  opposing his nomination, but given the impulsive and reckless  statements and actions of this President and the upheaval at the State  Department during the past year, we need a Secretary with the necessary  temperament, values, and longstanding commitment to diplomacy and  development. I hope he proves me wrong, but today I do not believe we  have that in this nominee.    Madam President, I would like to take a moment to  recognize the life and achievements of Dan Akaka, a veteran, educator,  U.S. Senator, and most importantly, a dear friend of mine. Dan passed  away recently after 93 years of life imbued with the aloha spirit, and  I have been reflecting on his legacy of quiet but effective work in the  Senate.   Dan Akaka was a tireless advocate for indigenous people. As I was  working on the 2013 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act,  his cooperation and persistence as chairman of the Indian Affairs  Committee helped include important provisions to protect Native- American women from violence. He also worked hard to support vital  programs that provided education, healthcare, housing, and other basic  services for Tribes across the country.   A World War II veteran himself, Dan was a strong supporter of the  National Guard. He was one the first cosponsors to support my National  Guard Empowerment Act and give the Guard the representation that it  deserved. He will also be remembered for fighting to have the valor and  sacrifice of Asian-American soldiers in World War II recognized,  sponsoring legislation that awarded long overdue Medals of Honor to  those who had been discriminated against because of their race.   Hawaiians were lucky to have him as a champion in the Senate, and I  was lucky to have him as a friend.   I ask unanimous consent that the New York Times article ``Daniel  Akaka, Former Democratic Senator From Hawaii, Dies At 93'' be printed  in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the New York Times, Apr. 6, 2018]      Daniel Akaka, Former Democratic Senator From Hawaii, Dies at 93                              (By Adam Clymer)         Former Senator Daniel K. Akaka, a Democrat who represented       Hawaii for 36 years in Congress and successfully fought for       the belated recognition of Asians and Asian-Americans who had       fought for the United States in World War II, died on Friday       in Honolulu. He was 93.        Jon Yoshimura, the senator's former communications       director, confirmed the death, saying Mr. Akaka had been       hospitalized for several months, The Associated Press       reported.        A World War II veteran, Mr. Akaka sponsored legislation in       1996 that led to a re-evaluation of the service records of       Asian-Americans who had fought in the 442nd Regimental Combat       Team and the 100th Infantry Battalion during the war.        As a result, almost two dozen Medals of Honor, the       military's highest award, were ultimately bestowed belatedly,       some posthumously, on Asian-American veterans, most of them       of Japanese heritage. Only one had been awarded during the       war itself.        After a White House awards-presentation ceremony led by       President Bill Clinton in 2000, Senator Akaka said the medals       had dispelled apparent wartime discrimination against Asian-      American military personnel.        The most prominent recipient was Senator Daniel K. Inouye,       Mr. Akaka's much better-known colleague--and Hawaii's senior       senator--for 22 years in the Senate. Mr. Inouye, who died in       2012, had lost his right arm while serving with the 442nd in       Europe.        Senator Akaka also successfully pursued legislation that       provided onetime compensation for members of the Phillipine       Scouts, an American-led unit of mostly Filipino and Filipino-      American recruits who fought alongside United States troops       but did not qualify for Veterans Administration benefits.        And he secured a formal apology for the United States's       role in the overthrow of Queen Lili'uokalani of Hawaii in       1893 as well as a transfer of land that the federal       government had taken.        But he failed in repeated legislative efforts to have       native Hawaiians recognized as an indigenous people so that       they might receive federal benefits similar to those provided       to American Indians and natives of Alaska.        During his Senate years Mr. Akaka had stints as chairman of       its Committee on Veterans Affairs and of its Committee on       Indian Affairs.        Mr. Akaka was an outspoken critic of the war in Iraq. On       March 17, 2003, three days before the United States attacked       that country, he warned the Senate:        ``If we pursue our current path, we will have a war lacking       in many things essential to achieving complete success. It       will be a war without broad international support, without       sufficient planning for post-conflict reconstruction and       stability, without a definite exit time and strategy, and       without a firm price tag.        ``Moreover,'' he continued, ``it will be a war with serious       ramifications for our long-term readiness capabilities for       homeland security and for managing other crises.''        A steadfast liberal on most issues, he was known as a       champion of federal workers, complaining that his Senate       colleagues too often denigrated them and cheerfully froze       their pay.        He chaired a Senate subcommittee on the federal work force       and was the chief sponsor of the 2012 Whistleblower       Protection Act, which provided safeguards against retaliation       to federal workers who report waste, fraud and abuse.        Daniel Kahikina Akaka was born in Honolulu on Sept. 11,       1924, the youngest of eight children. His father was of       Chinese and Hawaiian descent; his mother was Hawaiian. He       attended public schools.        After service with the Army Corps of Engineers, he       graduated from the University of Hawaii in 1952 with a degree       in education and taught music, social studies and math in       elementary, middle and high schools. He later became a school       principal and earned a master's degree.        After Hawaii was admitted into the union in 1959, he was an       official in the state's Department of Education and was named       director of the Hawaii Office of Economic Opportunity, an       antipoverty program.        Mr. Akaka was first elected to the House in 1976 and easily       re-elected afterward. In 1990 he was appointed to fill a       Senate vacancy caused by the death of Spark Matsunaga. He was       elected that fall and re-elected in 1994, 2000 and 2006. He       announced in March 2011 that he would not run again in 2012.        Mr. Akaka, who lived in Honolulu, is survived by his wife,       Mary Mildred Chong, whom he married in 1948; a daughter,       Millannie Akaka Mattson; four sons, Daniel Jr., Gerard, Alan       and Nicholas; and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren.        While he was never known as a key lawmaker, Mr. Akaka was       familiar to watchers of C-Span: his name came first whenever       the Senate roll was called and, in his early years, he       relished presiding over that body, a duty many of his       colleagues regarded as tedious.        In 1992, the Senate presented him with its Golden Gavel       Award for presiding for at least 100 hours.        ``I really was proud of being able to chair the Senate       floor over the years and really looked forward to it,'' he       said in a 2011 interview for this obituary.        Even in his final years, he left instructions with the       Democratic cloakroom that he would preside in a pinch,       saying, ``Any time you can't find somebody, call me.''                            ____________________     Madam President, I want to take a moment to remember a  Vermonter who, with seemingly boundless energy and enthusiasm, devoted  her life to her family, her students, her friends, and her community.  Hester ``Hep'' Caldwell, who died on April 10, 2018, will be forever  remembered and admired for a life well lived.  [[Page S2476]]    Hep, who lived to be 89, was one of those people who just about  everybody liked immediately. She loved people, she loved sports, she  loved the outdoors, and she loved living on West Hill in Putney, VT,  with her husband, John, whom she first met when they were both just 10  years old.   For decades, Hep taught history and John taught mathematics at the  Putney School. Besides challenging her students in the classroom, Hep's  many passions--hiking, skiing, gardening, classical music--inspired all  who knew her. She set an example for generations, young and old, in her  home, in the classroom, in woods, fields, and on the slopes and summits  of mountains in all seasons of the year and by her many years of  community service.   Putney will not be the same without Hep, but she has left her mark  there and in her children and grandchildren in ways that will live on  for generations.   I ask unanimous consent that Hep Caldwell's obituary in the Valley  News be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     [From Valley News, Apr. 22, 2018]                         Hester Goodenough Caldwell         Putney, VT.--Hester Goodenough Caldwell, born Nov. 30,       1928, died on Tuesday, April 10, 2018. Hep died as she lived:       sustained by her love for her family and her ability to meet       challenges with laughter and quick wit. Hep was born in       Woodbridge, Conn. to Erwin and Helen Goodenough. She grew up       loving the outdoors and playing alongside her three older       brothers and male cousins, excellent preparation for her       future schooling and her later ability to simultaneously       embrace and challenge traditional gender roles. At the age of       10 she entered Putney School, where she met the boy she would       later wed, John Caldwell. After graduating from Smith College       in 1950 and marrying John, she returned to Putney School in       1953, where she taught history for 37 years even as she       raised four children and earned her Master of Arts in Liberal       Studies from Wesleyan University. During her tenure at Putney       School, Hep also held a variety of positions including head       of the history department, dean of faculty, field hockey       coach, and ski coach. An avid hiker, she led student ski       trips to Tuckerman's Ravine, drawing on her years of skiing       for Putney School and on the ski patrol at Smith. Together,       Hep and John exemplified partnership as they raised their       four children, worked at Putney School, and traveled to       Switzerland, France, Italy, Austria, Finland, Norway,       Australia, Tonga, Wales, England, Japan, Yugoslavia, China       and Russia on learning, hiking and skiing expeditions.        In their later years, Hep and John became co-sponsors of       Camp Caldwell, a series of mini-camps for their 10       grandchildren, where they nurtured family ties, promoted the       benefits of physical labor, and cultivated a respect and love       for the natural world. In the spirit of 5:00 AM barn duty at       the Putney School, the little grandkid campers could not have       7 AM breakfast until they had dipped in the icy cold spring-      fed pond at the bottom of the hill, which of course Hep and       John had done themselves an hour or so earlier. Other camp       activities ranged from ``waking up the chickens and feeding       them'' to drawing straws to see which pair would have to wade       into the swamp mud to remove the water-cress that had       infested the pond's water. Now adults, some of the grandkids'       fondest memories include their time together with Hep and       John.        Hep contributed significantly to her community, serving as       a founding member of the new Putney Library, Chairperson of       Brattleboro Community Chorus, head of the Putney's Democratic       Party and as a Justice of the Peace, presiding over scores of       marriages. Inspiring her children, grandchildren and students       to do good in this world, lifting hearts with her piano       playing, Hep's legacy lives on in her children and       grandchildren, all of whom love skiing and other outdoor       activities, many of whom are engaged in teaching and       coaching.        Hep faced old-age challenges in her final years, but she       never lost her quick laugh and ability to find levity in       whatever was happening around her. She was pre-deceased by       her daughter, Jennifer and her brother, Ward. She will be       greatly missed by her husband, John, her three children, Tim,       Sverre, and Peter and her ten grandchildren, Tyler, Alexa,       Anya, Lucy, Sophie, Lucinda, Heidi, Austin, Isabel, and       Patrick, and her brothers, John and Jim. A gathering to       reflect on and celebrate her life will be held at the Putney       School Aug. 4.                            ____________________     Madam President, on March 21, 2018, Vermont lost one of  its finest sculptors, Frank Gaylord.   Frank Gaylord, a Granite City resident, was a beloved member of the  Barre community. Frank influenced the city and its residents, and the  city in turn influenced his art. The local granite quarries of Barre  provided ample materials for Frank to hone his sculpting skills.   Frank served his country not just in World War II, receiving a Bronze  Star for his service, but also in creating the Korean War Veterans  Memorial, his most famous work, which resides on the National Mall in  Washington, DC. The memorial is visually striking; Frank captured the  movement and feel of war, the 19 figures of diverse American soldiers  are shrouded in ponchos and seem to walk endlessly. Frank called the  day the memorial arrived on the National Mall as the highlight of his  life.   Other examples of Frank's work can be seen in many New England towns,  including at the Connecticut capital and in Williston and Montpelier,  VT. However, what Vermont will best remember Frank by was his  dedication and determination to improve Vermont's own Granite City.  Frank's contributions to the Barre Granite Association, as well as to  the former Barre Players, will be missed.   Frank's passing is a loss to Vermont, to the community of Barre, VT,  and to the Nation. I will always remember Frank when I see his work on  the National Mall and throughout Vermont, and how he so beautifully  captured our country's spirit.   I ask unanimous consent that the Times Argus article ``He had an arts  spirit: Famed Barre sculptor Frank Gaylord has died'' be printed in the  Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:     He Had an Arts Spirit: Famed Barre Sculptor Frank Gaylord Has Died                            (By Eric Blaisdell)         Barre.--The Granite City lost likely its most famous       modern-day resident with the death of sculptor Frank Gaylord.        Gaylord, 93, died at his daughter's home in Northfield       Wednesday night. Funeral arrangements have yet to be       announced, and are being taken care of by The Hooker and       Whitcomb Funeral Home.        Gaylord created the National Korean War Veterans Memorial       in Washington, DC. Other monuments created by Gaylord include       the Firemen's Memorial in Eugene, Oregon; the Doctor Ashbel       Smith statue in Baytown, Texas; the Policemen's Memorial in       Jacksonville, Florida; the Toledo Mud Hens Monument in       Toledo, Ohio; and the National Little League Monument in       Williamsport, Pennsylvania.        When Gaylord was growing up in Clarksburg, West Virginia,       he recalled in a Times Argus story in 2015, his grandmother       would give him plastic molds into which he would press clay       to make reliefs. That transformed into sculpting clay animals       and then he moved to carving soap, quickly learning how much       material it actually took to make a full sculpture.        As he grew up, Gaylord was initially interested in       taxidermy, which, at that time, was done by sculpting plaster       molds, with the animal skins pulled over them.        Then World War II came along, and Gaylord became a       paratrooper for two and a half years. Gaylord served with the       17th Airborne and fought in the Battle of the Bulge.        After the war, he used the G.I. Bill and ended up at the       Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh, which had both engineering       and fine arts schools. He later transferred to Temple       University's Tyler School of Art, where he focused on       becoming a carver.        In 1951, Mac Durnovich of E.J. Batchelder Co. in Barre       hired Gaylord. So he and his late wife Mary moved to Vermont.       He knew the community's reputation, its rich ethnic heritage,       and its renowned craftsmanship. He said in 2015 he knew he       could learn there.        Master sculptor Giuliano Cecchinelli, of Barre, has known       Gaylord since the 1960s. Cecchinelli said Thursday that Barre       has never had a sculptor like Gaylord.        ``He gave Barre more than Barre asked. . . . He made Barre,       Vermont,'' he said.        Cecchinelli said Gaylord was a perfectionist when it came       to his style of work, which had a more modern flair to it. He       said when he first met Gaylord he could tell right away that       Gaylord had class and that he would achieve what he wanted to       achieve.        Cecchinelli said he owns several pieces of Gaylord's work,       which he keeps in his home.        Sue Higby, executive director of Studio Place Arts in       downtown Barre, has known Gaylord for 15 years. Higby       highlighted his work at her studio in 2015.        ``I'm truly very sorry to hear of his passing and his       integrity as an artist will live on in Barre for years to       come,'' she said.        Higby said Gaylord was a cultural intellectual who loved       theater, dance and the human form. She also said Gaylord,       more than most artists, had the ability to capture in his       work the feeling of a ballet dancer's movement or the       fluttering of a piece of fabric.        Jerry Williams owns and operates Barre Sculpture Studios.       Williams has known Gaylord since the 1980s and at one point       he owned the studio next to Gaylord's.        ``Frank was a mentor to many sculptors, some of them still       operating in town. Some of them have moved on and done other  [[Page S2477]]       things. But he was a real valuable part of the sculpture       community in this town. Not just monumental, but the art of       what we're doing,'' he said.        Williams said he will remember Gaylord as someone with a       dry wit who knew how to put things in perspective, such as       how sculptors fit into the art scene. He said because Gaylord       went to art school, he approached sculpting from a different       perspective than those who learned by working in a granite       shed.        ``When I met him I kind of wanted to emulate that part of       him that wasn't ground down by an industry. He still had an       arts spirit,'' Williams said.                            ____________________     Madam President, I want to take a moment to highlight the  benefits of international students and scholars who come to the United  States to live and study and who have been unfairly penalized by the  current administration's efforts to limit travel to our country.   I wonder how many Americans are aware of the many ways that  international students contribute to our colleges and universities, to  our communities, and to our Nation. In economic terms, last year alone,  international students contributed an estimated $37 billion to the U.S.  economy and created or supported more than 450,000 U.S. jobs. In our  State of Vermont, nearly 2,000 international students and their  families contributed $83.1 million and supported 850 jobs. One would  think that President Trump, who often touts his efforts to create jobs,  would want to encourage this.   In addition to economic benefits, international students and scholars  advance U.S. national security by strengthening our diplomatic and  cultural ties with foreign countries. Students and scholars who spend  time in the U.S. become informal ambassadors when they return home,  sharing an appreciation for common values, counteracting stereotypes  about Americans, enhancing respect for cultural differences, and  maintaining connections with our country and citizens.   However, our country is at risk of losing our position as the most  attractive country for international students and scholars and of  ceding the critical benefits associated with such a reputation to  others.   The U.S. Council of Graduate Schools recently reported a decline in  international graduate student applications and enrollment for fall  2017, the first such decline in more than a decade. In fiscal year  2017, the U.S. Department of State issued nearly 20 percent fewer  student visas compared to the previous fiscal year. Students and  scholars are increasingly uncertain about their status in our country,  as well as the types of educational and research opportunities that  will remain available to international students. This uncertainty and  the chilling effects of recent executive orders targeting foreigners  appear to be diminishing the ability of the United States and our  higher education institutions to remain attractive to international  students.   At the same time, many other countries--including Australia, Canada,  and China--are seizing the opportunity and proactively introducing  national policies and marketing strategies to attract talented  international students who might otherwise come here.   I urge the administration to not ignore the many important  contributions to the U.S. economy, national security, and global  reputation that are made by international students and scholars. The  administration should reconsider its policies that are contributing to  uncertainly and reluctance among such individuals, who instead should  feel welcomed and encouraged to bring their talents and other  contributions to this country.                            ____________________
