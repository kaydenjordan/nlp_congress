 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of a much-needed  investment in our Nation's infrastructure, specifically our water  infrastructure.   Let me be very clear: Our crumbling and outdated water infrastructure  is in a state of emergency. It is leaving our most vulnerable Americans  struggling with water access and unaffordable rates, including my  hometown of Detroit, Michigan.   I want to commend President Biden and my colleagues for promoting the  American Jobs Plan, a comprehensive Federal investment to repair and  strengthen our infrastructure.   This could not be more timely, as Federal investment in public water  infrastructure projects have fallen from 63 percent of our overall  investment in 1977 to just 9 percent in 2014.   The American Jobs Plan will deliver the investments we need and  eliminate all lead pipes and service lines in our drinking water  systems.   It is unacceptable that in the United States of America, schools are  forced to put plastic bags over their drinking fountains because it is  not safe for our children to drink water because there are elevated  levels of lead.   Too much of our existing infrastructure is jeopardized because of  lead pipes. My home State of Michigan knows about this issue all too  well. The Flint water crisis brought national attention to the dangers  of elevated levels of lead in our drinking water.   Unfortunately, what happened in Flint is happening all across this  country. In my district, the same problem exists in the city of  Detroit. About 1,500 children under the age of 6 test positive for  elevated levels of lead every year, and of those tested, about 7  percent are diagnosed with lead poisoning.   Congress cannot stand by and watch as Americans get sick and poisoned  from their own drinking water.   I always like to emphasize: Water is not a luxury. A pothole is an  inconvenience, but water is a necessity to life.   We have the opportunity to address this issue right now by passing  the American Jobs Plan. It is a once-in-a-generation investment in our  communities and families. It also includes provisions similar to my  legislation, the WATER Act. My bill would fully fund the Drinking Water  and Clean Water State Revolving Funds, provide funding for public  schools to test and replace drinking water infrastructure, provide  grants to replace lead service lines leading to our households, and  much more to fix and strengthen our water infrastructure.   Earlier this Congress, I submitted Community Project Funding requests  to support water system improvements for two of my communities: Pontiac  and Royal Oak Township. These communities are not alone. Similar water  system improvement projects are needed across the country. With the  American Jobs Plan, we can make that a reality.   I look forward to continuing to fight for access to clean, safe, and  affordable drinking water for every American.                            ____________________
