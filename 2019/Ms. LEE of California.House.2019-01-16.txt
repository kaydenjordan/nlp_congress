 Madam Chair, first of all, I thank our chair  for yielding, for her tireless leadership, and for reminding us very  clearly that we need to open up the government right away.   As a Representative from northern California, let me just say that I  remember vividly the Oakland Hills fire in 1991 that killed 25 people  and destroyed more than 3,000 homes, and the 1989 earthquake that  killed many people and devastated many parts of my city. I represent  Oakland and Berkeley, California. Just as many helped us then, we will  help our neighbors now.   Disasters can impact any district. Just this morning, a small  earthquake hit my district again. Thankfully, there are no reported  injuries.   Let me also say that I am deeply grateful to our firefighters and  first responders who work around the clock to help save lives in  disasters that have ravaged our country, especially this past year.   Madam Chair, I am in strong support of this emergency supplemental,  which provides $12.1 billion in disaster relief to people who have been  impacted by wildfires, hurricanes, typhoons, and other natural  disasters. Our neighbors in Paradise, California; Puerto Rico; Guam;  Florida; southern California; the Virgin Islands; and the territories  all need our help, and they need it now.   Northern California's most recent wildfire known as the Camp fire is  the most destructive in California's history. Eighty-five people lost  their lives, and 13,000 homes were destroyed. These families have lost  everything, and they deserve our support now more than ever. Many of  these communities in California ravaged by wildfires are only just  beginning to recover, yet just last week, President Trump threatened to  withhold disaster assistance to California.                                time  1445    Does this President have no shame, bullying scared families with no  homes and communities to return to? Real leaders help families recover.    Real leaders help families recover and  rebuild. They don't use suffering families as political pawns.   Madam Chair, that is why we need to pass this bill. With the $12  billion provided in this bill, our communities will be able to recover  and rebuild, and families will finally get some peace of mind knowing  that we are with them.   I urge my colleagues to vote yes on the bill and yes to helping our  communities get back on their feet.
