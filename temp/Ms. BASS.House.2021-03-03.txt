 Mr. Speaker, 30 years ago today, Rodney King was viciously  beaten by police officers in Los Angeles. It would be the first time  the world would witness what African Americans had been organizing,  marching, and trying to change for over 100 years.   Personally, I was hopeful that once everyone saw what happens in  Black communities, policing in America would change. I was certain no  one would deny what they saw with their own eyes and that the officers  would be convicted. But they were acquitted. Some were even hired by  other police departments.   The sad truth was, when people told their stories of abuse or even  murder at the hands of police officers, they were simply not believed.  The story was always the same: I was in fear of my life. I thought they  had a gun. The person was resisting arrest. The individual attempted to  assault me.   That is all that was needed for the beating or murder to be  discounted, dismissed. The individuals' lives had little value.   Even children. These are children here. This is an 8-year-old, a 10- year-old, a mother, and another child placed on the ground because the  mother was suspected of stealing a car.   Several years after Rodney King's beating, cell phone cameras were  invented. It has taken technology and active citizen involvement to  document and expose this reality. And now there are many tapes, many  examples of individuals being shot and killed by officers, yet  transformation of policing in America has still not happened.   Passing the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act will be a critical  first step--just a first step--to transform policing in America. The  bill raises the standards for policing and holds those officers  accountable who fail to uphold the ethic of protecting and serving  their communities.                                time  1830    Now, I know that change is difficult, but I am certain that police  officers who risk their lives every day are concerned about their  profession, and they don't work in an environment where they are  chastised for intervening when they see a fellow officer abuse a  citizen or use deadly force when it is not necessary. And I am certain  that police officers want to make sure that they are trained in the  best practices in policing.   To support officers, this legislation will create the first-ever  national accreditation standards for the operation of police  departments, set national standards for officers, and establish best  practices in training, hiring, deescalation strategies, and bystander  duty.   For example, if officers had better training, maybe they would  understand that just because someone can verbally express ``I can't  breathe,'' does not mean they are faking and the officer can continue  to press on the person's chest, back, or neck. And despite our best  intentions, there will be some officers who cross over the line.   Mr. Speaker, that is why this bill also includes strong  accountability measures, both as a matter of simple justice, and to  keep unfit officers off the street. A profession where you have the  power to kill should be a profession that requires highly trained  officers who are accountable to the public. That is what this bill  accomplishes.   Police officers are the first to say it is unfair that they are not  trained to be social workers or healthcare providers.    Mr. Speaker, the Justice in Policing Act reinvests in our  communities.   If this legislation had been the law of the land several years ago,  Eric Garner and George Floyd would be alive today, because the bill  bans choke holds.   If the bill had been law last year, Breonna Taylor would not have  been shot to death in her sleep, because no-knock warrants for drug  offenses would have been illegal.   And if a national registry had been in effect, it would have been  revealed that the officer who killed 12-year-old Tamir Rice--   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the George Floyd  Justice in Policing Act.
