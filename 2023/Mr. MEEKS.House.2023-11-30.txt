 Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me first start off by saying the President of the United States  did the right thing. It is easy to say why we should vote against this  bill.   My good friend, the chairman, has talked about October 7 over and  over. Our committee has had several family members come before our  committee where we have vowed to do everything we can to get their  family members back home.   For me, it has been very personal. Yesterday, we talked to a group of  family members. We told them we will not stop until we get their family  members back home.   Negotiating to bring our hostages home is hard because you have to do  it with bad people.   Guess what? Hamas committed the heinous acts on October 7, but who  are we negotiating with to get the hostages home? Hamas. It is not  easy, but we vowed in front of these witnesses.   I wonder what we would say to those five individuals and families,  who are now safe at home, before they were released? Would we have  promised them and didn't we promise them we would do everything we  could to get them back home?   Yes, President Biden did the right thing. He brought five Americans  home who were rotting in Iran's notorious Evan prison.   Every Member of Congress--I repeat, every Member of this Congress who  was aware of these cases wanted our fellow citizens to come home. Now,  they are saying they should not have come home.   This was done, wanting them to come home, with a bipartisan voice.  President Biden thus succeeded in doing what his predecessors could  not. He got them home.   Iran, of course, as is Hamas, is a murderous and corrupt regime. They  are not pleasant, and this isn't easy. Thanks to this agreement, five  American families are now whole again, and Iran has lost the leverage  of holding these American hostages.   Now, H.R. 5961 would sanction parties that carry out the financial  terms of the hostage agreement in question. These include three  European commercial banks and the Central Bank of Qatar, who, by the  way, has been very instrumental in working with us to get hostages home  that were taken on October 7, but let's really talk about the facts.   Yes, I have been in classified sessions and nonclassified sessions  and have heard it, as all of us have. Let's talk about the facts.   Billions of Iran's own profits from oil sales were sitting in a  restricted account in South Korea. It was done by the prior  administration. It was established by the Trump administration for Iran  to make approved humanitarian purchases. This wasn't done by the Biden  administration. It was sitting in South Korea, by the Trump  administration, for humanitarian purchases.   The United States had no control over that account while it was  sitting there. The agreement moved that $6 billion from the restricted  account in South Korea, converted it to euros, and relocated it into  the restricted account in Qatar, which now the United States has  visibility over--not a single penny--facts, not conjecture, facts.    I don't think anyone can refute the fact that not a single penny has  moved into Iran. Not one. Not a penny, much less a dime. Not a penny  has moved into Iran.   Under the terms of the agreement, Iran can use the money in Qatar to  make approved humanitarian purchases to acquire medicine, medical  equipment, agricultural goods, and food. Iran's government physically  will never touch this money. The entirety of the transaction occurs  outside of Iran, and Iran only receives the vetted humanitarian goods.   By the way, that is consistent with our values, and that is why we,  in all of this, are talking about humanitarian concerns for people who  are just victimized by bad people.   Thus far, Iran has not made any requests of the humanitarian fund,  and nothing has been gained by Iran. All of the money remains in the  account, an account that the United States can watch.   We have leverage over that account due to our relationship with the  correspondent banks in Europe that would help process any transactions.  In other words, we know we now have more control over this money than  we did when it was sitting in South Korea. In fact, this account  provides us with leverage, not the other way around.   Furthermore, following the horrific attacks in Israel on October 7,  the United States and Qatar froze the humanitarian fund, so it is  frozen now in Qatar. No humanitarian purchases will be approved any  time soon. Again, nothing has changed.   The money remains in the account and we continue to have leverage.  Nothing has changed from when the money was sitting in South Korea.   The only thing that has changed is five American citizens are no  longer sitting in an Iranian prison. They are back home with their  families.   Madam Chair, if H.R. 5961 is passed into law, that leverage will be  gone. It will disappear. We will also lose our ability to conduct  diplomacy with Iran and others in the future. If we blow up this  agreement by passing this bill, we, the United States, will be the ones  breaking yet another sensitive negotiated agreement.   Our word and integrity will no longer be good in negotiations,  whether it is with Iran or any other parties. The United States must  continue to address--and here is where I think we agree--no one is  saying that the United States needs to continue to address Iran's  backing of groups like Hezbollah and Hamas.   The Iranian-supported Hamas terrorists unleashed pure evil when they  broke a cease-fire in the attacks on October 7. The population of Gaza  would not be engulfed in war right now if it were not for Hamas. But we  must also remain sober and serious about the challenge of Iran's  nefarious nuclear  [[Page H6002]]  program. None of the bad options we possess to stop Iran's nuclear  ambitions are better than the diplomatic track, which has already  proven successful.   It was the United States who actually violated the JCPOA, not Iran.  Pulling out of this hostage agreement will be the second time we  violate an agreement with Iran's leaders. Passage of this bill would  mean potentially slamming the door closed on future diplomacy, leaving  us only with dangerous and highly risky options of confronting Iran's  nuclear program.   We all agree, Iran must not ever have a nuclear weapon, but guess  what, since we pulled out of JCPOA, they are closer to getting a  nuclear weapon than had we been in there.   Madam Chair, the prisoner swap confirms to the Iranian regime that  the United States is a reliable negotiating partner, just as we see  taking place right now.   As we bring the hostages home from Gaza, they have to deal with  Hamas. Both sides have to keep their word. We have warned Israel, who  is a strong, diplomatic, honest country moving forward, fighting for  its existence but have to deal with Hamas. They made an agreement, and  they are living by that agreement. Hostages are coming home, and we  want that to continue for each and every one of them. They are not just  simply being released, Israel is giving something back in return.   In our case, Iran is actually not getting anything because they are  not getting a dime to be utilized for their nefarious purposes.   Madam Chair, let me conclude with this: The agreement has freed five  Americans--I repeat, five American citizens--who were suffering in an  Iranian prison, who we all, in a bipartisan way, said we would do  anything to get them home. We wanted them to be home.   It shifted Iran's own money from an account in Korea that we did not  control, to one where we play a role and have control that we didn't in  South Korea.                                time  1245    Not a single penny has left the account. I don't think anybody can  refute that. Not a single penny has left the account. Not a single  penny has entered Iran. Not a single U.S. taxpayer dollar has been  involved.   This fund remains frozen indefinitely by the United States in Qatar,  which has been working closely with us and Israel.   There is no reason to jeopardize future negotiations or further  inflame an already dangerous situation by passing this bill. The fact  of the matter is, I don't see why we would want to pass this bill. We  know that diplomacy is the first thing we need to move forward in  bringing our people home.   Lastly, let me just say this because I want to be absolutely clear: I  don't want Iran's leaders to benefit from our actions in any shape,  fashion, or form. This hostage agreement that stands today, they have  not benefited from it and will not benefit from it.   Unfortunately, this legislation will shoot American global  credibility in the foot without even touching Iranian regime leaders.  We encourage this House not to rush into passing this bill. Let's keep  the door open for diplomacy.   This stands as an example with Iran and others because we have  adversaries, but you always have to deal with those adversaries and  negotiate and talk to try to figure out how we can live in a better  place.   Let's think ahead. Let's not play checkers. Let's play chess. That is  what this is all about.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me just say that I keep hearing this demonstrates weakness. The  Biden administration demonstrated strength in being willing to stand  with your enemies and negotiate.   I can recall, for me, even in our own country, what I learned to live  by. Many folks were thinking that when Dr. King was moving forward with  nonviolence, he was demonstrating weakness and that we should go back  and fight. He demonstrated strength. Sometimes when dealing and  negotiating, that is where strength comes from, and if you just go out  swinging, you demonstrate weakness.   What Joe Biden has done was kept his word, number one. He said that  he would bring, whenever he could, American hostages home. This body  has said to American families that we would do everything and anything  to bring their families home. We should keep our word.   President Biden kept his word to those five American hostages, and  the United States House of Representatives should keep its word and not  challenge the agreement that the President made to return those five  American hostages.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Again, I haven't heard a reply. Not one penny has gone to Iran. If I  am wrong, then someone tell me. Not one cent. The money is frozen in  Qatar. Not one penny.   None of this could have been used by Hamas, Iran, or anyone for  October 7. They didn't have a dime.   The money was there already, put there for humanitarian purposes by  the Trump administration. It was in South Korea, but we didn't have any  control over it.   I didn't hear anybody talk about that when the Trump administration  was there, that he should not have sent the money to South Korea. This  should not be something that we are playing politics on.    The money shifted from South Korea and was changed into euros and  sent to Qatar, where we have now more visibility than ever. Not a dime  is going to Iran. We have five American hostages home, and then we are  going to question the deal.  [[Page H6003]]    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me say this: The United States has values. What is taking place  and what took place in Israel and is taking place in Gaza right now is  why we are fighting so hard to make sure that we have a supplemental  that includes humanitarian aid.   We know that there are people in Gaza, Palestinians, who are not part  of Hamas. Everyone wants to make sure, as we are doing in this pause,  that humanitarian aid is getting to them. It shows the best of who we  are as Americans.   It is also so in Iran. Every Iranian is not part of the regime. In  fact, the regime is cruel and does not provide humanitarian aid to many  of its citizens.   We don't want to be like the regime. We want to show our humanity.  Yes, when human beings are suffering, we want to make sure that we get  in humanitarian aid so that we can take care of them. That is what is  happening right now. That is why we are having the pause in the Middle  East, in Gaza.   Doing the hostage exchange, bringing people home, is what we should  be doing. What we are also doing is bringing in humanitarian aid to  those individuals who Hamas would never aid.   So people around the world will respect and know who we are, we  should never give up on our values. The money that we are talking about  is not going to be used or getting into the hands of the Iranian  regime. We are talking about trying to show that we have care and  humanity for those who are the victims of the regime.                                time  1300    Humanitarian aid. That is who we should be. We should be proud of the  fact that we want to try to take care of those who are a part,  unfortunately, of dictators and authoritarian regimes who will not take  care of their people. That is not who we are.   If, in the future, through the constraints that we have and the  approval that needs to take place we can help somebody that has been  victimized, I think that is the right thing to do.   To say that we don't care is the wrong thing to do. I just wonder if  we would invite those five families of those who have now returned  home, what would we say to them?   We wish your folks would have stayed in the prison because the  President should not have made this deal because of humanitarian aid?   What would we say to them?   What can we say to them now? They are listening to us.   We should renege on the deal and let their loved ones stay in prison?   Thank God President Biden understands being a humanitarian, bringing  our folks home, and at the same time having a hard line against Iran  and Hamas and its affiliates.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, one question that I think remains unanswered to my  colleagues on the other side: Are you willing to go and tell the family  members of those five hostages that are now home that they should still  be in that prison?   Are you willing to tell them that we should not have worked out a  deal with the $6 billion frozen for humanitarian  [[Page H6004]]  concern and that we should renege on the deal and they should go back  to prison?   The one thing that is missing is that we got these hostages home, and  that can't be held over our heads by Iran anymore.   I don't hear an answer to that.   What do you say to those families?   We have talked to families who have loved ones that are hostages.  What do you say to them? You should still be there? We should not have  made the deal?   Is that what you are saying? I think that what I am hearing is that  this deal should not have been made and those American hostages should  still be sitting in that Iranian prison?   I ask my colleagues on the other side: What do you say to those five  families?   Do we renege on the deal?   Do you tell them they should not be home, so we should not have made  the deal?   We have hostages before us all the time. What do you say to them?   I know what I am going to say to them. I am glad their family members  are home and I am glad Joe Biden made the deal to get them home. He is  not threatening and not using any U.S. dollars. There is no threat from  Iran in regard to that $6 billion to be utilized for any aggression on  their part.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, let me just say this. First, the debate on  the House floor today is a rare moment where the House Foreign Affairs  Committee is debating legislation under a rule, rather than under  suspension.   For those who don't know what that means, it signifies that this bill  is not bipartisan. That is in contrast to the great majority of  legislation that comes out of the Foreign Affairs Committee.   This is the first primary Foreign Affairs bill this year that we are  debating under a rule this Congress. In the previous two Congresses,  under the Democratic leadership, we debated a total of one bill under a  rule.   One thing I will say, as I have talked throughout this debate, one  thing that is a fact is that Mr. McCaul is my friend. We always try to  reach an agreement on all bills. There is no question about that. I am  not questioning that at all. We are frequently, as we did yesterday,  very successful.    We had a completely bipartisan markup, including on a potentially  game-changing bill that would codify an outbound investment regime to  protect our economy and our national security. I would say that that is  the way I do believe this committee is ran, and we work very closely  together.   On this bill is one of those times where I do fundamentally disagree  with the arguments put forward by the majority. I submitted an  amendment that would have added a national security waiver to the  legislation. Such a waiver is a very restrictive standard. The  President can only waive the sanctions if it was vital to the national  security of the United States. He could not waive the sanctions for  trivial reasons, nor even for an important economic reason. He could  only waive the sanctions to protect our national security. Of course,  that amendment was not made in order.   Every major sanctions bill over the last 20 years has had basic  exemptions and waivers, like the amendment I offered to this bill. This  history includes numerous Republican sanctions, bills targeting Iran.  By moving a bill today without those very basic guardrails, we are  undermining bipartisan practices that have been held for decades. We  are also forfeiting leverage to promote American interests and  undercutting our credibility around the world.   As such, I oppose this legislation. It is the wrong time for this  legislation. It is improper. It will hurt down the road. We need to  look and have a vision for down the road because, for me, what we do is  not just about today. It is about--I have three granddaughters, and I  say this everywhere--it is about 5, 2, and 6 months, so it is about  what takes place and what opportunities might be available 60 years  from now.   As we look back at prior history, things that were done by prior  Congresses had an effect 50 and 60 years later. People that are our  allies now, 60 years ago were our enemy. Time changes things. People  who were our enemies 60 years ago are now our allies.   Let's think forward. Let's vote this bill down--at least we should  have the waivers in there. I must oppose this legislation, and I  encourage all of my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I strongly support this amendment.   The United States must stand for humanitarian aid and must stand for  helping the people of Iran, even while we condemn the Iranian governing  regime. The regime's medieval views on women's rights and religious  freedom and their depraved agenda of financing terrorists around the  region are separate from the people of Iran.   This amendment simply separates the government from the people, and I  encourage all of my colleagues to vote for this very good and  humanitarian amendment.   Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Chair, I close by encouraging all of my  colleagues to vote in support of this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment is counterproductive. The  House has voted in a bipartisan manner to support general licenses to  Iran to allow open internet access to the protesters against the regime  of Iran. That could violate this vaguely drafted amendment. In the  recent past, the United States has spent very small sums of money to  promote civil society and democratic ideals in Iran, and that could  violate this amendment.   This amendment, I believe, with all due respect, is carelessly  drafted and unvetted. Therefore, I must oppose it.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment targets Qatar, the most  [[Page H6010]]  important partner of the United States in freeing Americans and  Israelis held hostage by Hamas.   Passage of this amendment and, in my opinion, this overall bill would  jeopardize sensitive, ongoing diplomacy related to the hostage crisis  in Gaza and further endanger Americans and Israelis in harm's way.  Israel's National Security Adviser publicly praised Qatar's role as  crucial to ongoing efforts to facilitate humanitarian solutions.   Furthermore, it was reported in late October that Qatar's Emir told  Secretary of State Blinken that his government was open to  reconsidering the presence of Hamas in Qatar once the hostage crisis is  resolved.   I agree that Hamas' continued presence in Qatar and Turkiye is  problematic. These terrorist leaders are living a life of luxury while  their people suffer in Gaza. They should be held accountable, but this  is not the way to go about it.   Let's free our hostages. Then, we can talk and work with Qatar to  hold Hamas' leadership in Doha accountable.   This amendment is simply grandstanding and not the best way to deal  with this issue, and certainly, it is being offered at the worst  possible time.                                time  1400    Diplomacy is very important. If we challenge or damage these  diplomatic channels, it further endangers Americans.   We can't pass this legislation. We should not pass this legislation.  I ask my colleagues to please join me in voting ``no'' on this  amendment. We shouldn't even need the bill.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Gooden).    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman  from Texas.    Mr. Chair, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I will just simply say, very briefly, when you  hear from Israel, its leaders, Israel's national security advisor  publicly praising Qatar's role as crucial, and when I visited Israel  and talked to the head of their defense, talked to Prime Minister  [[Page H6011]]  Netanyahu, all said that Qatar was crucial to this negotiation.   Let's not do this. It is the wrong time.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise to claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, this amendment is needless and simply not  rooted in fact. The sponsor bases his claims for this amendment on the  assertion that the administration has not condemned Houthi militants  for their violent actions and continued destabilizing behavior. This  simply is not accurate.   The Biden administration has repeatedly called out the violence of  Houthi militants that they have perpetuated against civilians,  including recent missile launches toward Israel, as well as our Gulf  partners.   In fact, as recently as this past Tuesday, November 28, the State  Department called out the violence of Iranian proxies across the region  as well, and especially called on the Houthis to immediately cease  attacks.   The United States led other G-7 nations in this public effort, which  follows other similar statements. These statements include the State  Department's condemnation of Houthi militants seizing the cargo ship  Galaxy Leader on November 20.   Spokesperson Matt Miller called such actions flagrant violations of  international law and demanded the immediate release of the ship and  its crew.   The administration made similar statements earlier this year and  last, calling out Houthi abuses against Yemeni civilians, missile  launches against Gulf partners, and more.   I, along with many of my colleagues, have and will continue to call  out abuses, escalatory actions, and violence throughout the region,  just as the administration has.   This amendment is an unnecessary and ill-conceived attempt to  misrepresent the facts, so I must oppose it, and I encourage all of my  colleagues to do so as well.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, let me just say this.   Joe Biden has been one of the staunchest Israel supporters of any  President of the United States.   You are going to take the word of the Ayatollah over the word of the  President of the United States?   The President of the United States has said not a penny will get to  the Ayatollah, but yet you want to take the side or believe in that  brutal authoritarian dictator.   I think that the American people know better than that. I think that  the American people understand better than that. I think that the  American people can look at the facts and see what side Joe Biden is  on, as he talks on a regular basis with the leadership of Israel,  almost every day since October 7.   I wouldn't trust or believe anything that the Ayatollah says, but I  do believe in Joe Biden.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment would be counterproductive to  America's interest.   No President, whether he be Democratic or Republican, has used this  waiver for anything but the most pressing reasons.   Rescinding this waiver would likely prevent the administration from  waiving sanctions that allow Iraq to pay for electricity imports from  Iran. Without this waiver, Iraq likely will be unable to import  electricity from Iran, leading to electricity outages and instability  across Iraq.   We have seen what instability in Iraq looks like over the past  decade: the decay of central governance, the rise of ISIS, and a  growing terrorist ideology that struck America and Europe in numerous  deadly attacks.   America has many interests in the Middle East, and this waiver is  important for ensuring that this administration or any future  administration has the flexibility it needs to promote American  interests.   It is important for the Presidents, this one and those in the future,  to have that flexibility. Thereby, I oppose my good friend from Texas'  amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of the Jackson  amendment.   The world in 2023 does not look like the world in 2018. Russia has  invaded Ukraine. Hamas has attacked Israel. The Burmese partial  democracy has collapsed in a coup.   On the positive side of the ledger, NATO is more united than divided.  The AUKUS pact has fortified our relationship with our closest allies.  Japan and Korea are cooperating with each other like never before.   In 2018, most of us were unfamiliar with the term ``coronavirus.'' In  2023, many of us are trying to forget it. The point here is that the  world can change dramatically in just 5 years.   Congress does itself a disservice when we lock into policies without  oversight or a chance to reconsider. Mr. Jackson's amendment would fix  that flaw in the bill, and I strongly support his amendment.
