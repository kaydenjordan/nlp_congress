 Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce  legislation that prohibits the sale, transfer, manufacture, and  importation of assault weapons.  [[Page S104]]    I will keep doing this every Congress. This legislation must  constantly be before us until Republicans finally decide to join me in  the effort to stop mass shootings. This legislation is not perfect. But  it is part of the solution. We must start with reducing the supply of  the weapons of war that are used to take the lives of our loved ones.   These last years have seen some of the worst gun-violence tragedies  in our Nation's history. For example, on October 1, 2017, in Las Vegas,  Nevada, a gunman opened fire with multiple semi-automatic assault  rifles that he had legally transformed into automatic weapons. He  killed more than fifty people and left more than 500 wounded. Among the  victims were mothers, fathers, brothers, and sisters.   There was Kelsey Meadows, 28 years old, who after graduating from the  University of California, Fresno, returned to her hometown of Taft,  California to be a substitute teacher at her alma mater, Taft Union  High School. She was described by the high school principal as ``smart,  compassionate, and kind'' with a ``sweet spirit and a love for  children.'' Her entire family and community were completely devastated.  Kelsey could have been any of us, attending that concert.   My own daughter told me after the Las Vegas shooting that she was  supposed to be in the city that evening, but her plans had to change.  It was only a little more than a year before the Las Vegas shooting  that we experienced what had then been the worst mass shooting in our  nation's history. That was when 49 people, who were enjoying an evening  of dancing with friends and loved ones, were massacred in Orlando,  Florida. Victims in Orlando included 22-year old Luis Velma, who was  working at Universal Studios on a Harry Potter ride.   There was also Eddie Justice, a 30-year old accountant who texted his  mother from the shooting, telling her: ``Mommy I love you.'' ``In club  they shooting.'' ``He has us.'' I encourage every member of this  chamber to imagine receiving those text messages from their son or  daughter.   And just six months before that, 14 people were killed and more than  20 were injured in San Bernardino, California at a work holiday party.  Among the victims was a father of six. A mother of three. A woman who  was eight when she and her mother left Vietnam for a better life in  America. The youngest victim was 26, and the oldest was 60.   And we should never forget that on December 14, 2012, 20 children had  their lives taken at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Children. This issue  could not be more important for our children's future.   This past year we saw young men and women begin an incredible  movement after the shooting that took place on February 14, 2018, at  Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. They are  setting an example for all of us. Tens of thousands of students  nationwide have taken to the streets to demand action to stop mass  shootings and stem the epidemic of gun violence that plagues our  communities. Our youngest generation has grown up hiding under their  desks, and they have said, ``enough.''   Following their example, I encourage every member of this body to  imagine dropping their young child off at school this morning, only to  learn a few hours later that a gunman walked into that school and tried  to kill as many people as possible. That is something we can prevent.   The deadly assault weapons used by the attackers in each of the  devastating shootings I have mentioned would have been banned under the  Assault Weapons Ban bill that I am introducing today. This bill helps  keep us safer, while also protecting the rights of lawful gun owners.   It prohibits semi-automatic rifles, handguns, and shotguns that can  accept a detachable magazine and have one military characteristic. This  is the standard employed in my home state of California--and it works.  The bill also prohibits bump-fire stocks, which, as we saw in Las  Vegas, allow people to convert semi-automatic rifles to function like  machine guns.   Importantly, our legislation further prohibits large-capacity  ammunition feeding devices capable of accepting more than ten rounds.  It also has several technical updates to the bill that was introduced  last Congress. Specifically, it bans stocks that are otherwise foldable  or adjustable in a manner that operates to reduce the length, size, or  any other dimension, or otherwise enhances the concealability of a  weapon. Additionally, it prohibits assault pistols that weigh 50 ounces  or more when unloaded, a provision which was originally part of the  1994 ban.   Finally, it bans assault pistol stabilizing braces and Thordsen-type  grips and stocks that are designed to evade assault weapons bans. Now,  let me tell you what the bill will not do.   It will not affect hunting or sporting firearms. Instead, the bill  protects hunters and sportsmen by specifically exempting 2,258 firearms  used for hunting or sporting purposes. It also exempts antique,  manually-operated, and permanently disabled weapons. Moreover, the bill  protects the rights of existing gun owners by grandfathering weapons  legally possessed on the date of enactment.   Opponents believe that this legislation impinges upon Second  Amendment rights. I disagree. The Supreme Court expressly held in  District of Columbia v. Heller that ``the right secured by the Second  Amendment is not unlimited.'' The Court made clear that reasonable  regulations are constitutional. This bill simply establishes reasonable  regulations on what types of weapons may be sold and used. Individuals  should not own nuclear weapons, they should not own rocket launchers,  and they should not own military-style assault weapons.   In fact, a number of courts have considered challenges to assault  weapons bans. To date, every court that has considered a ban on assault  weapons or large-capacity magazines has upheld the law. Mr. President,  I believe very strongly that the most important duty that government  has to its citizens is to protect the nation and the safety of its  people. Now, I am under no illusions. I know that the gun lobby has a  stranglehold on this building. I know we got 40 votes in 2013, and I  know Republicans control the Senate today.   But I also know this was hard-fought in 1994, and we prevailed--with  Republican support. It was a bipartisan vote.   I still believe that, at some point, my Republican colleagues will  come together and realize that we can be a nation that protects its  people from the savagery of these weapons.   I thank the chair, and I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Ms. Harris):   S. 67. A bill to provide for conservation, enhanced recreation  opportunities, and development of renewable energy in the California  Desert Conservation Area, and for other purposes; to the Committee on  Energy and Natural Resources.    Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce  legislation that prohibits the sale, transfer, manufacture, and  importation of assault weapons.  [[Page S104]]    I will keep doing this every Congress.
