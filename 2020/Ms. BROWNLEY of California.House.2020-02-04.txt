 Mr. Speaker, during National Gun Violence  Survivors' Week, I stand before you to call attention to the tragic  impact of gun violence on our Nation.   On November 7, 2018, Ventura County was forever altered by the  Borderline shooting, which took the lives of 12 individuals.   Telemachus Orfanos, a U.S. Navy veteran, survived the Las Vegas  shooting only to be killed 1 year later at Borderline. Tel died a hero,  rushing to save others when gunfire erupted.   Today, I am joined by his mother, Susan, whose presence is a reminder  of the far too many families grieving the loss of their loved ones.   Since the Borderline shooting, an estimated 45,000 people have died  from gun violence, and the Senate still refuses to act. Tel and all  victims of gun violence deserve better. They deserve much better.   The Senate must act. The lives of every American depend upon it.                            ____________________
