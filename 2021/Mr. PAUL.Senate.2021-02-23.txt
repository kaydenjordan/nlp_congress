 Mr. President, in times of conflict and peace, nations  should discuss and resolve disputes. We cannot expect to achieve peace  without effort and dialogue. The post of Ambassador to the United  Nations is a position where engagement is of the utmost importance.  Throughout Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield's 35-year tenure at the State  Department, under both Republicans and Democrats, she developed a long  track record of engaging diplomatically with other countries through a  very unique approach. Based on Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield's career, I  believe she will tackle international challenges and engage with  friends and adversaries, alike, and I support her nomination.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of America's  finest, MG Brian Winski, who served a 24-month tour as the commanding  general of the 101st Airborne Division and Fort Campbell, KY. Major  General Winski's unparalleled mastery across the tactical, operational,  and strategic spectrums in combination with his infectious and  inspirational leadership provided a continuous source of motivation for  soldiers and leaders alike.   In a time of uncertainty, Major General Winski exhibited the most  valued traits of a leader. As the senior commander of Fort Campbell,  KY, Major General Winski oversaw support services for 33,000 soldiers,  50,000 family members, 10,000 civilian employees, and 150,000 retirees.  Prior to the global Covid-19 pandemic, Major General Winski shaped the  way in which the 101st Airborne Division plans and executes emergency  deployment readiness exercises leading the 531st Hospital Center EDRE  and later watched their successful domestic deployment to New York to  provide help in crisis.   Major General Winski's impressive contributions enabled mission  success in some of the toughest and most challenging conditions. The  distinctive accomplishments of Major General Winski reflect great  credit upon himself, the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), the  XVIII Airborne Corps, the U.S. Army, and the Department of Defense. I  join my fellow Kentuckians in honoring Major General Brian Winski with  the Award of Distinguished Service Medal as he served his country with  class and courage.                            ____________________
