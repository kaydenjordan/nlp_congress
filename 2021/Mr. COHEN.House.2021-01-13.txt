 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the  time.   After President Trump was not impeached, Susan Collins said he has  learned a pretty big lesson; he was impeached.   Then he brought his ``It will be wild,'' riotous television show that  he produced for one person, individual one.   Intelligence reports indicate that the people he said he loves and  are special are going to attack this city and attack this Capitol next  week. He has not asked them not to do it. He has not told them to stand  down. I most fear January 20 because I think he will try to go out with  a bang.
