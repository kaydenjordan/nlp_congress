 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the  long career of public service provided to the people of Southern  California by Jeffery Kightlinger, general manager of the Metropolitan  Water District of Southern California, who is retiring after a 15-year  tenure.   I would like to take a few moments to reflect on what an  extraordinary leader Jeff has been not just for Southern California but  for the whole State, Like Jeff, I care deeply about our water future.  For years I have turned to him for his always wise counsel on how to  solve the next challenge. Over these many years, I have come to view  Jeff as a friend and to value our friendship. I have also learned to  value equally his leadership abilities.   The treacherous politics of California water and the immense  obstacles to getting anything done are legendary, but Jeff has always  been up to the task. Jeff is not only one of the smartest people I  know, but he has unparalleled ability to strategize how to approach a  complex water negotiation. He has built deep and trusting relationships  with many of the key players, not only in California but throughout the  Colorado River Basin. Knowing the other parties as well as he does,  Jeff is able to map out where there is the possibility of an agreement.  He then is able to work steadily and patiently over months and years,  gradually removing the obstacles until the parties can finally come  together.   Many of Jeff's greatest accomplishments have come in guiding major  changes within the Colorado River Basin, helping to collaboratively  negotiate landmark pacts among a truce among 7 States, two countries,  and 10 Native American tribes. These include the Quantification  Settlement Agreement, the Lower Colorado River Multi-Species  Conservation Program, significant revisions to the U.S.-Mexico water  treaty, innovative storage programs in Lake Mead, and the Colorado  River Drought Contingency Plan. This has laid a solid foundation for  longer term solutions to be negotiated over the next several years.  Jeff has helped forge Metropolitan's partnerships with agricultural  districts that have replaced litigation with cooperation.   If you evaluate a leader by the results they accomplish, what Jeff  has achieved in preparing Southern California for drought is  extraordinary. In a time when much of the California and the West is  desperate for water, Southern California stands out for how well it is  prepared. Millions of acre feet of water in storage ensures that the  region can weather this drought even if it lasts for several more  years.   It took a whole suite of actions for Jeff and Metropolitan to get to  this place. Knowing that the climate is changing and droughts will  worsen, Metropolitan has invested, planned, and prepared, resulting in  record water storage, reduced water usage in the region, and  unprecedented drought resiliency. This didn't happen by itself.  Metropolitan's conservation programs, including $350 million in turf  removal incentives, transformed the Southern California landscape as  Southern Californians embraced conservation as a way of life and  permanently lowered water demands. Metropolitan has also launched the  Regional Recycled Water Program Advanced Purification Center, a  500,000-gallon-per-day demonstration facility that could ultimately  serve as one of the largest recycled water projects in the Nation.   Under Jeff's leadership, Metropolitan weathered the great recession  and stabilized its finances while investing billions in restoring its  aging conveyance system and improving its water treatment methods,  setting a national example for how an agency can meet its  infrastructure challenges. His record of environmental stewardship  includes installing solar power at Metropolitan's water treatment  plants and leading the organization's first efforts to address climate  change. Through apprenticeships, recruitment, and promotions,  Metropolitan was able to transfer the specialized knowledge of graying  workforce to a new, diverse generation of water leaders.   No history of 21st century water in California and the West would be  complete without acknowledging his contributions. Jeff has been an  invaluable resource to myself, my staff, and those of numerous other  Members with his expert analysis and advice that has informed our  legislative work. His knowledge and counsel will be greatly missed. I  ask our colleagues to join me in congratulating Jeff Kightlinger on his  retirement and thanking him for his long career of public service to  the people of Southern California.                            ____________________
