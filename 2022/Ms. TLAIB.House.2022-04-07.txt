 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Restaurant  Revitalization Fund Act which included an amendment that I worked on  with my team and many of the folks that led this effort to prohibit the  funds from going to businesses who have committed wage theft against  their employees.   This simple change will make sure that our valuable Federal dollars  are being used to support businesses who do right by their workers, not  those who rip off their workers and steal their labor.   There is no doubt that a thriving restaurant industry is good for  everyone, but it is the workers who really make the restaurants and  businesses who they are today. And workers are the reason that so many  of them made it through this awful and continued pandemic.   We cannot leave those workers behind, as I said, and with this bill  and my amendment, we are making clear that if you cheat or exploit your  employees, the Federal Government will not do business with you.   As I continue to work in Congress to end wage theft and expand the  powers of our workers, I want to thank my colleagues, again, Chairwoman  Nydia Velazquez, as well as Congressman Dean Phillips, for their work  in improving this bill and moving it forward. I urge the Senate to take  this bill up as soon as possible.                            ____________________
