 Madam Speaker, I am pleased to join my  colleague, Mr. Matt Cartwright, once again as cosponsor on the RECLAIM  Act. This bipartisan legislation focuses on reauthorizing the abandoned  mine land fund, or the AML fund.   My district, Pennsylvania 15, has the most abandoned coal mines in  the country, and reauthorizing the AML fund will provide opportunities  and funding to clean up the abandoned land, not just in my district,  but across the Nation.   Coal mining built America. It powered us onto the world's stage. It  helped us win two world wars and brought our Nation into the modern  era.   The AML is set to expire this year. While we continue to make  progress on environmental restoration, reauthorizing the fund is  crucial to support clean-up efforts and spur economic development.   Madam Speaker, Congress has a great opportunity to do right by  Pennsylvania and other great coal mining States by reauthorizing the  abandoned mine land fund, which is not funded by tax dollars but by a  fee that has been placed on every ton of coal mined since 1977. Those  moneys are sitting there in the Federal Treasury, and we need to  reauthorize that abandoned mine land fund to further the redevelopment  of the scars of the water and the land in those abandoned lands.                            ____________________
