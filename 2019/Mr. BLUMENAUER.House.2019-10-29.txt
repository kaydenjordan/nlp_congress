 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy,  and I appreciate his words.   Mr. Speaker, for years, we have danced around this. It is complex  with the Turks, in terms of the relationship that we have tried to deal  with. But denying genocide has not helped resolve those issues. It  hasn't changed the behavior of the Turks.   Look at what is happening with the Kurds today. Failure to  acknowledge this horrific episode is a burden for us all--standing up  for human rights, acknowledging the truth, giving a sense of closure  and solace to the people who endured this horrific activity, and making  sure that we are united in our opposition to those genocidal  activities.   Sadly, unless and until the Turks own their history, acknowledge it,  they are not going to be able to move past it. This is a chapter that  needs a spotlight shone on it.   I appreciate this formal acknowledgment by the House of  Representatives. I think it is a first step toward healing, and it is  an important step toward preventing tragedies like this in the future.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support it, and I look forward to its  passage on the floor of the House.
