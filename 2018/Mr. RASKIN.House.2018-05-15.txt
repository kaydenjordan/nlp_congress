 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 613, the Lieutenant Osvaldo  Albarati Correctional Officer Self-Protection Act of 2017. I support  this bipartisan and commonsense bill to facilitate the ability of  Federal Bureau of Prisons correctional officers to carry personal  firearms for protection as they commute to and from their jobs.   This bill would allow the Bureau's correctional officers to protect  themselves without jeopardizing the safety and the security of the  facilities in which they work.   Currently, Bureau of Prisons correctional officers are authorized to  carry concealed firearms for self-protection while off duty under the  Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act, and this bill doesn't alter that  existing privilege.   Instead, because there is no mechanism today to allow these  correctional officers to store firearms that they might carry during  their commutes to and from work, they are precluded from bringing their  personal firearms onto the premises of these facilities and are  therefore, in effect, precluded from carrying firearms for personal  protection as they travel to and from the workplace.   To address this problem, H.R. 613 requires the Bureau of Prisons to  allow properly qualified correctional officers to bring their firearms  onto the premises of Bureau facilities in a manner that minimizes  possible security and safety risks.                                time  1600    The Bureau would be required to either provide correctional officers  with a secure storage area for their firearms located outside the  secure perimeter of the prison or allow the officers to store their  firearms in vehicle lockboxes approved by the Bureau.   Without question, correctional officers perform an essential and,  indeed, an indispensable function within our criminal justice system,  and we depend on them to keep all of our facilities safe, secure, and  efficiently run for everyone. For some correctional officers, the  inability to carry a firearm to and from work could leave them  vulnerable to someone attempting to do them harm.   This bill is named, as my distinguished colleague from Virginia said,  in honor of Lieutenant Osvaldo Albarati, a Bureau officer who was  ambushed and murdered as he drove home from his job at a Bureau  detention center. Lieutenant Albarati was specifically targeted for the  work he was doing at the institution.   We hope this legislation will prevent any future lethal attack on our  officers. Accordingly, I would commend Mr. Goodlatte and others, the  sponsor of the bill, for bringing this important measure forward, and I  encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, as we recognize our hardworking law  enforcement officers across America this week and honor those, like  Lieutenant Albarati, who have given their lives to keep the rest of us  safe, I am very proud to reiterate my support for the legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), the ranking member of the Criminal Justice  Subcommittee, to control.
