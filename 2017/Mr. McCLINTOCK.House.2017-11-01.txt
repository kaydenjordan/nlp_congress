 Mr. Chairman, 45 years ago, Congress enacted laws,  such as the National Environmental Policy Act, that promised to improve  the health of our forests. They imposed what have become endlessly  time-consuming and, ultimately, cost-prohibitive restrictions on our  ability to properly manage our national forests so that we can match  the tree density with the ability of the land to support it.   I think after 45 years of experience with these laws, we are entitled  to ask: How are our forests doing? The answer is damning. Our forests  are now catastrophically overgrown, often carrying four times the  number of trees that the land can support. In this stressed and  weakened condition, our forests are easy prey for drought, disease,  pestilence, and fire.   There is an old adage that excess timber comes out of the forest one  way or the other--it is either carried out or it burns out. When we  carried it out, we had resilient, healthy forests and a thriving  economy, as excess timber was sold and harvested before it could choke  our forests to death. In the years since then, we have seen an 80  percent decline in timber sales from our Federal lands and a  concomitant increase in acreage destroyed by forest fire. I would  remind my friend from Oregon that timber sales used to generate us  money, not cost us money.   The direct revenues and spin-off commerce generated by these sales  provided a stream of revenues that we could then use to improve our  national forests and share with the local communities affected.   The Resilient Federal Forests Act begins to move us back towards  sound and scientific forest management practices. It requires forest  managers to consider the cost of no action alternatives; it streamlines  fire and disease prevention programs and ensures that fire-killed  timber can be quickly removed to create both revenues and room to  restore fire-damaged lands; it ends the practice of raiding prevention  funds to fight fires; it streamlines onerous environmental review  processes without sacrificing environmental protection; and it provides  our forest managers with alternatives to resolve frivolous lawsuits.   Provisions that streamline the environmental reviews were already  signed into law last year for the Tahoe Basin, and the Forest Service  regional manager told me that is going to take their revenue processes  from 800 pages down to 40 pages and allow them to get their forest  there back to a sustainable level.   We made some very big mistakes 45 years ago, and our forests have  paid the price. This bill starts the long process of correcting those  mistakes and recovering our national forests, and I urge its adoption.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record two letters, one from the South  Tahoe Public Utility District, and the second from the Public Lands  Council and the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, in support of  H.R. 2936.                                                     June 22, 2017.      Hon. Rob Bishop,      Chairman, House Committee on Natural Resources, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Raul Grijalva,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Energy and Natural           Resources, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Bishop and Ranking Member Grijalva: As       entities responsible for delivering sustainable water supply       and renewable hydropower for millions of citizens throughout       the western U.S., we are writing in support of H.R. 2936, the       Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2017. National Forest lands       are the largest single source of water in the U.S. and in       some regions of the west contribute nearly 50% of the overall       water supply that supports our farms and cities. The current,       unhealthy state of these forests, which contain some of the       nation's most valuable watersheds, increases the threat of       catastrophic wildfires. These high intensity wildfires       jeopardize the reliability, volume and quality of water for       tens of millions of  [[Page H8337]]       Americans, along with the wildlife, recreational, and multi-      purpose value of these lands.        The H.R. 2936 supports collaborative forest management,       streamlines the environmental review process, addresses the       unsustainable practice of fire borrowing, and includes an       innovative arbitration process. We believe it is critical       that both forest management reforms and resolution of the       ``fire borrowing'' issue are addressed in any legislation to       ensure on-the-ground forest restoration activities can       proceed at the pace and scale of the problem.        We appreciate your leadership on this important issue and       urge prompt passage of H.R. 2936, the Resilient Federal       Forests Act of 2017.            Sincerely,      National Water Resources Association.      Utah Water Users Association.      Association of California Water Agencies.      Placer County Water Agency.      South Tahoe Public Utility District.                                   ____                                                      June 27, 2017.      Hon. Rob Bishop,      Chairman, House Natural Resources Committee, Washington, DC.      Hon. Raul Grijalva,      Ranking Member, House Natural Resources Committee,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Bishop and Ranking Member Grijalva: The       Public Lands Council (PLC) and the National Cattlemen's Beef       Association (NCBA) strongly support H.R. 2936, the Resilient       Federal Forests Act of 2017, introduced by Rep. Bruce       Westerman (R-Ark.). PLC is the only national organization       dedicated solely to representing the roughly 22,000 ranchers       who operate on federal lands. NCBA is the beef industry's       largest and oldest national marketing and trade association,       representing American cattlemen and women who provide much of       the nation's supply of food and own or manage a large portion       of America's private property.        The Resilient Federal Forests Act will expedite       environmental reviews and assessments for the removal of dead       trees and set deadlines for reforestation projects to occur.       Such changes ensure forests are no longer neglected and       establish a healthier management pattern. Further, this       legislation discourages frivolous litigation by requiring       litigants who oppose a management project to come to the       table with an alternative, rather than just tying up agency       time and resources in court. The bill provides an incentive       for collaborative efforts between local governments, local       stakeholders and federal land management agencies. Finally,       the legislation prevents ``fire borrowing'' and stops federal       agencies from raiding accounts necessary for proper forest       and range management.        The severe mismanagement of federally-owned forests and       rangelands, due to outdated environmental laws and       regulations along with the abuse of the legal system by       radical special interest groups, creates devastating economic       hardship and danger for our members and rural communities       across the west. The livestock industry and rural economies       will spend decades attempting to recover from millions of       dollars' worth of infrastructure damage and forage loss that       have been the result of catastrophic wildfires in recent       years, not to mention the loss of valuable wildlife habitats.        It is scientifically proven that proper timber management       and rangeland management through grazing is the key to       maintaining healthy forests and preventing catastrophic       wildfires. However, according to the BLM, livestock grazing       has been reduced on BLM lands by as much as 50 percent since       1971, while the timber industry has been all but destroyed       over the last 30 years, due almost entirely to federal laws       and regulations and predatory environmental groups.       Restrictions have allowed the accumulation of fuel,       increasing risk of wildfires and leading to harm of forest       ecosystems and western communities--the watershed, wildlife,       air quality, rural communities and the taxpayers are all       negatively impacted.        PLC and NCBA believe that H.R. 2936 is a positive step       forward to returning management flexibility and fiscal       responsibility to the federal land management agencies. PLC       and NCBA appreciate the opportunity to provide our input on       behalf of our members--the nation's food and fiber producers.       H.R. 2936 is proactive, common sense legislation, and we       would encourage the committee to pass the bill out of       committee without delay.            Sincerely,      Dave Eliason,        President, Public Lands Council.      Craig Uden,        President, National Cattlemen's Beef Association.
