 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to  2 minutes on the next three nominations.    Mr. President, fellow Senators, I rise today to urge an  affirmative vote on all three of the next appointments that are up.   The first one is Nicholas Burns to be Ambassador to China; and next  is Mr. Toloui, who is up for Assistant Secretary of State for Economic  and Business Affairs; and also Mr. Hussain, who is up for Ambassador  for International Religious Freedom. The Foreign Relations Committee  has looked at all three of these very closely.   Let me spend just a moment with Mr. Burns. I have known Mr. Burns  since his postings in Europe many, many years ago. If you are looking  for a bipartisan person to put in the position, this is your guy. When  I knew him, he was working for an administration, a Republican  administration.   He has done an outstanding job, has an outstanding reputation amongst  the cadre of Ambassadors, and I would urge that we confirm him and have  him in place in China. This is a tough posting, as we all know, at the  current time. We have got a lot of issues that exist between us and  China, and certainly Ambassador Burns is the one to carry our water  there.   The other two I can tell you that, without hesitation, both have been  scrubbed by the committee and been asked the questions that are  appropriate for both of these positions. We feel very comfortable in  recommending them to the body.   With that, I yield the floor.    We yield back also.
