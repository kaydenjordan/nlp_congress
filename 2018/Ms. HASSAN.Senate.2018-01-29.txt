 Mr. President, I rise today to oppose dangerous  legislation that would endanger the health of women by limiting their  constitutional right to access a safe and legal abortion. We must  recognize the capacity of every woman in our Nation to make her own  healthcare decisions, control her own destiny, and ensure that all  women have the full independence to do so.   Unfortunately, throughout the last year, the Trump administration and  Republicans in Congress have repeatedly tried to roll back access to  care and undermine the health of women. We have seen bill after bill  targeting women's healthcare by restricting access to abortion,  increasing the costs of maternity care, and allowing insurers to treat  giving birth as a preexisting condition.   The Trump administration issued interim final rules, allowing  employers to deny women access to the birth control coverage they need.  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have confirmed Trump  administration officials and judges to the bench who are vehemently  opposed to a woman's right to make her own reproductive health  decisions. Republicans have been relentless in their attempts to defund  Planned Parenthood, which is an essential source of care for women in  New Hampshire and provides key services like birth control and cancer  screenings.   Here we are, once again, with Republican leadership bringing a bill  to the floor that attempts to marginalize women and take away their  rights to make their own decisions. This bill  [[Page S547]]  would ban abortions after 20 weeks--an extremely rare procedure that is  often the result of complex and difficult medical circumstances. The  bill lacks adequate exceptions for survivors of rape or incest, and it  gets in the way of a woman and the judgment of her doctor, threatening  to jail physicians for providing patients the care they need.   In fact, a group of medical and public health organizations have  written to Congress, saying: This bill places healthcare providers in  an untenable situation. When they are facing a complex, urgent medical  situation they must think about an unjust law instead of about how to  protect the health and safety of their patients.   This bill is a direct challenge to the precedent set in Roe V. Wade.  We are at a moment in our country when women are speaking out and  fighting for basic dignity and respect at home, in the workplace, and  in their daily lives. They also deserve that respect with regard to the  most deeply personal health decisions they can make.   Passing this legislation would send a message to women across the  country that politicians in Washington do not believe that women have  the capacity to make their own healthcare decisions--as if women don't  understand or are unable to grapple with the physical, emotional,  economic, and spiritual issues that are involved in deciding when or if  to have a family or how to handle critical health challenges.   Rather than marginalizing women, we should be doing everything we can  to include them in the bipartisan work we need to do on priorities to  move our Nation forward. Divisive and partisan bills like this one  undermine women and undermine our strength as a country. I was proud to  join many of my colleagues in voting against this bill, and I am glad  that it has failed in the Senate today.   I thank the Presiding Officer.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Abir Dhalimi,  a fellow in my office, be granted floor privileges through August 31,  2018.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.  [[Page S554]]                                ____________________
