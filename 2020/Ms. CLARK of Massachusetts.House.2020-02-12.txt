 Madam Speaker, in 1970 in this very  Chamber the first African American woman elected to Congress, Shirley  Chisholm, said:   There is an unspoken assumption that women are different. Artificial  distinctions between persons must be wiped out of the law.   Congresswoman Chisholm was calling for the passage of the equal  rights amendment. Fifty years later and a century after securing the  right to vote, I stand before you, Madam Speaker, with the same call to  action.   I stand before you as a Member of the 116th Congress with the  greatest proportion of women Members in our history and a female  Speaker, but yet as a woman, my rights remain unprotected in the  Constitution.   The majority of Americans are women, but yet our Constitution does  not fully and explicitly include our mothers, daughters, grandmothers,  aunts, and neighbors.   Our Constitution is not just a founding document. It is a  foundational document to equality under the law. It is time to reflect  the truths that have become self-evident, that all people are created  equal. It is time to pass the equal rights amendment.                            ____________________
