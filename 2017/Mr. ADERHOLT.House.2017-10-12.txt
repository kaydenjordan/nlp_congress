 Madam Speaker, today I rise to recognize the tremendous  work of Elizabeth Dent, who has been an invaluable part of the staff of  the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture for the past 3  years. Elizabeth came to work with the subcommittee I chair after  working several years with a former appropriator, Congressman Jack  Kingston.   Elizabeth has been a valuable member of the subcommittee team. She is  diligent, dedicated, and keen to details, something that is very  important to the appropriations work.   She is always eager to volunteer and lend a hand to accomplish  whatever tasks may be needed in assisting in the agricultural  community. She has become an integral part of the team, and she will be  greatly missed on our subcommittee.   Elizabeth will be leaving the House Appropriations Subcommittee on  Agriculture to work for the Senate Agriculture Appropriations  Committee. I thank her for her outstanding work. The Senate  Appropriations Committee is very fortunate to have her work on the  staff. We wish her all the very best, and we look forward to working  with her in her new capacity.                            ____________________
