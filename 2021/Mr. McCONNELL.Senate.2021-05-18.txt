 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, recent headlines have reinforced a  warning that Republicans and economic experts have been articulating  literally for months: The massive spending the Democrats insisted upon  at the outset of the Biden administration was not in step with actual  needs.   Yesterday, I talked about some of the ways the multitrillion-dollar  spending spree rammed through in March has actually delayed our  reopening and our recovery: about the disappointing fall-off in hiring,  despite a historic number of open jobs, after the Democrats renewed a  Federal program that pays people extra not to work. Well, here is  another misplaced priority from that spending spree: our Democratic  friends' insistence on stuffing another wheelbarrow of cash into the  accounts of State and local governments that were already rebounding  from the crisis.   Back in February, as the Democrats insisted States were in dire need  of another huge bailout, 29 of the 50 States were actually closing a  12-month chapter in which their revenues met or exceeded the year  before. Twenty-nine of the fifty States were actually closing a 12- month chapter in which their revenues met or exceeded the year before  the pandemic.   The faster-than-expected economic recovery, combined with the five  bipartisan bills Congress passed in 2020, left a lot of cities and  States in even better shape in exiting the pandemic than they were  heading into it. Rising tax revenues had put these States in a position  not only to weather pandemic-related downturns but to fill in  preexisting budgetary potholes that actually had nothing to do with  COVID hardships.   Of course, that didn't stop the Democrats from cramming nearly  another $200 billion in State bailouts into the American Rescue Plan.  Impressively, California got its hands on $26 billion of the $200  billion. By the way, the State of California now claims it already has  a budget surplus three times that size--three times that size of a  budget surplus--and we are sending them another $26 billion.   They are having to brainstorm new ideas to spend the unneeded  avalanche of cash. I understand the State's Governor has come up with  one idea he likes. He is planning to cut a timely round of State-level  stimulus checks to include people who are in the country illegally-- just in time for his recall election later this year. Is that the kind  of urgent priority the Democrats had in mind when they used COVID to  push through what they called the ``most progressive'' legislation in  history?   Experts warned it was poorly targeted, and Republicans said American  families deserved better, but the big catalog of political payouts was  pushed right through. Let's remember exactly how this played out before  we are doomed to repeat it again.                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, on an entirely different matter,  yesterday, the Senate took a step toward considering wide-ranging  legislation that would touch on multiple parts of the U.S. economy in  the name of increasing innovation and competitiveness.   A secure, productive, and innovative America that can outcompete  China is something that all 100 Senators want. Of course, in a place  like the Senate, you are guaranteed to find a wide variety of different  ideas about the best ways to encourage that. A number of our colleagues  have assembled a proposal that touches on a long list of subjects-- everything from funding universities, to regional economic development,  to Indo-Pacific geopolitics, to artificial intelligence, to cyber  security, and beyond. Legislation this broad needs a thorough, robust,  and bipartisan floor process, including a healthy series of amendment  votes.   As one of my Republican colleagues--the ranking member on the  Commerce Committee--explained, as he supported moving the legislation  out of committee, the current draft is ``not ready for prime time'' yet  and deserves a robust process here on the floor.   I understand this bill has come to the floor with a bipartisan  understanding and the Democratic leader's assurances that there won't  be an effort to close debate on amendments prematurely. So I look  forward to the Senate's considering these important issues, and I hope  all of this interest in our competition with China will lead our  Democratic friends to rethink President Biden's intention to cut our  defense spending after inflation. The single best thing we can do to  stay competitive with China is to give our Armed Forces the resources  they need to stay competitive with China.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on one final matter, sometime soon, we  also expect to vote on a Democratic resolution to overturn a rule put  in place by the previous administration. Under Republican leadership,  the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission--an aggressive Washington  regulator of the American job market--issued modified marching orders  that increased transparency and decreased the odds of expensive  lawsuits.   Several years back, one investigation found the EEOC had become very  aggressive and was perpetrating a kind of legal harassment on job  creators, often leaving American taxpayers on the hook for court cases  which the Commission had actually lost. Taxpayers were paying to sue  job creators and lose in court, so the Republicans updated their  guidance. It was the first substantial update of the way the EEOC  handles disputes and conciliation since 1977. It said that the employer  in question deserves a written summary of the facts behind a complaint,  a written explanation of the legal justification, a few other details,  and 14 days to respond. Sounds pretty reasonable. This helps ensure the  Commission is making a good-faith effort to see if the dispute can be  settled outside of court before beginning a costly, adversarial  process.   Apparently, even these modest steps were too much for my friends on  the Democratic side. They want to roll back this progress. A number of  groups have asked them not to do this, from small business owners, to  builders and contractors, to restaurant owners, to retailers, and  beyond. These are the same employers who are already struggling to  climb back out of this pandemic and rehire workers. They don't need any  more Washington headwinds in their faces, and taxpayers don't need more  of their dollars being funneled back toward trial lawyers. So I would  urge Senators to vote against this resolution so the current, improved  rule can actually be left in place.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
