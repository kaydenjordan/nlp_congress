 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of my  friend, Roger Nicholson.   I love this photo because this was a really great day with two of  Roger's, I like to say, greatest friends. Maurice was his buddy that he  traveled all over Colorado with, and Roger caused a lot of trouble on  the way, too.   Roger is the embodiment of what I love about Coloradans, with his  fighting spirit and grand vision for the future and his faith in the  American Dream.   Roger immigrated to the United States legally as a child. And  starting from nothing, his mother gave everything to build a life for  their family through the promise of opportunity.   Roger often told me how I reminded him of his mom. I will cherish  that comparison all my life.   The lessons Roger learned from his mother's grit pushed him forward  as he strove to make something great out of his life as a businessman;  a friend to all; most importantly, a husband to his beautiful bride,  Bobbie; a fierce father; and a loving grandfather.   Roger was my friend--stubborn, ornery, funny, and driven. Roger's  support was rock solid, and his dedication to the fight for freedom was  unmatched.   Roger's legacy will live on through the conservative movement in his  community and in his family.   To spend time with Roger was to live in the moment and cherish every  spoken word. Even during our last conversation, Roger was full of spunk  and optimism. Joy was his strength until the end.   My friend Roger understood life, and he had the tough skin and tender  heart to prove it.   I love you, Roger, and we miss you greatly.                            ____________________
