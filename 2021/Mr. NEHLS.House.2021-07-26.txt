 Mr. Speaker, it is nearly August, a full 7 months since  the Biden administration assumed control of the White House, and still  there is no end in sight for the Biden border crisis.   It has been a month since Biden border czar, Kamala Harris, hopped  off of her jet for 90 minutes for a photo shoot near the border, which  she dubbed as a southern border visit, and still nothing has changed.   March was the highest month on record for illegal crossings until  April. April was the highest month on record for illegal crossings  until May. May was the highest month on record for illegal crossings  until June. And we are on pace to set another record in July.   How many records must be broken, crimes committed, victims trafficked  before the Biden administration wakes  [[Page H3851]]  up to the roaring crisis at our southern border?   The American people are sick and tired of the talk. They are sick and  tired of excuses. They are sick and tired of the political games.  Enough is enough. Secure the southern border.                            ____________________
