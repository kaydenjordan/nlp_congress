 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the truth and justice.    Twenty years ago, we suffered the worst external terrorist attack in  our modern history. But the gravest attack ever on American democracy  came 175 days ago. That attack was borne of big lies; big lies about  the election, about voting, and about our democracy. The lies divided  our country. They spread like a plague.   On December 11, I warned of elected officials amplifying big lies.  The 14th Amendment is clear about traitors and seditionists on the day  the electors tried to do their job. Think about it. We must now hold  everyone responsible. We must know how the spark of insurrection was  ignited and document who fanned the flames.   Madam Speaker, we have a duty to history. Our review will guide  future generations.
