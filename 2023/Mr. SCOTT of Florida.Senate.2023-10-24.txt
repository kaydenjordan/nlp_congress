 Mr. President, this week marks a monumental  occasion in enhancing our national security when Eastern Shipbuilding  Group's Nelson Shipyard in Panama City, FL, officially christens and  launches the U.S. Coast Guard Offshore Patrol Cutter Argus (WMSM-915).  The first in its class, the Argus is paving the way of replacing an  aging fleet of cutters and improving the capabilities needed to respond  to an array of national security threats across a dynamic maritime  domain.   Businesses like Eastern Shipbuilding Group and their many skilled  workers and suppliers, are the backbone of our economy as they continue  to create opportunities for the people of Florida  [[Page S5139]]  and expand the national security capabilities of our country. The  official christening and launch will be celebrated on October 27, 2023.  We, members of the U.S. Senate, recognize the ongoing service of  Eastern Shipbuilding Group to provide our military with capable, war- ready ships and thank the U.S. Coast Guard for ensuring the safety and  well-being of Americans across the Nation.                            ____________________
