 Mr. Speaker, I come from the State, Texas, that  has the highest percentage of people who have absolutely no healthcare  coverage, who use the emergency room as their health provider, and who  also have serious health challenges.   For Texans, if this bill passes, it means that the following things  will no longer be in their insurance policy or they will be charged  jacked-up fees for them: outpatient care; emergency room trips; in- hospital care; pregnancy, maternity, and newborn care; mental health  and substance abuse disorder services; prescription drugs;  rehabilitative services and habilitative services; lab tests;  preventative services; and pediatric services.   It should also be noted that, with this bill, about 660,000 Texans  would lose their healthcare coverage.
