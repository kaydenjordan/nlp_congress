 Mr. Speaker, with the opioid and heroin crisis, the  American people are currently facing one of the worst drug epidemics in  our Nation's history. My State of Colorado is certainly not immune.   In my travels throughout the Third Congressional District, from  Pueblo to Moffat County, up and down the west slope, through the San  Luis Valley, I hear of more lives lost with each passing year. Opioid  addiction knows no bounds, and even the most innocent have been  affected.   This last year, when I toured Parkview Medical Center in Pueblo,  Colorado, and visited the unit that treats babies who are born with  neonatal abstinence syndrome, which means that they were exposed to  opiates before they were born and suffer withdrawal at the moment of  birth, you see a truly heartbreaking situation. To see the most  vulnerable suffering from withdrawal symptoms is something that touches  the heart of every American. But it also served as a reminder that we  must be more aggressive and more inventive in our efforts to be able to  end this epidemic.   Opioid abuse is multifaceted, and there is not just one solution that  will solve this problem. That is why I have held more than 30 opioid  roundtables in various communities throughout my district, to be able  to hear from healthcare providers, law enforcement officers, and first  responders on the front lines of the fight against addiction; to learn  how the Federal Government can play a better role in supporting those  efforts.   In these roundtables, I have learned that opioid abuse often begins  in the last place that you would expect it to: the doctor's office or a  hospital emergency room. For example, a person who sprained their ankle  while skiing may go to their doctor to be receiving pain medication for  their injury. This medication may provide relief from the pain, but it  can also provide an intense sense of euphoria. From there, there is the  possibility that an addiction is born.   According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, of those who began  using opioids in the 2000s, a whopping 75 percent reported that their  first opioid was a prescription drug.   Colorado has the 12th highest rate of abuse of prescription opioids  across the Nation. In response to the rising number of Coloradans  becoming addicted through prescribed opioids, the Colorado Hospital  Association launched a pilot program in 10 hospital emergency  departments across the State with the goal of reducing prescribed  opioids by 15 percent. This program was so successful that it actually  achieved a 36 percent reduction.   I am glad that, this week, the House passed a series of more than 20  bills in a bipartisan effort to curb opioid addiction. Included in this  series was the bill I was proud to help introduce called the  Alternatives to Opioids in the Emergency Department Act. This bill  would allow programs similar to the one in Colorado to be tested in  hospital emergency departments across the Nation, helping to ensure  that people who do not need opioids are never exposed to them in the  first place.   Mr. Speaker, I stand here proud of the collective work accomplished  in the House this week, but recognizing that this crisis will not be  solved overnight, and we still have a long road ahead. It is not an  issue that is going to be solved solely by the Federal Government. It  is going to take a collaborative effort with our States, our local  governments, and our families as well in addressing this problem.   We must continue to work together to end the stigma surrounding  opioid abuse and find innovative solutions that will end this crisis  for good.                            ____________________
