 Mr. Speaker, throughout my tenure in Congress, I  have been so proud to work and promote LGBT equality here at home and  around the globe.   When I was first elected as a Member of this distinguished body in  1989, our country was in a very different place than it is today in how  we understood people who are LGBT and the rights and the respect due  them.   Although much progress still needs to be made, it is true that we are  moving in the right direction. Let me give you some examples, Mr.  Speaker:   By voting to end the misguided Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy;   By funding much-needed human rights programs abroad, implemented by a  wonderful agency, USAID, such as its LGBT Global Development  Partnership;   By endorsing the principle of equality as it applies to marriage  rights and responsibilities;   By including LGBT individuals within nondiscrimination provisions and  by ensuring that these and other services funded by this body are made  available without regard to sexual orientation or gender identity.   As a founding member of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus, I  have continued to build on these successes by supporting education  legislation, including:   The Student Non-Discrimination bill to end bullying and harassment  continually faced by LGBT students throughout our Nation;   Adoption bills, such as Every Child Deserves a Family Act;   Legislation to modernize laws and eliminate discrimination with  respect to people living with HIV/AIDS; and   The Equality Act, which gives consistent protection for LGBT  individuals across existing civil rights laws.  [[Page H9699]]    Each one of these efforts seeks to put an end to the discrimination  and to the violence against individuals as a result of their sexual  orientation or their gender identity, and I believe each one of them is  so strong and deserves to continue to be an American value because  discrimination of any kind runs counter to who we are as Americans.   As a refugee from the brutal communist, the dictatorship in Cuba, I  have always viewed my adopted homeland, the United States, as a symbol  of freedom, of equality, of opportunity; and these are fundamental  values that must be applied to everyone in our country, regardless of  who they are or whom they love.   The United States has a unique and important role in the world. Many  people look to us for leadership. They aspire to be like us. They  emulate our values. So, as a country, we have the opportunity and the  awesome responsibility to promote the best of our American values.   One way to do this is to take a stand against the violence, against  the harassment, against the discrimination that LGBT community members  face around the world. Mr. Speaker, I will give some examples.   Our American values dictate that we should respect and embolden  individual freedoms for all. That is our guiding principle. But in 70  countries throughout the world, being gay or transgender is cause  enough to be locked away, imprisoned. In seven of these countries, the  penalty is death.   Our State Department Human Rights Report, a report that Congress has  requested or mandated be filled out every year, is reported to us. It  is filled with examples of abuses, of discrimination, of  violence carried out against LGBT individuals everywhere.    In Russia, basic political freedoms of speech, of assembly, and of  expression are denied to those who are LGBT. In the Russian republic of  Chechnya, Chechen government officials are directly responsible for  rounding up and executing LGBT individuals. We in Congress condemn  these actions by Chechen authorities through a resolution that I  authored and we passed.   In Egypt, LGBT individuals have been subjected to forced exams in  order to prove if someone is gay, whatever that means; and, later, they  are incarcerated.   In Indonesia and Nigeria, gay men have been stoned.   In Jamaica, lesbians have been subjected to rape, purportedly to  correct their sexual orientation.   In Brazil and in many Central American countries, transgender  individuals have been subjected to abuse and murder.   This is unimaginable in our country, but those are but a few examples  of the range of injustices and disrespect that LGBT individuals face  around the world.   Those who remain in their countries face these humiliations. They are  even denied employment, employment that they need in order to feed  their families. And those who seek to flee their countries to escape a  fate that you and I cannot even imagine are often denied the expedited  refugee protection that they need.   So, Mr. Speaker, as my time serving in this body comes to a close, my  fight for what is right will not end. I say to my colleagues: We may be  from different parties, we may have different points of view and  different philosophies, and we might serve on different committees, but  I ask us all to commit, beginning today, to working across the aisle  with a view to becoming more consistent, more fair, more respectful,  and more principled on this issue. We as a country need to take action  to set the right example.   There are many issues upon which we as a body may never agree, but  LGBT equality should not be one of them.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I am so proud to rise today to  recognize Ira Leesfield and congratulate him on receiving the 2018  Lawyers for Children America's Janet Reno Outstanding Community Partner  Award.   As a University of Florida Law School graduate, Ira proved himself to  be an intelligent and driven individual from the very beginning of his  legal career. Upon graduation, Ira entered the honors program at the  U.S. Department of Justice and served as a trial attorney in the U.S.  Army and in the Judge Advocate General's Corps before opening his own  practice in 1976.   Since then, Ira has become well known for his work throughout our  State and the U.S., where he has consistently made it his mission to be  a voice for the less fortunate and those in need.   In the early 1990s, Ira established the Leesfield Family Foundation,  which supports both local and national nonprofits, and emphasizes  protecting the elderly and underprivileged women and children in our  south Florida community.   Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Ira on this  well-deserved recognition. I thank him for  [[Page H9701]]  his tremendous efforts throughout the years, and I am so honored to  call Ira Leesfield my amigo.                            ____________________
