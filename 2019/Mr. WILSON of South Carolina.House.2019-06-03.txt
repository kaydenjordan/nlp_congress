 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, congratulations to Prime  Minister Narendra Modi for his landslide victory on May 23, as 600  million Indians went to the polls.   After the elections, Prime Minister Modi called for a ``strong and  inclusive India.'' According to The Washington Times, Modi said, ``This  election has become a movement of social unity,'' and that his  government would work to earn the trust of all Indians, including  religious minorities such as Muslims and Christians.   India's rising global standing is due in large part to the leadership  of Prime Minister Modi, who has promoted free enterprise to create  jobs. His reelection reinforces the strategic partnership between India  and the United States.   Best wishes to Prime Minister Modi on his next term. India is  appreciated as the world's largest democracy by America, which is the  oldest democracy. India is well represented in Washington by Ambassador  Harsh Vardhan Shringla.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
