Madam President, I know people outside the beltway think  nothing ever happens here--and certainly that nothing ever happens on a  bipartisan basis--but they would be wrong on both counts.   Last night, the Senate passed a piece of bipartisan legislation  called the American Law Enforcement Heroes Act. It is a great example  of legislation everyone can agree on and get behind.   The main goal is to connect veterans--those who have served in our  military and have a passion for public service--to opportunities in  State and local law enforcement. When we think about it, who better  than our retiring military personnel who are accustomed to wearing one  uniform, moving then into the civilian law enforcement world wearing  another uniform but continuing their legacy of public service. That  way, those who have voluntarily put themselves in harm's way to keep  the peace and promote American interests abroad and defend our homeland  can continue the record of public service at home.   For veterans, that can mean a rewarding job in law enforcement.  Through their training, experience, and sacrifice, there is no doubt  that our veterans are equipped with valuable skills to keep our  communities safe. By prioritizing existing Federal funds for State and  local law enforcement agencies to hire veterans, we can better serve  them as they transition into civilian life. We know that can be a  challenging transition, but that is exactly what the American Law  Enforcement Heroes Act that we passed yesterday does.   For State and local law enforcement groups, that means they can  attract the best qualified men and women who are eager to serve their  country in a new way. So this is really a win-win.   Fortunately, this legislation builds on the good work already  underway in places like my home State of Texas. Over the last several  months, I have had a chance to visit cities and counties all over the  State that are actively recruiting veterans to serve as police officers  or sheriffs. That includes law enforcement leaders from San Antonio to  Houston, to Fort Worth. As my colleagues may recall, following the  terrible killing of five police officers and shooting of seven more in  Dallas, Police Chief David Brown made an appeal for people who were  protesting or otherwise concerned about the law enforcement agencies  involved to sign up and join them--to be a part of the solution and not  just protesting the problem.   Thankfully, we have set a tremendous example in Texas of how hiring  veterans to serve as law enforcement officers benefits all of our  communities. I am glad this bill will follow their inspiration and help  communities across the country hire more veterans.   I said before that this legislation is something everyone can agree  on, in a polarized political environment, and that is of course evident  by the broad bipartisan support it has received.   Let me express my gratitude to the senior Senator from Minnesota, Ms.  Klobuchar, as well as the senior Senators from Connecticut and  California--all Democratic colleagues--for being my original cosponsors  on the bill. I am also grateful to my Republican colleagues, including  Senator Cruz, as well as the junior Senator from North Carolina and the  senior Senators from Iowa, Utah, and Nevada, for working with us on  this legislation.   My friend Congressman Will Hurd on the House side introduced the same  bill there, and I am hopeful it will pass sometime today so we can get  this to the President's desk for his signature without delay.   I would also note that the American Law Enforcement Heroes Act is  backed by major law enforcement groups across the country, including  the Fraternal Order of Police, the Major County Sheriffs of America,  the Major City Chiefs Association, and the Veterans of Foreign Wars. I  have been grateful for their help along the way toward passage of this  bill.   I look forward to this bill becoming a law--hopefully, this week, as  we continue to celebrate Police Week honoring the service of the men  and women in blue who keep our communities safe--and making it clear  that this Congress cares not only about our veterans but also our law  enforcement officials as well.   Madam President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
