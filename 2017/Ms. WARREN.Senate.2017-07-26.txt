 Mr. President, since the Republicans have announced that  their top legislative priority in this Congress would be to rip away  healthcare from millions of Americans, I have come down to the floor  many times to beg them to reconsider. I shared stories about families  in Massachusetts who gained quality healthcare coverage for the first  time after the passage of the Affordable Care Act. I shared statements  and letters from hospitals and doctors in Massachusetts talking about  the incredible difference healthcare coverage makes for the patients  who walk through their doors. I have also shared many, many stories  from parents with children who have complex medical needs--all of those  children depending on Medicaid.   I know that families, doctors, hospitals, nursing homes, and patients  lying in their hospital beds haven't just been sharing their stories  with me; they have been begging every Republican in the Senate to  listen to them as well. People share their stories because they want to  make a difference. These are the stories of families we represent. They  are the reason we are here in the Senate. They are supposed to be our  guiding light for the choices we make and the way we vote.   Senate Republicans who voted yesterday to move forward with their  effort to rip away Americans' healthcare are not listening to the  people they represent. Their vote was irresponsible. It was reckless.  It was cruel. It was immoral. But more than that, this was a vote that  is not who we are as a country.   Let's be very clear about what is happening on the floor of the  Senate right now. Fifty Republicans have voted to open debate on a  series of bills, each of which would have devastating effects for  healthcare in this country. Now the Republicans don't know which of  these bills will actually be the ones they will be asked to vote on.  Only some of the bills have been analyzed by the number crunchers over  at the Congressional Budget Office, the CBO, to estimate exactly how  many people would be kicked off insurance and how high premiums would  go, but every version that the CBO did examine over the last few weeks  was very ugly, with tens of millions of people losing their coverage  and costs skyrocketing for millions more.   The latest plan Senator McConnell has been floating behind the scenes  would have Republicans ultimately vote on what is called a skinny  repeal bill. This bill would make a limited set of changes to the  Affordable Care Act--just the important stuff. What is important to  Senator McConnell? It seems to be the part of the Affordable Care Act  that makes the health insurance system actually work, because the  skinny bill would repeal the parts of the ACA that say everyone needs  health insurance coverage. This is the individual mandate.   Republican leadership is telling their Members that if they vote for  this skinny bill, they can hammer out the rest of the details in  conference with the House of Representatives. But make no mistake--this  isn't a more moderate version of the Republicans' ugly plan to repeal  the Affordable Care Act. This isn't compromise. In fact, this may be  the worst idea they have had yet because if Senate Republicans vote to  repeal the individual mandate, they are getting rid of the linchpin of  the insurance markets in this country. That is because this provision-- the one the Republicans want to junk--is what keeps the price of  insurance affordable for people with preexisting conditions.   Don't just take my word for it. Independent experts have looked at  what would happen if the Republicans repeal the individual mandate.  Boy, it is not pretty. Just yesterday, the American Academy of  Actuaries--these are the experts who study how insurance works. They do  that for a living. These are their numbers. They wrote to Senate  leadership begging them not to go forward with this reckless plan. They  wrote that eliminating this part of the health law ``would likely have  significant implications for health care coverage and costs both to  consumers and the federal government.'' They said that it would ``lead  to premium increases.'' It would ``weaken insurer solvency.''   Let me do the translation on this. The actuaries--those who study  insurance for a living--are saying that what the Republicans are  thinking of voting on is a provision to jack up insurance costs through  the roof and rip away coverage from those who can't afford to pay those  higher costs.   We should be very clear about the consequences. If the Republicans go  through with that vote, they will be responsible for every dollar of  premium increases that occur over the weeks and months that follow as  this bill sits in a conference with the House and insurance companies  jack up prices because they don't know what they might be required to  cover. Senate Republicans will be responsible for every single person  who has to drop coverage because they can't afford those price  increases. The Senate Republicans will be responsible for every single  person who didn't go to the doctor when they needed to or didn't  schedule surgery when they needed to because they no longer have health  insurance. Senate Republicans will be responsible for every family in  this country who misses a mortgage payment or can't pay their  electricity bill or is forced into bankruptcy because their medical  debts have become too big to ever pay off.   Every time I have come to the floor to talk about this terrible  Republican bill, I have said that I am ready to work on bipartisan  proposals that will actually improve healthcare in this country, and I  say it again. I am still ready to do that, but we cannot move forward  while Senate Republicans are still trying to take healthcare coverage  away from millions of Americans and drive up costs for millions more.   Republicans seem to think they can wear us down, that they can keep  us here until we get too tired or we give up or we just give in, but,  boy, that is where they are wrong. They do not have a clue what they  are up against because we are fighting for families. We are fighting  for little kids. We are fighting for our neighbors. We are fighting for  parents and brothers and sisters and loved ones. We are fighting for  the American people. When you fight for the American people, the wind  is always at your back, and your heart is always strong.   So Democrats will be here, fighting for as long as it takes to beat  back these shameful healthcare bills. We hear the American people. We  hear you. We are on your side, and we will never give up.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I intend to offer the following motion  to H.R. 1628, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the  Record.
