 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this year's NDAA,  and I thank the chairman for his leadership.   I am honored to serve as the chairman of the Subcommittee on  Strategic  [[Page H6955]]  Forces. I am pleased that 53 provisions I led in this year's NDAA  received broad bipartisan support.   Through this bill, conservatives have achieved major wins that  counter harmful Biden administration plans to treat our military like a  social experiment. However, we must continue to make necessary  investments in our strategic forces. We must prepare to simultaneously  address two-peer aggressors, as well as deter the growing threats from  Iran and North Korea. This bill does that.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill to ensure our  men and women in uniform have the resources they need to defend our  Nation.
