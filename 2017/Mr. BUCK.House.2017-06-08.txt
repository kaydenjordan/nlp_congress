 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 400, line 22, insert ``(a) In General.--'' before       ``Within''.        Page 401, after line 2, insert the following:        (b) GSA Study.--        (1) Study.--The Administrator of General Services shall       carry out a study to determine--        (A) the Consumer Law Enforcement Agency's office real       estate leasing needs, in light  [[Page H4798]]       of the changes to the Agency's structure made by this Act;        (B) whether the office space referenced in subsection (a)       is the most cost-effective use of taxpayer money in meeting       those needs, relative to alternative leasing options in the       Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area; and        (C) if there is a Government department or agency that has       building needs that could be met by moving all or a portion       of the employees of such department or agency to the property       described under subsection (a).        (2) Report.--Not later than the end of the 6-month period       beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, the       Administrator of General Services shall issue a report to the       Congress containing all findings and determinations made in       carrying out the study required under paragraph (1).        (3) Authority to sell property.--If, after carrying out the       study required under paragraph (1), the Administrator of       General Services determines that--        (A) the Consumer Law Enforcement Agency's office real       estate leasing needs have changed in light of the changes to       the Agency's structure made by this Act, and        (B) that there is no Government department or agency that       has building needs that could be met by moving all or a       portion of the employees of such department or agency to the       property described under subsection (a),       the Administrator may sell such property to the highest       bidder, so long as the revenue from the sale exceeds the       combined cost of building such property and the cost of the       most recently completed renovation of such property.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 375, the gentleman  from Colorado (Mr. Buck) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today to explain my amendment to the  Financial CHOICE Act.   Since the passage of Dodd-Frank, the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau has been unaccountable to Congress and harmed small businesses  across this country. I am thankful for the work done by Chairman  Hensarling to rein in this out-of-control agency.   With the United States nearly $20 trillion in debt, we must do  everything possible to bring financial accountability to our Federal  Government. Spending at this rate will leave us not only financially  bankrupt but morally bankrupt as well. It is immoral to spend money we  don't have today and force our children to pay in the future.   Despite this, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau decided it was  necessary to renovate their headquarters, estimated at more than $200  million, over $50 million more than the building is worth. Even in  their initial designs, a lavish two-story waterfall and four-story  glass staircase were more important than the financial prosperity of  our children.   The Financial CHOICE Act makes changes to the CFPB, which will likely  result in different real estate needs for the agency. My amendment is  simple: it will require an assessment of whether the current CFPB  building is a good use of taxpayer dollars. If not, it authorizes the  General Services Administration to sell the building to the highest  bidder, generating hundreds of millions of dollars by offloading a  property that is unnecessary for the Federal Government to own.   Just a few months ago, my first grandchild, nicknamed Bear, was born.  When he grows older, I want to tell him I did everything in my power to  fight the out-of-control spending that plagues our generation. This  amendment is part of that fight for Bear and all of our grandchildren.   This amendment requires our government to use taxpayer dollars  efficiently, and it reinforces a culture of fiscal restraint and  bureaucratic decisionmaking.   I encourage all of my colleagues to support this commonsense and  fiscally responsible amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Buck).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes  appeared to have it.
