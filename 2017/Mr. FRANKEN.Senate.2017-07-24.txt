 Mr. President, I rise to talk about the effort by  Republicans in the majority to rip apart our healthcare system and  jeopardize the protections for people with preexisting conditions and  to throw millions of people off their health insurance.   Now, it is deeply troubling at this point that with less than 24  hours until the expected vote, we don't even know which version of  repeal the Republicans hope to pass. Do Republicans support the Better  Care Reconciliation Act--the bill that according to the Congressional  Budget Office, would cause 22 million more Americans to become  uninsured, which would drive up healthcare costs and dismantle the  Medicaid Program? Do they support the Cruz amendment, which would bring  back junk insurance plans that offer virtually no protection and drive  up out-of-pocket costs for vital services or will they rally behind  their backup option, a plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act and  replace it with nothing--that is, nothing--an approach that would add  32 million more Americans to the ranks of the uninsured and cause  average premiums in the nongroup market to double or will it be  something else entirely? We don't know.   This is reckless. This is irresponsible. The American people deserve  better.   Let's be clear. A vote for the motion to proceed is a vote to move  forward with conceivably any one of these bills, and all of these bills  are terrible. They jeopardize lifesaving care and treatment for  millions of American families, especially those with preexisting  conditions. They tear apart our safety net and give tax breaks to  powerful corporations.   Let me remind my Republican colleagues that a vote in support of the  motion to proceed will have real-world consequences for your  constituents who may lose their health insurance. Perhaps these are  people you have met; people, many of whom may be losing sleep out of  justified fear that their children or their parents, their loved ones  or they themselves are at risk of losing their healthcare.   I have talked to so many people in my State about these dangerous  proposals. There is Kristi. Kristi is a young farmer in Greater  Minnesota whose husband and two kids relied on Medicaid to access care  when their farm was struggling.   There is Sandy, whose mom is in a nursing home and who doesn't know  how she will pay for the round-the-clock care her mother needs if  Medicaid, which covers more than 6 in 10 nursing home residents  nationwide, scales back coverage.   Then, this is Sheri, who said that if it weren't for Medicaid, her  son Brandon, who has cerebral palsy and hydrocephalus, probably  wouldn't be here. I met Brandon. I think he is 18 or 19. He was born 15  weeks early, in Minneapolis, about a pound and a half. They took him to  the Mayo Clinic in Rochester. The Mayo Clinic said: We can't handle  him, so they sent him back to Minneapolis to Gillette Children's  Hospital, which could. They told Brandon's parents: He is going to  require $1 million in care the first day to save his life.   Brandon has had, I think, 37, 38 surgeries. He spoke at a meeting we  had on Medicaid a couple of weeks ago in Minnesota, and he stood--he  had a walker. He had just gotten an A-minus in his first college  course. He was actually, in a way, the last person in the room I was  worried about because his resilience--this guy, this kid is going to be  amazing. I don't think he would be here if we didn't have the kind of  Medicaid we have and the kind of Medicaid my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle are talking about limiting in a way that will affect  so many people I have met across my State.   This is one of those votes that will go down in history. It is one of  those votes that all of us will be answering for wherever we go for the  rest of our lives.   The former Republican Senator from Minnesota, David Durenberger,  outlined some of the reasons Senators should not vote for this  consequential legislation in an excellent op-ed, a piece he wrote, and  it was in USA TODAY today. Senator Durenberger--again, a Republican  from Minnesota and someone whom I talk to a lot about healthcare--wrote  this piece, saying resist the bullying, don't vote for a mystery  healthcare bill.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record Senator  Durenberger's op-ed.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:     Former GOP Senator: Resist the Bullying. Don't Vote For a Mystery                              Health Care Bill       There will be no do-overs on this. Take it from me: a no vote           this week is the only one that will be defensible in the           years to come.        What do you do when you are a U.S. senator and the       president wants you to vote for a health care bill that could       radically change health care?        You ask questions. You hold hearings. You understand what       it would mean to your constituents. You listen to those who       know the system. And when it doesn't add up, you vote against       it.        The year was 1979, and I was a freshman Republican senator       from Minnesota. Inflation was driving the already high costs       of health care through the roof. President Carter wanted to       use Medicare and Medicaid to limit increases in hospital       budgets in the face of rapidly inflating costs.        Ultimately, I decided to vote against it as it would end up       hurting the people of my state and was inconsistent with my       beliefs. And then, after the vote, we--Democrats and       Republicans--launched an effort to learn how best to change       the cost curve of the entire health system by focusing on how       we pay for Medicare.        This week, the Senate once again is set to vote on a health       care bill that will radically change how people get coverage       and who can afford their care. But unlike normal times,       Senators, you are being asked to approve a Motion to Proceed       to a vote:        Without knowing what will be in the bill.        Without knowing what the non-partisan Congressional Budget       Office will say about the impact of major amendments and the       final bill on coverage and premiums.        With full knowledge that the Senate parliamentarian, who       rules on what can and can't be allowed in a budget bill, has       said that the Senate must remove provisions intended to       prevent an insurance market death spiral        Without knowing the details of the secret state Medicaid       waivers the Trump administration insists will make the bill       work.        Without knowing how your own state budget will be impacted.        Without knowing how you will defend the provisions you will       only learn about later, including the payoffs and other       things that will be sneaked into the bill at the last minute.        Without even knowing which bill you are being asked to vote       on, what the defining amendments will be and how much time       you will have when being pressed for a final vote you'll be       stuck with. Forever.        A vote in these circumstances will rightly provoke anger       and distrust unlikely to abate. Take it from me: A no vote on       the Motion to Proceed this week is the only one that will be       defensible in the years to come.        I have had my arm twisted by the best of them--presidents       and Senate leaders and party whips alike. I know how       uncomfortable it can be. Usually, they were able to attempt a       convincing argument about what is good about the bill for the       country or my state. But I never would have voted for       something so far reaching without knowing the answer to all       the questions above.        Never in all my years did I experience the level of       bullying we see today. It doesn't look good in Minnesota, and       I suspect it doesn't look any better in your state.        I know that some of you ran for office vowing to repeal the       Affordable Care Act, hoping to improve coverage and decrease       costs. As public opinion polls tell us, voters do not believe       this bill does the job. The good news is we haven't run out       of time to ask questions and to work together to fix what       needs fixing if we take the time to return to regular order       and hold hearings.        Seven years ago, Democrats supported a bill far from       Democratic orthodoxy. It did not provide for single payer,       nor Medicare for all. Not even a public option. They handed       Republicans a chance to build a health system that plays to       our unique strengths as a nation, not to our weaknesses.        As someone whose efforts earned the support of both       Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush to reduce       health care costs without leaving anyone behind, I know our       party can do much better. But it should be obvious to all of       you listening to your constituents that voting on this       hodgepodge of mysterious bills is not the way.        Because there are no do-overs. The vote for the Motion To       Proceed is likely a vote for final passage, and the House       clearly stands ready to pass the Senate bill unchanged.        There is no making good on all of the issues later. Once       the funds for health coverage are gone, it will take new tax       increases to replace them. And what's the likelihood that       will happen?        There will be no hiding this vote. Let me assure you, as       the official scorekeeper, the  [[Page S4150]]       CBO will eventually score the entire bill, and that's what       your vote will be evaluated on.        For those who worry about re-election politics, I can       assure you that going into a campaign confident that you've       done what's best for every one of your constituents, not just       for those who want to stick you with a stale slogan, is the       best medicine you'll ever have prescribed for you.     Mr. President, there aren't many votes like this in a  Senator's career so let's just lay this out. If you support the vote  tomorrow, the following are some of the specific consequences that  could follow and in many cases would follow.   First, it is a vote that would open debate on bills that would  undermine protections for people with preexisting conditions. This  could happen in one of two ways. This vote could open debate on the  potential Cruz amendment, which would allow insurance companies, as  long as they offer ACA-compliant plans on the exchanges, to also sell  bare-bones, skimpy plans outside of the exchanges, with almost no  consumer protections. Under this amendment, insurers would be allowed  to deny coverage and charge higher rates to women, older adults, and  individuals with preexisting conditions. To my Republican colleagues, I  ask: Do you know someone who is pregnant? Do you know someone who has  diabetes? Asthma? Depression? Cancer? Multiple sclerosis? Substance use  disorders? Arthritis? Dementia? Sleep apnea? Parkinson's? All of these  people could be denied coverage under the Cruz amendment, just as they  were prior to the ACA.   The Cruz amendment will also bring back annual and lifetime limits,  coverage exclusions, and more.   When I was campaigning in 2008, and I would go around Minnesota-- cafes, VFW halls, bars--there would be a flyer up for a family who had  gone bankrupt for someone who had gotten sick. This would bring back  those annual limits, those lifetime limits. Do we really want to go  back to that?   The Cruz amendment is intended to deceive. The amendment is designed  to make people think it would lower premiums since it would allow  insurers to offer stripped-down plans that don't comply with the ACA's  consumer protections, but what it actually does is skyrocket the price  of insurance for people with preexisting conditions like epilepsy,  Crohn's disease, and stroke, while eviscerating the quality of  insurance for those who don't yet need, or know they need, such  coverage.   In fact, America's Health Insurance Plans, which is the national  political advocacy and trade association of companies that sell health  insurance to Americans, and the BlueCross BlueShield Association have  said this proposal is ``simply unworkable in any form and would  undermine protections for those with preexisting medical conditions,  increase premiums and lead to widespread terminations of coverage for  people currently enrolled in the individual market.''   The fact is, these high-deductible, bare-bones plans are a dangerous  rip-off, and many people will not even realize what garbage insurance  they have until it is too late.   Here is the thing. Even if the Cruz amendment were removed from the  bill, the Better Care Reconciliation Act would still undermine  protections for people with preexisting conditions. That is because the  bill would allow, and even incentivize, States to waive ACA protections  like the guarantee of coverage for basic essential health benefits.   If you are allowed to offer plans that don't cover basic services  like mental health, prescription drugs, and maternity care, then you  have a backdoor channel to charge people who need those services more  than those who don't. Not only that, States that seek waivers and end  the guarantee of essential health benefits bring us right back into the  world of annual and lifetime limits--a world where your care would end  not because your doctor said so but because the insurance company would  stop paying for it. This could be true even for people who get their  health insurance through their employer. In fact, even if you work in a  State that hasn't taken this waiver, your employer could have gotten  their health insurance from a State that had.   In short, with or without the Cruz amendment, the Better Care  Reconciliation Act breaks President Trump's promise to protect people  with preexisting conditions.   Second, yes, tomorrow is a vote to end Medicaid as we know it.  Medicaid is a lifeline, providing health insurance and access to care  for more than 70 million Americans. That is about one in every five  Americans. It includes seniors, pregnant women, people with  disabilities, families with children.   Senator Klobuchar was right about this being a lottery. Any of us can  be in an accident. Any of us can be diagnosed at any time. Any of us  can have a child who is diagnosed at any time with something  unexpected.   Healthcare really should be a right. I don't understand people who  say: I am healthy. My kids are healthy. Why should I suffer? I am the  victim here. Nothing has happened to me. Why should we have a system  where I am paying for people with preexisting conditions?   Really? Is that the attitude my Republican colleagues are taking?  Because that seems to be the logic.   Medicaid had been a bedrock of our healthcare system since 1965. It  was and is a Federal promise made to States and to all Americans over  50 years ago. And most of all, Medicaid works. But the Better Care  Reconciliation Act would gut it. It would end the program's coverage  guarantee, leaving States to either roll back coverage or slash other  vital programs in order to meet their citizens' needs.   Finally, a vote to support the motion to proceed to this bill is a  vote to drive up people's total healthcare costs. The Republicans'  plans decrease or eliminate the ACA's tax credits, which help people  afford their insurance--that was part of the construct--and it  dramatically hikes premiums for older Americans, although ones younger  than I--I am now 66, but from 50 to 64. It drives up deductibles and  other out-of-pocket costs that many people have to pay in order to  receive care.   Americans don't like these proposals. In fact, new polling shows that  only 17 percent of Americans think they and their families will be  better off under the Republican plans. That is 17 percent.   What Americans want is for Republicans and Democrats to work together  to build on and improve the Affordable Care Act. So why do my  Republican colleagues continue to push forward on these terrible bills?  It doesn't have to be this way. There is another option. This body can  reject the wrongheaded and ill-thought-out proposals and allow for an  open, bipartisan process under regular order where we can work together  and do the things the American people actually sent us here to do-- expand coverage, lower costs, and improve care. We should have  bipartisan hearings where we hear from nonpartisan expert witnesses  about the challenges facing the Affordable Care Act so we can work  together to fix what isn't working in the ACA.   What we do know from the last few years is that coverage matters.  This is important. Coverage matters. Just having coverage matters.  Healthcare isn't really about these big, heroic emergencies. A person's  health is about some of those events, but what it is really about is  having coverage and getting continuous care throughout your life.   Rigorous studies have shown that for every 300 to 800 adults who get  coverage, 1 life is saved per year. Research summarized by Atul Gawande  and his colleagues in a recent New England Journal of Medicine piece  finds that health coverage expansions have improved people's access to  care, improved their financial security, meaning fewer bankruptcies and  medical bills sent to collections, improved chronic disease care and  outcomes, improved self-reported health, and more. Overall, health  insurance has been shown to help Americans live longer, healthier  lives. Now is not the time to roll back our progress.   I urge my Republican colleagues to think about what a vote for  proceeding on this terrible legislation would mean for the American  people.   Paul Wellstone said that politics isn't about winning; it isn't about  money; it isn't about power; it is about improving people's lives. Our  constituents sent us here to improve their lives. So I urge my  Republican colleagues to vote no. Let's work together to fix what needs  to be fixed in the Affordable Care Act and do all we can to  [[Page S4151]]  make sure people have access to affordable, high-quality healthcare  when they need it.   Mr. President, I yield the floor to the Senator from New Hampshire.
