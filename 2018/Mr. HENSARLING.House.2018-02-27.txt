 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 747, I call  up the bill (H.R. 4296) to place requirements on operational risk  capital requirements for banking organizations established by an  appropriate Federal banking agency, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and submit extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I rise, today, in strong support of H.R.  4296, an important bill authored by Mr. Luetkemeyer, who is a real  leader on our committee. He is the chairman of the Subcommittee on  Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit and has led many bills on  this floor. This particular one addresses the burden that unnecessary  operational capital requirements have imposed on our financial  institutions and then, consequently, on our hardworking families and  small businesses that are seeking credit.   The Basel Committee requires U.S. financial institutions to hold  excessive capital based upon a look-back approach to an organization's  risk, previous earnings, and other provisions that provide no  indication of future risk.   Again, Mr. Speaker, this is about holding operational capital for  past activities.   This methodology employed by the international standard setters has  forced our banks to hold hundreds of billions of dollars in reserve  rather than putting that money to work in the real economy--in loans  and investments--for people to buy cars, to launch small-business  enterprises, or maybe to make a downpayment on that first home.   Again, Mr. Speaker, let me say it so that all can hear. Hundreds of  billions of dollars is currently sitting in banks across the country  not being utilized to fund mortgage loans, car loans, and other day-to- day financing that American families and individuals demand.   On top of this is the increased cost of compliance that banks have  had to shoulder under Dodd-Frank's onslaught of regulation. Banks like  Coatesville Savings Bank, the only remaining bank in Coatesville,  Pennsylvania, has told us that, now, 25 percent of their annual budget  is nothing but compliance cost, Mr. Speaker. This is detrimental to the  Coatesville, Pennsylvania, community. That is 25 percent. That is a  huge figure, Mr. Speaker, that cannot be used to fund the American  Dream in Coatesville, Pennsylvania.   So, again, Chairman Luetkemeyer brings us a very commonsense reform  and a very necessary reform.   Most agree and recognize the importance of our financial institutions  to hold capital in the event of future crisis or distress. Nobody  denies that, and this legislation does not remove those requirements.  But, Mr. Speaker, requiring banking organizations to look back in the  rearview mirror and hold operational capital against discontinued  activities or products is just not nonsensical, it is crazy. It makes  no sense.   H.R. 4296 simply amends the method of how reserve capital is  calculated by establishing standards based on an organization's current  business activities, making the requirements more accurate and tailored  to a bank's current risk profile. Again, Mr. Speaker, it is just common  sense. That means banks would still retain sufficient reserves to  weather an economic storm, but they would be able to put the billions  of dollars currently sitting on the sidelines to work to help make the  economy grow, to make it healthier.   In short, this method-based approach proposed by H.R. 4296 properly  calibrates operational capital while also ensuring strong, healthy  financial institutions and, thus, a stronger economy for our  constituents.   Again, to be very clear, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4296, does not prevent  Federal financial regulators from instituting operational risk capital  requirements. It does not eliminate the authority of a regulator to  assess operational risk, nor does it prevent regulators from requiring  that capital be held against riskier activities or businesses. The bill  simply puts forth a thoughtful framework that sets parameters, while  allowing regulators the flexibility needed to ensure that capital  standards are appropriately tailored.   A healthy financial system, Mr. Speaker, will enhance individuals'  financial freedom and will lead to a healthier and better regulatory  system.   H.R. 4296 has garnered strong, bipartisan support in our committee,  passing by a vote of 43-17, again, because it is practical and common  sense.   I again want to thank the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer),  who chairs our Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit Subcommittee,  for his leadership on this bill. I urge all of  [[Page H1309]]  my colleagues to join me in supporting this important bipartisan  measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer), the chairman of the Subcommittee on  Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit, and the bill's sponsor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.   As I listen to my colleague from Ohio, she uses the complete wrong  analogies. What happens is we don't pay our home insurance premiums on  the home we sold; we pay it on the home we own.   If you lived in a swamp and then you moved to a mountaintop in  Colorado, you pay different insurance premiums; and if you cease to be  a skydiver and you become an accountant, maybe you pay different life  insurance premiums. This has to do with your risk profile today, not  yesterday.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Stivers), a member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Hultgren), the vice chairman of the Financial Services  Subcommittee on Capital Markets.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.   I point out to my friends on the other side of the aisle, there are  over 20 different capital levels that are already applied to our  banking organizations, including the Total Loss-Absorbing Capital, the  TLAC.   I would also point out, if my friends are so concerned about capital  levels, maybe they should have supported the Financial CHOICE Act,  which is a tradeoff between greater levels of capital and Washington  micromanagement of our financial institutions.   Last but not least, Chairman Powell of the Federal Reserve appeared  before our committee just this morning to say safety and soundness  considerations  [[Page H1312]]  allow the Fed to, for all intents and purposes, impose any capital  level they want to on our banking institutions, thus undercutting all  the arguments we have heard from the other side of the aisle.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Pittenger), the vice chairman of the Financial Services  Subcommittee on Terrorism and Illicit Finance.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Zeldin), a very hardworking member of the Financial  Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Davidson), a very thoughtful member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from New York (Ms. Tenney), a hardworking member of the Financial  Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Hollingsworth), who is a member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, for the perhaps two dozen people who are watching us on  C-SPAN at the moment, I think it is important to add a little bit of  clarity to what we are debating here.   What we are debating is: What is the proper capital level for a  federally insured financial institution?   We know that if that capital level is set too low, then perhaps the  financial institution could fail. If it is set too high, then they will  not have the capital to help fund the American Dream--car loans, home  loans, and small business loans.   So we have heard a lot about a very simple bill that helps clarify  one of perhaps two dozen different capital levels that are already  applicable to our banking institutions, the total loss-absorbing  capacity, the supplementary leverage ratio, the enhanced supplementary  leverage ratio, the liquidity coverage ratio, the G-SIB surcharge, and  the list goes on and on and on.   We are talking, about, Mr. Speaker, one capital level, the  operational capital--operational risk capital. So, number one, there  are a multitude of different capital levels and liquidity levels that  are already applied to our financial institutions.   What we are saying is, if we are measuring operational risk, we  should focus on current risks. Then, if in doubt, Mr. Speaker, I always  recommend that Members actually read the bills that are being debated.  It is an always helpful exercise. If you would actually read the bill,  you would discover in section 1 of the bill, Mr. Luetkemeyer's bill  says that operational risk capital is based primarily on the risks  posed by a banking organizations' current activities and business.   If you look at subparagraph (3) of paragraph (a), it says: `` . . .  which is not solely based on a banking organization's historic  losses.''   So it is not prohibited to look at historic facts, but, primarily, we  must be focused on the current operational risk.   As I used earlier in the debate the analogy of who would want their  life insurance premiums based on the fact that in an earlier point in  their life they were a skydiver or a scuba diver and now today they are  facing life as an accountant? Those are different risk profiles.   If you build a home 4 feet below sea level, yet you sell that home, I  doubt you want your flood insurance premiums based on the home that you  already sold. It makes no sense.   As I also said earlier in this debate, when it comes to proper levels  of capital, as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated earlier today  before our committee, safety and soundness considerations trump all.  The regulators have the power to adjust the capital levels.   Now, this friend on the other side of the aisle talks about, oh, my  God, this is a huge risk to the economy. It is $22 million. Now, that  is real money. But, Mr. Speaker, we all know that is not even a  rounding error here; $22 million over the 10-year budget window is  approximately a $2 million risk. And from the Congressional Budget  Office report, they say that it is a small, small chance that the FDIC  would incur additional costs. So this is not creating more risk to the  system.   What we are trying to do is calibrate the appropriate risk. If we are  going to measure operational risk as opposed to the other 20-some odd  capital levels, then we ought to be focused on current risk, because if  we are not, Mr. Speaker, hardworking Americans are losing current  credit opportunities in order to pay for past operational risk. That is  not right, that is not fair, and that is not smart.   We ought to ensure that we have the proper capital level not only to  make sure that we have a safe and sound financial system but to make  sure that we are capitalizing the American Dream for our constituents.   My constituents in the Fifth District of Texas, who live in places  like Mineola and Forney, who are desperately trying to fund their  American Dream and put that down payment on a first house, we have got  to make sure that they are able to.   So many Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. They need these  credit opportunities, Mr. Speaker. Let's calibrate one capital ratio  properly. Let's add a little common sense, and let's not allow the good  people in Basel, Switzerland--as good as they may be--de facto impose  what is an irrational capital system on our banking system as we are  trying to help our small businesses and our families.   So, Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Members to support H.R. 4296, a  strong bipartisan bill to help credit opportunities for all families.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Speaker, again, there are roughly two dozen  different capital and liquidity levels that are applied to our banks.  We are talking about, one, operational capital, and whether or not  operational risk capital ought to be based on current risk.   Now, I know my friend on the other side of the aisle always likes to  wave the Wells Fargo flag. Wells Fargo needs to be held accountable.  There needs to be justice for all who have been wronged. There have  been roughly $142 million now paid in restitution. There have been over  $200 million in fines paid.                                time  1700    The board of Wells Fargo has been replaced. The CEO was fired, and  the Federal Reserve capped their growth, all under existing  authorities.   But under this motion to recommit, potentially, other financial  institutions could be included. It is not the financial institution  that counts, at the end of the day. It is capital that could be used to  fund car loans. It is capital that could be used to fund homes. It is  capital that could be used to fund the next Apple or the next Amazon.  Instead, that capital would be put onto the sidelines.   Again, we are talking about operational risk capital only and should  it be calibrated for current risk or past risk. That is a completely  different  [[Page H1316]]  issue from ensuring that customers of Wells Fargo, who clearly have  been wronged, receive justice and that Wells Fargo has been held  accountable.   Again, I would point out this might not have happened if the CFPB  under the previous administration had been doing their business. They  should have caught this. But they didn't. Instead, it was the LA Times  and the Los Angeles city attorney. The CFPB was asleep at the wheel  under the previous administration.   So, again, there is existing authority. But if the regulators and  then-Director Cordray had been doing their job, this wouldn't have  happened. The evidence was there and it was simply overlooked. We see  way too many instances of that, Mr. Chair.   Again, we want to properly calibrate one capital level, operational  risk capital. That is what the bill of the gentleman from Missouri  does. We should not be confused about the jihad against banks, because  banks, ultimately, are still funding the American Dream. You punish our  constituents, you punish small businesses every time you needlessly  take away capital that can fund their American dreams.   I urge a ``no'' vote on the motion to recommit. I urge an ``aye''  vote on Mr. Luetkemeyer's bill.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
