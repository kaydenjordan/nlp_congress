 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on the bill, H.R. 9.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time to close.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time to close.    Mr. Chair, it is, again, great to be here this morning.  I appreciate Speaker Pelosi coming down and talking about bipartisan  solutions and working together.   Obviously, on this piece of legislation, I think the terminology was  demanding a plan for the administration. Well, that assumes that the  administration would sign this bill. That also assumes that the Senate  would pass this bill. Even if the President would sign a bill that he  doesn't want to enact, he would probably then veto the bill he just  signed. Then we would sustain his veto.   If we want to move forward, then we want to do things that can get  through  [[Page H3413]]  the Senate and get to the President's desk. That is why, all afternoon  yesterday, we talked about--and this amendment has some of those issues  in it--adaptation, resiliency, grid modernization, and how do you  adapt.   We appreciate the intent on which this amendment is being brought  forward.   On another cautionary note, in the Paris accord, when it talks about  addressing loss and damage associated with the impacts of climate  change, it is referring to the Paris accord's provision for developing  countries. That accord doesn't have provisions for developed countries.   Maybe as things move forward with my colleague from New Jersey, we  can make sure we address that appropriately.   We would like to have these studies done before we go into  international agreements when we don't know how they are going to  respond, versus after the fact, just like the cart before the horse.  Then we will know that this is a good deal, that we should do this, or  maybe that we shouldn't.   We had a couple of amendments last night that talked about all the  bad aspects but none of the positive aspects. We also had a couple that  said let's look at the good and the bad.   I would suggest that, in an amendment, there may be some areas of the  country in which the infrastructure is not going to be harmed. In fact,  an area of the country might even benefit from these changes.   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to vote against the amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time to close.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time to close.    Mr. Chair, this is the perfect example of an amendment  that, as we move something forward that might be able to be considered  by the Senate and signed by the President, I think we would be very  interested in dealing with.   Although, I guess I am a little confused. The amendment says we don't  want to be technologically specific, although you mentioned the  benefits of carbon capture, sequestration, and utilization, which is an  amendment we had in the committee to try to say these are some good  technologies we ought to consider.   A lot of folks on our side have been excited about the energy  renaissance, the ability to recover more oil. We know the great stories  of Texas and the ability to capture carbon and sequester it with  utilization for money to help deal with other issues.   I think when we move in the direction of a bill that we plan to get  through the Senate and the House, we should keep our communications  open because I think there are some bipartisan solutions.   The Republicans have always talked about conservation, innovation,  and adaptation. This is part of the innovation package.   We also have advanced nuclear in that package. We also have pump  storage and batteries in that package. I think there are opportunities  here.   We offered, as I said, in the committee, the value of nuclear and  advanced nuclear energy, hydropower, carbon capture, and the production  and export of natural gas. Part of my portfolio of volunteer activities  is in the Eastern European bloc. Obviously, the ability to export  natural gas has been a boon to these countries that don't want to be  enslaved to Russian natural gas.   Again, there are things we can do. When we talk about innovation  necessary to produce a strong economy, energy security, and lower  emissions, we have to focus on the benefits of these technologies.  While I can agree with the idea of this amendment, I think it falls  short of what is necessary for Congress to assist our priorities.   Mr. Chair, I encourage a ``no'' vote, but I look forward to working  with my colleague in the future, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, first of all, we really don't need a Paris  Agreement to meet substantial changes in the carbon dioxide, or, as my  colleague was speaking, she was really referring to the Clean Air Act  and the four criteria pollutants that we have so aggressively addressed  since 1992.   Having said that, what is better for the poor and the downtrodden is  to have a job. What is better for their health and economic opportunity  is to have a job. What also helps is that they have a good paying job  that provides great healthcare benefits.   So, from 2015 to 2018, out of the industrialized countries, the  United States is the number one reducer of carbon dioxide--number one.  We didn't have to do it with all these international accords. We do it  through innovation, technology, and advancement.   But carbon dioxide emissions went up last year. That is a known fact.  The question is why. Well, Mr. Chairman, we have one of the best  economies that I have ever served in in the House of Representatives,  where there are help wanted signs all over the place.   As the manufacturing sector grows, there is a need to address these  emissions. That is why Republicans continue to look forward to the day  when we can join with our Democratic colleagues on conservation,  innovation, and adaptation, moving some bills and processes through the  floor that will be received well in the Senate and to the President's  desk.   I think, rather than focus on the finding, we should debate  bipartisan solutions such as boosting research, advanced technologies,  and promoting innovation. I ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, again, to my colleague, and I appreciate  it. She has me at a disadvantage because I have a huge ag district, 33  counties in southern Illinois, more pigs than people. I have corn,  beans, and the like, so we appreciate this; and we appreciate this  amendment because of the voluntary action of it and trying to  incentivize and appreciate what our agriculture community has done  because, as you know, other proposals out there that are debated in  Washington might have some severe effects on agriculture.   I also want to take this time to say we did a lot in the last  Congress. I think the misnomer is that if we don't say ``climate  change'' and we move good public policy, that we haven't done anything.   Through the House, we passed:   The Energy Efficient Government Technology Act; that was actually  voice voted and sponsored by Anna Eshoo from California;   Advanced Nuclear Technology Development Act,  Bob Latta from Ohio;   Streamlining Energy Efficiency for Schools Act, which this is another  thing we did in the last Congress;   Ozone Standards Implementation Act of 2017, Pete Olson from Texas;   Satisfying Energy Needs and Saving the Environment, the SENSE Act;   Blocking Regulatory Interference from Closing Kilns Act by Bill  Johnson;   Responsible Disposal Reauthorization Act of 2017, another bill to  reauthorize the West Valley Act.   Of course, I am a proud sponsor, with a huge bipartisan vote, for  what was H.R. 3053, which was how do you deal with the nuclear waste  provision.   So we actually moved a lot of bills in the last Congress, and many of  those bills were in a bipartisan manner.   Yes, we do not carry the mantle of ``Paris'' or ``climate,'' but not  everything has to be a subtitle of that major provision, especially if  you are doing what we are trying to do in the House, which is bring to  the floor bills in a bipartisan manner.   Conservation, that would be like energy efficiency, new source  review, forest management practices. Being from Washington State, the  gentlewoman understands the forest issues and the concerns that we do  more forest management practices. Maybe some of our fires would be less  so.    Innovation; advanced nuclear power; carbon capture; utilization;  sequestration, which we spoke about in an amendment previously; and  also pump storage batteries.   Also, from Washington State, the gentlewoman knows the benefits of  hydropower, and if we can pump that water back up and have a continuous  cycle, that is a pretty green use of power.   Adaptation, grid modernization, resiliency, and things on GMO crops,  crops that can change if the environment is changing, if the growing  cycles change. Right now we have drought-resistant corn. We might have  to have corn that grows in wetter conditions. That is all part of the  adaptation that we need to talk about.   So I appreciate the gentlewoman's amendment and the chance to discuss  these issues. I support voluntary action. The idea of this amendment  will be better served focusing on examining the costs of these  commitments, like some of our Republican amendments try to do, as we  move this bill outside of the committee.   I oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate my colleague bringing that up. I  taught high school for 4 years, so education is key.   This whole provision of moving to the Paris accord was done without  education of the Members of Congress. It was an executive branch  decision.   We can debate whether the President had the authority or didn't have  the authority, but we think what happened was that there was not total  buy-in. Had it been presented as an agreement or had it been presented  as a treaty, it wouldn't have passed either Chamber.   I do agree that education is very, very important. However, I also  believe in local control. Republicans will always have a challenge with  the Federal Government directing, dictating, and telling our local  schools what their curriculum should be.   Mr. Chair, that is why I oppose this amendment. I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, we appreciate this amendment. A lot of these  amendments are putting the cart before the horse. It would have been  interesting to have these debates about resiliency and efficiencies  prior to the administration going into the Paris accord. You do the  research first and then you make a decision.   Now what we are trying to do is say, okay, we have this Paris accord  that the President has stepped away from, so now let's evaluate what  impacts are happening.   We did accept an amendment yesterday in this debate to look at both  positive and negative aspects, which I think is a fair balance. There  are going to be some areas of the country that are going to benefit;  there are going to be some areas of the country that are going to be  disadvantaged. So I think that is helpful in this debate.   There is a lot of talk about an infrastructure bill coming up. We  hope that would be something we would move in a bipartisan manner. I  know that it is always going to be asked how to pay for it.   I am willing to make the tough calls on how to pay for it. But in  that infrastructure bill, it would be great if the resiliency of  communities and these concerns that are being addressed could be  wrapped up in something like that.   Again, for this bill, Leader McConnell just said on the floor that  they are not going to address it. Even if they did, the President  wouldn't sign it.   We will get to a point in time in this Congress when we will work  together.   Republicans believe in conservation, innovation, and adaptation. This  is part of the adaptation portfolio, and we look forward to working  with you as we move forward.   This amendment does nothing to affect CO2 reductions, so I  will oppose the amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, again, first of all, I appreciate my  colleague, one whom I have gotten a chance to know. I look forward to  working with him on some issues down the road.   I want to take this time to kind of reject the premise that nothing  has been done. In the debate a little while ago, I mentioned the 15 or  20 bills that had passed the House in a bipartisan manner. These were  signed into law, a lot of the hydroelectric extensions in H.R. 2122 and  H.R. 2292 to extend the project of the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission involving the Cannonsville dam. Hydroelectric power is  clean, renewable. I can go through a whole list of things that were  done.   As I said in debate earlier, just because we don't put the stamp of  ``Paris'' or ``climate change'' on a piece of legislation doesn't mean  that it is not going to help reduce our carbon exposure. In fact, our  country has the largest reduction of CO2 of any  industrialized nation from 2015 to 2018.   Having said that, I also would readily admit, and the Chair has heard  me say this many times, that in 2019, our emissions went up. But that  was because we have a thriving economy with more manufacturing. So this  debate is still very important.   This amendment suggests that the measures that the Obama  administration were putting in place to meet the commitments in the  Paris Agreement were affordable. A lot of us would reject that premise  when you look at the cost per kilowatt hour of major generation,  baseload versus the green.   We have always tried to be kind of an all-of-the-above. Actually, in  part of my congressional district, which is very large, I have one of  the biggest wind farms in Illinois. That is in the Champaign County,  Vermilion County, Ford County area in southern Illinois.                                time  1015    Also, solar power. Because of the actions our State General Assembly  has done, we have a lot of solar power construction going on in the  State of Illinois. An all-of-the-above approach is what we would hope  for.   We look forward to the time when this, too, shall pass, this debate  on this bill, which will then go to the Senate and die, and then we  work back with my friends in the Foreign Affairs Committee. Chairman  Engel is also on the Energy and Commerce Committee, so he knows that we  will eventually get to the aspect where we can move in a bipartisan  manner.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I want to make sure I also thank my  colleague for his service. I, too, served in the Army infantry during  the Cold War. They are a band of brothers, and we do appreciate his  service to the country.   Also, I do appreciate that the National Defense Authorization Act,  passed in the last Congress, has been helpful. That is another example  of, it  [[Page H3419]]  wasn't couched in climate change, but it was couched in national  defense. That is where, again, I will continue to make the arguments  and the comments that things have been going on. I don't want to read  the first list of bills and stuff that we have passed over the last  Congress.   The military is also looking at small modular nuclear reactors in  some isolated locations. That will be part of the issues in the  innovation area that Republicans could be very, very supportive of. We  look forward to having those debates.   I also know forward operating bases of solar technology and of solar  power help keep our warfighters prepared and able to communicate. It is  just the smart thing to do versus trying to haul crude oil or  generators and stuff to places where it would not be in the best  interest of our warfighters to have.    So the focus is good. The Republicans, again, believe in  conservation, innovation, and adaptation. When we move a bill that will  get a chance to be heard by the Senate and that we work together, the  goal would be to get something on the President's desk that he will  sign. This is not the venue, because the Senate is not going to move it  and the President is not going to sign it. But I would encourage my  colleagues to stay engaged, not just with the Armed Services Committee,  but the Energy and Commerce Committee, and colleagues on this side  because I do think there is merit to the debate. Acknowledgement of  what the Department of Defense has done was focused on by the previous  Commander in Chief.   The Paris climate mandates instituted by the Obama administration  through the Paris Agreement and the outdated executive order would have  increased energy prices and wasted taxpayer dollars. As a result, we  cannot support the amendment that would condone and reinstitute some of  these costly measures.   Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I will read into the Record a statement.  This is from the International Energy Agency, Global Energy and  CO2 Status Report 2018, published March of 2019, so it is  pretty much fresh off the press. It addresses some of these issues that  I have mentioned during this debate today about how we have been doing  things; how, overall, missions are decreasing; and how public policy  has helped, and the like.   This is on page 10: ``In the United States, the emission reductions  seen in 2017 were reversed with an increase of 3.1 percent in  CO2 emissions in 2018.''   That is what we addressed about the economy going up, more  CO2 emissions.   ``Despite this increase, emissions in the United States remain around  their 1990 levels, 14 percent and 800 metric tons of CO2  below their peak in 2000. This is the largest absolute decline among  all countries since 2000.''   So I think that is instructive when we are here debating a bill that  is not going to be reviewed by the Senate and the President is not  going to sign it.   We look forward to working with my colleagues on the Committee on  Energy and Commerce on things that we can do to work together to even  make better strides than what we already have in this country.   We don't get a lot of credit because we don't couch it in, as I said  before, Mr. Chairman, ``climate change,'' ``Paris accord.''   But, you know, facts are important, data is important, and the Energy  Information Agency is an independent agency underneath the Department  of Commerce, so it is evaluating all countries and all emissions.   Republicans believe in conservation, which would be energy  efficiency, new source review, force management, innovation, advanced  nuclear power, carbon capture, sequestration, utilization.   To the colleague who brought the amendment up, I don't believe coal  will be dead. I think if we bring technology and we use carbon capture,  utilization, and sequestration and get it captured, we can still have a  coal mining sector. We can still have energy electricity generated by  coal. I hope so, because I am from a coal mining region, and I am not  going to walk away from the jobs in southern Illinois.   And the adaptation which we have had a lot of debate about today,  which is grid modernization, resiliency, crops, and the like.   The amendment of my colleague is opposite to what Dr. Burgess and I  tried to do in the committee when we marked up this bill. We wanted to  have the research and the analysis done before we go back to a climate  agreement.   I mean, what good does it do if you go to an agreement and then you  find that jobs have been lost, wages have gone down? It is too late.  You are in the agreement.   So let's do the research prior, which was our amendment, Dr. Burgess  and I--it wasn't made in order for the floor----to say let's do this  research.   So if we are going to move and go back into the climate Paris accord,  if we are going to affect jobs in the economy negatively, we should  know that beforehand. This amendment does not do that.   Mr. Chairman, I ask for a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I think that is the first time I have been  directed to my region of the State of Illinois, and I appreciate it.   Illinois has 102 counties. I represent 33 of those, or parts of 33,  so it is a little different than north of I-80, as the Chairman knows  and as does the author of this amendment. And, of course, you had me at  a disadvantage because I have great kinship and friendship with my  colleague who is offering this amendment.   I would pause to say sometimes we have a hard time defining  ``clean.''   What is clean energy? For me, some of this debate is no  CO2 or very limited CO2 emissions. I think that  is in the Paris accord, in the climate change, global warming debate.  It is all about CO2. We have some colleagues come here and  talk about the four criteria pollutants and stuff, but this is really  about CO2.   So we also think not just solar, but we ought to make sure we do  geothermal provisions. We ought to look at pump storage provisions. We  should do the hydroelectric provisions.   As my colleagues know, Mr. Chairman, the Chicagoland area of Illinois  has the largest production of electricity through the use of nuclear  power--six locations, 11 reactors. How much does it emit of  CO2 into the atmosphere? Zero. Major baseload energy that is  beneficial in this debate, because we can't meet these standards unless  we have some major generation, some major baseload.   So I think if we look forward to moving forward with a bill that  would have a chance to move to the Senate floor that we eventually want  to get to the President, we actually look forward to working with my  colleagues on provisions and helping us grapple with the definition of  clean.   If the definition is little to no CO2 emissions, solar is  great; wind is great. They are small parts of a large portfolio of  nuclear energy and hydroelectric, which are the predominant clean  energy electricity producers if that definition is CO2.   So, with that, I ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the amendment,  respectfully.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
