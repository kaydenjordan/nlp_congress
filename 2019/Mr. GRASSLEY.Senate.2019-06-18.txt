 Madam President, today is the 10th anniversary of the  Supreme Court decision in Gross v. FBL Financial Services.   The Court ruled that employees who face age discrimination have to  meet a higher standard of proof than workers who face discrimination  based on any other factor. This case involving Iowan Jack Gross  affected employment discrimination litigation across the entire  country, and sent the message to employers that age discrimination is  OK.   I hope the Senate acts on the Protecting Older Workers Against  Discrimination Act to correct this injustice and restore fairness to  our Nation's senior workforce. I happen to be the sponsor of that  legislation.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
