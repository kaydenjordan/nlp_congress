 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Texas for  yielding. I rise today in strong support of the underlying legislation,  H.R. 5083, the Farm Workforce Modernization Act.   This is a critical piece of legislation for my constituents,  certainly in Central Washington, but for farmers and ranchers across  the country in need of a stable and legal workforce.   I am grateful for my friend, Representative Lofgren, for including  Republicans in these negotiations and bringing together a diverse  bipartisan group of Members of Congress, agricultural stakeholders,  farmers and producers, labor unions and farmworker associations to  write a piece of legislation that will go a long way toward  [[Page H10039]]  providing certainty for our Ag industry.   The House has failed to address Ag labor reform since 1986. For the  last 30 years, the crisis facing farmers has only been exacerbated, and  the need for fixes has become even more clear.   Today, we have an opportunity to continue this process and bring  relief to farmers and ranchers, not just those I represent, but dairy  farmers in the Midwest, Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan and  Northeast, New York and Maine; the famous peach orchards of Georgia and  South Carolina; and certainly the orange groves in Texas and the salad  bowl of California and Arizona--all across the country.   Like past efforts, this bill may not be the perfect solution, but it  is a significant improvement over the status quo. This legislation  stabilizes our current workforce by implementing the first of its kind,  merit-based immigration program for agricultural workers who have spent  decades in our fields.   The bill streamlines our current H-2A program and reduces the  bureaucratic red tape for farmers. It addresses rising costs of guest  worker wages and implements E-Verify for the Ag industry, something  Republicans have been asking for since the rollout of the program.   Despite the progress this legislation makes, there is still work to  do. It does not address every sector of our Nation's Ag industry. We  still have to find a solution for our processors. We need to improve  the equitable housing options. There are many other aspects of our  broken immigration system we must work together to fix.                                time  1315    A ``yes'' vote today on this bill is a vote to continue the process  and get this bill to the Senate.   I want to thank the staff, certainly Travis Martinez and Carrie  Meadows, but also David Shahoulian and Betsy Lawrence on Ms. Lofgren's  staff. Many people have put a lot of time into this effort.   Our farmers and ranchers desperately need relief. Men and women who  contribute to our ag industry need certainty. This bill is the first  step.   I urge my colleagues to vote for the underlying legislation and  encourage their input as we continue to perfect the bill and send it to  the President's desk.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend from  Colorado for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, if you talk to any farmer in this country, one of the  biggest issues that they will raise and something they are concerned  with, is their labor force, a secure and legal labor force. And that is  what brought together a bipartisan group of Members of Congress,  representatives from agricultural groups around the country, as well as  agricultural labor groups around the country, to come up with a bill to  deal with the labor situation that we have in this country, to provide  a certain legal labor force; something that is simple in saying that,  but very, very complex in order to get to the solution.   So this has three titles. Number one deals with the current  workforce. We have come up with something that the President has asked  for, a merit-based system to provide legality to our current workforce  that requires a history of ag labor; it requires fines because people  broke the law to get here; and it requires people to stay engaged in  the agricultural industry.   Title two simply is to reform the H-2A program, something that we  desperately need. It makes it more responsive, more efficient. It will  cap the ever-skyrocketing wage growth in this country of the AEWR to  3.25 percent per year. Some States next year are facing a 9\1/2\  percent increase.   On top of that, it will allow full-time employers, like dairies, to  be able to take advantage and utilize the H-2A program.   And third, it will require a phase-in of the E-Verify system,  something that Republicans have wanted for a long time, and something  that I think will remove an incentive for people to illegally cross the  border and will do a lot to improve the security of our country.   This bill provides certainty for farmers and farmworkers.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record some letters of support from the  National Association of Counties, the Chamber of Commerce of the United  States of America, the Americans for Prosperity, the National  Association of State Departments of Agriculture, the Committee on  Migration, and included in a letter to leadership, a list of over 300  agricultural organizations across this great country in support of this  legislation.                                                 November 18, 2019.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader McCarthy: The       undersigned groups, representing a broad cross-section of       agriculture and its allies, urge you to advance the Farm       Workforce Modernization Act (H.R. 5038) through the House to       address the labor crisis facing American agriculture. A       stable, legal workforce is needed to ensure farmers and       ranchers have the ability to continue producing an abundant,       safe, and affordable food supply.        The effects of agriculture's critical shortage of labor       reach far beyond the farm gate, negatively impacting our       economic competitiveness, local economies, and jobs.       Economists have found that every farm worker engaged in high-      value, labor-intensive crop and livestock production sustains       two to three off-farm jobs. As foreign producers take       advantage of our labor shortage and gain market share,       America will export not only our food production but also       thousands of these farm-dependent jobs. Securing a reliable       and skilled workforce is essential, not only for the       agricultural industry but for the U.S. economy as a whole.        The House must pass legislation that preserves       agriculture's experienced workforce by allowing current farm       workers to earn legal status. For future needs, legislation       must include an agricultural worker visa program that       provides access to a legal and reliable workforce moving       forward. This visa program needs to be more accessible,       predictable, and flexible to meet the needs of producers,       including those with year-round labor needs, such as dairy       and livestock which currently do not have meaningful access       to any program.        While the bill does include a few provisions that raise       significant concerns for the agricultural community, we are       committed to working together throughout the legislative       process to fully address these issues. It is vital to move       the Farm Workforce Modernization Act (H.R. 5038) through the       House as a significant step in working to meet the  [[Page H10071]]       labor needs of agriculture, both now and in the future.

Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader McCarthy: On behalf       of the National Association of Counties and the 3,069 county       governments we represent, we are writing in support of the       Farm Workforce Modernization Act (H.R. 5038). This bill would       preserve, expand and improve on the processes and resources       aimed at helping counties bolster our local agricultural       economy.        County governments across the country face many challenges       to providing quality  [[Page H10072]]       and affordable housing options for rural families and farm       laborers. Unfortunately, federal regulations often are       inflexible and too restrictive to address the unique needs of       our rural communities. Much of our nation's existing farm       labor housing has also aged past its useful life with severe       physical problems, including inadequate heating, plumbing and       space.        Additionally, we are encouraged by efforts in this bill to       modernize and simplify the H-2A process and ensure that a       reliable and capable workforce is available for the nation's       farmers and ranchers. This bill would provide stability and       consistency in our farm labor force and create a realistic       path for migrant and seasonal farm workers to contribute to       the national economy.        We ask that you join us in support of the Farm Work       Modernization Act and help strengthen our nation's local       agricultural economies. Thank you for your time and       consideration on this important matter.            Sincerely,      Hon. Mary Ann Borgeson,        Commissioner, Douglas County, Nebraska, President, National       Association of Counties.      Hon. Melissa McKinlay,        Commissioner, Palm Beach County, Florida, Chair, NACo's       Agriculture and Rural Affairs Steering Committee.                                   ____                                          Chamber of Commerce of the                                        United States of America,                                                   October 30, 2019.                                                    Washington, DC,        To the Members of the House of Representatives: The U.S.       Chamber of Commerce supports the Farm Workforce Modernization       Act, which would take important steps to address the growing       struggle of agricultural employers to meet their workforce       needs.        The inability of American farmers to effectively meet their       workforce needs does not affect the agricultural industry in       a vacuum. When crops rot in a field because farmers do not       have enough workers for the harvest, this does not only harm       the interests of that farmer. These situations also       negatively affect the shipping company that would have       transported those products, and the retailers that would have       sold them.        Furthermore, the uncertainty caused by the insufficient       quantity of agricultural workers in the U.S. has enabled       foreign agricultural producers to take advantage of this       situation and gain market share. American agricultural       producers will only become less competitive in the global       marketplace if these workforce problems persist.        The Farm Workforce Modernization Act seeks to provide       workforce stability for agricultural workers by allowing       unauthorized farm workers to earn legal status in the U.S.       This legislation also would address future agricultural       workforce needs by updating the temporary agricultural worker       program, most notably providing eligibility to employers who       have year-round labor needs, which is critical for dairy and       livestock. Furthermore, the bill would enhance domestic       security by making the use of E-Verify mandatory for       employers seeking to hire temporary agricultural workers.        This bill could benefit from further refinement. The       proposed prevailing wage levels for temporary agricultural       workers, as well as the new annual visa quotas for year-round       agricultural employment, should be more responsive to market       needs. In addition, the transition period for agricultural       employers to utilize the E-Verify system should be extended       in order for employers to better adjust to the new compliance       burdens being foisted upon them. We are committed to working       with members of both parties to address these and other       issues to improve the bill as it proceeds through the       legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                Neil L. Bradley,       Executive Vice President and Chief Policy Officer.                                   ____                                           Americans for Prosperity,                                            The Libre Initiative,                                                  November 19, 2019.        Dear Representative: On behalf of our organizations and the       millions of activists we represent, we applaud the bipartisan       efforts from lawmakers in the House of Representatives on the       Farm Workforce Modernization Act of 2019. This bill       represents a step in the right direction by modernizing       components of our guest worker program and legal immigration       system. It will also help our country better meet the needs       of employers and guest workers in the agricultural sector.        We are encouraged by lawmakers' efforts to streamline       components of the H-2A program aimed at reducing some of the       burdens imposed on employers and workers, in addition to       considerable reforms that create new legal channels which       currently are not available.        While the legislation is not perfect, the bill represents       an important step forward to improve the way we issue       temporary visas for guest workers and green cards for       aspiring immigrants. We look forward to working with members       to improve this bill by further reducing unnecessary barriers       that impede upon the ability for employers and employees to       freely contract in a mutually beneficial manner.        With only a few legislative days remaining, we urge       lawmakers to continue working together to modernize and       improve our guest worker program and stand ready to partner       with lawmakers to accomplish this goal.            Sincerely,      Brent Gardner,        Chief Government Affairs Officer, Americans for Prosperity.      Daniel Garza,        President, The LIBRE Initiative.                                   ____                                       National Association of State                                      Departments of Agriculture,                                    Arlington, VA, October 25, 2019.      Hon. Zoe Lofgren,      Chairwoman, Subcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship,           House Committee on the Judiciary, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Dan Newhouse,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Re Support for the Farm Workforce Modernization Act.         Dear Chairwoman Lofgren and Congressman Newhouse: The Farm       Workforce Modernization Act (FWMA) is a crucial step forward       towards solving agriculture's need for labor. NASDA thanks       you for your hard work negotiating and finding compromises on       a bipartisan bill that will successfully increase access to       farm labor across the country. Foreign-born workers are an       essential part of the U.S. agriculture workforce and an       estimated half of U.S. farm workers are currently foreign       born. For years, the agriculture industry has struggled to       access sufficient labor in sectors ranging from produce to       animal handling. This is only compounded by the current low       unemployment in the United States. These factors are why the       National Association of State Departments of Agriculture       urges Congress to pass the FWMA.        NASDA represents the Commissioners, Secretaries, and       Directors of the state departments of agriculture in all       fifty states and four U.S. territories. NASDA members       represent all agriculture in their states and finding       practical solutions for the agriculture labor shortage is a       top priority for NASDA members.        Agriculture labor reform is crucial for ensuring that U.S.       farmers and ranchers have a reliable and skilled workforce.       This bill will, for the first time, make year-round visas       available. This is crucial for the dairy industry and other       industries that rely on temporary labor. Further, NASDA       supports the bill maintaining the H-2A program while also       creating a new, certified agricultural worker status. This       status and its renewable visas will increase certainty for       farmers, ranchers and the farm workers who we rely upon for       the safe harvesting and handling of crops and livestock.        NASDA acknowledges that a multi-faceted effort is needed to       fix the challenges with agriculture labor, so any progress       made on this front is a step in the right direction. We look       forward to advancing solutions to agriculture's labor       shortage with Congress.            Sincerely,            Doug Goehring,                                                   NASDA President,      North Dakota Agriculture Commissioner.                                   ____           Committee on Migration, Committee on Domestic Justice and             Human Development,                                 November 12, 2019, Washington, DC,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the Committee on       Migration and the Committee on Domestic Justice and Human       Development for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, we       write to urge you to support H.R. 5038, the Farm Workforce       Modernization Act. This bipartisan legislation, introduced on       October 30, 2019, by Representative Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) and       several Republican and Democratic sponsors, would create an       earned legal status program for agricultural workers and       would improve the existing H-2A system.        Recognizing the dignity of work of farmworkers and their       families is a central concern of the Catholic Church. In his       1981 encyclical, Laborem Exercems, Pope John Paul II spoke of       the importance of agricultural workers and the need to       protect those working in the fields. Farmworkers produce the       food that we eat and contribute to the care of our community.       Regarding immigrant farmworkers, the bishops in the U.S. have       long advocated for reforms of the existing system, including       a ``legalization program that would help stabilize the       workforce, protect migrant workers, and their families from       discrimination and exploitation and ensure that these workers       are able to continue to make contributions to society.''        H.R. 5038 proposes a meaningful way for migrant       agricultural workers to earn legal status through continued       agricultural employment and contributions to the U.S.       agricultural economy. It also improves labor protections       while producing employment flexibility that is needed to aid       our agricultural industries. H.R. 5038 creates more       accessible and predictable worker programs while ensuring       more worker protections, such as improving the availability       of farmworker housing and providing better health       protections.        As currently written, H.R. 5038 is a step in the right       direction and reflects genuine bipartisan engagement. We       encourage you to  [[Page H10073]]       consider co-sponsoring this current version of the bill and       to move it forward to help ensure a more stable workforce for       our farming economy, as well as a tailored earned       legalization program and greater worker protections.            Sincerely,      Most Reverend Joe Vasquez,        Bishop of Austin, Chairman, USCCB Committee on Migration.      Most Reverend Frank J. Dewane,        Bishop of Venice, Chairman, USCCB Committee on Domestic       Justice and Human Development.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to take the step and  do what we can to improve the labor situation for farmers and ranchers  across this country.
