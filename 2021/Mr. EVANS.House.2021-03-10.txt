 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   This act is big and bold, and it begins to keep our promise to Build  Back Better. This is a historic bill, a policy revolution.   It includes: cutting child poverty in half, expanding the earned  income tax credit for our essential workers, and saving people's  pensions.   It means a shot in the arm, returning kids to school safely, and more  people back in jobs.   My constituents in Philadelphia feel it is needed now. This is  something we all should be working on together.   I thank the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and all of the  [[Page H1278]]  staff for working on this very important bill. This is something that  is long overdue, and I am glad to be part of it.
