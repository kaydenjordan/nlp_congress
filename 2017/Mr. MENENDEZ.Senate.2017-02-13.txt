 Mr. President, I rise today to speak in opposition to  President Trump's nominee to serve as Secretary of the Treasury, Steve  Mnuchin.   From his days at Goldman Sachs, on the frontlines of developing the  very products that brought our economy to its knees, to his reign as  chairman of OneWest Bank, quantified by tens of thousands of  foreclosures and qualified by years of despair, to his plan to get rich  off cash-strapped seniors, to his investments in Sears that stripped  pension benefits from low-wage-earners, Mr. Mnuchin made a career out  of exploiting the financial turmoil of hard-working American families,  never once stopping to consider the impacts of his profiteering on the  people of this country.   At every step of the way, Mr. Mnuchin's mantra has been to privatize  profits and socialize losses.   While our President spent much of his campaign railing against  Goldman Sachs and Wall Street's stranglehold on Washington, it should  be lost on no one that Wall Street has the majority vote in this  administration. With friends like Mr. Mnuchin and Gary Cohn in high  places, the country's largest and most complex financial institutions  can rest easy, knowing this administration is firmly committed to their  bottom lines. As Treasury Secretary, Mr. Mnuchin will be a chief  architect of the GOP's ``Wall Street First'' policy.   Despite his self-described humble beginnings at Goldman Sachs in the  1980s, Mr. Mnuchin was on the frontlines of developing the now-infamous  collateralized debt obligations known as CDOs and credit default swaps.   I urge my colleagues not to be fooled by Mr. Mnuchin. He was part of  the cadre of corporate raiders that brought our economy to its knees.   In its 2011 report on the great recession that wiped out nearly $13  trillion in household wealth and cost nearly 9 million Americans their  jobs, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations described  Goldman Sachs' role in the crisis as follows:         Goldman engaged in securitization practices that magnified       risk in the market by selling high risk, poor quality       mortgage products.    It said:         Conflicts of interest related to proprietary investments       led Goldman to conceal its adverse financial interests from       potential investors, sell investors poor quality investments,       and place its final interests before those of its clients. .       . .''    Despite the damage they caused, Mr. Mnuchin never learned his lesson,  and, as recently as 2012, he praised these instruments, calling them  ``an extremely positive development in terms of being able to finance  different parts of the economy and different businesses efficiently.''   Now, after he left Goldman Sachs, Mr. Mnuchin started a hedge fund,  Dune Capital, which started investing in an exotic financial instrument  called life settlements, which are made up of life insurance policies  purchased from cash-strapped seniors. The investor, Mr. Mnuchin's hedge  fund, had a plan to pay the premiums on the policies until the seniors  died, at which point they would cash in on the insurance claims.   So let's be clear. Under Mr. Mnuchin's plan, the sooner seniors died,  the more money his hedge fund would make. While the markets for  [[Page S1116]]  this product collapsed before Mr. Mnuchin could cash in, we have to ask  ourselves if this is the type of leader whom we want at the helm of our  economy? Do we really want a Treasury Secretary who had a plan to get  rich off of dying seniors?   That brings us to the end of 2008 and early 2009. Wall Street had  brought our economy to the brink of collapse, and 13.2 million  Americans were facing unemployment. Home values were plummeting, having  fallen 12.5 percent in just one quarter. And where was Mr. Mnuchin? He  was negotiating the deal of a lifetime. In the darkest days of the  financial crisis, when Rome was burning, Mr. Mnuchin and his friends  were looking for stores to raid.   Boy, did they find a gem in IndyMac. He purchased IndyMac's $23.5  billion of assets for a mere $1.55 billion in March of 2009. With the  FDIC, Federal Deposit Insurance entity backing, its too many loans went  south. So he had a governmental guarantee for $23.5 billion of assets  for about $1.5 billion, and he had the government's guarantee. All that  Mr. Mnuchin had to do was to agree to help homeowners struggling with  their mortgages, but Mr. Mnuchin didn't hold up his end of the bargain.  He wanted more. Apparently, the profit margins of foreclosure were just  too sweet to ignore.   After buying IndyMac and renaming it OneWest Bank, Mr. Mnuchin was  installed as chairman. But instead of working to achieve sustainable  loan modifications and workouts for struggling borrowers, as Mr.  Mnuchin had committed to doing, OneWest's business model centered on  kicking borrowers out of their homes at the first sign of default.   In April of 2011, the former Office of Thrift Supervision hit OneWest  Bank with a consent order because the bank was actually putting  homeowners on a fast track to foreclosure, robo-signing foreclosure  documents.   In a sworn deposition in 2009, a OneWest vice president admitted to  robo-signing 750 foreclosure documents a week without ever reading or  reviewing them. In 2014, an independent government review of OneWest's  foreclosure activities in 2009 and 2010 alone identified more than  10,000 homeowners, including dozens of active-duty servicemembers, who  were owed $8.5 million in damages due to the bank's foreclosure  practices.   OneWest's practices were especially egregious when it came to seniors  with reverse mortgage loans. During Mr. Mnuchin's tenure at the bank,  OneWest's reverse mortgage subsidiary, Financial Freedom, had  approximately 17 percent of the reverse mortgage shares but was  responsible for nearly 40 percent of reverse mortgage foreclosures. In  other words, Mr. Mnuchin cornered the market on focusing and  foreclosing on seniors in America. Whether it was foreclosing on a 90- year-old woman over a 27-cent--27-cent--missed payment or threatening  to kick an 84-year-old widow out of her home of 54 years, Mr. Mnuchin  was ruthless.   What did Mr. Mnuchin have to say about all of this when we asked him  during his confirmation hearing in the Senate Finance Committee? He  dodged responsibility at every step. First he blamed IndyMac for the  quality of mortgage loans; then he blamed government regulations, which  he falsely claimed forced his bank to kick people out of their homes.  If that wasn't enough, Mr. Mnuchin had the audacity to tell us that his  bank did not robo-sign documents despite clear evidence to the  contrary.   To make matters worse, Mr. Mnuchin had the gall to call OneWest a  loan modification machine. He repeatedly misled the committee that  OneWest provided more than 100,000 loan modifications when, in fact,  they modified less than one-quarter of that amount.   On top of misleading the committee, Mr. Mnuchin has been unwilling to  provide information on the number of borrowers who lost their homes  during the time that he ran the bank. We believe that number is at  least 60,000 families and seniors, but those numbers could even be  higher.   At the end of the day, this is about much more than numbers. It is  about the seniors who are barely hanging on to their homes--their only  source of wealth. It is about communities that were hit with a one-two  punch of subprime loans in the years leading up to the crisis, only to  face banks like OneWest with unrelenting foreclosure practices that  stopped at nothing until they had kicked people out of their homes.   It is about people like Sylvia Oliver of Scotch Plains, NJ. After her  employer cut her hours in 2009, like so many other hardworking  Americans at the time, she ran into difficulty paying her mortgage.  Despite the fact that Ms. Oliver found a full-time job and applied  eight--eight--times for loan modifications, Mr. Mnuchin's bank denied  each and every one of her applications. Ms. Oliver has been fighting to  save her home for 7 years. She is hanging on by a thread. Her own words  speak volumes about Mr. Mnuchin. She said:         It's been very painful and stressful not knowing if my kids       and my family are going to have a home to live in, or if it's       going to be foreclosed on. I would ask you to remember my       experience when you consider whether Mr. Mnuchin is qualified       to lead the Department of the Treasury. As the CEO and Chair       of OneWest Bank, Mr. Mnuchin had the opportunity to help       families like mine with responsible loan modifications, and       he didn't. I don't think this is a track record that anybody       should be proud of.    Ms. Oliver is right. Mr. Mnuchin's record is not only undeserving of  pride, it is shameful. While Mr. Mnuchin's business formula proved  toxic for tens of thousands of hard-working American families and  seniors, it was incredibly lucrative for Mr. Mnuchin and OneWest's  investors. He sold OneWest for $3.4 billion, a profit of $1.85 billion  over just 6 years, making around $200 million for himself. That is a  pretty nice return on investment.   While I am gravely concerned about Mr. Mnuchin's history of  exploiting hard-working Americans to line his own pockets, I am equally  concerned about his plan to unchain Wall Street. Mr. Mnuchin has made  it his No. 1 priority to roll back Wall Street reform.   As my friend Senator Brown has often said, our colleagues seem to  have contracted a case of collective amnesia about the great recession.  Just 8.5 years after the worst financial collapse in 80 years, which  put taxpayers on the line for billions in bailouts, the President,  Republicans in Congress, and Mr. Mnuchin are champing at the bit to  take down the very protections that were put in place to prevent  another catastrophe. I ask them, Have we learned nothing?   We know what this administration wants. It wants what the industry  wants. On the day the President signed his ``Wall Street First''  Executive order, Goldman Sachs' shares soared 4.6 percent, a $4 billion  gain. At the end of the day, Mr. Mnuchin is nominated to serve in a  position to ensure the financial stability of the American economy, but  his only experience is betting on the financial instability of American  families.   Not only did he profit off the backs of struggling homeowners, he  also stands to profit off of pensions he mismanaged while on the board  of the Sears company. From the time Mr. Mnuchin joined the board of  Sears, the company lost billions of dollars, including more than $8  billion since 2011 alone. Rather than invest in growth and its workers,  he decided to strip the company of its most valuable assets and keep  them for themselves and their friends.   While Sears seemed to lose in this transaction, there were some that  certainly appeared to profit. Not surprisingly, Mr. Mnuchin and his  hedge fund friends were those profiteers. As a shareholder lawsuit  contended, they gobbled up the most valuable and profitable assets, and  they saved golden parachutes for themselves to escape if the company  crashed. This might sound complicated, but it is a move that would make  Gordon Gecko from the movie ``Wall Street'' proud. Just replace  Bluestar Airlines with Sears, and fiction becomes reality. In the world  of both men, greed is good.   But this isn't a movie. It is the real world with real-life  consequences for 200,000 people who work at Sears. Stripping Sears of  $12 billion worth of its most valuable assets contributed to the  devaluation of the company, which further jeopardized the pensions of  more than 200,000 Americans. According to the most recent filing, this  pension fund is now underfunded by an alarming $2 billion after they  stripped $12 billion of its most valuable assets. These retirees, who  rely on pensions to live, who worked hard all of their lives and played  by the rules, have already  [[Page S1117]]  had their benefits cut by Mr. Mnuchin and the Sears finance board. In  fact, the pension situation has become so dire that the government,  through the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, or the PBGC, felt  compelled to step in to protect the pension benefits for these 200  people.   As if his past mismanagement of pensions isn't bad enough, as  Treasury Secretary, Mr. Mnuchin would oversee the decision whether to  bail out the pension. Mr. Mnuchin would have to decide whether to  protect his personal hedge fund investments in Sears, which he refuses  to divest, or to protect the Federal Government and those 200,000  retirees.   To be fair, when I asked Mr. Mnuchin about his inherent conflict of  interest during his confirmation hearing, he pledged to recuse himself  from any decision by the PBGC regarding Sears. But we have heard that  song before. Mr. Mnuchin can't avoid a conflict of interest by recusing  himself any more than President Trump can avoid a conflict by  supposedly letting his children run his businesses. The only true  firewall against a potential conflict of interest is through a full  divestiture, which Mr. Mnuchin refuses to do. As a private citizen and  executive at Sears, Mr. Mnuchin showed a total disregard for the earned  pension benefits of hundreds of thousands of hard-working Americans. I  have no reason to think he will have a change of heart as Treasury  Secretary.   Not only does Mr. Mnuchin want to let banks write their own rules and  let executives profit when they cut pensions, but he also wants to cut  taxes on the rich so he and his friends can keep more of their ill- gotten gains. After helping raise millions of dollars from Wall Street  and big corporations for President Trump's campaign, they are now  expecting a big return on their investment--and, boy, do they win big  league under the Mnuchin-Trump tax plan. This ill-conceived proposal  would give large corporations, which are already earning record  profits, an additional $2.5 trillion. That is $2.5 trillion taken away  from transportation, from schools, from the middle class, and given  directly to multinational corporations. It would eliminate the estate  tax and gift taxes, giving a nearly $200 billion windfall to the  wealthiest 5,000 family dynasties in the country--$200 billion to the  wealthiest 5,000 family dynasties in the country--and 99.99 percent of  all Americans will not see a penny from this giveaway. But we know who  would benefit: Mr. Mnuchin and President Trump.   It doesn't stop there. On top of all of this, the Mnuchin-Trump  proposal would also give the top one-tenth of 1 percent--the wealthiest  of the wealthy, the corporate CEOs and hedge fund managers who make  around $4 million per year or more--$1 million back each and every  year. This group of elite earners already take home a whopping 184  times the average pay and has the same combined net worth as nearly 90  percent of all American workers. These 160,000 of the richest families  in the country have as much wealth as 144 million families in America.   I have nothing against wealthy people. I have nothing against  millionaires and billionaires. Many worked hard for their money, and  they played by the rules. I applaud their success. But I don't think  the wealthy, who are doing just fine right now, need an extra million  dollars or more than the middle class. I don't think we should be  borrowing trillions more from China just to give the top one-tenth of 1  percent another million dollars. This is fundamentally backward.   They say we can't afford to invest in infrastructure, we can't afford  to help our graduates with mounting college debt, we can't afford to  give a whole host of resources to things we think are critical to  compel our Nation to be the continuing global economic leader, but we  can afford to give $1 million away to all the millionaires and  billionaires in the country. This warped order of priorities is a  perfect metaphor for Mr. Mnuchin's school of economics: Give the rich  more and more because they know best.   Unfortunately, this theory of trickle-down economics hasn't worked in  the past and will not work now. The American people are sick and tired  of getting fleeced. They are tired of working hard every day and  playing by the rules only to fall further behind. They are tired of  losing in a rigged system.   But a Treasury Department led by Mr. Mnuchin will only deliver more  of the same: more tax breaks for the wealthiest in the country, more  borrowing from China, more income inequality. These are not the  principles Americans want or need.   In conclusion, you can tell a lot about a person based on how they  handle a crisis. When Wall Street crashed and the country plunged into  recession, where was Mr. Mnuchin? Was he warning regulators that they  were asleep at the wheel and hard-working Americans were being  exploited? Was he working to reform the broken system? No. He was  looking for stores to raid with one goal in mind: profits.   Some would like to either ignore or whitewash this past, but if we  don't learn from history, we are doomed to repeat it. The American  people cannot afford a repeat of that past. We cannot afford a return  to the Wild West of Wall Street--when the middle class was held hostage  to the earnings reports of the biggest banks, when the cure for income  inequality was simply more tax cuts for the wealthy.   We need a Treasury Secretary who will stand up to Wall Street, not  take orders from them. We need a Treasury Secretary who understands  that the strength of our country has come and will always come from the  middle class, not from the CEOs and the hedge funds. Unfortunately,  Mnuchin is not that person.   I urge may colleagues to oppose his nomination.   I yield the floor.
