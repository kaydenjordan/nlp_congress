 Mr. President, thank you very much. I feel like we  should be talking about the deficit, which is of concern to us and wish  it were of more concern to----   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator wish to call up her motion?    Mr. President, yes, I do. I absolutely do.                               Motion to Commit    Mr. President, I call up my motion to commit, which is at the desk.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         The Senator from Michigan [Ms. STABENOW] moves to commit       the bill H.R. 1 to the Committee on Finance with instructions       to report the same back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting       any day on which the Senate is not in session, with changes       that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) to revert the corporate tax rates to 35 percent in the       event that real average household wages do not increase by at       least $4,000 by 2020.    The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.    Mr. President, this would put in place a guarantee that  middle-class families would receive the benefits they are being  promised in this bill. I am offering this motion to  [[Page S7537]]  commit with the support of Senators Casey, Van Hollen, Udall, Cardin,  Booker, Wyden, Menendez, Harris, and Brown.   I have said it before, and I will say it again, there is no question  we need tax reform. We need tax reform that creates jobs, incentivizes  companies to bring back jobs from overseas, protects our farmers, helps  small businesses, and puts more money in the pocket of middle-class  families in Michigan and across the country. That is what we need, and  that is what I would vote for and I know other colleagues on our side  would vote for, but that is not what this bill does. That is not what  this Republican bill does.   We know our friends across the aisle are in a hurry to pass this  legislation as quickly as possible before the American people discover  what a bad deal it is. Unfortunately, for Republicans, we keep  uncovering new ways that this tax legislation is a huge giveaway for  the wealthiest 1 percent. Now we know, from the latest scoring, it  blows a huge hole in our Nation's debt, expanding our Nation's debt.   Here are just a few ways this legislation hurts middle-class  families. It keeps a loophole that lets corporations write off their  expenses, their moving expenses, when they move jobs overseas. However,  a family moving across the country to Michigan for a new job could no  longer deduct their moving expenses. Big businesses could keep on  deducting their State and local taxes, but middle-class families,  sorry, no State and local tax deduction for you. Oil companies would  enjoy a brandnew $4 billion offshore tax loophole. Merry Christmas.  Meanwhile, 87 million American households who earn less than $200,000 a  year get a tax increase. Let me repeat that. Eighty-seven million  American households who earn less than $200,000 a year will get a tax  increase under the bill in front of us, and health insurance premiums  will go up by 10 percent, and continue to go up, while 13 million fewer  people would have healthcare coverage.   President Trump has called this bill, in his words, a ``great, big,  beautiful Christmas present'' for the American people. Well, I  certainly hope the American people remember to keep the gift  certificate. This bill is a disaster for the middle class and a  disaster for our future.   President Trump isn't the only person who has made big promises about  this legislation. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, one of the bill's  biggest salesmen, has said: ``On the personal tax side, middle-income  people are getting cuts and rich people are getting very little cuts.''  I would like to highlight his first words ``on the personal tax  side''--very sneaky language. Once all the proposals that actually help  the wealthy are taken into account, all of them, it is clear that those  in Secretary Mnuchin's personal income category are the real winners.   White House budget director Mick Mulvaney is making promises too. He  said, ``The White House, the President, is not going to sign a bill  that raises taxes on the middle class, period.'' I would assume, based  on that statement, he wouldn't sign this bill. The nonpartisan Tax  Policy Center found that 87 million middle-class and working families  will see their taxes go up.   Perhaps the biggest promise of them all came directly from the White  House. ``The average American family would get a $4,000 raise under the  President's tax cut plan.''   Republicans have promised hard-working, middle-class families in  Michigan and across the country that by giving the top 1 percent and  large corporations a huge tax giveaway--you know the trickle-down  economic approach--that magically they will receive $4,000, $7,000,  even $9,000 in extra income. By giving this big supply-side tax cut,  magically, families will receive $4,000, $7,000, or even $9,000 in  their income.   Well, the proof is in their paychecks. That is what is going to  happen for the American people. They are going to take a look at their  paychecks to find out whether this is true, and that is why I am  offering a motion that will ensure that the benefits of these tax cuts  go to the middle class and that the promises being made to the families  in Michigan and across the country will be kept. This motion would send  the bill back to the Finance Committee with instructions to include a  trigger to return the corporate rate to its current level if the  average household wage doesn't go up at least $4,000 in the next 2  years. That seems only fair to me. People are being told over and over  again they are going to get money directly in their pocket. The  President said a minimum of $4,000. Well, the proof is in your  paycheck. That is what the American people are going to be looking at.   This motion simply makes sure the American people get the raise the  Trump administration is promising them. If my Republican colleagues are  serious about putting more money in the pockets of the middle class, I  urge you to support this motion.   You know Michigan families could certainly use an extra $4,000 in  their paycheck. What they don't need are broken promises--the kind of  promises they have heard before too many times. Just think back to the  Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003. Colleagues from across the aisle came  to the floor and said the 2003 Bush tax cuts would ``allow us to grow  our way out of our current economic doldrums.'' What did we get?  Massive debt. And the Bush tax cuts ``will aid the people and  businesses who make up our economic machine and get it moving down the  tracks at full speed again.'' We got massive debt, and wages did not go  up. The train derailed, growth was anemic, and middle-class families  saw very little lasting benefit. If this approach worked, if trickle- down economics worked, I would be supporting this. There is no evidence  that this has ever worked.   A new analysis of the tax bill is even more skewed to the top than  the Bush tax cuts. Economist Bruce Bartlett served as Deputy Assistant  Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy during the Reagan and  George H.W. Bush administrations. Last month, when asked if tax cuts  pay for themselves through greater economic growth, Mr. Bartlett said:         That's a lie. It's always been a lie. . . . There's not one       iota of evidence that will support this argument.    In fact, he added that wages actually fell--actually fell--for 10  years after the Tax Reform Act of 1986 was enacted.   The Bush tax cuts didn't benefit middle-income families in the long  term. The Reagan tax cuts didn't benefit middle-income families in the  long term. What they did was cause the deficit to explode. That is a  fact. We all know what happened next. Republican colleagues pointed to  the huge deficits. President Bush said that now we need to privatize  Social Security, cut Medicare because, oh, my gosh, we have big  deficits. Thankfully, Democrats put an end to that plan. Well, another  distinguished Republican President once said: ``There you go again,''  and that is true.   The recently passed Republican budget resolution makes it clear that  their next step after this is to cut Medicare and Medicaid. In fact,  their budget already allows almost $1.5 trillion to be cut from these  programs. But don't take my word for it. Take their word for it.  Earlier this month, Speaker Paul Ryan made the Republican plan very  clear. He said: The next thing we are doing is going to entitlements-- Medicare and Medicaid. In fact, after the numbers that just came out  and the fact that even with dynamic scoring--what many would call  ``voodoo scoring''--it doesn't solve the problem on deficits. So it  means cutting Medicare and Medicaid may be suggested even sooner.    You have huge tax giveaways to the wealthy 1 percent, which causes  the deficit to explode and causes them to cut crucial programs like  Medicare and Medicaid. That is the scenario that is in front of us.   I hope people will remember this. This is only step one. When folks  come back and say: Oh, my gosh, there is a huge deficit; we have to cut  Medicare and Medicaid, they will remember this debate and this time.   Middle-class families see their taxes go up. They see their  healthcare costs go up, and they see Medicare, Social Security, and  Medicaid cut. This is worse than a one-two punch. It is a one-two-three  punch, and middle-class families will feel every blow.   Michigan families deserve better than this. American families deserve  better than this. American families deserve real tax reform that  creates jobs and incentivizes companies to bring  [[Page S7538]]  jobs back to America by closing loopholes, not creating new ones; that  protects our farmers, helps our small businesses, and puts more money  in their pocket. That is what I support.   They deserve to be told the truth about the end goal of this  Republican tax plan. If Republicans mean it when they say middle-class  families will get at least $4,000 more in wages, well then, everybody  should be voting for my motion to commit because American working men  and women know the proof is in their paycheck. The proof is in your  paycheck. The proof is in your paycheck. That is what every single man  and woman working today is going to look at--their paycheck.   All I am saying is that, if you are going to tell them there is  $4,000 more, then we are going to measure that in the next 2 years. If  there is, that is terrific, and if there isn't, this tax scheme should  stop.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.    Mr. President, in a few minutes, we are going to be  voting on a motion of mine that actually dovetails with what the  distinguished Senator from Florida was talking about in terms of hard- working people who have been told there will be a minimum of $4,000 put  into their wages based on what is being done in the Senate with the  Republican tax proposal. We have no evidence of that. In fact, we have  no economic scoring that shows that. We have no evidence in the past  that has ever been done with supply-side economics. If that is true, at  least $4,000 in people's wages is great. I think that is wonderful. We  want to guarantee that. We want to make sure the proof is in somebody's  paycheck.   I am very pleased to have Senators Casey, Van Hollen, Udall, Cardin,  Booker, Wyden, Menendez, Harris, and Brown joining me in a very simple  approach that I would hope everybody would support. If you are  confident that what is being done here in this supply-side tax cut is  going to end up with $4,000 in the pockets of middle-class families,  then let's make sure it is true. Let's make sure that happens.   We are going to measure this in 2 years. If it doesn't happen in the  next 2 years, then the tax cuts stop. Why? Because all they are doing  is blowing a hole in the budget. All they are doing is creating more  deficits and not putting money in people's pockets.   I hope everyone will join me. I agree, we have hard-working folks who  have  [[Page S7545]]  seen their wages flat for years. They have seen not only their wages  flat but their pensions attacked, and they find themselves in a  situation where, yes, they are working, but the wages are down or maybe  it is two jobs now instead of one in order to be able to keep the same  wage, but they feel like they are treading water and not getting ahead.  Folks are talking a lot about that, about wanting to help middle-class  families. Great. I have a lot of folks in Michigan who would love to  have $4,000, $5,000, $6,000 more in their wages. I would love to  support something that does that.   Let me go back and say, it didn't happen under the Bush tax cuts,  even under Reagan tax cuts. Wages were flat for the next 10 years. It  certainly didn't happen in Kansas with what they did, doing the same  kind of supply-side economics. If this could actually work, sign me up.  I think people deserve to make sure that promise will be kept.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.    I would urge that we vote to make sure the proof is in  the people's paychecks, and that is what this motion is.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.    Will the Senator yield for a question?    Will the Senator yield for a question?    Will the Senator yield for a question?    How many years do you think it will take before folks  get their $4,000--2021, 2022?    Mr. President, if I could just have 15 seconds, the  people in Michigan want to know when they are going to get their  $4,000. That is all.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.   The question is on agreeing to the Stabenow motion to commit.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk called the roll.   The result was announced--yeas 45, nays 55, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 289 Leg.]                                  YEAS--45       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Brown      Cantwell      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Coons      Cortez Masto      Duckworth      Durbin      Feinstein      Franken      Gillibrand      Harris      Hassan      Heinrich      Hirono      Kaine      King      Klobuchar      Leahy      Markey      McCaskill      Menendez      Merkley      Murphy      Murray      Nelson      Peters      Reed      Sanders      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen      Stabenow      Tester      Udall      Van Hollen      Warner      Warren      Whitehouse      Wyden                                  NAYS--55       Alexander      Barrasso      Blunt      Boozman      Burr      Capito      Cassidy      Cochran      Collins      Corker      Cornyn      Cotton      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Donnelly      Enzi      Ernst      Fischer      Flake      Gardner      Graham      Grassley      Hatch      Heitkamp      Heller      Hoeven      Inhofe      Isakson      Johnson      Kennedy      Lankford      Lee      Manchin      McCain      McConnell      Moran      Murkowski      Paul      Perdue      Portman      Risch      Roberts      Rounds      Rubio      Sasse      Scott      Shelby      Strange      Sullivan      Thune      Tillis      Toomey      Wicker      Young   The motion was rejected.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators,  the Senate will continue to debate the bill tonight, but the next  rollcall votes will be at 11 a.m. tomorrow.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.    Mr. President, today I wish to remember and pay  tribute to Judge Anna Diggs Taylor, who turned her lifelong passion for  justice into a highly successful legal career, breaking down barriers  for women and people of color and inspiring me and so many others in  our State.   When Anna Katherine Johnston was born in 1932 in Washington, DC,  women had very few options. African-American women had even fewer.  However, Anna's parents, Hazel Bramlette Johnston--a business teacher-- and Virginius Douglass Johnston--a Howard University trustee--deeply  believed in the power of education and in their smart, hard-working  daughter. When she was in 10th grade, they pulled her from the  segregated DC school system and enrolled her in the prestigious  Northfield School for Girls in Massachusetts, from which she graduated  in 1950.   Her own early experiences with segregation and witnessing how the law  could be used as a tool to further equality led her to the legal  profession. It wasn't a common career path for women in those days. In  fact, when she graduated from Yale Law School in 1957, there were only  four other women in her class. About 5,500 women were practicing  lawyers in the United States in 1960.   Anna got her chance to join those ranks when J. Ernest Wilkins, the  first African-American man appointed as an Assistant Secretary of  Labor, hired her as a staff lawyer in the Office of the Solicitor. In  1960, Anna married Congressman Charles Diggs, Jr., and moved to  Detroit, where she had two children and a career, including as an  assistant Wayne County prosecutor.   In 1964, her passion for justice led her to Mississippi, where she  represented civil rights workers who were jailed for helping register  African-American voters. She arrived the same day civil rights  activists James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner  disappeared, and she became a target of hatred herself when an angry  mob yelled racial slurs at her and three other activists as they were  leaving the Neshoba County courthouse after trying to question the  sheriff.   Over the years, Anna worked both in private practice and in public  service, as an assistant U.S. attorney and managing her husband's  congressional office. When she and her husband later divorced, she  helped to elect Coleman Young as Detroit's first Black mayor and worked  to integrate city government during his administration.   In 1976, Anna married S. Martin Taylor and worked on Jimmy Carter's  Presidential campaign. Three years later, President Garter appointed  her to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.  She was the first Black woman Federal judge to serve in our State and  the first Black Woman chief judge for that circuit. She retired in  2011.   She once said that ``black judges have an important role, especially  in staying close to their communities,'' and Judge Taylor did just  that. She was deeply involved in community organizations including the  Community Foundation for Southeast Michigan. She was an adjunct labor  law professor at Wayne State University, vice president of the Yale Law  School Association, and served on the joint steering committee of the  gender and racial ethnic fairness task forces for the Sixth Circuit,  positions that allowed her to help open the same doors that others had  opened for her.   In a biography, Judge Taylor once wrote that her legal career was ``a  thousand times more exciting, more intellectually challenging, and more  enriching'' than she had ever imagined while at Yale Law. That didn't  mean it was easy; breaking barriers never is. Yet she did it. Judge  Taylor's life and career will long serve as an example of just how far  you can go with hard work, persistence, and a passionate dedication to  your ideals.   I think that young girl in a segregated DC classroom would be really  proud. I know that many people in Michigan certainly are.   Thank you.                            ____________________
