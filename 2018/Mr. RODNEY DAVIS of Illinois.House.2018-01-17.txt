 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for  yielding. Chris Smith is one of the leaders in the pro-life movement  that we have had not just here in the House, but in our country.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today because I want to commemorate the 45th  anniversary of Roe v. Wade. Every year in January, families, religious  leaders, and students come to Washington, D.C., and march from the  National Mall to the Supreme Court. To me, the March for Life means  having renewed hope and faith in our Nation's young people, as I see  hundreds, many from perishes just like mine, come to our Nation's  Capital to stand for human life.   I want to recognize all of the groups from Illinois, who are  traveling to participate in this week's March for Life event, including  the 250 young people and chaperones from my Diocese in Springfield,  Illinois. As a father of a daughter and twin boys, I want to thank our  youth for their commitment to life.
