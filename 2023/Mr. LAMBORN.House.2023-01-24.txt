 Mr. Speaker, I rise to remember the lives lost due to  the Roe v. Wade decision. There are an estimated 64 million American  souls who are missing as a result. We gather today on this 50th  anniversary, solemnly, but hopefully.   As Members of Congress, we are tasked with representing our  constituents, even the unborn ones. I will always speak out and fight  to protect the sanctity of these lives.   It is difficult to imagine how we as a Nation allowed this decision  to stand for almost 50 years. I have hope and know that the Supreme  Court has provided for us a brighter future with their decision in  Dobbs.   Last Congress, as was just stated, I introduced the Second Chance at  Life Act. Chemical abortions can be reversed with no harm to the child  if the pregnant mother develops second thoughts midway through the  chemical abortion process. My legislation, again, in this Congress,  will give the opportunity of life for thousands of unborn children.   So, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Representative Smith and  Representative Fischbach for their leadership in the Congressional Pro- Life Caucus and for holding this Special Order.                                time  1945
