 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Nadler and  Chairwoman Lofgren for their leadership on this important bill. This  moment has been years in the making, thanks in no small part to the  advocates, the allies, and the young people who fought hard for their  right to stay in a country that they call and consider home.    Let me be clear, the American Dream and Promise Act is not perfect,  but there is a lot of good in it. This is a big step forward.   That is why I offered amendments to, first, prohibit juvenile  adjudications from being used to determine a public safety risk, and,  two, to eliminate all references to gang databases or presumed gang  affiliation from H.R. 6. It didn't make it, but it is still a great  compromise.   We cannot afford to turn our backs now. We must pass H.R. 6 today, a  significant precedent by the House of Representatives to create a  pathway to citizenship for millions.   Mr. Speaker, I thank everyone responsible for their contributions to  this piece of immigration reform.
