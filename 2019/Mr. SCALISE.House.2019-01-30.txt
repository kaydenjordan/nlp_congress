 Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland  (Mr. Hoyer), the majority leader, for the purpose of inquiring as to  the schedule for the week to come.    Madam Speaker, as it relates to the suspension calendar,  I know, this week, there was an extra bill added to the suspension  calendar that wasn't on the list by close of business last week. Do you  anticipate this Friday's list being amended again the following week,  or should that be a complete list?   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, clearly, as a suspension, it wasn't in  the traditional sense--obviously, it went down. There being a sense of  the House resolution, typically, those are resolutions where both sides  work together.   I ask the gentleman, do they anticipate approaching senses of the  House in a partisan way or, hopefully, in a bipartisan way, where we  can work together to get a true sense of the House that could pass?   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   Madam Speaker, as we approach bipartisan resolutions, we hope that  the gentleman from Maryland and his side would work with us on those.  It could have been a resolution that actually passed, had we been able  to work together and, hopefully, include some language about border  security.   As we look to the conference committee that is now meeting, as we  talk about border security especially being the centerpiece of the big  debate over government funding that, hopefully, we get agreement to,  there were reports that, last week, the Democrat majority was going to  roll out their plan for homeland security. Ultimately, that plan  wasn't, in fact, rolled out. Is there going to be a rollout? As we have  these negotiations----    I yield to the gentleman from Maryland to let him know  that his side said they wouldn't negotiate during a shutdown.  Obviously, the shutdown is over now. Will there be a counteroffer now  put on the table?    Madam Speaker, I look forward to hearing that proposal  laid out. As the House and Senate Republican and Democrat conferees  meet together, I do think, and have an optimistic approach, that we are  not that far removed from reaching a deal, if we can ultimately find a  way to put a real amount on the table that shows how we can secure the  border, as our experts--the men and women who risk their lives to  secure the border--have suggested in their proposal, if we can come to  a place where we can agree on a way to actually achieve border  security, and that includes physical barriers.   When the gentleman from Maryland, I think it was 2 weeks ago, was  talking about some Democrats who were going over to the White House  back then, it was said that they didn't have the authority to  negotiate. Do the Democrat conferees have the authority to negotiate on  behalf of the Democrat majority in the House?   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's quick  candor.   Madam Speaker, as we wrap this up, I would ask about an issue that a  number of our Members were concerned about and hope this is not a  trend. In the House Natural Resources Committee, the majority,  yesterday, as they were proposing their new rules for the committee-- and each committee, as we know, proposes their new rules as a new  Congress is sworn in and established on a committee level--in the oath  that is administered to men and women who come before the committee to  testify, the original proposal suggested removing ``so help you God''  from the oath. One of the Members on our side noticed that omission and  put an amendment in place to restore ``so help you God'' in the oath.  Fortunately, that was added back in.   I would ask the gentleman, is this going to be a trend? Is there  going to be some kind of general movement by committees to try to  remove ``so help you God'' from the oaths that are administered to  witnesses?    Madam Speaker, hopefully, it is not a trend that we see.   Madam Speaker, I know the last few weeks have been contentious. We  have a lot at stake as we try to get an agreement on something that  actually can work to properly fund the government and properly secure  the border.   I am glad that the conferees are finally meeting. I hope we don't see  any attempt to run out the clock, because we do have a limited amount  of time, although it is far more than enough time to reach an  agreement, if all parties are truly there in earnest, and I do think  they are.   I hope that they put all options on the table and listen to all the  proper expert testimony that has been given on why we need to have  certain amounts to secure the border and certain tactics and techniques  and technology that are all going to be part of this.   Hopefully, at the end of that discussion, very quickly, they can  reach an agreement that we can then bring to the House and the Senate  and pass in a bipartisan way that the President can sign to finally  properly fund the government and secure our Nation's border.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.                                time  1430     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman and I know we look  forward to welcoming the President of the United States to this House  Chamber on Tuesday night for the State of the Union Address.   I appreciate the work that we are going to do together to secure our  Nation's border and properly fund our government, and unless the  gentleman has something else he would like to add, I yield back the  balance of my time.                            ____________________
