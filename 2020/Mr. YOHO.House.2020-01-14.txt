 Madam Speaker, let's take a look at the chronological  timeline since Donald Trump won the primary. I mean, this movement  started immediately after that.   You can go to Mark Zaid, the attorney for the whistleblower. You can  go on and hear the Members of this body saying: We are going to impeach  him.   The vile words that came out of one of the Members from Michigan,  saying: We are going to impeach this m-effer.   Those people shouldn't even be allowed to serve in here with that  kind of an attitude and hatred. They set a goal to impeach this  President. They didn't have a reason, but they set a goal, and then  they searched for that goal.   It was the Steele dossier that was completely fabricated, paid for by  the Clinton campaign and DCCC, completely dispelled as false, but yet  they went down this. They dispelled the Mueller report. They kept going  to find something.   And then Adam Schiff said: We have irrefutable evidence that this  President colluded with the Russians. That turned out to be false. The  whistleblower, and the second whistleblower, and I could go on, but you  guys have heard enough of that stuff.   I want to come back to what our Founding Fathers said. This is  Washington's warning to this Republic 223 years ago.   The Constitution rightly sets a high bar for impeachment, but the  integrity of the process also depends on the ability of legislators to  vote their minds independent of party politics. Removing a President is  too important, and lawmakers are given too much latitude to define high  crimes and misdemeanors for it to be any other way; otherwise,  excessively partisan politicians could overturn an election simply  because the President is a member of the opposing party.   It is in regards to this impeachment process that George Washington  forewarned us of this moment in history when political parties ``may  now and then answer popular ends,'' but ``they are likely, in the  course of time and things, to become potent engines by which cunning,  ambitious, and unprincipled men'' and women ``will be enabled to  subvert the power of the people and to usurp for themselves the reins  of government. . . . ''   That is what we have here.                                time  1530
