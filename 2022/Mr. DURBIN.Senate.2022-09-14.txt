 Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm  Lara Montecalvo to serve on the First Circuit Court of Appeals. Ms.  Montecalvo has significant litigation experience at both the trial and  appellate level and will be an outstanding addition to the bench.   She attended Swarthmore College and Boston College Law School. Ms.  Montecalvo then worked in the Justice Department's Tax Division as a  trial attorney. In 2004, Ms. Montecalvo began working in the Rhode  Island Public Defender's Office. She became the Rhode Island Public  Defender in 2020.   As a DOJ trial attorney and as a State public defender, Ms.  Montecalvo gained experience in both State and Federal court. She has  tried more than 20 cases to verdict, including 15 as sole counsel. In  addition, she has personally handled more than 80 appeals. The American  Bar Association rated her ``well qualified'' to serve on the First  Circuit, and she has the strong support of Senators Reed and  Whitehouse.   Ms. Montecalvo has shown that she is committed to equal justice. I  will be supporting her and urge my colleagues to do the same.    I announce that the Senator from Michigan (Ms. Stabenow)  is necessarily absent.   The result was announced--yeas 52, nays 47, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 335 Ex.]                                  YEAS--52       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Brown      Cantwell      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Collins      Coons      Cortez Masto      Duckworth      Durbin      Feinstein      Gillibrand      Graham      Hassan      Heinrich      Hickenlooper      Hirono      Kaine      Kelly      King      Klobuchar      Leahy      Lujan  [[Page S4590]]        Manchin      Markey      Menendez      Merkley      Murkowski      Murphy      Murray      Ossoff      Padilla      Peters      Reed      Rosen      Sanders      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen      Sinema      Smith      Tester      Van Hollen      Warner      Warnock      Warren      Whitehouse      Wyden                                  NAYS--47       Barrasso      Blackburn      Blunt      Boozman      Braun      Burr      Capito      Cassidy      Cornyn      Cotton      Cramer      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Ernst      Fischer      Grassley      Hagerty      Hawley      Hoeven      Hyde-Smith      Inhofe      Johnson      Kennedy      Lankford      Lee      Lummis      Marshall      McConnell      Moran      Paul      Portman      Risch      Romney      Rounds      Rubio      Sasse      Scott (FL)      Scott (SC)      Shelby      Sullivan      Thune      Tillis      Toomey      Tuberville      Wicker      Young                               NOT VOTING--1               Stabenow           The nomination was confirmed.
