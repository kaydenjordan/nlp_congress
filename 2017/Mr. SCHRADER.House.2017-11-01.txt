 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share the story of Juan  Navarro in Monmouth, Oregon, and to continue to urge Speaker Ryan to  put forth a clean Dream Act bill.   Juan was brought to the United States, when he was 3 years old, from  Guadalajara, Mexico. Juan suffers from cerebral palsy and was unable to  walk. Juan was admitted as a research patient in Shriners Hospital, and  after multiple surgeries and 12 long years of physical therapy, Juan  now is able to walk without any support.   While Juan was receiving care, his parents had to work two jobs,  something we all used to do. They did this to provide a better life for  Juan.   Over time, Juan excelled in school, and Oregon became his home.   Juan is an active member in the Monmouth and Western Oregon  University communities. He serves as a diversity student mentor, works  with the faculty at Western Oregon to create a campus website that  lists available resources for undocumented students, works for the city  of Monmouth as a community liaison, and started a support group for  DREAMers at Western Oregon University.   Juan is the first person in his family to graduate from college and  is currently attending graduate school at Oregon State University's  College Student Services Administration program. He currently works as  a graduate assistant and hopes to bring more institutional changes for  students of color.   Without DACA, none of this would have been possible for Juan, and our  country would have lost out on a motivated and talented person.   Young people across the country are relying on us. We need to pass a  clean Dream Act that will recognize Juan and the over 800,000 DREAMers  as equal members of our community.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, this fire season has put the need for  real forest management in stark relief for those of us who live out  West.   The current laissez-faire forest policy, with random desperate  measures to fight increasingly horrific fires that threaten and destroy  rural and now--as we have seen in California--suburban communities is  completely inadequate and increasingly costly to the taxpayer.   This bill, contrary to what some have said, rewards communities that  have proactive, collaborative programs; stewardship programs; rural  advisory committees; and wildfire protection plans to manage their  forests without redundant NEPA processes.   A few thousand acres out of the millions acres of Federal forest land  are now going to be enabled to be managed for wildlife successional  forest habitat; removal of dangerous roadside and infrastructure  threatening vegetation; insect and disease infestations; reducing  hazardous fuel in the forests; and,  [[Page H8331]]  frankly, doing a little reforesting of salvage projects, which should  have been allowed years ago.   We also pilot a few arbitration projects to stop the endless  frivolous litigation of every single forest project, at least in  Oregon, and I think elsewhere.   SRS payments continue to rural communities whose way of life has  been, basically, taken away from them by the endless frivolous  litigation in our Federal forests. Counties, for the first time, get  some revenue from the very stewardship contracts that we want to  encourage, but not at the expense of rural communities' economic  health.   Many are still stuck in the recession, and this bill is critical to  their revival. Oregon counties in the Oregon and California railroad  areas also get the opportunity to be made whole again, like the  original statute said.   I think it is important to note for a lot of our friends out there  that the current regional forest plans still apply and are not  undermined. We just give flexibility to the Forest Service folks within  the regions to do what they think needs to be done to keep those  forests healthy. We empower good management.   For those of you who are interested in innovation, this bill actually  calls out cross-laminated timber and other thoughtful uses of forests  and timber that can bring environmental and timber groups together like  it should be in the 21st century.   Finally, most important of all for some folks, we actually get  wildfire disaster funding included as a reasonable topic of  conversation and get out of the current fire-borrowing policy that is  preventing the Forest Service and BLM from doing good forest management  to prevent those fires in the first place.   On balance, frankly, this is a very good bill and it is much-needed  at this time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 13, line 6, insert ``or'' after the semicolon.        Page 13, strike line 7 (and redesignate the subsequent       paragraph accordingly).        Page 13, line 9, strike ``through (6)'' and insert       ``through (5)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 595, the gentleman  from Oregon (Mr. Schrader) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, I would like to thank my colleagues, Representatives  DeFazio and Panetta, for offering this amendment with me today. I think  it is one of the important changes we can make that will help improve  the Resilient Federal Forests Act.   Collaborative forest management activities and categorical exclusions  are an important tool in forest management and are designed to help the  Forest Service and BLM speed the ability of those agencies to get into  areas more quickly to improve forest health.   I believe the use of categorical exclusion should be reserved for  reducing hazardous fuel loads, addressing disease and insect  infestation, protecting water resources or increasing water yield, and  maintaining or enhancing critical habitat. That makes sense. All these  activities are very appropriate as designated activities for  categorical exclusions.   Listing timber production as a designated activity, I believe, does  not work in this context. Timber is a byproduct of all those  activities. Therefore, it is unnecessary to actually include it as a  specific designated activity.   Our amendment simply strikes timber production from the list of  designated activities for categorical exclusion under section 111. It  is a pretty clear-cut issue, in my book.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I would like to thank the chairman and Mr.  Westerman for the bill and being congenial and good folks to work with  for a bipartisan piece of legislation we desperately need.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
