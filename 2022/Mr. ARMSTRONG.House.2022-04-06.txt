 Madam Speaker, the fact is, President Trump has  exerted executive privilege, and Mr. Scavino has raised the issue of  executive privilege at President Trump's request.  [[Page H4375]]    No matter how much my colleagues on the other side want to say  differently, it is a legitimate assertion, considering the D.C. Circuit  Court, in Nixon v. Administrator, held that the executive privilege can  be raised by a former President, a determination recently reinforced by  Justice Kavanaugh in Trump v. Thompson by stating that the right of a  former President to assert executive privilege exists, even if the  sitting President does not support that privilege. Concluding otherwise  would, in fact, actually eviscerate the privilege in total.   Keep in mind that the ruling on executive privilege in Trump v.  Thompson deals with a narrow set of documents from the National  Archives. It has no bearing on whether Mr. Scavino testifies. The  ruling does not apply to documents at issue in this case, nor does it  apply to the testimony sought by the committee or whether the committee  has a legitimate purpose for conversations between President Trump and  his aide.   The select committee has refused to acknowledge President Trump's  assertion of privilege as it applies to Mr. Scavino, and the committee  takes an overexpansive view of what Trump v. Thompson actually says and  fails to even acknowledge that the Supreme Court case of Nixon v.  Administrator exists.   This is not a settled question, and it is not nearly as clear-cut as  some would have you believe.
