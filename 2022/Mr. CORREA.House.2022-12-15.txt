 Mr. Speaker, this is a great country. I rise to honor the  life and legacy of Judge James Ortega Perez. Part of the Greatest  Generation, Judge Ortega Perez grew up in my district, in a segregated  community, a farmworker. When World War II started, he answered the  call of duty and joined the Army where he served as a sergeant with the  Army Corps of Engineers.   After fighting for this great country, he came back and finished his  high school graduation at Santa Ana High School, but he wasn't done.  Then he enrolled at the University of Southern California, where he got  a bachelor's degree and then went on to USC Law School. He then became  the first Latino attorney in Orange County, California. Then he was  appointed as the first Latino judge in Orange County, California.   It is a great country. Judge Ortega Perez went from being a  farmworker to the halls of justice in Orange County. Today, we honor  the life and legacy of Judge Ortega Perez.                            ____________________
