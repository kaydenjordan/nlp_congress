 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak out against the ongoing  epidemic of gun violence in our cities and towns.   There is no gun violence without guns. From the countless calls I  receive from my constituents to the majority of Americans who have  voiced their support for gun control reform, something must be done by  Congress.   So many Americans are haunted by the gun violence that has taken  their loved ones, and that is why we should all be in favor of stronger  gun laws to keep these weapons out of dangerous hands.   Too many lives have been stolen. Too many children have been killed.   For this reason, I will be introducing the Safer Neighborhoods Gun  Buyback Act of 2023. My bill would provide Federal grants to States,  local governments, and gun dealers to conduct gun buyback programs  across the country.   We need a national program to give all towns and cities the funds to  get guns off our streets. This is commonsense legislation, and if made  into public law, it would benefit our Nation greatly.                            ____________________
