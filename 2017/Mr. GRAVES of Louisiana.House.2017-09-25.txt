 Mr. Speaker, I rise and want to make  comments actually echoing a lot of the comments that were made already.   The gentleman from Massachusetts talked about this needing to be a  bipartisan bill, and I agree. The gentleman from New Jersey talked  about Hurricane Sandy tax relief, and I agree. The gentleman from  Florida talked about the need to ensure that we are responding quickly  and appropriately in response to the devastating disasters that have  affected his State of Florida and the State of Texas. I also support  the gentleman from Pennsylvania's comments regarding a short-term  reauthorization to the FAA so we can continue to move forward on  reform.   But you may be wondering why, Mr. Speaker, groups like the  Association of State Floodplain Managers and the Consumer Federation of  America have expressed opposition to this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I include these letters in the Record.                                                Association of State                                       Floodplain Managers, Inc.,                                                 September 24, 2017.      Re Private flood insurance in H.R. 3823, Disaster Tax Relief           and Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2017.         Dear Leadership of the U.S. House of Representatives: Early       this week, the House will consider legislation promoting       development of private flood insurance as part of a bill to       reauthorize the FAA for 6 months and provide hurricane tax       relief. The bill is scheduled to be taken up under suspension       this week. ASFPM strongly objects to consideration of private       flood outside the reauthorization of the NFIP. The proposed       bill does not insert HR 2901 from the 114th Congress as       mentioned in press reports, but inserts HR 1422, the Ross-      Castor bill from the 115th Congress as Title 4, with       provisions that as written could substantially weaken and       undermine the critical functioning of the National Flood       Insurance Program,. The NFIP not only provides flood       insurance, but is a comprehensive flood risk management       program.        Although we understand the potential benefits of more flood       insurance options, we point out that the private market has       been readily expanding since Biggert-Waters 2012 was passed       authorizing private flood insurance. ASFPM cannot support       authorization for private flood insurance as written in HR       1422. The temporary extension and reauthorization of the NFIP       expires on 8 Dec 2017, giving Congress ample time to consider       the full scope of the NFIP, into which private flood must       integrate, without causing irreparable damage to the other 3       fundamental elements of this comprehensive flood risk       management program. Those are floodplain mapping,       implementation of local floodplain ordinances to protect new       development, and hazard mitigation grants to reduce damage       and loss of life from flooding.        ASFPM has stated that three modifications of that HR 1422       language must be made to ensure continuity of the       comprehensive flood risk reduction aspects of the NFIP that       exist today. A federal policy fee on all NFIP policies pays       for almost half the cost of floodplain mapping and all of the       costs of floodplain management including technical assistance       to over 22,000 communities that have joined the NFIP. Hazard       mitigation grants are funded by premium income to the       program. None of these functions are provided by private       flood insurance policies.        Yet private insurance companies acknowledge that mapping       (i.e. identification of flood risk areas and areas of       mandatory purchase of flood insurance) and floodplain       management (i.e. reduced risk due to local requirements for       hazard-resistant construction) help them to target their       marketing and to price premiums lower where floodplain       ordinances exist.        First, private policies must also carry the federal policy       user fee to support the mapping and floodplain management       functions. Private flood policy holders, private insurance       companies, as well as the NFIP and its policy holders,       benefit from these functions by identifying at-risk areas,       ensuring building construction standards which facilitate       lower flood insurance premiums, and targeting areas and       structures which could benefit from mitigation actions       leading to lower premiums. As policies migrate to the private       sector, millions of dollars in revenue to support those       floodplain management and mapping functions will be lost       unless there is an equivalent policy user fee on private       policies.        Second, private policies to satisfy the mandatory purchase       requirement for properties in floodplains must only be sold       in communities that participate in the NFIP (meaning  [[Page H7467]]       they have adopted floodplain management ordinances to guide       safer development). In smaller communities with only a       handful of properties required to purchase flood insurance,       if that requirement can be met with private policies, those       communities may drop out of the NFIP and no longer maintain       floodplain management ordinances to reduce future losses.       This could result in lack of abililty to reduce future flood       losses and in taxpayers picking up disaster costs.        Third, several provisions of the existing definition of       private flood insurance must be retained. The Biggert-Waters       2012 legislation (42 USC 4012a(b)(7)) defines private flood       insurance, among other things, as providing coverage ``at       least as broad as'' that provided by the NFIP. The language       provides consumer protections to ensure policies would not       have excessive deductibles, exclusions, or eliminate some       essential coverages like Increased Cost of Compliance, which       provides assistance to policyholders to rebuild in a manner       that reduces flood damage in the future. Without these       important provisions in place, policyholders could face       unaffordable deductibles when they have a claim; communities       would find it much harder to help homeowners become eligible       for mitigation funding; and there would be a greater chance       that claim payments would not be applied to building repairs       resulting in increased community blight. ASFPM further notes       that with this language in place, the private market has       already been growing. The private flood insurance bill       strikes this language.        The nation's floodplain managers strongly urge adoption of       these elements if private flood language is added to the       House NFIP reauthorization bill. This would preserve the       flood risk mapping and floodplain management functions that       the NFIP provides and would protect consumers from purchasing       low-cost policies that provide less than adequate coverage       and/or higher deductibles they could not pay. This would not       happen if insureds had an NFIP policy.        The Association of State Floodplain Managers (ASFPM) and       its 36 chapters represent more than 17,000 state and local       officials, as well as other professionals engaged in all       aspects of floodplain management and flood hazard mitigation       including management of local floodplain ordinances, flood       risk mapping, engineering, planning, community development,       hydrology, forecasting, emergency response, water resources       development and flood insurance. All ASFPM members are       concerned with reducing our nation's flood-related losses.        Again we urge you to oppose inclusion of these ill-advised       private flood provisions outside of the context of       comprehensive NFIP reauthorization legislation. The       suspension package makes it impossible to properly address       these issues. Thank you for seriously considering these       recommendations from the Association of State Floodplain       Managers.            Very sincerely,                                                    Chad Berginnis,      ASFPM Executive Director.                                   ____                                   Consumer Federation of America,                                                 September 25, 2017.      Re Oppose adding flood insurance provisions of H.R. 1422 to           the FAA extension bill.         Dear Representative: Today, the House will consider       legislation promoting development of private flood insurance       as part of a bill to reauthorize the FAA for six months and       provide hurricane tax relief. The bill is scheduled to be       taken up under suspension this week. CFA strongly objects to       consideration of private flood insurance outside the       reauthorization of the National Flood Insurance Program       (NFIP). The proposed bill does not include H.R. 2901 from the       114th Congress as mentioned in press reports, but rather,       includes H.R. 1422, the Ross-Castor bill from the 115th       Congress as Title 4, with provisions that as written could       substantially weaken and undermine the critical functioning       of the NFIP.        We oppose the inclusion of H.R. 1422 for numerous reasons:        First, several provisions of the existing definition of       private flood insurance must be retained. The Biggert-Waters       2012 legislation (42 USC 4012a(b)(7)) defines private flood       insurance, among other things, as providing coverage ``at       least as broad as'' that provided by the NFIP. The language       provides consumer protections to ensure policies would not       have excessive deductibles, exclusions, or eliminate some       essential coverages like ``increased cost of compliance,''       which provides assistance to policyholders to rebuild in a       manner that reduces flood damage in the future. Without these       important consumer protective provisions in place,       policyholders could face unaffordable deductibles when they       have a claim; communities would find it much harder to help       homeowners become eligible for mitigation funding; and there       would be a greater chance that claim payments would not be       applied to building repairs resulting in increased community       blight. The Association of State Floodplain Managers (ASFPM)       further notes that with this language in place, the private       market has already been growing. The private flood insurance       bill strikes this language which significantly eliminates       important consumer protections.        Second, the 45 day notice of cancellation provision must be       maintained or private insurers could cancel coverage when a       storm is approaching and not leave consumers with enough time       to get NFIP coverage, which has a 30-day waiting period for       coverage attachment. H.R. 1422 as included in this bill       problematically removes this notice provision.        Third, surplus line insurers should not be authorized to       sell flood insurance since they are not covered by state       guarantee funds should they fail after a big storm, and they       are not regulated by the states and should not be allowed to       offer flood insurance unless the policy provisions are at       least equal to the NFIP coverage and the Federal Emergency       Management Agency (FEMA) is given some authority to regulate       claims practices. H.R. 1422, as included in this bill,       permits surplus line insurers to sell flood insurance,       placing consumers at risk.        Fourth, private policies must also carry the federal policy       user fee to support the mapping and floodplain management       functions. Private flood policy holders, private insurance       companies, as well as the NFIP and its policy holders,       benefit from these functions by identifying at-risk areas,       ensuring building construction standards which facilitate       lower flood insurance premiums, and targeting areas and       structures which could benefit from mitigation actions       leading to lower premiums. As policies migrate to the private       sector, millions of dollars in revenue to support those       floodplain management and mapping functions will be lost       unless there is an equivalent policy user fee on private       policies. H.R. 1422 would diminish flood mapping resources       and increase risk to consumers.        Fifth, private policies to satisfy the mandatory purchase       requirement for properties in floodplains must only be sold       in communities that participate in the NFIP (meaning they       have adopted floodplain management ordinances to guide safer       development). In smaller communities with only a handful of       properties required to purchase flood insurance, if that       requirement can be met with private policies, those       communities may drop out of the NFIP and no longer maintain       floodplain management ordinances to reduce future losses.       This could result in a lack of ability to reduce future flood       losses and in taxpayers picking up disaster costs.        We strongly urge you to oppose the inclusion of H.R. 1422       in the FAA extension bill.            Sincerely,                                                  J. Robert Hunter,                                            Director of Insurances.     Mr. Speaker, extraneous provisions on flood  insurance that should not be pasted into this legislation were  included. These provisions actually undermine the very solvency of the  program. They are establishing a private market at a time when the  National Flood Insurance Program--the Federal program--is going to need  the resources to pay claims. Establishing a private market within 60  days is going to divert resources from the Federal program to private  insurers. It is going to divert these dollars to where they don't have  the resources to make the payments.   Private insurance companies are already involved in flood insurance,  and once we authorize them to step into these markets, they are going  to be able to cherry-pick low- and moderate-risk policies, leaving the  National Flood Insurance Program with only high-risk policies, leaving  them with the burden of flood mapping and leaving them with the burden  of a $24.6 billion debt. I don't understand how the program is going to  have the resources to pay the claims it underwrites.   Next, Mr. Speaker, one of the other big problems we have is that this  shows floods in Texas, floods in Louisiana, and gutting homes in  Louisiana here and in Texas there.                                time  1730    These were both 1,000-year flood events. I don't understand the  difference on why we choose these folks get tax relief and these don't.  We introduced nearly identical legislation to address this.   We shouldn't be discriminating against folks in New Jersey and New  York and Louisiana in exchange for the others.
