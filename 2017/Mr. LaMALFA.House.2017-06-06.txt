 Mr. Speaker, on this day, June 6, 1944, 73 years ago,  the largest amphibious assault in history landed on the beaches of  Normandy, known as Operation Overlord, which we know more commonly as  D-Day.   I rise today, 73 years later, to honor the thousands of Allied  soldiers who lost their lives on the beaches of Omaha, Utah, Gold,  Juno, and Sword, and those, as well, that lived to carry the battle,  ultimately, to Berlin and win.   General Eisenhower told his soldiers that ``the hopes and prayers of  liberty-loving people everywhere march with you.'' Today we commemorate  the operation which began the liberation of Europe from Nazi control  and paved the way for the eventual Allied victory in Europe--and for  all of us to remain vigilant to preserve that same precious and fragile  freedom.   As was said in the movie ``Saving Private Ryan,'' for all of us,  ``Earn this.''                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 7 o'clock and 23 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, June 7, 2017, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
