 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  life and legacy of my dear friend and fellow Eagle Scout, Jim Kennedy.  I got to know him well over the years through the Juniata Valley  Council where he was the Council Scout Executive.   Jim embodied the Scouting oath and law. He was trustworthy, loyal,  helpful, friendly, and courteous, to name just a few. Jim dedicated  himself to service and worked diligently to better his community,  making significant improvements to the Seven Mountains Scout Camp and  earning national recognition for the Council.   Jim is survived by his wife of nearly 40 years, Andrea, and their  three sons: Matthew, Phillip, and Lincoln. Jim, his family, and the  Juniata Valley Scouting community are all in our prayers as we grieve  this loss together.   Trail signs taught in Scouting, Mr. Speaker, show a circle of stones  with one stone in the center as the sign for gone home. Jim Kennedy  reached the end of his trail in life and returned home living Scouting  values.   Rest in peace, Scouter.                            ____________________
