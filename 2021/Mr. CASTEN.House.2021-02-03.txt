 Madam Speaker, climate change is an existential treat to  our species. Atmospheric CO2 levels are now higher than at  any point in the last 3 million years. Half of all those emissions were  released since 1985. We are in trouble, and that trouble is  accelerating, but addressing that trouble is a massive economic  opportunity.   Rather than being paralyzed by fear, let's inspire Americans toward  that opportunity, because virtually anything we do to reduce  CO2 emissions makes us wealthier. Making heat and power  without burning fossil fuel means you don't have to pay for fossil  fuel. Clean energy is cheap energy.   For those who still like pollution, all that future generations ask  you is to love being rich a little bit more. And that is why I was so  heartened to see President Biden's recent executive orders procuring  clean energy for the Federal Government, phasing out market-distorting  fossil fuel subsidies, incorporating the social cost of carbon into our  decisionmaking, to name just a few, and that is just the start.   Madam Speaker, let us all in this body now build on that leadership.  Let us build back better and build back greener. Let us leave our  children a better planet than the one we inherited. Let us embrace  science. But most of all, let us lead.                            ____________________
