 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge Republicans  and Democrats to join us on this vote to extend the vital jobs-saving  program, the Paycheck Protection Program, which will provide relief to  small businesses that desperately need it during this public health  crisis. It is not just the small businesses that will benefit. It is  actually for the workers who work in those businesses to keep their  jobs.   With talk that the House Democrat leadership is looking to finish our  legislative business and send us home early, we should be doing  everything that we can in our power to provide that relief to small  businesses that desperately need it.   In my district in southwest Washington, almost 9,500 small businesses  have accessed critical paycheck protection loans. Surgical Training  Institute in Camas was able to keep its 22 employees employed. The  little Neptune Theatre in Pacific County also took advantage of this  program. Altogether, they have saved 92,000 jobs.   That is 92,000 people--individuals, moms, dads, brothers, and  sisters--who are able to continue providing for their families by  putting food on the table and keeping a roof over their kids' heads.   This should not be a political football. Across the Nation, the PPP  has helped save millions of jobs, and small businesses have been able  to keep their doors open and pay their employees.   This is not a partisan issue. Let's stop talking about what was done  in the past. Let's look forward and fix the problem. Join with us now  and support extending this program.   To me, it is a shame that small business relief and relief for  workers is a partisan issue. It should not be treated like a political  football here in Congress. This is not a hostage we should hold on to  to get anybody's wish list passed. We should pass this.   The fact of the matter is that the PPP expired on August 8, and we  have been in session many days between now and then. With nearly $135  billion still in the program, Congress must act now to free up these  funds and get relief to those who need it most.   Thousands of businesses across the country are on the brink of  collapse and mass layoffs, and they are crying out for help. If we do  not act now to extend the PPP, they could all go under. We are talking  about our neighborhood mom-and-pop shops that are the backbone of our  communities. We don't have any more time to waste.   Mr. Speaker, I urge defeat of the previous question so the House can  advance bipartisan relief to small businesses.                                time  1215
