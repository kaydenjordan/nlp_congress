 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate  Veronica Sierzant for winning the Lawton M. Calhoun award from the  Greater Savannah Athletics Hall of Fame.   The Calhoun award is presented annually to the most outstanding  athlete across all sports in Chatham County. Veronica is a senior at  Islands High School and has committed to playing volleyball next year  at Syracuse University where both her parents competed in athletics.   She was selected as the Savannah Morning News Player of the Year her  junior year and has been the first three-time champion of the Hollis  Stacy award, which is given to the most outstanding female athlete in  Savannah.   During her senior season, she was voted team captain and led the  Raiders to a Region 3-4A title.   Off the court, Veronica is a member of the National Honor Society,  the Spanish National Honor Society, and the Future Farmers of America.   Madam Speaker, I wish her the best of luck and know she will  represent the First District well at Syracuse University this fall.                            ____________________
