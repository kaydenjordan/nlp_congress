 Mr. Speaker, this is an unprecedented crisis that requires  an unprecedented, bold response.   The HEROES Act will support workers, families, hospitals, and cities  in my district struggling to get by with: direct payments for families;  extended unemployment benefits; vital funding for police, firefighters,  teachers, cities, and Tribal governments; and investment in testing,  tracing, and treating coronavirus so we can safely get our country back  to work.   The American people can't wait for their savings to run dry and their  businesses to go bankrupt. Vote ``yes'' today for the HEROES Act to  bring relief to American families as we mitigate this health crisis.
