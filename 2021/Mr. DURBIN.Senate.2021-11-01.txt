 Madam President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm  Toby Heytens to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth  Circuit.   He is an accomplished appellate advocate, with a depth of experience  and a fair-mindedness that would make him an asset to the Fourth  Circuit. He started as a clerk on the Third Circuit, completed a  prestigious fellowship at the Justice Department's Office of the  Solicitor General, and then he clerked for Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Not a  bad resume.   After a few years in private practice, Mr. Heytens rejoined the  Justice Department as an assistant to the Solicitor General. Most  recently, he was Solicitor General for the Commonwealth of Virginia.   He is a distinguished academic--taught at Cornell Law School, joined  the faculty at UVA Law School, codirected the Supreme Court Litigation  Clinic.   Mr. Heytens has personally argued 10 cases before the U.S. Supreme  Court--there aren't many people who can say that--and handled the  briefing in more than 50 other cases before the Court, and the breadth  of these cases is impressive.   With such credentials, it is not surprising he enjoys the strong  support of Senators Kaine and Warner.   He has been unanimously rated ``well qualified'' by the American Bar  Association, and his nomination is supported by leaders in the legal  community, including three former Republican Solicitors General under  President George W. Bush.   He is a dedicated public servant. I will be voting for him, and I  hope my colleagues will join me.                                   COVID-19    Madam President, on another matter, this weekend saw the happy return  of a tradition in many neighborhoods.   Last night, my senatorial assignment was to be at the front door of  my home in Springfield, IL, and pass out candy to the trick-or- treaters.   After a year off because of COVID, Halloween was back. We had at  least 80, maybe 100, kids show up, and they were all having a great  time, as we all remember our own youth.   What a difference vaccines can make. Slowly but surely, we are  putting this pandemic behind us. And after a difficult year-plus of  remote learning, kids are going back to school across America.   Three days ago, we received some long-awaited news that will enable  parents to breathe another sigh of relief and allow children to be  safely vaccinated. The FDA authorized Pfizer vaccinations for kids  between ages 5 and 11.   While it is true that healthy children generally are at lower risk  from this virus, they are not immune, and testing had to take place,  and it has taken place. The new lower-dose COVID vaccine can protect  our kids--and grandkids, I might add. And I want to do everything I can  to make sure that happens.   I usually tell the story, which dates me, but I know the reality of  my impression on those who are watching. I have been around a few  years, and I remember in the 1950s, when we were scared to death of  polio, and along came Jonas Salk--God bless his memory--with a new  vaccine, and we all lined up, rolled up our sleeves, and got  [[Page S7526]]  a shot, and there wasn't a question asked.   We saw the ravages of polio--the iron lungs, the crippled children,  and some who lost their lives--and we did what we should do: we  followed our parents' guidance, got the vaccinations. We virtually  eliminated polio in America as a result of it.   We have got to do the same thing, when it comes to COVID, for  children.   The new COVID vaccine for young children is just the latest proof  that President Biden's leadership and efforts are working.   Not one Republican, I might add, not one, could see their way to vote  for President Biden's American Rescue Plan. It was that same rescue  plan which set up the program across America to administer vaccines.   Where would we be today if we were still struggling to do that?   I want to thank the Biden administration for that leadership. We are  starting to see good results, despite the Delta variant. And I think  that we can see at least the possibility of putting this pandemic  behind us. But I hope more people will get vaccinated so that that will  happen sooner rather than later.   Every week--and I have noticed--some of our Republican colleagues,  including their leader, come to this floor to propose undercutting  commonsense vaccine policies that exist to protect our Nation. These  Senators, to my knowledge, have all been vaccinated; yet, when it comes  to the mistruths and distortions about vaccinations, they are strangely  silent. I think we know why.   Apparently, they think pitting Americans against each other is good  politics, but it may be good politics one day and bad public health for  a long time. It is corrosive to our public spirit. America is strongest  when we are united.    We will no doubt hear our Republican colleagues cheer on the small  minority of police and firefighters in cities like New York and  Chicago, who continue to refuse to get vaccinated, despite mandates.   Here is a number that we should keep in mind, those of us who say,  and I count myself as one, that we respect law enforcement and want  them to be strong and safe--last year, five times more law enforcement  officers died of COVID than died of gun violence.   Let me repeat that. Last year, five times more policemen died of  COVID than died from gun violence.   COVID is the No. 1 killer of law enforcement officers in America  today. And so when we talk about being on the side of the police, and  you want to save their lives--I sure do. I want them to be safe on the  job, but I also want them to be vaccinated so that they don't succumb  to the illnesses that follow when they are not.   If you care about police safety--if you really care about police  safety, put this pandemic behind us once and for all and get  vaccinated, and speak up when people decide, on FOX TV and others, to  peddle this anti-vax quackery that we see too often.    I announce that the Senator from New York (Mrs.  Gillibrand) is necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from New York (Mrs.  Gillibrand) is necessarily absent.
