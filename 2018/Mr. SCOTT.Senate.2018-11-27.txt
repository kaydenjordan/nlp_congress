 Mr. President, today it is my pleasure to honor the  Pelham Batesville Fire Department, as the fire district celebrates its  50th anniversary. Since 1968, the district and fire department have  dutifully provided fire and rescue services to a large area of upstate  South Carolina, including parts of Greenville County, Spartanburg  County, and Greer.  [[Page S7131]]    Time and again, the PBFD has remained vigilant and steadfast in their  commitment to providing the best emergency services to the community.  True dedication and generosity are characteristics frequently used to  describe this department; once, PBFD firefighters pitched in to just to  pay for gas to drive the trucks to the next emergency. Today, the  future of the department looks bright, as it grows at an unprecedented  rate and now includes four stations. I look forward to hearing of their  continued success.   Congratulations on 50 years, Pelham Batesville Fire Department and  district, and thank you for your continued services to the  upstate.                            ____________________
