 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for  yielding.   Mr. Chairman, one of the components in this legislation has to do  with the California high-speed rail line which was originally bonded  for $9.9 billion in 2008. The high-speed rail would run from San  Francisco to Los Angeles, and the projected total cost was deemed to be  around $33 billion that the voters of California were sold when this  was placed on the ballot. They would fund $9.9 billion of it. The rest  would come from the private sector, seeing that it would be such a  great investment and they would make a lot of money at that. The  completion date would be 2020.  [[Page H5422]]    As I look at the calendar, we are already 3 years behind the 2020  date. As well, they have been looking for more money because they have  fallen way short. The silence has been deafening from the private  investors who have not come in on that because they know it is a money  loser.   So what do we have?   Instead, California keeps coming begging to the Federal Government  for more and more funds. They were able to scoop up about $3 billion  soon after the Obama stimulus act.   Do you remember that one, Mr. Chair, back in 2009, look for the  shovel-ready projects?   So they were able to scoop that up. They took that money because the  other States who initially took that money gave it back because they  weren't going to make high-speed rail work in their States for anywhere  near the right price.                                time  1745    Here we are, at least 3 years after the initial date, and projections  now are somewhere around 2035. They are just now chipping away at the  Central Valley portion that would run from about Merced to Bakersfield  and end in an almond orchard out there somewhere.   They are running out of funding, so they keep coming back to the  Federal Government for more. They got $3 billion of ARRA funding back  then, and they have since passed a carbon tax in California, where they  auction off carbon credit rights in order to prop this up even more.   They are coming to us once again. They are $28 billion short of just  fulfilling the Central Valley portion, not the whole $33 billion that  voters were sold many years ago. It is going to end up being about $128  billion at current projections.   Mr. Chair, we have to stop throwing money down this rathole.  Initially, they tried to tell us it would be a million jobs, back when  I was in the State legislature. They finally admitted after 3 years  that they meant a million job-years. I guess that means 5,000 workers  working for 20 years or something like that, or 200 years. Some crazy  number would mean a million job-years.   By the time you would actually take this rail, which is going to be  electrified from San Francisco to San Jose, you would have to switch  trains. You may well have to switch trains around here somewhere, too.  You could take Southwest from San Francisco to L.A., be on the beach,  and already have a sunburn before you could actually get off the high- speed rail where you are going. Plus, this is without being subsidized  by the taxpayers for the ultraexpensive tickets these are going to be  because of the massive overrun in costs.   Mr. Chair, I appreciate my colleague, Chairman Cole, for including  this language in the bill that would block $3 billion of new spending  on this from Federal taxpayers.    Mr. Chair, instead, why don't we invest infrastructure  money to build the water storage that would grow these crops that all  Americans would utilize and enjoy, which they already do since 90  percent are grown in California?   Let's invest in good things instead of this dumb high-speed rail  project, which is a rathole, a boondoggle, that will not pay off.    Mr. Speaker, in only 3 years, President Biden's failed  foreign policies have caused chaos around the globe.   In the Middle East, Biden failed to enforce congressionally enacted  sanctions while opening up new lines of cash for Iran to fund terror.  Now, Israel is under attack from Iran-backed terrorist proxies.   In Europe, Biden lifted sanctions on Putin's Nord Stream 2 pipeline,  a move that he was warned was a calamitous foreign policy disaster,  while simultaneously undermining American energy production, weakening  our influence, and empowering malign producers of energy like Russia.   In Afghanistan, Biden's chaotic troop withdrawal left Americans dead,  the Afghan Government to collapse, and stranded tens of thousands of  Afghan allies.   In Asia, Biden continues to ignore a growing number of aggressive  provocations from the Chinese Communist Party. He gave the CCP a pass  on their COVID obstruction, let their spy balloon gather intelligence  from sensitive military sites, promoted the use of the CCP's spyware  app called TikTok, and was standing idly by as China reportedly set up  a spy base in Cuba.   In North America, cartels are exploiting Biden's open borders agenda  to poison tens of thousands of Americans with deadly fentanyl, while  experts warn of the ever-growing terror threat as 1.6 million got-aways  have escaped into the country on Biden's watch.   Mr. Speaker, his foreign policy agenda has been a failure on every  front, and the entire world is less safe from it.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 9 o'clock and 8 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Tuesday, November 7, 2023, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
