 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Democratic leader asks of the House managers:         John R. Bolton's forthcoming book states that the President       wanted to continue withholding $391 million in military aid       to Ukraine until Ukraine announced investigations into his       top political rival and the debunked conspiracy theory about       the 2016 election. Is there any way for the Senate to render       a fully informed verdict in this case without hearing the       testimony of Bolton, Mulvaney, and the other key eyewitnesses       or without seeing the relevant documentary evidence?    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   The short answer to that question is no. There is no way to have a  fair trial without witnesses. And when you have a witness who is as  plainly relevant as John Bolton, who goes to the heart of the most  serious and egregious of the President's misconduct, who has  volunteered to come and testify, to turn him away, to look the other  way, I think, is deeply at odds with being an impartial juror.   I would also add, in response to the last question, that if any part  of the President's motivation was a corrupt motive, if it was a causal  factor in the action to freeze the aid or withhold the meeting, that is  enough to convict. It would be enough to convict under criminal law.   But here there is no question about the President's motivation. And  if you have any question about the President's motivation, it makes it  all the more essential to call the man who spoke directly with the  President, whom the President confided in and said he was holding up  this aid because he wanted Ukraine to conduct these political  investigations that would help him in the next election--if you have  any question about whether it was a factor, the factor, a quarter of  the factor, all of the factor, there is a witness a subpoena away who  could answer that question.   But the overwhelming body of the evidence makes it very clear, on  July 26, the day after that phone call, Donald Trump speaks to Gordon  Sondland. That is that conversation at a Ukraine restaurant. What does  Gordon Sondland--what is the President's question of Gordon Sondland  the day after that call? Is he going to do the investigations?   Counsel for the President would have you believe the President was  concerned about the burden-sharing. Well, he may have had a generic  concern about the burden-sharing in other contexts, but here the  motivation was abundantly clear. On that phone with Gordon Sondland,  the only question he wanted an answer to was, Is he going to do the  investigation?   Now, bear in mind he is talking to the Ambassador to the European  Union. What better person to talk to if his real concern was about  burden-sharing than the guy responsible for Europe's burden-sharing?  But did the President raise this at all? Of course not. Of course not.  And if you have any question about it at all, you need to hear from his  former National Security Advisor. Don't wait for the book. Don't wait  until March 17, when it is in black and white, to find out the answer  to your question: Was it all the motive, some of the motive, or none of  the motive?   We think, as I mentioned, the case is overwhelmingly clear without  John Bolton, but if you have any question about it, you can erase all  doubt.   Let me show a video to underscore--No. 2, slide 2--how important this  is.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. As House managers, really their goal       should be to give you all of the facts because they are       asking you to do something very, very consequential . . . and       ask yourself, ask yourself, given the facts you heard today       that they didn't tell you, who doesn't want to talk about the       facts? Who doesn't want to talk about the facts?        Impeachment shouldn't be a shell game. They should give you       the facts.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. One last video, which is even more important and  on point for Mr. Bolton--No. 3.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Mr. Counsel PURPURA. And once again, not a single witness       in the House record that they compiled and developed under       their procedures that we discussed and will continue to       discuss provided any firsthand evidence that the President       ever linked the Presidential meeting to any of the       investigations.        Anyone who spoke with the President said that the President       made it clear that there was no linkage between security       assistance and investigations.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. We know that is not correct, right? Because, of  course, Mick Mulvaney said that the money was linked to these  investigations. He said, in acknowledging a quid pro quo, that they do  it all the time, and we should just get over it. Gordon Sondland also  said the President said, on the one hand, no quid pro quo but also made  it clear that Zelensky had to go to the mic and announce these  investigations.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The gentleman's time has expired.   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   The Senator is recognized.    Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator Schumer's question is for the House  managers:         Would you please respond to the answer that was just given       by the President's counsel?    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. I would be delighted. There are two arguments  that Professor Dershowitz makes: one that is, I have to say, a very odd  argument for a criminal defense lawyer to make, and that is, it is  highly unusual to have a discussion in trial about the defendant's  state of mind, intent, or mens rea.   In every courtroom in America, in every criminal case--or almost  every criminal case, except for a very small sliver where there is  strict liability--the question of the defendant's intent and state of  mind is always an issue. This is nothing novel here. You don't require  a mind reader. In every criminal case--and I would assume in every  impeachment case--yes, you have to show that the President was  operating from a corrupt motive, and we have.   But he also makes an argument that all quid pro quos are the same and  all are perfectly copacetic. Now, some of you said earlier: Well, if  they could prove a quid pro quo over the military, now that would be  something. Well, we have. So now the argument shifts to all quid pro  quos are just fine, and they are all the same.   Well, I am going to apply Professor Dershowitz's own test. He talked  about the step test, John Rawls, the philosopher--let's put the shoe on  the other foot and see how that changes our perception of the case. I  want to merge that argument with one of the other Presidential  counsel's argument when they resorted to the whataboutism about Barack  Obama's open mic.   Now, that was a very poor analogy, I think you will agree, but let's  use that analogy and let's make it more comparable to today and see how  you feel about this scenario.   President Obama, on an open mic, said to Medvedev: Hey, Medvedev, I  know you don't want me to send this military money to Ukraine because  they are fighting and killing your people. I want you to do me a favor,  though. I want you to do an investigation of Mitt Romney, and I want  you to announce you found dirt on Mitt Romney, and if you are willing  to do that, quid pro quo, I will not give Ukraine the money they need  to fight you on the frontline.   Do any of us have any question that Barack Obama would be impeached  for that kind of misconduct? Are we really ready to say that would be  OK, that Barack Obama asked Medvedev to investigate his opponent and  would withhold money from an ally that needed to defend itself to get  an investigation of Mitt Romney?   That is the parallel here. And to say, well, yes, we condition aid  all the time--for legitimate reasons, yes. For legitimate reasons, you  might say to a Governor of a State: Hey, Governor of the State, you  should chip in more toward your own disaster relief. But if the  President's real motive in depriving the State of disaster relief is  because that Governor will not get his attorney general to investigate  the President's political rival, are we ready to say that the President  can sacrifice the interest of the people of that State or, in the case  of Medvedev, the people of our country because all quid pro quos are  fine? It is carte blanche? Is that really what we are prepared to say  with respect to this President's misconduct or the next?   Because if we are, then the next President of the United States can  ask for an investigation of you. They can ask for help in their next  election from any foreign power, and the argument will be made: No,  Donald Trump was acquitted for doing exactly the same thing; therefore,  it must not be impeachable.   Now, bear in mind that efforts to cheat an election are always going  to be in proximity to an election. And if you say you can't hold a  President accountable in an election year, where they are trying to  cheat in that election, then you are giving them carte blanche.   So all quid pros are not the same. Some are legitimate and some are  corrupt, and you don't need to be a mind reader to figure out which is  which. For one thing, you can ask John Bolton.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.    Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk for  both the counsel for the President and the House managers.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator Schumer's question reads as follows:         The House Managers say the President demands absolute       immunity. The President's counsel disputes this. Can either       of you name a single witness or document to which the       President has given access to the House when requested?    I believe it is time for counsel for the President to go first.   Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, I thank you and Minority  Leader Schumer for the question.   Let me try to be clear and distinguish a couple of things.   The House managers have said there was blanket defiance. That is the  way they characterized it--that we are not going to give you anything  and that that is all we said. It was just a blanket defiance. We are  not going to respond.   What I have tried to explain several times is that that was not the  President's response. There were specifically articulated responses to  different requests based on different legal rationales because there  were different problems with different subpoenas.   One problem is that all of the subpoenas up until October 31 were not  validly authorized. So those subpoenas we said we were not going to  respond to because they were not validly issued. It was not an  assertion of executive privilege. It was not an assertion of absolute  immunity. It wasn't anything else. It was the fact that they were not  validly authorized.   They pointed out that, aha, we subpoenaed--I think they mentioned-- Acting Chief of Staff Mulvaney after October 31. That is true, but we  didn't rely on the fact that the subpoena was not authorized. We  pointed out the doctrine of the absolute immunity of senior advisers to  the President. This is not some blanket absolute immunity for the  entire executive branch. It doesn't apply to all of the subpoenas they  issued. As we explained in our brief, it applies to three. There were  three people they subpoenaed as witnesses that, on this basis alone,  the President declined to make available--Acting Chief of Staff  Mulvaney, Legal Advisor to the National Security Council John  Eisenberg, and Deputy National Security Adviser Kupperman, I believe,  but it is in our brief. It was those three who had immunity--a doctrine  asserted by every President since Nixon.   Then there was a different problem with some of the subpoenas. As to  some of the other witnesses who were not senior advisers to the  President, the President did not assert that they had absolute  immunity. Instead, those subpoenas refused to allow those executive  branch personnel to have executive branch counsel accompany them. There  is an OLC opinion that has been published--it is online and cited in  our trial memorandum--stating it is unconstitutional to refuse to allow  executive branch personnel to have the assistance of executive branch  counsel to protect privileged information during questioning, and,  therefore, it is not valid to force them to appear without that  counsel.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Counsel.   Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Mr. Chief Justice and Senators, you know, we  have received nothing as part of our impeachment inquiry.   It is worth pointing out that the House committees that subpoenaed  before the House vote had standing authority under the House rules, and  they were the Oversight Committee, which has the standard authority to  investigate any matter at any time, as does the Foreign Affairs  Committee. It has the authority, under the rules of the House, adopted  January 11, to issue subpoenas. They did, and they were defied.   The idea of absolute immunity has never been upheld by any court, and  it is really incomprehensible to think that somehow this concept of  absolute immunity has lurked in hiding, for centuries, for Presidents  to use it in this day. When you think of the two cases--the Miers case  and the McGahn case--the courts completely rejected the idea of  absolute immunity.   On the slide, there was a decision recently made in the McGahn case,  and here is what it reads: ``Stated simply, the primary takeaway from  the past 250 years of recorded American history is that Presidents are  not Kings . . . '' Those are the judge's words, not mine.  ``[C]ompulsory appearance by dint of a subpoena is a legal construct,  not a political one, and per the Constitution, no one is above the  law.''   The President is not permitted by the Constitution or by the law to  assert any kind of absolute immunity. That does not exist in America,  and as the judges pointed out, that would be something that a King  would assert. I am not saying that, but I will say this. It is  something our Founders set up our checks and balances to prevent.  Nobody has absolute power in our system of government--not the Senate  and House, not the President, not the judiciary. This is unprecedented  and just wrong as a matter of law and as a matter of the Constitution.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The Senator from Georgia.    Whatever you want.   Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Whatever I want. That is what you said, Mr.  Schumer.   Whatever I want? Here's what I want. I want Adam Schiff. I want  Hunter Biden. I want Joe Biden. I want the whistleblower. I want to  also understand there may be additional people within the House  Intelligence Committee that have had conversations with that  whistleblower--that I get anybody we want. By the way, if we get  anybody we want, we will be here for a very long time.   The fact of the matter is, we are not here to argue witnesses  tonight, which, obviously, is an undercurrent. But to say that this is  not going to extend this proceeding--months, because understand  something else: Despite the, you know, executive privilege and other  nonsense, I suspect Manager Schiff--smart guy--he is going to say: Wait  a minute, I have some speech and debate privileges that may be  applicable to this.   I am not saying that they are. But they may raise it. It would be  legitimate to raise it. So this is a process that we would be--this  would be the first of many weeks.   I think we have to be clear. They put this forward in an aggressive  and fast-paced way, and now they are saying ``Now we need witnesses''-- after 31 or 32 times you said you proved every aspect of your case.  That is what you said.   He just said he did. Well, then, I don't think we need any witnesses.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from New Jersey.    I have a question for the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator Schumer's question is for the House  managers:         Would you please respond to the answer that was just given       by the President's counsel?    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. I think we can all see what is going on here, and  that is, if the House wants to call witnesses, if you want to hear from  a single witness, if you want to hear what John Bolton has to say, we  are going to make this endless. We, the President's lawyers, are going  to make this endless. We promise you, we are going to want Adam Schiff  to testify. We want Joe Biden to testify. Hunter Biden. We are going to  want the whistleblower. We are going to want everyone in the world. If  you dare, if you have the unmitigated temerity to want witnesses in a  trial, we will make you pay for it with endless delay. The Senate will  never be able to go back to its business.   That is their argument.   How dare the House assume there will be witnesses in a trial.  Shouldn't the House have known when they undertook its investigation  that the Senate was never going to allow witnesses; that this would be  the first impeachment trial in the history of the Republic with no  witnesses?   So Mr. Sekulow wants me to testify. I would like Mr. Sekulow to  testify about his contact with Mr. Parnas or Mr. Cipollone about the  efforts to implement the President's fight on all subpoenas. I would  like to ask questions about--well, I would like to ask questions of the  President and put him under oath. But we are not here to indulge in  fantasy or distraction; we are here to talk about people with pertinent  and probative evidence.   And you know something? I trust the man behind me, sitting way up,  whom I can't see right now, but I trust him to  [[Page S677]]  make decisions about whether a witnesses is material or not, whether it  is appropriate to out a whistleblower or not, whether to--whether a  particular passage in a document is privileged or not. It is not going  to take months of litigation, although that is what the President's  counsel is threatening.   They are doing the same thing to the Senate they did to the House,  which is, you try to investigate the President, you try to try the  President, we will tie you and your entire Chamber up in knots for  weeks and months. And you know something? They will if you let them.   You don't have to let them. You can subpoena John Bolton. You can  allow the Chief Justice to make a determination in camera whether  something is relevant, whether it deals with Ukraine or Venezuela,  whether it is privileged or it isn't, whether the privilege is being  misapplied to hide criminality or wrongdoing. We don't have to go up  and down the courts; we have a perfectly good Chief Justice sitting  right behind me who can make these decisions in real time.   So don't be thrown off by this claim: Oh, if you even think about it,  we are going to make you pay with delays like you have never seen. We  are going to call witnesses that will turn this into a circus.   It shouldn't be a circus. It should be a fair trial. You can't have a  fair trial without witnesses.   I think when I was asked that question before, I answered in the  affirmative--in the negative. You can't have a fair trial without  witnesses, and you shouldn't presume that when a House impeaches, the  Senate trials from now on will be witness-free, will be evidence-free.  That is not what the Founders intended. If it was, they would have made  you the court of appeals. But they didn't. They made you the triers of  fact. They expected you to hear from witnesses. They expected you to  evaluate their credibility.   Don't take my word for it about John Bolton. Look, I am no fan of  John Bolton's--although I like him a little more than I used to--but  you should hear from him. You should want to. Don't take General  Kelly's view for it. Make up your own mind whether you are to believe  him or Mick Mulvaney. Will you believe John Bolton or the President?  Make up your own mind.   Yes, we proved our case, counsel. We proved it overwhelmingly. But  you chose to contest the fact that the President withheld military aid  to coerce an ally. You chose to contest it. You chose to make John  Bolton's testimony relevant, pertinent. If you had stipulated the  President did as he is charged, then you might make the argument that  you are making here, but you haven't. You contested it. And now you  want to say: But the Senate shall not hear from this witness. That is  not a fair trial. It is not even the appearance of fairness. You can't  have a fair trial without basic fairness.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The Senator from Louisiana.
