 Mr. Speaker, all of us in the Western Hemisphere are in  horror. Venezuela is a failed state and potentially on the brink of  civil war. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week that  thousands of Cuban intelligence agents are helping the Maduro regime  maintain control over the army, while Maduro orders his soldiers to  shoot his own people who are demonstrating in the streets.   We cannot let countries like China, Russia, Iran, and Cuba continue  to play a role in propping up the Maduro regime. While I commend  Treasury Secretary Mnuchin for issuing sanctions against individuals of  the Venezuelan Supreme Court, I call on the administration to ratchet  up the pressure on these outside forces and have them answer for their  role in the emergency situation in Venezuela.   While we face many challenges across the globe, America must reengage  in the Western Hemisphere and not let the neighbors in our backyard  slide back into tyranny.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Sessions for holding this  Special Order. It means, I think, a lot not only to the Scouts that are  here in the House of Representatives and the Senate to recognize the  importance of Scouting to our country, but to all the mothers, fathers,  and Scouts that are seeing this proceeding on C-SPAN or will hear about  it to realize that they are participating in something that is very  special.   I mean, I think of Scouting, really, Mr. Speaker, as a gift to the  country for all of the reasons that the previous speakers have noted. I  can't think about Scouting without thinking about what it has meant to  me, Chairman Sessions, and influencing on my young life. Role models is  the first thing that comes to mind with Scouting.   I think about my dad--who was not an Eagle Scout. He was a Sea  Scout--and he ended up being basically a Life Scout for life, as people  say in Scouting. But nobody was more influential to me in my youth than  my dad--currently 91 years old--a Scout still at heart, and all the  experiences we had together, how we bonded as father and son, and how,  when I went off to college, Mr. Speaker, he continued to be a role  model and adult leader for young men for years to come.   That is the kind of person that is in every one of our communities  all over this country, helping mold our young people through the  Scouting program.   Mr. Speaker, Scouting was my first paid job. I worked at a Scout  camp. I earned, I believe, something like $10 a week, plus room and  board, of course. It is when I first learned who FICA was because, at  $10 a week, I wanted to know who took this $2 out of my $10 check. So I  learned my first lesson about Federal economic policy and who FICA was  as a Boy Scout working at the end of a very dusty parking lot for 7  weeks in the hot summer of Arkansas, teaching, pioneering, cooking, and  camping merit badges.   But I think of other adults besides my dad. I think about Angelo  Coppola and Fred Bean, both constituents of mine now that I serve in  the people's House who were camp directors at that camp where I was a  very happy employee and Scout for those summers in the early 1970s.   So Scouting is about role models. Scouting is about character  building, and that starts that relationship, I think, between our moms  and our dads that are involved in the Scouting program, and what we  give to kids today. And, boy, do we need that character development.   The Boy Scouts of America was formed in 1910 and was inspired by  British war hero Robert S.S. Baden-Powell of the Scouting program  started back in the U.K. A lot of people today who are involved in  Scouting, even at this moment, Mr. Speaker, don't know that the U.S.  Congress presented a law to Woodrow Wilson, who signed it in 1916,  chartering the Boy Scouts of America.   We are chartered by the United States Congress, and what a special  feeling it is for all of us who are Scouts in Congress today to  recognize that something that was so important to our youth was, in  fact, chartered by the body that we serve in today.   In the early 20th century, Baden-Powell was thinking about how to  expand army youth training with a place for all boys to dedicate their  efforts to peace, not war, and he wanted Scouting to improve boys'  lives by building their character, physical fitness, and outdoor  skills.   He put a premium on bringing boys together from all walks of life,  mixing boys from the elite prep schools and boarding schools with those  in working class homes. And we do that today, Mr. Speaker. We bring  boys from all backgrounds into the character-building exercises of  Scouting.   Mr. Collins, a few minutes ago, talked about the importance of  outdoor recreation, and that was certainly what brought me in. My  interest in Scouting was outdoor recreation. When you think about it,  in 1910, people were moving off the farm. People were urbanizing. We  were passing laws on child labor. We were trying to make sure our boys  coming off the farm away from home would have a good set of role  models. So Scouting was so important to that urban youth that they get  character and that outdoor experience.   And while that was a big deal back in 1910, I would argue, as Chris  Collins did today, that it is a big deal now. He talked about a nature  deficit. There is no doubt that we have that today, just as we did in  some people's views back in 1910.   In 2005, Leonard Sax wrote a seminal book that I urge not only all of  our Members to read, but people watching these proceedings to read,  ``Boys Adrift,'' where he argued that the lack of experiential learning  and free playtime--particularly outdoors--in our childhood is  diminishing our effectiveness in learning as managers and our  interpersonal relationships.   In 2008, Richard Louv wrote a book called ``Last Child in the  Woods,'' where he argued that unstructured outdoor playtime is critical  to childhood development.   Well, that is exactly what Scouting does. It provides outdoor  recreation, something I think is essential to childhood development;  something that we have lost because of not only urbanization, but our  changing behavior.   One recent nature conservancy poll found that only 10 percent of  American teens spend time outside every day. I can't imagine on a day  where the sun was shinning when I was a teenager that I ever spent any  time indoors. My parents were always on the hunt: Where is he? He is  outside somewhere.   According to research by the Harvard School of Public Health,  American adults spend less time outdoors than they do inside vehicles;  less than 5 percent of their day.   So I think the scientific research says our boys and our girls need  outdoor recreation. They need experiential learning. This is what is  the core of the Scouting program. Like air and water, our wild places,  our National Parks are essential to the education of our children and  have greatly benefited the Boy Scouts and the Scouting experience. I  can't imagine what my life would be like without that Scouting  experience in terms of my love of the outdoors.   The second thing that attracted me to Scouting was the leadership  opportunities. Baden-Powell said he wanted to be boy-driven. And here,  101 years after President Wilson signed the Boy Scouts of America into  law, Scouting prides itself, Mr. Speaker, on being boy-driven, kid- driven. That is how we teach responsibility, character, and leadership.   I like this famous list, Mr. Sessions, that we use at so many Eagle  Scout ceremonies called ``100 Scouts.''   Mr. Speaker, of 100 Scouts, people who participate in Scouting:   Thirty will drop out their first year, but they will remember the  program fondly.   Twelve will be from a family that has no religious organization or  religious membership, and many will begin their first contact with the  need to be morally straight and have, at their heart, a belief in God;  12 will be touched by the Scouting program.   Five will go on to earn their religious award from whatever faith  tradition they have.   One will use their Scouting skills to save a life.   One will credit Scouting skills for saving their own life.   Eighteen will develop a lifelong hobby.   Eight will find their vocation through the exploration of the merit  badge work they did as a Scout.   Seventeen will later become Scout leaders, like all of our Members  here on this floor tonight.  [[Page H4493]]    Four will become an Eagle Scout.   Four out of that 100, Mr. Speaker, will earn the rank of Eagle Scout,  and at least one will say they value earning that Eagle award more than  their college degree.   When it comes to the role that Scouting plays, it is something that I  am so proud of because I have a Scout in Troop 30 in St. Paul's  Methodist Church in Little Rock, and I am so proud of the work that he  has done on that trail toward Eagle. He is in the middle of planning  his project now to combine his love of golf and Scouting. It is a  service project at The First Tee of Central Arkansas in Little Rock,  and I reflect it on the value of these Eagle projects across our  communities in all 50 of our States and around the world.   Just in America, using 2014 data, about 150--140 people earn their  Eagle rank a day in the United States. And in 2014, they spent 8.1  million hours, Mr. Speaker, on their Eagle Scout project, benefiting  our towns, our communities, all over this country.   In the nonprofit world, if you applied a typical pay rate to that, a  project rate that the independent sector uses of about $23 an hour,  that is $188 million in public service value our Eagle Scouts have  contributed across this country.   Mr. Speaker, I want to tell Mr. Sessions how much I appreciate his  taking time to highlight Scouting, and the value of Scouting to our  town and our communities, but, more importantly, to our families at  creating that sense of character that we have talked about tonight.   I am one of those people that values my Eagle Scout award, dating  back to 1972, from Troop 27, at Our Lady of the Holy Souls Catholic  Church in Little Rock. And I am so proud that this many years later I  still have the ability to support my son who is on that Eagle trail,  and have the support of my dad that many long years after 1972 and my  Eagle award because, in our family, we believe in a good turn daily. We  believe in the Scout law. We believe in the Scout oath. And if there is  one thing you need to do to survive in Congress, you have got to be  prepared.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Mr. Sessions for the opportunity to share  these comments in support of Scouting. I thank the gentleman for his  service to the National Eagle Scout Association and his long service to  Circle Ten Council in Dallas, Texas.
