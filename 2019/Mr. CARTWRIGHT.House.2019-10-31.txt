 Madam Speaker, Congress exists to serve the American  people by passing legislation that will protect their rights and  promote their welfare.   Since January of this year, House Democrats have been vigorously  legislating for the people and have passed more than 200 bills--200  bills--bills to secure a living wage for American workers, bills to  protect pensions and fight discrimination in the workplace, bills to  expand access to healthcare and lower the cost of prescription drugs.  We have passed bills to safeguard our elections, the bedrock of our  democracy, from both foreign and domestic interference.   In contrast, the Republican-controlled Senate has offered little but  obstruction and inaction. Their leader proudly calls himself the ``grim  reaper'' for laying waste to our 200 bills.   So, I rise today to implore Senate lawmakers: Do your job. Take up  these House-passed measures and start serving the American people.                            ____________________
