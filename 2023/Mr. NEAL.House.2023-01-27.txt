 Mr. Chair, due to unforseen circumstances, I was unable to  be present today to vote on Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez's Amendment No.  72 on H.R. 21, Strategic Production Response Act. Had I been present, I  would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 68, H.R. 21, Strategic  Production Response Act.                Amendment No. 73 Offered by Ms. Ocasio-Cortez
