 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, we are now 4 weeks into the fiscal year.  The Federal Government--the most powerful nation on Earth--is running  on autopilot, and we only have 4 weeks until the government shuts down  unless Congress takes action.   And it is not a theoretical exercise. The actions we take, or don't  take, in this Chamber with respect to the fiscal year 2022  appropriations bills affect people's lives and also the direction of  this Nation.   These bills provide for our national defense, help educate our  Nation's children, provide medical care for our veterans, ensure that  we have clean air and water, invest in science, and provide a social  safety net for our Nation's most vulnerable populations.   Now, we can, and we should, do our job and finish these bills in the  coming weeks, and we should be ready to go. I mean, 2 weeks ago, I made  public nine Senate appropriations bills. When you combine this with the  three bills the Senate Appropriations Committee marked up way back in  August, all 12 bills have been released. The House has marked up all of  their bills, and all but three of them have already passed the House.   But in order to finish our work, we need to have an agreed-upon top  line that has been worked out in a bipartisan and bicameral basis-- something that has been done so many times in the past. We can't  finalize bills until we know how much we are able to spend. And I have  been calling for these negotiations for months. But we need all the  party to come to the table. It takes both Republicans and Democrats to  strike a deal.   Now, Democrats have already made a fair offer. My Republican  colleagues made clear to us that they believed the President's proposal  for a 1.7-percent increase for defense programs was inadequate. I  thought it struck the right balance, as did many of my colleagues.   But this institution is built on compromise. So in the Senate posted  bill, I included a 5-percent increase for defense instead of the 1.7  percent the administration had proposed. The 5-percent increase is  based on the funding level included in the National Defense  Authorization Act, NDAA.   Now, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted on that. Do you know  what the vote was?--25 to 1, in favor of that 5-percent increase. Every  single Senate Republican on the Committee supported this level of  funding. The House bill contains the same 5-percent increase, and it  passed the House Chamber, 316 to 113.   In order to increase the defense number and stay within the top line  established in the FY 2022 budget resolution, I reduced the amount for  nondefense programs from President Biden's proposed 16-percent  increase, which I would have preferred--but I reduced it to a 13- percent increase. That is how negotiations work. Each side has to give  something.   Now, having offered the Republican-endorsed spending level for  defense, have they taken yes for an answer?   No.   Have they taken time for a counteroffer?  [[Page S7764]]    No.   Instead, they seem intent on driving us toward a full-year continuing  resolution.   If I had been here a long time and was a cynical person, which I am  not, I would be worried that delay was a political calculation to tie  the hands of the Biden administration and thwart his agenda--governing  under a long-term continuing resolution is difficult, and they know it.  But this Vermonter tries not to be cynical.   But I would remind, from a practical point of view, the stakes are  too high to play politics with the practical budget. This is not  something we should play politics with because the consequences for the  American people are too great. The impacts of a full-year CR are too  onerous for the country to bear. That is unquestionably true for those  who claim to care about defense programs and national security. And you  would think that fact all by itself would bring all parties to the  negotiating table.   A full-year CR would not only reduce the defense spending by $37  billion compared to the Senate bill I posted, it would actually cut  defense spending below last year's levels. Since a CR freezes programs  at last year's level, certain programs would be overfunded and others  would be underfunded. The Department of Defense would be unable to  shift enough money around within their transfer authority to correct  the imbalances, resulting in billions of unspent dollars and even more  unmet priorities. And you can only imagine the waste and confusion that  would occur.   With money tied up in outdated priorities, the United States will  struggle to meet the challenges and threats of today. While the U.S. is  no longer in Afghanistan, a CR would revive the Overseas Contingency  Operations, OCO, to the tune of $69 billion at DOD. And that is the  account, of course, meant to fund wartime activities. It would also  provide--just think of this for a moment--$3.3 billion to train and arm  the now-defunct Afghan security forces. In other words, a continuing  resolution would have $3.3 billion to train and arm a no longer  existing Afghan security force.   Now, while we are paying for a war we are not actually fighting, DOD  may be forced to reduce the end-strength of our military just so they  can pay our troops and civilian personnel the 2.7-percent pay raise  they so rightly deserve, that is set to go into effect on January 1,  2022. In other words, the Pentagon may have to lay off soldiers to find  the money for a pay raise under a continuing resolution, while money is  tied up on a war we are not even fighting. That makes no sense. That  makes no sense.   Just think of this: We lay off soldiers so we can pay for a pay  raise, because we have our money tied up in a war that we are not  fighting. I mean, Kafka couldn't think of something this crazy.   Now, most Members in this Chamber would agree that China is one of  our biggest threats. Reflecting that reality, the President proposed  over $66 billion in military investments to counter the growing  influence of China. None of the new capabilities included in the  defense appropriations bill would be funded under a continuing  resolution.   So we can say, boy, we are going to gear up with China; however, the  Senate can't get around to vote on it.   Now, many Senators have come to the floor in recent weeks to ask that  we provide an additional $1 billion for Iron Dome. I wonder if they are  aware that if we have a CR, Iron Dome doesn't get a billion dollars; it  gets $73 million.   Given these facts--and these are only a few of many examples--I am  mystified why there doesn't seem to be any urgency on the other side to  solve these problems. Republican Members have been quick to criticize  Democratic leadership for not bringing the NDAA to the Senate floor for  consideration more quickly, but that is an authorizing bill. And when  it comes to actually funding the Defense--not just authorizing, but  actually putting the money there--they won't even come to the table.  Yet, on the very same day, I was told that the Republican leadership  wants to have a full-year continuing resolution that would cut defense  funding.   They are out here saying, Why aren't you passing an increase in the  Defense spending--but, oh, by the way, we want a bill that would cut  the Defense funding?   So I would ask them, which is it? Is one aim for the TV soundbites?  But if rhetoric doesn't match the reality, start being honest with the  American people.   If we fail to get a deal on full-year appropriations bills, our  veterans also lose out. Due to increased demands for community care,  under a continuing resolution, the VA will not have sufficient funds to  cover medical care for veterans. These are men and women who served our  country. Think of all the praise we have had, all the greetings as the  great men and women come back from wars, many suffering all kinds of  injuries. ``We will never forget our veterans.'' Oh, yes, we will  because we won't stand up and pass the money they need. Veterans  deserve better than this.   Our domestic priorities will also suffer under a continuing  resolution. The fiscal year 2022 Senate bills include historic  increases to care for and educate our Nation's children, combat climate  change, build and renovate affordable housing, improve our  infrastructure, and continue to combat the pandemic, which is still  with us. None of these increases--none of them--will occur under a  full-year CR. We will be forced to operate at last year's levels in a  country that now has been transformed by a global pandemic. How  irresponsible is that?   For example, in our bill, we provide critical funding increases for  mental health and substance abuse. These funds are desperately needed  in every State in this country as rates of anxiety and depression have  soared during the COVID-19 pandemic. Drug overdose deaths are expected  to reach their highest levels to date. But in a continuing resolution,  we say: Tough. You are on your own. We don't have the money.   Under a continuing resolution, funding at the National Institutes of  Health will stagnate, leaving us behind in critical advancements in  medical research at a time I think we need it more than anytime in my  life.   The fiscal year 2022 Senate bills include critical investments to  combat climate change. That would disappear under a CR. A CR says we  will have complacency, not bold action.   The next few days and weeks are critical. I hope the American people  realize what is at stake. I ask our colleagues on the other side of the  aisle to join us in negotiating a path forward.   It is not an exaggeration to say that the choice we face with these  appropriations bills goes to the very heart of why we are here. We can  either come together the way we used to, the way democracy is supposed  to, and make our government work for the American people or we can  become the branch of government where, instead of governing, the  minority party defines its role as preventing the Congress from doing  its job so it can then falsely blame the majority party.   There have been around 2,000 Senators who have had the privilege of  serving this country since it began. I served with over 400 of them-- more than 20 percent of all the Senators in the Nation's history. I  remember Republicans and Democrats could work together, not for their  party's interest but for the country's interest.   There are only 100 of us. We should be the conscience of the Nation.  We should be working together to protect the Nation. But I fear that we  have political gamesmanship, and it is not just about these bills but  the relevance of Congress itself today and for the future, whichever  party is in the minority. If that becomes the norm, it is going to be  impossible to turn the clock back.   We need a top-line deal. Republicans need to come to the table and  make a comprehensive offer. Those of us on this side of the aisle are  ready to work on behalf of the American people. I ask our Republican  colleagues to join us in working for the American people.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I thank the distinguished chair of the  Senate Armed Services Committee for his comments.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I am pleased that yesterday, the Senate  confirmed Adrienne Wojciechowski to be the Assistant Secretary for  Congressional Relations at the U.S. Department of Agriculture--USDA--a  role for which is eminently qualified. For more than a decade, Adrienne  has been an indispensable staff member in the Senate, dedicated to  supporting farmers, growing our rural economies, and tackling climate  change and land stewardship challenges. Adrienne has earned deep  respect from on both sides of the aisle.   Adrienne first joined my staff in 2007 and quickly became a key  member of my legislative team on topics ranging from agriculture to  water quality to climate change. Adrienne was immediately involved in  2008 farm bill negotiations and played an integral staff role in  negotiating substantial portions of the 2014 and 2018 farm bills.   Over the years, I could always count on Adrienne's persistence,  attention to detail, and sound judgement. Adrienne brought these same  gifts to her work with USDA partners in Vermont, carefully building  trusting relationships that enabled my legislative work to be informed  by on-the-ground, State-level delivery of USDA programs.   Most recently, Adrienne has served as a professional staff member on  the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, managing Senators'  diverse spending priorities in the annual appropriations cycle and  negotiating bipartisan final bills.   I have served on the Senate Agriculture Committee since I first came  to the Senate. There is an old saying that Vermont without farms would  still be a nice place, but it wouldn't be Vermont. While she is not a  native Vermonter herself, it has been a pleasure to see Adrienne form  such deep relationships with Vermont's agrarian traditions, our  farmers, and our landscape. Whether it was navigating USDA bureaucracy  or rebuilding a barn after a fire, farmers and the agriculture  community in Vermont knew that a call to my office would get Adrienne  on the case.   Although Senate staff work behind the scenes and their contributions  can go unheralded, the impact of Adrienne's dedication, her  contributions to conservation policy, farm viability, and farmland  protection programs can truly be seen on the landscape of Vermont and  across the country. On behalf of all Vermonters, I thank Adrienne  Wojciechowski for her service to the U.S. Senate and wish her the best  of luck as she joins the Biden administration.                            ____________________
