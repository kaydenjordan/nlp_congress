 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to fight for our Nation's  servicemembers and push back against the extreme MAGA agenda wish list  that will yank the rug out from under American families, small  businesses, and our enlisted military members.   Pay for our soldiers, benefits for our veterans, military readiness,  and more are in serious jeopardy. We risk America's health and safety,  and we risk hurting America's middle class all because the MAGA wing  continues to control the GOP.   This manufactured crisis jeopardizes national security and will ruin  our economy. My colleagues across the aisle, who clearly aren't here  right now, must choose. Will they crash the economy on purpose? Will  they destroy jobs and American livelihoods, or will they stand up for  our troops, veterans, families, and seniors? There is a word for people  who take hostages, ``terrorists.''                            ____________________
