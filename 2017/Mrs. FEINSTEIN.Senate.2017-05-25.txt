The online Record has been corrected to read:   Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Drone Federalism Act  of 2017.    ========================= END NOTE =========================     In recent years, small unmanned aircraft have emerged as a  transformative new technology. These devices--more commonly known as  drones--are highly capable, commercially available, and operable even  by novice consumers.   The way that drones are flown in the daily life of our communities  and in such great numbers has raised new challenges for safety,  privacy, and security that demand cooperation between the federal,  state, and local governments.   Today, drone operations present an astounding array of challenges. In  just two years, over 2,500 drone incidents have been reported to the  Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA. The most recent year of data,  from October 2015 to October 2016, saw the number of incidents surge  166% over the prior year. In addition, there have been some  [[Page S3220]]  alarming reports. On February 26th, 2017, a drone crashed through the  27th floor window of a Manhattan apartment building in New York City.  The next month, on March 28th, a drone crashed through the 23rd floor  window of City Hall in Buffalo, New York. Drones have repeatedly  interfered with medical helicopters. On May 1st, 2016, a medevac  helicopter trying to land at Florida Hospital East in Orlando was  forced to abort its initial landing because of a drone. On November 14,  2015, a helicopter leaving children's hospital in St. Louis, Missouri  had to take evasive action to avoid a drone, banking 60 degrees. Drones  also interfere with emergency wild fire fighting. On April 30, 2017,  multiple drones filming the Opera fire in Riverside, California forced  firefighting helicopters to suspend operations. This happened eight  times in 2015, and another eight times in 2016, in California alone.  Drones have also crashed into the Golden Gate Bridge, including twice  last month. On April 1st, a drone flown almost two miles beyond line of  site fell from the sky into a lane of traffic, only a few feet from the  crowded sidewalk. Again on April 9th, another drone flown beyond line  of site crashed one of the bridge's towers.   These incidents are occurring throughout the nation, but each state  has faced its own challenges. Half of all reported incidents came from  just five States: California, Florida, New York, Texas, and New Jersey.   In fact, one-fifth of all drone incidents reported to the FAA  occurred in California. What works for protecting urban areas will be  different than what is needed in rural areas.   The current legal framework for managing the airspace, which evolved  over a century of manned aviation, is a poor fit for these new  challenges. Drones bear little resemblance to the manned aircraft that  came before them.   First, drones intrude into the everyday life of our communities in a  way that airplanes do not. Airplanes fly into and out of airports, and  municipalities can try through zoning to minimize disruptions. Drones,  on the other hand, can take flight from any location, can hover  anonymously overhead, and are often used to film whatever aspect of  public or private life may catch the operator's interest of the  operator's.   Second, drones are seldom engaged in interstate commerce once they  have been purchased. Short communication range and limited battery life  means that commercially available drones are almost always operated  locally, and are unlikely to be operated across state lines.   Third, there are far more drones than there are airplanes. Already,  more than 750,000 drones have been registered, and the FAA anticipates  up to 4 million drones by 2020. By contrast, there are little more than  200,000 manned aircraft registered in the United States.                              WHAT THE BILL DOES    The Drone Federalism Act would address the modern challenges of drone  operations and provide a clear legal framework to regulate drones. The  bill has three provisions.   First, the bill preserves the authority of State, Tribal, and local  governments to issue reasonable restrictions on the time, manner, and  place of drone operations within 200 feet of the ground or a structure.  These could include speed limits, local no-fly zones, temporary  restrictions, and prohibitions on reckless or drunk operators, for  example.   There are regulations that the FAA must issue uniformly throughout  the country to ensure the safety and efficiency of the national  airspace. This bill does not interfere with that authority. However,  the bill does require the FAA to consider legitimate state and local  interests when exercising preemption, and to respect any reasonable  additional low-altitude restrictions that state and local governments  choose to impose.   Second, the bill reaffirms that the federal government will respect  private property rights to the airspace in the immediate reaches above  a property, including at least the first 200 feet. Neither Congress nor  the FAA may authorize drone operations immediately over property  without the owner's permission.   Third, the bill promotes cooperation between the levels of government  by directing the FAA to partner with a diverse group of cities and  States to test out different approaches and report on best practices.                 STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS REGULATE DRONES    The Drone Federalism Act is consistent with the recent action taken  by States to regulate drone operations. In response to drone incidents  and the concerns of their communities, lawmakers throughout the country  have identified the need for a variety of new approaches to managing  drones. Indeed, at least 38 States are considering drone legislation  this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.   These proposals include: definitions of harassment and voyeurism,  airport protections, penalties for interfering with emergency  responders, protections against the delivery of contraband at prisons,  bans on flights over football games, and definitions of aerial  trespass, among others.   This exercise of the laboratories of democracy is appropriate. Our  communities should not have to rely on an already overburdened federal  agency to craft specific regulatory protections for every local  context, supply on-the-ground enforcement agents, or pursue complicated  civil cases in court for every infraction. Local police should be  empowered to issue citations akin to a traffic violation for clear-cut  infractions, without having to prove an action meets a vague tort law  standards of negligence and harm. There should be no question that a  State has a right to prevent drones from interfering with emergency  responders or delivering contraband into prisons; to criminalize hit- and-runs, voyeurism, stalking, or harassment with a drone; to allow  judges to deny drones to sex offenders.   Neither should there be any question that a State or municipality has  a right to restrict the use of drones where it would be hazardous. Just  as the federal government has banned drone operations over Federal  Parks, States should have the option to protect State parks. Just as  the Federal Government banned flights over sensitive areas, like the  entire Capital region, cities should have the option to protect schools  or other sensitive areas of their own. Just as the Federal Government  can impose temporary flight restrictions over major sporting events or  airshows, a county should have the option to protect its summer  fairgrounds or holiday parade route.                                  CONCLUSION    The Drone Federalism Act that I am introducing today, along with  Senators Lee, Blumenthal, and Cotton, is a proactive, affirmative  solution. It recognizes the federal interest in protecting the safety  and efficiency of the national airspace, while also respecting private  property rights, Tribal sovereignty, the powers reserved to the States  by the Tenth Amendment, and the general principle of local self- determination.   This bill will invite the democratic participation of government at  every level, avoid the need for years of litigation about the scope of  preemption, and enable effective local enforcement. It is incumbent on  Congress to provide clarity and to guarantee all sides an equal voice  moving forward.   This bipartisan bill is the way to do that.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Durbin, Mr.          Tillis, and Mrs. Ernst):   S. 1276. A bill to require the Attorney General to make a  determination as to whether cannabidiol should be a controlled  substance and listed in a schedule under the Controlled Substances Act  and to expand research on the potential medical benefits of cannabidiol  and other marihuana components; to the Committee on the Judiciary.    Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the  Cannabidiol Research Expansion Act with my colleagues, Senators  Grassley, Durbin, Tillis, and Ernst.   Cannabidiol, or CBD, is a nonpsychoactive component of marijuana. In  many instances parents, after exhausting other treatment options, have  turned to CBD to as a last resort to treat their children who have  intractable epilepsy. Anecdotally, CBD has produced positive results.   However, due to existing barriers and the fact that marijuana is a  schedule I drug, rigorous research that is needed to better understand  the long-term  [[Page S3221]]  safety and efficacy of CBD as a medicine, as well as the correct dosing  and potential interaction with other medications, is lacking.   The Cannabidiol Research Expansion Act seeks to both reduce these  barriers and spur additional research to ensure that CBD and other  marijuana-derived medications are based on the most up to date  scientific evidence. It also provides a pathway for the manufacture and  distribution of FDA-approved drugs that are based on this research.   It does this while maintaining safeguards to protect against illegal  diversion.   First, the bill directs the Departments of Justice and Health and  Human Services to complete a scientific and medical evaluation of CBD  within 1 year. Based on this evaluation, the legislation directs the  Department of Justice to make a scheduling recommendation for CBD that  is independent of marijuana. This may include transferring the schedule  of CBD to another schedule, or removing it from the list of controlled  substances altogether. A scheduling recommendation for CBD that is  independent of marijuana has never been done before.   Second, without sacrificing appropriate oversight, it streamlines the  regulatory process for marijuana research. In particular, it improves  regulations dealing with changes to approved quantities of marijuana  needed for research and approved research protocols. It also expedites  the Drug Enforcement Administration registration process for  researching CBD and marijuana.   Third, this legislation seeks to increase medical research on CBD,  while simultaneously reducing the stigma associated with conducting  research on a schedule I drug. It does so by explicitly authorizing  medical and osteopathic schools, research universities, practitioners  and pharmaceutical companies to use a schedule II Drug Enforcement  Administration registration to conduct authorized medical research on  CBD.   Fourth, the bill allows medical schools, research institutions,  practitioners, and pharmaceutical companies to produce the marijuana  they need for authorized medical research. This will ensure that  researchers have access to the material they need to develop proven,  effective medicines. Once the FDA approves these medications, the bill  allows pharmaceutical companies to manufacture and distribute them.   Fifth, the bill allows parents who have children with intractable  epilepsy, as well as adults with intractable epilepsy, to possess and  transport CBD or other nonpsychoactive components of marijuana used to  treat this disease while research is ongoing. To do so, parents and  adults must provide documentation that they or their child have been  treated by a board-certified neurologist for at least 6 months. They  must also have documentation that the neurologist has attested that  other treatment options have been exhausted and that the potential  benefits outweigh the harms of using these nonpsychoactive components  of marijuana. The neurologist must also agree to monitor the patient  for potential adverse reactions.   Finally, because existing Federal research is severely lacking, the  bill directs the Department of Health and Human Services to expand,  intensify, and coordinate research to determine the potential medical  benefits of CBD or other marijuana-derived medications on serious  medical conditions.   The 2016 National Academy of Sciences report, titled ``The Health  Effects of Cannabis and Cannabinoids: The Current State of Evidence and  Recommendations for Research'' underscored the need to reduce research  barriers, increase the supply of CBD and marijuana for research  purposes, and address existing research gaps.   The Cannabidiol Research Expansion Act seeks to do just this.   This bill is critical to helping families across the country as they  seek safe, effective medicines for serious illnesses. I hope my  colleagues will join me in supporting this important legislation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DAINES (for himself and Mr. Tester):   S. 1282.
