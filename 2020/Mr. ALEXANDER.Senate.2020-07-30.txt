 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10  minutes when the afternoon votes are concluded.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask through the Chair, does the  Senator from Ohio wish to speak further?    Mr. President, I thought the Senator from Arizona made  a very commonsense proposal. We are in a position here in the Congress  that we often find ourselves in: We have different opinions-- dramatically different opinions in some cases. What she said was, while  we are working those things out, let's extend the $600 unemployment  benefit for 7 days so people aren't hurt. That is a commonsense  proposal. I regret that wasn't adopted.   I like what the Senator from Ohio said. Instead of starting--when you  have a disagreement over several items, my experience is that you don't  start with the things that you disagree on the most; you start with the  things you agree on the most.   There are a number of things in the House-passed bill and in the  Senate Republican bill that was introduced on Monday, which the  President supports--let me repeat that. The House of Representatives  passed a bill. They have a Democratic majority. The Senate has a  Republican majority, and we have a Republican President. We have a  Republican President and a Republican bill, and we have a House-passed  bill, and it is time to see if we can put the two together. That is why  we have two bodies. But that requires Senators and Members of the House  who are willing to sit down and come to some compromise or some  resolution of the issues.   There are some things about which we have big differences. One is the  dollar figure. As the Senator from Ohio said, we have already spent  $3.5 trillion. That is a number so big, most of us couldn't even speak  it before we got to this era of the sneaky, dangerous COVID virus.   Let's look at the other side. On what might we agree or many of us  agree? We don't have 100 percent on either side who are going to agree  on most anything.   We might start with schools. Schools are starting up in the southern  part of the United States, where the Presiding Officer is from-- Florida--and I am from Tennessee. Schools are getting ready to go back,  and so are colleges. That means there are 70 million students who would  like to go back to school or college--100,000 public schools, 35,000  private schools, and 6,000 colleges.   What help do they need? They need help reopening safely so that they  can go back with students physically present as consistent with safety  as is possible.   I talked with the Governor of Tennessee, Bill Lee, yesterday. He said  93 of the 95 counties in Tennessee had schools that were going to  reopen in person. Maybe not every student, maybe not every class, but  in 93 of the 95 counties, the Governor said they know that children  need to be in school and their parents need for them to be in school.  Two-thirds of married parents work outside the home.   This is a bill for the children, though. I mean, every teacher, every  pediatrician, and almost every parent knows that, especially with young  children, if they are left out of school for such a lengthy period of  time, it damages them; it hurts them. There is a health risk in going  back, yes--not very much for young children--but there is a bigger  emotional, intellectual, and physical risk if they stay out of school.   What have we proposed to do? We proposed to help pay for the schools  to open safely and to help pay for the colleges to open safely, which  most are doing.   The Chronicle of Higher Education said yesterday that 50 percent of  our colleges plan to open this fall with students physically present.  Thirty-five percent have a mix, with students physically present and  online instruction. That means only 13 percent will be all virtual--at  least that is their plan.   If we could agree on that, why shouldn't we help them? Well, we can  agree on it because the House of Representatives bill and the Senate  Republican bill have almost exactly the same amount of money in them-- about $1,250 for K-12 schools--that is a lot of money per student;  $1,250 per student--and about $1,500 per student for colleges to help  them open safely. We could agree on that.   I think we can agree on childcare. We ought to be talking about back  to school, back to childcare, back to work. It is hard to go back to  work if you don't have childcare. There are provisions in the House  bill and the Republican bill that aren't so different.   Testing. We all believe, I think, that we need maximum advance on  testing, especially point-of-care testing--quick, reliable tests. There  is money in the Republican bill and in the Democratic bill to advance  that effort.   Then there are the small business loans, called PPP. That probably  was the most successful part of the early CARES bill, but a bipartisan  group of Senators has worked on getting rid of some of the problems  with it and come up with a proposal to extend that.  [[Page S4621]]    Those are several major points of which we agree. And I think the  Senator from Arizona's suggestion that we pass the unemployment benefit  for another week while we work together to get an agreement was a  commonsense one.   (The remarks of Mr. Alexander pertaining to the introduction of S.  4375 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced  Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')    I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I honor one of my  constituents, Judge Charles D. Susano Jr., who retired in April after  25 years of dedicated service to the State of Tennessee. Judge Susano  is the state's longest serving state appellate judge and has led a  remarkable life of public service and thoughtful jurisprudence.   Judge Susano is a native and lifelong Knoxvillian. Born in 1936, he  attended Knoxville Catholic High School before going to the University  of Notre Dame where he graduated magna cum laude. Following an  honorable discharge from the U.S. Army, Judge Susano returned to his  Tennessee roots to attend the University of Tennessee Law School, where  he was a member of the Tennessee Law Review and the Order of the Coif.   Judge Susano began his legal career clerking for Chief Justice  Hamilton Burnett in the inaugural class of clerks to the Tennessee  Supreme Court. He practiced law in Knoxville for 30 years, while also  giving back to the community as a member of the advisory commission to  the Tennessee Supreme Court on Civil Rules, as well as board member of  several local nonprofits.   In 1994, Governor Ned Ray McWherter appointed Judge Susano to serve  as a judge for the Tennessee Court of Appeals, and he won the seat  later that same year. Judge Susano would go on to win statewide  reelection in 1998, 2006, and 2014, and he served as the presiding  judge of the Court of Appeals from 2012-2014. During his time on the  court, he has authored over 1,000 legal opinions and received numerous  awards including: the Justice Frank F. Drowota III Outstanding Judicial  Service Award in 2017; Appellate Judge of the Year from the American  Board of Trial Advocates, Tennessee Chapter in 2003; and the Courage in  the Face of Adversity Award from the Knoxville Bar Association in 2004.   I want to thank Judge Susano for his many years of service to  Tennessee. The end of his long tenure in the Tennessee judiciary will  certainly be felt by many in the State. I wish him, his wife, and their  children all the best as they begin this new chapter in their  lives.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I want to speak for a few minutes about  the changes to telehealth during the last five months--one of the most  dramatic developments in the delivery of medical services ever--and why  we in Congress should make many of those changes permanent.   I recently heard from a psychiatric nurse practitioner in Nashville  who has been seeing patients during the COVID-19 pandemic using  telehealth--which means she uses the Internet to see her patients over  video or she calls them on the telephone.   She told me about one of her elderly patients who, before the COVID- 19 pandemic, got to her appointments by walking from her high-rise  apartment to Gallatin Road, catching a bus, and then walking from the  bus stop to the clinic.   When the patient got to the clinic, she had to wait for her  appointment. Then, when the appointment was over, she had to do all of  these steps in reverse to get back home.   Because of telehealth, this nurse said that her patient was in tears  out of appreciation that she could now have appointments from her own  home. She had access to health care without the long journey, and she  could still receive her medications.   The nurse said that several of her other elderly patients have had  similar experiences and have asked if they could continue to have  access to telehealth in the future, even after the pandemic.   Because of COVID-19, the health care sector and federal and state  governments have been forced to cram 10 years' worth of telehealth  experience into almost 5 months. In 2016, there were almost 884 million  visits nationwide between patients and physicians, according to the  Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Almost all of them were in  person--online or remote visits were rare.   During the last four months, the number of online or remote visits  virtually exploded. According to Vanderbilt University Medical Center,  Vanderbilt went from 10 telehealth visits a  [[Page S4636]]  day before the pandemic to more than 2,000 telehealth visits a day  across specialties, including primary care, pediatrics, and behavioral  health. In less than 3 months, Vanderbilt has provided more than  100,000 telehealth visits.   Before COVID-19, approximately 13,000 Americans enrolled in the  traditional Medicare program received telehealth services in an average  week. In the last week of April, nearly 1.7 million Americans enrolled  in traditional Medicare received telehealth services.   In total, over 9 million Americans in traditional Medicare received a  telehealth service between mid-March and mid-June.   The Nashville Journal reports that Tennessee's Centerstone, which  provides treatment for mental health and substance use disorders, says  it is providing nearly 2,500 telehealth visits per day and 30 percent  more of patients are keeping their appointments, which is key to  treating these disorders. According to Bob Vero, Centerstone's CEO,  ``We've taken away a lot of the reasons people don't follow through  with their care.''   Tim Adams, the CEO of Ascension Saint Thomas Health, which has 9  hospitals in Middle Tennessee and employs over 800 physicians, told me  that he predicts that 15-20 percent of the system's visits between  patients and physicians will be conducted through telehealth in the  future.   In that 15 to 20 percent holds true across the Nation because of  telehealth expansion during COVID-19--it would produce a massive change  in our health care system.   Congress and the administration reacted to the pandemic by creating a  regulatory environment that made the current telehealth boom possible  by allowing: in-home virtual visits; telehealth for patients in rural  areas at rural health clinics; telehealth from physical therapists,  speech language pathologists and other providers; telehealth for many  more services including emergency department visits; and allowing  Medicare hospice and home dialysis patients to start their care with a  virtual visit.   Now Congress is beginning to build on what we've learned and make  those changes permanent. Here are three steps Congress should take now,  as a part of the COVID-19 legislation that we are working on:   Step One is to pass the COVID-19 HEALS Act legislation that was  introduced Monday, which:   Provides telehealth access to part-time and hourly employees; extends  the administration's telehealth flexibilities and waivers through the  end of the Public Health Emergency, or through 2021; and allows Rural  Health Clinics and Federally Qualified Health Centers to continue to  provide telehealth to Medicare beneficiaries for 5 years beyond the  public health emergency.   Step Two is to pass the CONNECT for Health Act. That legislation  explores ways to expand telehealth services and begins to permanently  remove some of the restrictions on where a patient needs to be for  telehealth access. The bill is already supported by a broad coalition  in the Senate and the House.   Here in the Senate, the CONNECT for Health Act has been led by  Senators Roger Wicker (R-MS), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R- MS), Ben Cardin (D-MD), John Thune (R-SD), and Mark Warner (D-VA)--and  today the bill has 38 cosponsors in the Senate.   This bill was first introduced in 2016 and these senators deserve  great credit for seeing the need to expand permanently telehealth  services even before the pandemic forced a massive change in how  Americans receive health care from their doctors.   Step Three would be to pass the bill I'm introducing today which  would go further than either of those first two steps and would make  permanent in-home visits and rural telehealth access. The bill would  also give the Secretary authority to make permanent other changes that  the Administration has made over the last few months.   Here's what the bill being introduced today does:   Ensures that patients can access telehealth anywhere by permanently  removing Medicare's so-called ``geographic and originating site''  restrictions, which required both that the patient live in a rural area  and use telehealth at a doctor's office or clinic.   Congress temporarily ended these restrictions in the Coronavirus  Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act that was  signed into law on March 6, allowing millions of Americans to talk with  their doctor virtually during the pandemic.   Making this change permanent will ensure Medicare beneficiaries do  not lose that ability when the pandemic ends.   Protects access to telehealth for patients in rural areas. The bill  makes permanent a change allowing Medicare beneficiaries to continue  receiving telehealth services from Rural Health Clinics or Federally  Qualified Health Centers.   Telehealth access is especially important for patients in rural and  other medically underserved areas because they no longer have to travel  to see their primary care doctor.   Those are two changes that this bill would make permanent.   Then it would give the Secretary of Health and Human Services new  authorities to do these three things:   Help patients continue to access telehealth from physical therapists,  speech language pathologists, and other health care providers.   The bill gives authority to the Secretary of Health and Human  Services to allow Medicare to permanently expand the types of health  care providers that can offer telehealth services.   Before COVID-19, only doctors, nurse practitioners, physician  assistants, and certain other practitioners could deliver telehealth  services.   Today a much wider range of health practitioners are providing  telehealth services.   Help give Medicare recipients many more telehealth services.   The bill gives authority to the HHS Secretary to give Medicare the  flexibility to reimburse for more telehealth services.   During the pandemic, Medicare has been reimbursing for 135 telehealth  services, more than doubling the number of telehealth services covered  before COVID-19. Examples include emergency department visits, home  visits, and physical, occupational and speech therapy services. Help  Medicare hospice and home dialysis patients begin receiving care  through a telehealth appointment.   Medicare requires a face-to-face visit when a patient begins hospice  and home dialysis care, and this change would provide authority to the  HHS Secretary to allow a telehealth visit to fulfill the requirement  for an in-person visit. This will provide flexibility to improve access  for these patients and account for individual circumstances. This  legislation is the result of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and  Pensions Committee hearing on June 17, during which senators asked  health care experts about the 31 temporary Federal policy changes made  in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.   The legislation I am introducing today incorporates the  recommendations of those experts to make permanent 5 of the most  important changes--and helps to ensure that patients do not lose the  benefits that they have gained from using telehealth during the COVID- 19 pandemic.   This bill would make permanent the telehealth changes in the  legislation introduced Monday as well as the CONNECT for Health Act.  The best result for the American people would be for Congress to  approve all three steps--the changes in the HEALS Act, the CONNECT for  Health Act, and my legislation--in the next COVID-19 package so we  don't miss the opportunity to support and encourage one of the most  important changes in the delivery of medical services ever.                                  ______                                         By Mr. KAINE:   S. 4390. A bill to establish a grant program to support schools of  medicine and schools of osteopathic medicine in underserved areas; to  the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.
