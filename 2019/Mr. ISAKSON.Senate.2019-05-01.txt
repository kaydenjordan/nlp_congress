 Mr. President, first of all, I thank the Senator from  Missouri for his comments about the disaster. We are having a disaster  in the U.S. Senate because we haven't been able to solve our emergency  problem yet. It is not because of Senator Blunt. He has done a great  job, as have many Members of the Senate. We are close now, and there is  a meeting this afternoon with important Senators. We are close on  Hawaii, on Alaska, on Georgia, on South Carolina, on Tennessee, on  Alabama, on Florida, and on the other States that have had disasters in  the past year to which we have still been late on getting disaster  emergency funds.   In fact, in Georgia, this is the 222nd day, in the case of one  emergency, that those funds have been held up. In the agricultural  season, 222 days is 1\1/2\ plants. It is one planting, one picking, and  a second planting. So it is a significant part of the agriculture year.  We are getting killed in Georgia. Our farmers are getting hurt badly  because of the ineptitude, in part and sometimes in whole, of the U.S.  Senate.   Finally, cool heads are coming together. We are getting over some  arguments, and we are getting some things solved. Thanks to the help of  Senator Blunt and others in the U.S. Senate, we are going to get help  to our farmers in Georgia, to those in Alabama, and to those in Alaska  from the earthquake and to those in Hawaii from the lava flow and the  eruptions they have had there and from all of the other disasters we  have had. Finally, that money is going to start flowing.
