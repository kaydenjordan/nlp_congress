 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Barletta  and Ranking Member Johnson. I also look over this House floor and thank  my colleague, Mrs. Bustos, from Illinois, for joining me in this effort  because, if you travel to my district or Mrs. Bustos' district in  central and, in my case, southern Illinois and you ask my constituents  about their opinion of FEMA's disaster declaration process, they are  going to tell you that it is broken.                                time  1330    You don't have to look any further than the State of Illinois to see  how FEMA's public assistance formula is failing hardworking families  across this country because it simply does not put all communities on a  level playing field.   In 2012, tornadoes devastated Harrisburg in southern Illinois, but  the State was denied public assistance while Missouri and Kentucky  received aid due to the damage inflicted by the exact same storm. Just  a few short years ago, the towns of Gifford and Washington in central  Illinois were denied public assistance as well, despite those  communities suffering millions in damage. And just last year, Illinois  was once again denied public assistance following extensive damage done  in late December 2015 and early January 2016 caused by severe storms  and flooding in the central and southern parts of our State.   Under existing regulations, FEMA currently takes into account several  factors when determining the need for public and individual assistance.  However, there is currently no standard to determine which factor is  more important than another during the disaster declaration process.  This leads to highly subjective and uncertain processes that leave  States and communities in limbo for weeks as their application is  considered.   By working with the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee last  year during the markup of the FEMA Disaster Assistance Reform Act, we  were successful in including important language based on legislation I  introduced that requires the administrator of FEMA, when making  recommendations to the President regarding a disaster declaration, to  ``give greater weight and consideration to severe local impact.'' This  bill ultimately passed out of the House under suspension last Congress,  but, unfortunately, the bill died in the Senate.   This Congress, I have introduced this language again, along with my  friend and colleague from Illinois (Mrs. Bustos), as the Disaster  Declaration Improvement Act.   Passing this bill will have a real impact on States like Illinois,  where a large portion of the population is concentrated in a small  northeastern corner of our State. Because of the population density in  the northern part of my State, rural parts, where I live and where I  represent, are having to meet an arbitrarily high standard in order to  qualify for a disaster declaration. Enacting this language is going to  help level the playing field and help ensure rural areas are given a  fair chance when disaster happens and help is needed.   During our March markup of this bill, we also added important  language that strengthens the bill by way of an amendment offered by my  friend, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves). This language also  requires FEMA to place more consideration on recent multiple disasters,  to take into account the cumulative impact such events can have. So I  want to thank Chairman Graves for working with my office on including  this language and for being a cosponsor of my bill.   I also want to express my personal gratitude to Chairman Shuster and  Ranking Member DeFazio for working with us during the last Congress and  this Congress, and for moving this bill so early. Again, I want to  especially thank Chairman Barletta for being a cosponsor of this bill.   Mr. Speaker, central and southern Illinois just experienced another  flooding event this past weekend. And while it is not yet clear what  the damage is, it is clear that Congress must act to  [[Page H3021]]  ensure that folks get a fair shake if it is determined that Federal  assistance is needed.   I urge a ``yes'' vote.    Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably  detained. Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall  No. 242.                            ____________________
