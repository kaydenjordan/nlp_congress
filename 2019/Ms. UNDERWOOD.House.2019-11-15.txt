 Mr. Chair, I missed rollcall No. 617, on agreeing to  the Torres (CA) amendment to H.R. 4863. Had I been present, I would  have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 617.                    Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Flores     Madam Speaker, the shooting in Santa Clarita yesterday  marks the 365th mass shooting this year. At least one of those  shootings rocked my own community.   Today is exactly 9 months since the senseless workplace shooting in  Aurora, Illinois, that took the lives of Trevor Wehner, Clayton Parks,  Russell Beyer, Vicente Juarez, and Josh Pinkard. Some of the heroic  police officers who responded to that shooting just returned to full  duty this week.   This does not have to be the norm. This year, the House passed  bipartisan legislation that would save lives by implementing universal  background checks for every gun purchased. The Senate needs to pass it  and to send it to the President.   And we should do more still. I support legislation that would prevent  gun violence by: one, committing Federal funds to study it for the  public health crisis that it is; two, keeping guns out of the hands of  known domestic abusers; and, three, just this week, I cosponsored the  Assault Weapons Ban of 2019, because weapons of war do not belong in  our neighborhoods.   These are commonsense policies that would save countless lives:  children's lives, first responders' lives, our own neighbors' lives.                            ____________________
