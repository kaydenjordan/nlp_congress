 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 354, which  forcefully condemns the shocking assault carried out here on American  soil, here in our Nation's Capital, by trained paramilitary agents of  the Turkish Presidential security force against a peaceful assembly of  protesters who were exercising their First Amendment rights to freedom  of speech.   Video footage offers evidence that President Erdogan sanctioned the  attack, and then calmly sat back to watch as his bodyguards carried it  out.  [[Page H4630]]                                     time  1645    Each of us in this Chamber must ask the question: What sort of  foreign leader invited for an official visit by the President of the  United States would conduct himself in such a reprehensible manner and  would show such contempt for America's commitment to human rights and  civil liberties?   Make no mistake. This is the same man who has ordered mass  incarcerations in his own country, who persecutes dissenters and jails  democratically elected officials, and who locks up journalists on a  whim. In fact, he is the number one jailer of journalists in the world.   The assault on innocent protesters in the streets of Washington,  D.C., is entirely consistent with the impulses of an autocratic Turkey.  It has unmasked President Erdogan for the bully that he is and offers  Americans a teachable moment on the character of official Turkey. It  reflects a deeply imbedded reflex that, in the modern era, has brought  the world, among other things, the unlawful invasion and occupation of  Cyprus, the Armenian genocide, and the violent repression of the  Kurdish people.   This incident demands more than just the prosecution of Erdogan's  security personnel or the expulsion of the Turkish Ambassador or the  strong condemnation of Erdogan himself, all of which should happen. It  is time for a complete reevaluation of the U.S. relationship with  Turkey. We cannot pretend that it is business as usual with a foreign  leader that has attacked our Nation's most cherished democratic values  on our very own soil.
