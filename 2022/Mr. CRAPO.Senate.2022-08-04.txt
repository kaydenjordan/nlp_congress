 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I appreciate  my colleagues' commitment to this issue and to their constituents. As  you know, this legislation has been before us for some time now, and  there is controversy over it.   This bill would retroactively reinstate pension benefits for a small  subset of participants whose pensions have already been transferred to  the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, or PBGC. That would create a  precedent that other plans would follow.   The PBGC exists specifically to cover pension benefits if a plan is  terminated. So we should let the system work. This system does not  require taxpayer dollars for a bailout or for whatever one would like  to call it. That is part of the reason for the objection.   We also have an obligation to be deliberate in how we spend taxpayer  money. Before we inject more money into the system, we should explore  the implications of this bill, which brings me to my final point. The  Finance Committee has not held a hearing--not a single hearing, let  alone a markup--on this bill. The Finance Committee exists to examine  proposals such as this and to provide all Senators an opportunity to  weigh in.   I am willing to work with my chairman, Senator Wyden, on this and  with Senator Brown and with Senator Portman and other Senators who are  interested in the issue so we can see if there is a need and a way that  we can address this issue specifically without creating a precedent  that would deal with the rest of the entire system that has been put  together to address terminated plans.    Because of the need for us to have regular-order deliberation and  consideration of this legislation, I must, today, object.
