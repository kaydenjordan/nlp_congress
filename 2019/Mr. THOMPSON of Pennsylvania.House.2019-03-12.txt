 Mr. Speaker, I rise today, during  National Agriculture Week, to celebrate American farmers and farm  families.   This nationwide effort recognizes and celebrates the abundance  provided by American agriculture. It also reminds citizens that  agriculture is a part of all of us and plays a critical economic and  food security role.   Thursday is National Ag Day, which began in 1973 as a way to increase  public awareness of agriculture's role in society. National Ag Day  encourages every American to understand how food and fiber products are  produced; appreciate the role agriculture plays in providing safe,  abundant, and affordable products; value the essential role of  agriculture in maintaining a strong economy; and acknowledge and  consider career opportunities in the agriculture, food, and fiber  industries.   In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, we are fortunate to have more  than 58,000 farmers. These men and women are the lifeline of the  Commonwealth, as agriculture is our number one industry.   Our farmers produce a safe and abundant food supply, including our  dairy farmers, who produce the milk that is stocked in the cases of our  supermarkets and in lunchrooms across America.   My bill, the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act, would further expand  milk choices in our schools. It would allow for whole milk, both  flavored and unflavored, to be offered in school cafeterias.   Mr. Speaker, milk was once a staple in the diets of our students, but  consumption in schools has dramatically decreased since the Healthy,  Hunger-Free Act of 2010--which demonized milk fat, which is where  nutrition and flavor is--was implemented.   Milk is the number one source of nine essential nutrients in the  diets of many young Americans. We can provide the foundation for a  solid, healthy lunch in our schools that also tastes great and students  will want to drink.   When students don't consume milk, they are not getting nutrients such  as calcium, potassium, and vitamin D.   I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids  Act, and National Agriculture Week is the perfect time to sign on to  this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, we know that farmers feed; nutrition matters; and  agriculture plays a critical role in modern society. I would like to  thank all Americans who work tirelessly in the ag sector. On behalf of  a grateful Nation, we thank you.                       Cybersecurity Skills Integration     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  H.R. 1592, the Cybersecurity Skills Integration Act.   As co-chair of the House Career and Technical Education Caucus, I am  proud that we continue to provide the resources necessary to have a  dominant and prosperous workforce. For instance, this past July, we  authorized the Carl D. Perkins Act to advance career and technical  education.   We must continue developing a 21st century workforce to meet the  technical demands our country is facing now and into the future. That  is why, together with my friend, Congressman  Jim Langevin, we have  introduced a bill to help protect our sensitive data and critical  infrastructure from bad actors.   Our legislation directs the Department of Education to create a  comprehensive grant program that integrates cybersecurity education  into new and established postsecondary CTE programs.   With more than 16 critical infrastructure sectors in our country, we  must prepare our next generation of learners to have the most  sophisticated and comprehensive educational programs to protect our  Nation's most dire assets, systems, and networks.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I thank Mr. Langevin  for his work and leadership on this issue.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to  highlight a fatal disorder that has been impacting deer populations in  24 States, including Pennsylvania, chronic wasting disease.   Chronic wasting disease is progressive and always fatal. Deer, elk,  mules, and moose are impacted by this disease. First, they have  difficulty moving, and the most obvious and consistent sign is  significant weight loss over time.   Madam Speaker, I made an amendment to the 2018 farm bill that gives  priority status to chronic wasting disease under the research portion  of the bill, and I will be introducing legislation to help identify and  address the root causes of chronic wasting disease.   This past Saturday, my colleague and friend, Congressman   John  Joyce, and I were at the East Freedom Fire Hall with 300 hunters. At  this event, chronic wasting disease was at the forefront.   While the science is developing, a cure is still years away and needs  considerable funding to make it a reality. It is my hope that, through  research, we can successfully cure chronic wasting disease.                            ____________________
