 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the career of Bob  Gastonguay, who has been with my office since I was elected in 2011.   Prior to his first retirement, Bob had a long and successful career  in telecommunications as the executive director of the Nevada State  Cable Telecommunications Association.   Why did he come out of retirement? He wanted a Federal job.   No matter the difficulties that came with serving as the face of my  front office, Bob has been the perfect person to greet people or take  their calls. He greets everyone with a warm welcome, and shows them  respect, and makes them feel heard.   As a new member of the octogenarian club, Bob hasn't let his age slow  him down. He is always the first one in, constantly on the move, and  always striking up a conversation with whomever he meets.   In addition to his long career, Bob raised a family of two sons, a  granddaughter, and three great-grandchildren with his loving wife of 60  years, Barbara.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Bob for his service to Nevada and to the  country.                            ____________________
