 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following  statement regarding the impeachment trial of the former President be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:     Statement on the Second Impeachment Trial of the Former President          Mr. President. The former President's conduct       during and after the 2020 Presidential election was       indefensible and dangerous. By inciting an insurrection       against Congress and pressuring government officials across       our Nation to overturn the election in his favor, the former       President directly ``threatened the integrity of the       democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of       power, and imperiled a coequal branch of Government.''\1\ As       long as he is able to hold public office under the United       States, he will remain a grave threat to our national       security and our Constitution. For these reasons, I again       voted to convict the former President on the House of       Representatives' Article of Impeachment.                        Constitutionality of the Trial         As a threshold question in this trial, the former       President's legal team and several Republican Senators have       argued that the Senate cannot hold an impeachment trial       against a President who is no longer in office.\2\ This       argument is just another convenient excuse for some of my       Republican colleagues to avoid holding the former President       accountable. Not only has the theory been roundly rejected by       both liberal and conservative constitutional legal       scholars,\3\ it would also completely contravene both Senate       and historical precedent.\4\ In this case, consistent with       the prevailing legal theory and historical precedent, the       Senate voted to affirm the constitutionality of this current       trial--a decision that I fully supported.\5\ Thus, after       addressing the threshold Constitutional issue, the question       before every Senator in this trial became twofold--(1) did       the former President do what he is charged with in the       Article?; and (2) if so, does that action warrant conviction       and disqualification from holding future office?                             The Big Lie Debunked         The public record demonstrates clearly that the former       President engaged in the conduct outlined in the Article of       Impeachment put forward by the House of Representatives. We       watched his actions with our own eyes. We heard his       conspiracy theories and baseless accusations with our own       ears. For months after the election, all of America witnessed       the former President's deliberate repetition of the ``Big       Lie;'' he repeatedly claimed--without any evidence--that the       2020 general election was rigged and stolen from him.\6\ In       furtherance of this falsehood, the former President has made       numerous claims, all easily and consistently rebutted,       regarding the votes cast in multiple battleground states. As       the Senior Senator from Pennsylvania, a state that the former       President relentlessly attacked after the election, I believe       it is important to debunk the numerous false statements that       the former President asserted regarding the Pennsylvania       Presidential election.        Prior to the election, it was widely reported that the       public should ``beware'' of early U.S. election tallies       because of the unprecedented amount of mail-in voting and the       different ways that states were processing ballots due to the       COVID-19 pandemic.\7\ In Pennsylvania specifically,       Democratic voters were outpacing Republican voters by a 3-to-      1 ratio in mail-in voting.\8\ Since the mail-in votes would       be the last to be counted in most counties, experts cautioned       voters that the former President might appear to be winning       in the early returns on election night (a ``Red mirage'')       only to lose that lead as election officials counted more       mail-in ballots in the days after Election Day (a ``Blue       shift'').\9\        Despite these warnings, the former President attempted to       sow doubt, even before Election Day, about votes counted       after November 3. A week before Election Day, he indicated       that ``counting ballots for two weeks'' after Election Day       was ``totally inappropriate'' and he did not believe it was       consistent with our Nation's election laws.\10\ To be clear,       there is nothing improper or illegal about election officials       counting legally cast votes after Election Day. Nonetheless,       as election officials in Pennsylvania began to process the       heavily Democratic-leaning mail-in ballots in the days       following Election Day and the former President's ``Red       mirage'' predictably turned to a ``Blue shift'' in favor of       President Biden, the former President claimed that officials       were ``finding Biden votes all over the place.''\11\ In       reality, election officials in Pennsylvania were simply       counting legally cast votes. As Republican Philadelphia       Commissioner Al Schmidt said: ``In the birthplace of our       Republic, counting votes is not a bad thing. Counting votes       cast on or before Election Day by eligible voters is not       corruption. It is not cheating. It is democracy.''\12\        Relatedly, the former President also claimed that in       Pennsylvania, ``tens of thousands of votes were illegally       received after 8 P.M. on Tuesday, Election Day, totally and       easily changing the results.''\13\ Here again, the former       President was lying. In September 2020, the Pennsylvania       Supreme Court extended the mail-in ballot receipt deadline in       Pennsylvania by three days because of the unprecedented       circumstances caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\14\ The       Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision did not permit eligible       voters to vote after Election Day. Rather, pursuant to the       Free and Equal Elections Clause of the Pennsylvania       Constitution, the court explained that ballots mailed by       Election Day could still be counted if those ballots were       received within three days of Election Day.\15\ In addition       to lying about whether it was legal to receive ballots after       Election Day, the former President drastically overinflated       the number of ballots received after Election Day in       Pennsylvania. In fact, there were only approximately ten       thousand ballots received after Election Day and those       ballots were not even included in Pennsylvania's certified       election results.\16\ Since President Biden won Pennsylvania       by over eighty thousand votes, the ballots received after       Election Day would not have made any difference in       Pennsylvania's Presidential election outcome.\17\        In another tweet, the former President claimed that       Pennsylvania prevented his campaign officials ``from watching       much of the Ballot count.''\18\ Again, the former President       was lying. In fact, in response to a judge's question during       one hearing on whether there were election observers in the       canvassing room, a lawyer representing the former President       offered the seemingly bizarre concession that there was ``a       non-zero number of people in the room.''\19\ Furthermore,       multiple courts confirmed that the former President's       campaign presented no evidence suggesting that his campaign's       observers were treated any differently than the observers for       the Biden Campaign.\20\        The former President's lies did not stop there. In late       November, the former President tweeted that over a million       votes in Pennsylvania were ``created out of thin air.''\21\       This is a lie. Here, the former President was referring to a       conspiracy theory offered by Republican State Senator Doug       Mastriano, who claimed that the Pennsylvania Department of       State was reporting an extra 1.1 million mail-in votes in       Pennsylvania.\22\ Senator Mastriano indicated that       Pennsylvania had reported mailing out ``1,823,148 ballots, of       which 1,462,302 were returned,'' but he indicated that a       dashboard on the Department of State's website recorded over       2.5 mail-in ballots in the general election.\23\ While       Senator Mastriano did not include sources for his data, it       was easy to determine that he was conflating different       datasets from the general election and the June primaries. A       dataset from the Pennsylvania Department of State clearly       detailed that there were 1,823,148 mail-in ballot request for       the June 2020 primaries\24\--the exact number that Senator       Mastriano cited--while Pennsylvania's official returns for       the 2020 general election clearly illustrated that over 2.6       million voters cast a ballot by mail in the Presidential       election.\25\        In another tweet on December 28, the former President       claimed that there were ``205,000 more votes than there were       voters'' in Pennsylvania.\26\ This too is another lie. Again,       the former President appeared to be referencing yet another       conspiracy theory offered by another state legislator,       Representative Frank Ryan.\27\ Representative Ryan claimed       that the official election returns included 205,000 more       votes than those listed in Pennsylvania's voter registration       database.\28\ Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro       explained that the voter registration database referenced by       Representative Frank ``is updated by each county       individually, and this updating process can take several       weeks following an election.''\29\ Thus, the Attorney General       explained that it appeared that Representative Ryan was       comparing ``the official returns with incomplete data from       the registration database to justify his baseless claim that       there were more votes than voters.''\30\        Unfortunately, the above lies are merely a sampling of the       former President's total lies about the election process in       Pennsylvania and across the Nation. In addition to these  [[Page S940]]       falsehoods, the former President claimed--without evidence--      that there were ``900,000 Fraudulent Votes'' in       Pennsylvania,\31\ that Dominion Voting Systems switched       221,000 votes from the former President to Joe Biden in       Pennsylvania,\32\ and that ``Fraud and illegality'' were a       ``big part'' of his election lawsuits in Pennsylvania.\33\        The Pennsylvania election was administered safely and       securely by thousands of Republican and Democratic election       officials and selfless volunteers across the Commonwealth. We       know this because as the House Managers highlighted in their       trial brief, ``[o]ur legal system affords many ways in which       a candidate can contest the outcome of an election.''\34\ The       former President did not merely contest the election in       Pennsylvania, but also in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada,       and Wisconsin.\35\ In total, the former President and his       allies filed 62 lawsuits in state and federal courts       regarding the 2020 election and they lost every case, except       for one minor lawsuit in Pennsylvania.\36\        Furthermore, despite the President's public claims of       widespread illegalities, his legal team rarely attempted to       allege fraud in his lawsuits.\37\ In fact, his own attorney,       Rudy Giuliani, explicitly confirmed that the Campaign was not       alleging fraud during one high profile case in Pennsylvania       by stating ``[t]his is not a fraud case.''\38\ Despite these       facts, the former President continued to spread a different       narrative--a Big Lie regarding a rigged election--on Twitter.        United States District Court Judge Matthew Brann of the       Middle District of Pennsylvania highlighted the absurdity of       some of the former President's legal arguments in an opinion       dismissing one of the Campaign's lawsuits:         ``Plaintiffs ask this Court to disenfranchise almost seven       million voters. . . . One might expect that when seeking such       a startling outcome, a plaintiff would come formidably armed       with compelling legal arguments and factual proof of rampant       corruption, such that this Court would have no option but to       regrettably grant the proposed injunctive relief despite the       impact it would have on such a large group of citizens. That       has not happened. Instead, this Court has been presented with       strained legal arguments without merit and speculative       accusations, unpled in the operative complaint and       unsupported by evidence. In the United States of America,       this cannot justify the disenfranchisement of a single voter,       let alone all the voters of its sixth most populated state.       Our people, laws, and institutions demand more.''\39\         In the Campaign's appeal to the United States Court of       Appeals for the Third Circuit, Judge Stephanos Bibas, a judge       appointed by the former President,\40\ wrote for a unanimous       panel affirming Judge Brann's initial decision.\41\ Judge       Bibas wrote: ``Free, fair elections are the lifeblood of our       democracy. Charges of unfairness are serious. But calling an       election unfair does not make it so. Charges require specific       allegations and then proof. We have neither here.''\42\ The       Presidential election was fair and lawful notwithstanding the       many lies told by the former President.                  The Former President's Pattern of Conduct         Despite losing case after case in federal and state courts,       the former President was not deterred in his efforts to       spread his Big Lie regarding a stolen election. Instead, he       turned his attention to pressuring federal, state and local       elections officials to overturn the election. In Georgia, he       personally called the Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger,       and told him to ``find 11,780 votes, which is one more than       we have because we won the state.''\43\        He also began an aggressive lobbying campaign against Vice       President Pence.\44\ Pursuant to the Twelfth Amendment, the       Vice President counts each state's certified Electoral       College votes for President in a joint session of       Congress.\45\ However, the former President regularly lied       about the constitutional duty of the Vice President. In       another attempt to turn the election in his favor through       illegitimate means, the former President suggested that Vice       President Pence should violate his oath of office by refusing       to count certain electoral votes for President Biden during       the joint session.\46\        After failing to overturn the election through the courts       and his pressure campaign on other elected officials, the       former President took aim for one more attack on American       democracy. He summoned his mob of insurrectionists to       Washington, D.C. on January 6, 2021 for a ``Save America       Rally'' to coincide with the joint session of Congress.\47\       He invited them. He incited them over the course of months       and on January 6. Finally, he directed this Trump mob to the       Capitol to subvert and obstruct Congress from conducting its       constitutional obligation to certify the 2020 Presidential       election.        On January 6, we heard the former President continue to       spread his Big Lie at his rally. As Attorney General Shapiro       detailed, the former President ``inflamed the crowd by       repeating the same debunked allegations about voter fraud in       Pennsylvania and elsewhere. In his remarks, he repeated no       fewer than eight false statements about Pennsylvania's       elections alone.'' \48\ He further incited the mob to ``stop       the steal'' by declaring that ``we fight, we fight like       hell,'' because ``if you don't fight like hell you're not       going to have a country anymore.'' \49\        The case for incitement is about far more than just the       former President's speech on January 6. This was about a       pattern of conduct. It was about the former President's       autocratic leadership and calls for political violence       throughout his Presidency. It was about a President who once       bragged: ``I have the tough people [supporting me], but they       don't play it tough until they go to a certain point, and       then it would be very bad, very bad.'' \50\        I, as well as public officials in both parties, talk about       fighting for public policy goals. We fight for health care.       We fight for civil rights. We fight for equity and justice.       However, when the former President tells his supporters to       fight, it means something different because the former       President has regularly condoned and encouraged violence       against protestors and members of the press since he became a       candidate in 2015. As Lead House Manager Jamie Raskin told us       during the trial: ``January 6 was a culmination of the       President's actions--not an aberration from them.''\51\ It       was the former President's pattern and practice of condoning       and encouraging violent action.        For example, during remarks in October 2015, the former       President--then a candidate--indicated that he would be a       ``little more violent'' next time protestors interrupted one       of his rallies.\52\ Video later showed the former President's       supporters forcibly dragging protestors out of the campaign       event.\53\ In a February 2016 rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, we       saw the former President tell his supporters to ``knock the       hell'' out of protestors and then promised to pay their legal       fees resulting from any altercation.\54\        In March 2016, a supporter of the former President sucker       punched a Black man being escorted out of a campaign       rally.\55\ The former President's supporter was later       recorded as saying ``[t]he next time we see him, we might       have to kill him.'' \56\ Just days later, the former       President defended those at his rallies assaulting protestors       by calling their actions ``very, very appropriate.'' \57\ In       another 2016 rally in Las Vegas, the former President       commented that he would like to ``punch [a protestor] in the       face'' before reminiscing about the fictional ``old days''       when violent behavior was allegedly more acceptable.\58\       ``You know what they used to do to guys like that when they       were in a place like this?'' he asked the crowd. ``They'd be       carried out on a stretcher, folks.''\59\        This abhorrent behavior did not change when the former       President entered office. In August 2017, after a rally of       white supremacists resulted in three deaths and more than 33       other injuries in Charlottesville, Virginia, the former       President offered perhaps the most disturbing comments of his       Presidency when he suggested that there was ``blame on both       sides'' and that there were ``very fine people on both       sides.''\60\ In October 2018, we saw the former President       praise and glorify the actions of current Governor of       Montana, Greg Gianforte, after then-candidate Gianforte had       body slammed and hospitalized a journalist in May 2017.\61\       Mr. Gianforte had already pled guilty to the assault.\62\        In 2020, the former President further glorified violence by       indicating that ``when the looting starts, the shooting       starts'' in relation to the civil rights protests occurring       after George Floyd's murder at the hands of law enforcement       in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\63\ Later, we saw the former       President direct federal agents to forcibly move hundreds of       peaceful protestors outside of the White House so he could       pose for a photo op in front of St. John's Church in       Washington, D.C.\64\        In April 2020, in what turned out to be a dress rehearsal       for the January 6 insurrection, we saw the former President       tweet ``LIBERATE MICHIGAN!'' after the Governor of Michigan       implemented several mitigation measures to address the COVID-      19 public health crisis.\65\ Nearly two weeks later, on April       30, armed protestors dressed in tactical gear sieged the       Michigan State Capitol, waving the Confederate flag and       wearing MAGA hats.\66\ Rather than condemn those who had       seized the state capitol waving Confederate flags, the former       President encouraged the Governor of Michigan to negotiate       with them: ``The Governor of Michigan should give a little,       and put out the fire. These are very good people, but they       are angry. They want their lives back again, safely! See       them, talk to them, make a deal.''\67\ Just a few months       following the capitol siege in Michigan, the FBI arrested       thirteen men for ``plotting to storm the Michigan State       capitol building, launch a civil war, kidnap Governor       Whitmer, transport her to Wisconsin, and then try and execute       her.'' \68\        The former President's pattern of conduct is indisputable.       A reasonable person cannot dispute that the former President       knew exactly what he was doing by perpetuating the ``Big       Lie,'' summoning his crowd of insurrectionists on January 6       and telling them: ``[I]f you don't fight like hell, you're       not going to have a country anymore.'' \69\ The former       President led his supporters to a breaking point and as he       had predicted in the past--it was ``very bad, very bad.''       \70\ There is simply no way to excuse the former President's       actions in this case.                          An Attack on Our Democracy         By encouraging his mob of insurrectionists to march on the       Capitol and obstruct the Congressional certification of the       2020 election, the former President attacked the foundational       principles of our democracy and the peaceful transfer of       power. He did not merely endanger another branch of       government and the Presidential line of succession. His       actions led to at least five deaths,  [[Page S941]]       injuries to nearly 140 members of law enforcement and untold       collateral damage resulting from the carnage of that day.\71\       He endangered the lives of countless Congressional staffers       and employees, members of the press and members of Congress.       He put a target on the back of his own Vice President and his       Vice President's family. His actions jeopardized our Nation's       national security by tarnishing the United States' reputation       abroad and emboldening violent extremists at home.        Furthermore, he has shown absolutely no remorse for any of       it, even going as far to glorify the insurrection in the       immediate aftermath of the attack. After the Capitol had been       secured in the early evening of January 6 and Congress was       making plans to resume its joint session, the former       President turned to Twitter to release a statement. He did       not denounce the violent insurrection, but rather he chose to       continue to spread his Big Lie that the election was stolen       from him and to call the insurrectionists ``great patriots:''         ``These are the things and events that happen when a sacred       landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously       stripped away from great patriots who have been badly &       unfairly treated for so long. Go home with love & in peace.       Remember this day forever.'' \72\         Ultimately, after carefully reviewing all of the evidence       put forward in this case, I found that the House Managers       more than exceeded their burden of proof. The former       President's conduct violated his oath of office, endangered       our democracy and jeopardized the United States' national       security. Through this conduct, the former President       committed a high crime against our Constitution. I voted to       convict him in the most bipartisan Presidential impeachment       proceedings in our Nation's history.\73\                                   endnotes         1. H.R.

Mr. President, I rise today in commemoration of the  75th anniversary of the electronic numerical integrator and computer.  This anniversary, formally known as ENIAC Day, marks the 1946  dedication at the University of Pennsylvania of the first all- electronic, programmable computer.   Invented by John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert of the University's  Moore School of Electrical Engineering, construction of the computer  began in July 1943. After several years of tireless work, Mauchly and  Eckert produced a 27-ton computer that occupied 1,800 square feet of  floor space and could complete complex calculations near  instantaneously. Also due credit are the original programmers of ENIAC,  Kathleen McNulty Mauchly Antonelli, Jean Jennings Bartik, Frances Betty  Snyder Holberton, Marlyn Wescoff Meltzer, Frances Bilas Spence, and  Ruth Lichterman Teitelbaum, without whom the operation of the machine  would not be possible. After ENIAC, Mauchly and Eckert continued to be  industry pioneers and went on to invent UNIVAC, the first commercial  computer. Today's Unisys Corporation, which I am proud to note is  headquartered in Blue Bell, PA, traces a momentous part of its origins  back to J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly and their early inventions.   As we mark this 75th anniversary, we marvel at the impact of ENIAC  and how far computers have come. While ENIAC was originally intended as  a tool to further our national defense, we have come to rely on later  iterations of the computer in all aspects of life. Computers enable us  to be more efficient, more connected and have transformed the world we  live in. I look forward to what the world looks like when we celebrate  the 100th anniversary of ENIAC Day in 2046.                            ____________________
