 Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to be up here  today, and I want to, first of all, say on June 28 of this year, we  raised $1.8 million for charity through our baseball game. We had  27,000 people pay to attend. We honored law enforcement, and Toyota was  our sponsor.   Tonight, I stand here with Bill Johnson, one of our captains, Gary  Palmer, and Chuck Fleischmann, who we surely call MVP.   This game is a tradition in Washington. Both sides play hard. The  Democrats played hard this year. We played a little harder. The score  was 16-6 in the Republicans' favor.   I just want to say that we truly are America's team, and we are proud  of it. We have had a three-peat. Practice starts September 4 of this  year as we move to a four-peat.   So that being said, we accept our trophy. We are honored to play our  Democratic colleague friends. We will be looking forward to next year's  game, and I just say, may God bless America.
