 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I appreciate the gentleman's amendment and his dedication to the  sound management of natural resources on behalf of the constituents in  his State.   Placer mining is unique to Alaska and has a unique history in place  in Alaska's economy. As such, the BLM proposal for unique reclamation  and bonding requirements need to receive additional review.   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of the gentleman's amendment.
