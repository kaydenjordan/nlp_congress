 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded    Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the nomination of  David Bernhardt as the next Deputy Secretary of the Interior.   Mr. Bernhardt has shown that he is unwilling to fight for the long- term conservation of our public lands and the responsible use of our  public resources. By his own admission, he intends to be a big business  yes-man for the Trump administration's extreme disregard for our  environment and the human lives that are affected.   President Trump promised to drain the swamp of DC, but with each day  of this administration, this Republican-controlled Senate approves yet  another corporate insider to help out big business. The decision to  nominate Mr. Bernhardt is no exception. He is another conflict-ridden,  climate-dismissing Trump appointee who favors profits over people.   Let's look at his record. Mr. Bernhardt has extensive political  experience in the Department of the Interior under the Bush  administration, but in his tenure at the Department, including the 2  years he oversaw the ethics division, the Department was awash in  ethical scandals and scientific misconduct.   And what did he do after he left government service? He scooted off  to a lucrative lobbying firm to help Big Oil and other extraction  companies maximize their profits by expanding offshore drilling and  delaying air pollution limits on coal plants, regardless of the impact  that would have on our children's future.   Even Mr. Bernhardt isn't proud of his own record. Prior to his  nomination, his lobbying firm bio bragged about recently helping  corporations fight against the Endangered Species Act, supporting  corporate interests in offshore drilling and exploration for fossil  fuels, and helping mining companies pursue public lands for  development. He openly bragged about recently representing ``an entity  under investigation by a Federal Agency'' and ``entities accused of  violating the Department of the Interior's regulations.'' He swaggered  through Washington. That is, he swaggered right up until he was under  consideration for the No. 2 spot at Interior. Now that he is in the  public spotlight, he has scrubbed all those pro-industry, pro-pollution  references from his bio. Now that the public is paying attention, he is  putting out a clean image of a public servant who just happens to  advise big corporations from time to time.   Beyond the ties Mr. Bernhardt still has to industry, I am alarmed by  his willingness to serve as the corporate rubberstamp that President  Trump wants. Mr. Bernhardt is a walking conflict of interest who has  taken one spin through the revolving door, and now he is coming back  around again for a second pass.   The Deputy Secretary serves at the pleasure of the President. But a  Deputy Secretary--the No. 2 at the Department--is, first and foremost,  bound to serve the American people and the mission of the Department.  No President is properly served by a corporate yes-man, and Mr.  Bernhardt's yes-man mentality was on full display during his  confirmation hearing.   When my colleague from Minnesota, Senator Al Franken, questioned Mr.  Bernhardt about climate change at his nomination hearing, he was all  too willing to dismiss the urgency of climate change, and he pushed  aside the responsibility of the Department of the Interior to act. In  defiance of accepted climate science, he stated:         This President ran, he won on a particular policy       perspective. That perspective's not going to change to the       extent we have the discretion under the law to follow it.    In other words, don't bother me with the facts; we will just stick to  whatever President Trump tells us to do.   But the rest of us can't ignore the facts. Our planet is getting  hotter. The last 16 years were all among the hottest 17 years on  record, and our seas are rising at an alarming rate. Our coasts are  threatened by furious storm surges that can sweep away homes and  devastate even our largest cities. Our economically disadvantaged  communities, too often situated in low-lying floodplains, are one bad  storm away from destruction. Our naval bases are under attack--not by  enemy ships but by rising seas. Our food supplies and forests are  threatened by droughts and wildfires that are becoming so common across  the country that they barely even make the evening news.   The effects of manmade climate change are all around us, and things  will only continue to get worse at an accelerating pace if we don't do  something about it. We can act, and one important step is saying no to  corporate raiders who are seeking to exploit public lands and gamble  with our children's future.   President Trump thinks leadership is handing over management of our  public lands to Big Oil and Big Coal executives who are looking to  stuff their pockets while the getting is good. Mr. Bernhardt, a  seasoned advocate for corporate interests, seems all too eager to  please this President and corporate interests, no matter the cost to  the American people. If President Trump's highest ranking agency  officials are not brave enough to speak even a little truth to power  about this President's climate delusions, then, who will?   The American people deserve leadership at the Department of the  Interior--leadership that is committed to ensuring that our public  resources and  [[Page S4108]]  our public lands are preserved for future generations of Americans. The  American people deserve leadership that fights back when the President  seeks to cut thousands of jobs at the Department of the Interior or  offers a budget that critically undermines the Department's mission and  threatens our public lands.   The American people deserve leadership at the Department of the  Interior--leadership that works for the people--and that is not David  Bernhardt.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
