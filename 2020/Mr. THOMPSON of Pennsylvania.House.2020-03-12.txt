 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  highlight the NASA ``be an astronaut'' program.   For the first time in 4 years, NASA is accepting applications for a  new class of astronauts.   Space exploration is a rich piece of modern American history, and  thanks to the new Artemis program, it will remain a part of our future.   Artemis will send the first woman and another man to the South Pole  of the Moon by 2024 and allow us to establish a permanent presence on  the Moon by 2028.   Our Nation's astronauts help execute a bold vision for science and  for exploration. Aspiring astronauts have the opportunity to join NASA  for this new chapter in space exploration.   Applications are being accepted through March 31 at www.USAJOBS.com.  U.S. citizens with a master's degree in a STEM field, 2 years of  related experience, and a passing physical exam are eligible to apply.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all eligible space lovers and travelers to  apply for this incredible opportunity.                            ____________________
