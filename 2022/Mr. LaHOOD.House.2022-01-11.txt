 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the life of former Peoria  City Clerk Mary Haynes, who passed away at the end of 2021. Mary Haynes  represented the best of Peoria.   In 1985, Mary was elected as the first woman Peoria city clerk. For  over 25 years, she made local government work better. Being the city  clerk was a passion of Mary's, and she was beloved by her colleagues.  She ensured transparency in city government and worked to educate other  city clerks throughout Illinois.   One of her most satisfying roles during her time as clerk was heading  up the Rediscovering City Hall project, which restored Peoria City Hall  to its monument form.   Above all, Mary was a devoted mother and grandmother and one of the  kindest people you could meet. She was a friend to everyone who knew  her, and her presence will be missed dearly in Peoria.   My prayers are with Mary's children, grandchildren, and loved ones.  May she rest in peace.                            ____________________
