 Mr. President, today I wish to speak on S. 994, the  Protecting Religiously Affiliated Institutions Act of 2018.   First, I want to thank Senator Hatch and the other supporters of the  bill. In particular, I would also like to thank the House sponsors of  the bill, Representatives Kustoff and Kilmer, for their work in  shepherding it through that chamber.   I am glad to see this bill finally enacted into law.   Early last year, a string of bomb threats to synagogues, mosques, and  other religious affiliated institutions, such as Jewish community  centers, threatened this Nation and one of its core constitutional  tenants: the free exercise of religion. In the wake of these threats,  the Judiciary Committee held a hearing on religious hate crimes.   Just 1 month after that hearing, two Islamic centers in northern  California were attacked during Ramadan. At the largest Sacramento  mosque, a burned Quran was also filled with bacon and handcuffed to a  fence. That mosque alone has been targeted multiple times.   Despicable acts like these have become far too common. The statistics  are startling. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, from  2014 to 2016, anti-Muslim hate crimes increased 99.4 percent, from 154  reported incidents to 307 reported incidents. There has also been a  rise in anti-Semitic incidents. The Anti-Defamation League reported  1,986 anti-Semitic incidents nationally in 2017, compared to 942 in  2015, an increase of 110 percent. We heard testimony in the Judiciary  Committee that this increase came after the dangerous rhetoric that was  used during the 2016 election cycle.   Unfortunately, this sort of persistent hateful rhetoric continues to  plague our Nation and our political discourse. This was made manifest  during a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville last summer that  culminated in a young woman losing her life.   The clear lesson is that all of us must strongly condemn hateful acts  and state in no uncertain terms that they have no place in our country.  This legislation is one way for us to do that. This bill updates the  Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996 to specifically prohibit threats of  force made against religious real property, including the property of  religiously affiliated institutions.  [[Page S6492]]    This update is critical because, while the current law prohibits the  destruction of religious real property, it did not previously specify  that threats against religious real property, such as threats of  violence against Jewish community centers, are also hate crimes.   Finally, while this bill addresses religious hate crimes, we must  remember that the motivations behind hate crimes extend far beyond  religion. It does not matter if it is a crime based on one's religion,  race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, or any other element of  our shared humanity.   I am hopeful that the Judiciary Committee can continue to work  together to protect all victims of hate, regardless of whom they are,  whom they love, where they worship, or where they are from. Thank you.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today the Royal Swedish Academy of  Sciences announced the awarding of the Nobel Prize in chemistry to  three outstanding scientists, Frances H. Arnold, George P. Smith, and  Gregory P. Winter, for using evolutionary principles to create new  enzymes. Their work marks a remarkable leap forward in human knowledge  and technology, and I salute these scientists on their honor.   The use of evolutionary techniques to create enzymes has led to new  developments in numerous fields, from health to biofuel technology.  Through the use of directed evolution, scientists and researchers have  been able to speed up the processes of nature and to tackle some of our  most challenging problems. These achievements would not have been  possible without the leadership of Dr. Arnold, Dr. Smith, and Sir  Gregory Winter.   Dr. Arnold hails from my home State of California and has worked as a  professor at the California Institute of Technology. I am proud of the  role that Caltech played in making this discovery possible. Dr. Arnold  received  [[Page S6494]]  her Ph.D. from the University California, Berkeley, and I thank her for  her contributions to the study of bioengineering and biochemistry.   On behalf of all Californians, I commend these three recipients on a  well-deserved honor and for all that they have done to advance human  knowledge of the power of evolutionary technology and bioengineering.  Let us hope that this discovery will continue to expand the horizon of  human knowledge and lead to new efforts in humanity's never-ending  quest for enlightenment.   Again, I congratulate these three distinguished scientists and their  families on this remarkable discovery and prestigious award.                            ____________________
