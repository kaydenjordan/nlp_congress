 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember  John D. Miller of Monticello, Illinois. He was a beloved public servant  and active community member who suddenly passed away last week.   After graduating from Monticello High School in 1971, John served in  the United States Army and later in the National Guard and the Army  Reserves. It was there that he began his career in law enforcement,  serving as a military police officer and an instructor.   His civilian service started with the Decatur Police Department  before he was named Argenta's chief of police. In 1995, he was  appointed to the same role with the Monticello Police Department, where  he went on to serve for 17 years until his retirement in 2012.   Throughout his tenure, he was known for his sense of justice, but  also his sense of compassion. In total, he dedicated 34 years of his  life to law enforcement.   In 2013, he once again answered the call to better his community, and  he was elected as an alderman on the Monticello City Council. In 2017,  he was reelected to a second 4-year term.   John lived his life in humble service to his friends and neighbors.  For so many, he was a role model and a mentor, and he will be truly  missed.   My prayers are with his wife, Karen, his children, and his  grandchildren.                         Congratulating Coach Jim Ott     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate Coach Jim Ott and the men's golf team at Illinois Wesleyan  University on their NCAA Division III national championship win last  month for the 13th straight year.   Illinois Wesleyan University has made it to the national  championship, but this year, they took home the trophy. When asked  about the win, Coach Ott said: ``The nice thing is it was such a team  effort.''   During the 3-day tournament, the Titans had led the scoreboard until  the final nine holes, when the second-place team caught their lead and  tied them.   Thanks to a 12-foot par putt on number 18 by junior Skylar LeVine and  a 15-foot par putt on the final hole by senior Drew Pershing, the team  secured their first-place ranking, earning them the title of national  champions.   Illinois Wesleyan's win also earned Coach Ott the Dave Williams  National Coach of the Year Award, presented by Golf Pride Grips. He has  been the men's golf coach for the Titans since 2000 and led Illinois  Wesleyan to eight wins in 11 tournaments this season. After coaching  the Titans for 19 years, he can finally boast a national championship  win.   Coach Ott has a lot to be proud of. I congratulate him and the entire  Titan golf team.                      Remembering the Life of Terry Todt     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember  Terry Todt. Terry was a friend and a beloved community member who  passed away on May 23.   Many of us in central Illinois grew up listening to Terry on the  radio. For the past 41 years, he was the man behind the microphone  announcing some of the most memorable moments in high school sports in  central Illinois.   Terry got his first transistor radio at the age of 7. In 1978, his  dream of becoming a broadcaster came true when he was hired by WSMI in  Litchfield, the radio station he had listened to on that transistor  radio while growing up.   Because of his excellence in sports announcing, he was inducted into  the media division of the Illinois Basketball Coaches Association Hall  of Fame, as well as many other distinctions.    But Terry's love for youth sports went far beyond his broadcasts:   For many years, he officiated basketball, baseball, and soccer with  the local sports association;   He was instrumental in expanding the Raymond Park District to add two  athletic fields, including a soccer field that was named in his honor;   Last year, he began the T. Todt Shootout, a basketball benefit that  raises money for the Montgomery County Cancer Association.   Terry left a lasting legacy that will long be remembered.   I remember meeting Terry in 1995, and he is just one of the most  genuine people anyone could have ever met. He was an iconic member of  the Raymond community, and he will be missed by many.   My prayers are with his wife, Brenda, their children, their  grandchildren, and everyone who knew my friend Terry Todt.                            ____________________
