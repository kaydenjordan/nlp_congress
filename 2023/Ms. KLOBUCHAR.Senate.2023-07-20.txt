 Mr. President, I rise to state my intention to include  the Afghan Adjustment Act as an amendment to the National Defense  Authorization Act.   This involved years of work. This bipartisan legislation is led with  Senator Graham, along with Senators Coons, Moran, Blumenthal,  Murkowski, Shaheen, Wicker, Durbin, Tillis, and Mullin. Those are just  the people who are cosponsoring this bill; and there are many others  who are supporting it on both sides of the aisle.   What is this about? Well, it is about our national security. It is  about a covenant--a covenant--that we have made and we must keep to  those who stand with us on the battlefield. This bill does right by  Afghans who worked alongside our troops and shows the world that the  United States of America, when we make a promise, we keep it.   Nearly 80,000 Afghans who sought refuge in our country are currently  in limbo. In just the last few weeks, one of them who was a translator  for our military, who was working two jobs to support his family, who  was living in legal limbo, was murdered--murdered--in the middle of the  night working as a Lyft driver.   Is that keeping our covenant? Is that keeping our promise?   Many of these people are those who risked their own lives and their  family's safety to protect our servicemembers. That is why this bill is  so strongly supported by the American Legion, by the VFW; and that is  why it has gotten support from people on both sides of the aisle.   These are people who are in our country right now. They are in our  country right now. What this bill does is it simply says that they will  be vetted but that we will also keep our promise to those who stood by  our military. Among them are translators and humanitarian workers, as  well as courageous members of the Afghan military who stood shoulder to  shoulder with our troops. They cannot go back. They would be killed. We  were right to help these people flee the Taliban and come to the United  States, and it now falls on us to help provide them with the stability  and the security they need to rebuild their lives here. So many of them  want to move on with their lives here in the United States of America,  a country that they stood with.   We have seen this before. We saw it with the Hmong and the Vietnamese  when they came to our country. And many of them now, who are they? They  are police officers, they are doctors, they are firefighters, they are  people who teach our kids. That is how this has worked in the past and  it has been successful and it will be successful now. The bipartisan  Afghan Adjustment Act creates a more efficient system for our Afghan  allies to apply for permanent legal status. It is provisional permanent  legal status.   The legislation makes the process more thorough, as I noted, by  requiring applicants to go through vetting that is just as rigorous as  the vetting they would have gone through if they came to the United  States as refugees, including an in-person interview, a standard that  eight--eight--eight former Donald Trump and George W. Bush  Administration national security officials called the ``gold standard''  of vetting. The gold standard of vetting.   Senator Graham and I worked closely with many Republicans--including  Senator Moran who has been so helpful  [[Page S3446]]  as ranking member of the Veterans' committee on this bill; including  Senator Wicker who is on this bill, the ranking member of Armed  Services--and the Department of Defense to strengthen the bill's  vetting provisions and to add language that responds to concerns. In  addition, the legislation updates a special immigrant Visa program to  include groups that should never have been excluded from the program in  the first place, including the female tactical teams of Afghanistan,  which did so much to support our troops. The entire purpose of the  Special Immigrant Visa program is to provide permanent residency to  those who have supported the United States abroad. And it is clear to  me that these brave women should also qualify.    The bill also requires the administration to implement a strategy for  supporting Afghans outside of the United States who are eligible for  SIV status and ensures that these applicants have a way to get  answers--answers--from the State Department about their applications.   The Afghan Adjustment Act, as I noted, is sponsored by a bipartisan  group of 11 cosponsors--with many more who are going to vote for it-- and has earned the backing of more than 60 organizations, including the  Veterans of Foreign Wars and the American Legion, as well as some of  our Nation's most revered military leaders, including Admirals Mike  Mullen, William McRaven, and James Stavridis; Generals Richard Myers of  the U.S. Air Force, Joseph Dunford from the U.S. Marine Corps, and Stan  McChrystal, from the U.S. Army.   Part of the reason we were able to build such a broad coalition for  our bill is because it is modeled after other bipartisan legislation  that Congress passed after previous armed conflicts. After the Vietnam  War, Congress passed a law, as I noted, that allowed thousands of  people to resettle in the U.S., including many Hmong refugees who now  call Minnesota home.   As I noted, they are such success stories. They are in the  legislature. They are farmers and bakers. They are builders and  inventors. They started families. Congress also acted similarly  following the Cuban revolution and the Iraq war to protect allies and  friends. In each instance, our country welcomed these immigrants and we  have benefited immeasurably from their contributions.   If we act to help our Afghan allies, just as we helped other allies,  we will continue this tradition of not leaving people behind--of  keeping our covenant.   Think of these stories.   A few months ago, I had a meeting with a group of Afghan women who  served in the Afghan National Army Female Tactical Platoon, including  one of the group's commanders, Mahnaz. Our troops heavily relied on the  platoon during the war. As our soldiers pursued missions hunting down  ISIS combatants on unforgiving terrain and freeing prisoners from the  grips of the Taliban, these women had their backs. The platoon worked  especially closely with our military's support team and facilitated  conversations between our soldiers and the Afghan women that they  crossed paths with in the field.   Mahnaz is now living in limbo. But some of her biggest advocates  fighting for her and her platoon to secure residency are the American  soldiers they served with. I know every one of my colleagues has heard  from American soldiers about these brave Afghans that served with our  soldiers.   In U.S. Army Captain Mary Kolars' words:         Mahnaz might as well be my sister. They've sacrificed for       their country and for ours. The bond between our two units is       pretty inseparable.    The deep respect is mutual. Mahnaz knows what her sacrifice cost her.  She is more than 6,000 miles from the place she once called home with  little hope of ever returning. She separated from so many of the people  she once shared her life with. But even knowing the cost of her  sacrifice, she says she would do it all again.   I am in absolute awe of her grit and her patriotism and the many  stories. I will be telling these stories every day throughout this  week, and I hope that we will come together and make sure that she and  so many other of these brave Afghans have a path in this country. It is  example after example of these stories.   Ahmad spent 4 years training to serve in the Afghan military. He was  selected for Afghanistan's elite aviation unit, which worked closely  with America's military in our fight against the Taliban. Reflecting on  his experience, he said:         In the face of danger, we were united, we were relentless,       we were resilient.    His helicopter was shot down--not once, but twice--but that didn't  diminish his resolve.   But his experience since the evacuation has been shattering. He now  lives in Alabama, thousands and thousands of miles away from his  family. He works two jobs to make ends meet and sends what he can back  to the loved ones he left behind. He knows full well that the  foundation he is building here in America could dissolve in a second if  he doesn't get some kind of provisional status, which this Congress can  grant, just as it did with the Vietnamese and the Hmong and after the  Iraq war and after the Cuban revolution. He was there for us in time of  need, and we must be there.    Another man--I am not going to reveal his name, and he asked that it  not be revealed because of his family back in Afghanistan--while he and  his wife and children were able to evacuate to the United States, he  lives in fear of the Taliban retaliating against his other loved ones  back in Afghanistan.   He served in the Afghan National Army for years and worked as a  liaison with our forces. He even trained in the United States,  graduating from the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College at Fort  Leavenworth, but Afghanistan was his home, and he always believed that  that was where he would remain. That changed when the Taliban seized  control. Fearing for his safety, he and his family rushed to the  airport in Kabul, weaving through countless Taliban checkpoints,  knowing that any wrong move would be their last.   Today, he is in Kansas, but he has anxiety for the people at home and  in not knowing if he, too, will be sent back.   Another story is of a man named Tashmorad. He is afraid the Taliban  will target his family if his name becomes public. That is why this  isn't really his name but is a name he asked to be used.   Back in his home country, he flew missions with the Afghan Air Force.  To use his words, his job was to ``capture the bad guys like al-Qaida  and Taliban.'' He had dreamt of flying since he first saw an Afghan  pilot make an emergency landing in his village when he was about 10  years old. When he found out that he would have to learn English to  fly, he started trying to teach himself from a book that he bought at a  local shop. He went on to earn a degree in language and culture, with a  focus on aviation, and then took part in flight training from our  military, from the U.S. military.   He then spent 10 years as a military pilot, where he flew as high as  25,000 feet, helping American soldiers identify Taliban positions in  the mountains of Afghanistan. He was stationed about 300 miles from his  family when the withdrawal began. His squadron leader ordered him to  fly back to support the evacuation. Even though it was getting dark, he  turned his airplane lights off to avoid being detected and shot down.  Because of his tact and his skill, he landed safely. His commanders  advised him not to leave the airport, but he knew he needed to see his  family. He made a brief trip home to his pregnant wife and kids and  said goodbye before he returned to join the airlift operation. That was  almost 2 years ago, and he hasn't seen his family since.   Today, he lives in Roanoke, VA. He delivers food to make extra money.  He works as a water technician. Every extra cent that he makes, he  sends back to his family. He still dreams of flying, but more than  that, he dreams of reuniting with his wife and kids. He dreams of  buying a two-bedroom house for his family, and he dreams of having a  safe and stable life in the country that he risked everything for.   There are more stories of two Afghan Air Force pilots and friends.  Their paths to become women pilots were hardly straightforward, but  through sheer persistence and skill, they both made it happen. The two  women were at aviation training in Dubai when the withdrawal began. In  an instant, their lives were turned upside down.  [[Page S3447]]    I ask you to imagine how you would feel if you were in a foreign  country, and you realized that you couldn't safely, all of a sudden,  return home. They knew that their careers put their loved ones at risk,  so they called their families and told them to round up their uniforms,  their pilot IDs, and their diplomas and burn them.   Hasina watched over a video call as her mom destroyed the evidence of  the life she had worked so hard to build. ``All my dreams were on  fire,'' she once reflected, ``and I was just watching.''   She arrived in the United States, she and her friend, with one  suitcase each. They began waiting tables at a strip mall in Fort Myers,  FL, hoping, one day, to return to the skies.   Those are just a few of the examples.   My colleagues, there are 80,000 of those stories--80,000 of those  stories--and we have a covenant to keep. You talk to any soldier who  served over in Afghanistan, and they will have stories to tell. It is  our job to uphold the promises that were made to those who served with  us, because if we don't uphold those promises, what do you think is  going to happen the next time we ask others to serve with our own  military?   I am so proud that we have such strong bipartisan support for this  amendment, that we have those in the Senate who have worked on these  issues for so long in supporting this. I am convinced that when we have  the vote on this amendment, we will finally be able to put our heads up  proudly and say our covenant has been kept.   I yield the floor.
