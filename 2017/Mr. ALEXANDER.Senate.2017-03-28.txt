 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Strange). Without objection, it is so  ordered.                          Nomination of Neil Gorsuch     Mr. President, redundancy is often a virtue, so I am  about to practice redundancy.   Last week, I made a speech on the floor of the Senate about the  upcoming votes in connection with the President's nomination of Neil  Gorsuch to be Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United  States, and I talked about the 230-year history of this body to always  have Presidential nominations for judges--for Supreme Court Justices,  for Federal district judges, and for circuit judges up to 2003 by a  majority vote. Never in the history of this body has the Senate refused  to allow a vote, an up-or-down vote on a Supreme Court Justice.   Because I hear that may be what the Democrats are planning to do-- even though Mr. Gorsuch may be one of the most remarkably talented  nominees in a long, long time--I want to make the address that I made  last week again, and I am going to deliver it word for word in hopes  that someone may actually hear it.   President Trump's nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be a member of  the U.S. Supreme Court will be considered on the floor of the Senate  next week. Some have suggested that instead of allowing a majority of  Senators to decide whether to approve the Gorsuch nomination, there  should first be a so-called cloture vote to determine whether to cut  off debate.   Now, you can see what would happen. Cutting off debate requires the  approval of 60 Senators. There are 46 Democratic Senators, so if 41 of  the 46 Democrat Senators vote not to cut off debate, we would never get  to a vote on Judge Gorsuch. We would never get to a vote. In other  words, the 41 Democratic Senators would have filibustered to death the  Gorsuch nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States, a  partisan act that has never happened before in the 230 years of the  Senate.   Filibustering to death the Gorsuch nomination or any Presidential  nomination, for that matter, flies in the face of 230 years of Senate  tradition.   Throughout the Senate's history, approval of even the most  controversial Presidential nominations have required only a majority  vote. For example, in 1991, President George H.W. Bush nominated  Clarence Thomas to be Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme  [[Page S2037]]  Court. The debate was bitter. The vote was narrow. The Senate confirmed  Justice Thomas 52 to 48.   Although Senate rules have allowed any one Senator to try to  filibuster the nomination to death, to insist on a 60-vote vote, not  one did. In fact, Senate rules have always allowed Senators the option  to filibuster to death a Presidential nomination, yet it has almost  never happened.   According to the former Senate historian, with one possible  exception, which I will describe later, the number of Supreme Court  Justices in our country's history who have been denied their seats by  filibuster is zero. The number of the President's Cabinet members in  our country's history who have been denied their seats by a filibuster  is zero. The number of Federal district judges in our country's history  who have been denied their seats by a filibuster is zero. I know that  for a fact because an attempt was made to filibuster one--Judge  McConnell from Rhode Island--and I voted against that, as did other  Republican Senators, because we thought it was wrong to break the  Senate's 230-year tradition of always considering judges by majority  vote, and we prevailed.   We could have done it, but we didn't do it. That is the point.   Next week, the Democrats can filibuster Judge Gorsuch to death, but  they shouldn't do it. They shouldn't do it.   Until 2003, the number of circuit judges in our country's history who  have been denied their seats by filibuster was zero.   Senator Everett Dirksen did not filibuster President Lyndon Johnson's  nominees. Senator Robert Byrd did not filibuster President Reagan's  nominees. Senator Howard Baker did not filibuster President Carter's  nominees. Senator Bob Dole did not filibuster President Clinton's  nominees.   During most of the 20th century, when one party controlled the White  House and the Senate 70 percent of the time, the minority never  filibustered to death a single Presidential nomination.   On the other hand, there have been plenty of filibusters on  legislation--so many that in 1917, the Senate adopted the so-called  cloture rule as a way to end filibusters. The idea is, after you talk  enough, you should bring it to an end, so they had a supermajority for  that purpose. The rule was amended in 1949, 1959, 1975, 1979, and  1986--always in response to filibusters on legislation, never on  nominations. It was the 1975 change that established the current  cloture standard of 60 votes to end debate, except on amendments to the  Standing Rules.    Filibustering a Presidential nomination has always been treated  differently than filibustering a legislative matter. The filibuster of  legislation is perhaps the Senate's most famous characteristic. It has  been called ``democracy's finest show, the right to talk your head  off.''   As the actor Jimmy Stewart says in the movie ``Mr. Smith Goes to  Washington'': ``Wild horses aren't going to drag me off this floor  until those people have heard everything I've got to say, even if it  takes all winter.'' That was Jimmy Stewart talking about his  filibuster.   The late Robert Byrd described the importance of a legislative  filibuster in this way in his last speech to the Senate: ``Our Founding  Fathers intended the Senate to be a continuing body that allows for  open and unlimited debate and protection of minority rights. Senators  have understood this since the Senate first convened.''   In fact, the whole idea of the Senate is not to have a majority rule  on legislation. Throughout Senate history, the purpose of the  legislative filibuster has been to force consensus on issues, to force  there to be a group of Senators on either side who have to respect one  another's views so they work together and produce 60 votes on important  matters. We did that last December in a piece of legislation that the  majority leader called the most important legislation of the Congress,  the 21st Century Cures Act. There were enormous differences of opinion  about it, but because Senator Murray, the ranking Democrat and I, and  the Democrats and Republicans in the Senate and in the House, and  President Obama and Vice President Biden all wanted a result, we formed  a consensus. We resolved our differences, and we agreed on this most  important piece of legislation that will help virtually every American  family by advancing cures for cancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes, and a  variety of diseases.   Nominations have always been treated differently from legislation.  For example, under Senate rule XIV, any Senator can bring legislation  directly to the Calendar of General Orders, bypassing committees. There  is no such power for nominations. There is no rule XIV for nominations.  Senate rules allow debate and, therefore, the possibility of filibuster  on a motion to proceed to legislation. Debate is not allowed on a  motion to proceed to nominations. So there can't be a filibuster on a  motion to proceed to a nomination. In summary, while Senate rules have  always allowed for extended debate or filibusters, the filibuster was  never used to block a nomination until recently.   As I mentioned earlier, it was never used to block a Cabinet  nomination, never used to block a Federal district judge, until 2003,  never used to block a Federal circuit judge, and never used to block a  Supreme Court Justice, with one possible exception. The exception  occurred in 1968 when President Lyndon Johnson sought to elevate  Associate Justice Abe Fortas to be Chief Justice. There was bipartisan  opposition to that idea. When it became clear that the Senate majority  would not agree, President Johnson engineered a 45-43 cloture vote so  that Fortas could save face and appear to have won something, according  to the former Senate Historian. Fortas then asked the President to  withdraw the nomination.   Other than that, never has a Supreme Court nominee been filibustered  to death in the Senate. Other than the Fortas nomination, the  filibuster was never used to block any judicial nomination until 2003  and 2004, when Democrats for the first time decided to use the 60-vote  cloture requirement to block 10 of President George W. Bush's nominees.  I had just arrived in the Senate. I remember it well. I was really  outraged by it because, as for the nominees, it was the right of the  President to name them and the right of the Senate to reject them. But  throughout history it was always by 51 votes. This unprecedented action  by the Senate Democrats produced a threat by Republicans to change the  Senate rules to make it clear that only a majority is required to  approve a Presidential nomination. There was a negotiation, and  eventually five of Bush's nominees were approved, five were blocked,  and the rules weren't changed.   Then in 2011 and 2013, Republicans returned the favor. That happens  around here--a precedent set by that side then becomes a precedent that  this side, then, undertakes. In 2011 and 2013, the Republicans returned  the favor by seeking to block five of President Obama's nominees for  the circuit court by insisting on a 60-vote cloture on each.  Republicans alleged the President was trying to pack the Federal  Circuit Court of the District of Columbia with three liberal justices.  To overcome Republican objections, the Democrats invoked the so-called  nuclear option. They broke the Senate rules to change the rules. The  new rule eliminated the possibility of 60-vote cloture motions for all  Presidential nominations except for the Supreme Court, which is where  we are today.   There have been other examples of minority Senators filibustering  nominations to death, all of them during the last three administrations  and all involving sub-Cabinet nominations. Then, of course, there have  been delays in considering nominations.   My own nomination in 1991 as U.S. Education Secretary was delayed for  51 days--I thought improperly--by a Democratic Senator. President  Reagan's nomination of Ed Meese as Attorney General of the United  States was delayed 1 year by a Democratic Senate. No one has ever  disputed our right in the Senate, regardless of who was in charge, to  use our constitutional duty of advice and consent to delay and examine  and sometimes to cause nominations to be withdrawn or even to defeat  nominees by a majority vote.   But, as we approach the vote next week on Neil Gorsuch on the floor  of the Senate, it is useful to remember that the tradition of the  Senate has been to treat legislative matters one way and Presidential  nominations a different way: to filibuster to death  [[Page S2038]]  legislation, yes; to filibuster to death Presidential nominations, no.   Should the Gorsuch nomination come to the floor soon, as I believe it  will, overwhelming Senate tradition requires that whether to approve it  should be decided by a majority vote and there should be no attempt by  the minority to filibuster the nomination, especially of such a  qualified man.   I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
