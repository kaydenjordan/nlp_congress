 Mr. Speaker, this has been a bipartisan effort. It has  been good. We made some progress. I want to say a few things, though.   I am proud to be a cosponsor of the SELF DRIVE Act. This legislation  puts us on a path towards safely deploying autonomous vehicles. I am  glad to see that it has strong bipartisan support.   Autonomous vehicles offer many benefits, including tremendous  lifesaving potential. Approximately 40,000 people are killed on our  highways every year in deadly automobile accidents. About 3,600 of  those accidents took place in my home State of California.   AVs can also transform mobility for millions of people who otherwise  face difficulty driving, such as seniors and those with disabilities,  including 3.8 million veterans in our country living with service- connected disabilities. That is more than 17 percent of veterans in  this country.   AVs can help connect underserved communities, as well as reduce  traffic congestion on our roads, and increase our Nation's productivity  and competitiveness in the global economy.   While I am glad that we are taking these steps for this legislation  today, our work cannot stop here. As the technology evolves, we must  ensure that the benefits are being maximized for consumers. This means  making sure that the vehicles are safely and appropriately tested, that  strong consumer privacy and cybersecurity protections are in place, and  that we are fully preparing Americans for the new employment  opportunities that this industry will create.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R.  3440, the DREAM Act, to protect DREAMers like Felipe, who works at  Microsoft Bing, Skype, and at Doppler Labs, a San Francisco startup.
