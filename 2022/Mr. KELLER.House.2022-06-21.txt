 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time and  for his hard work.   Mr. Speaker, it has been a year-and-a-half of President Biden and  Washington Democrats' disastrous tax-and-spend policies, and American  families are feeling the effects of rising inflation in their  paychecks, at the gas pumps, and in the grocery store.   Instead of working to eliminate wasteful government spending, the  President's 2023 budget calls for the highest sustained spending burden  in American history, $73 trillion over 10 years, all at the expense of  our children and grandchildren, who will be forced to pay for this  outrageous spending and debt.   Going to Speaker Pelosi's ``Show me your budget, and I will show you  what you value,'' I have my granddaughter with me tonight. I value her  future. I value the fact that she is not going to have to pay for this  spending, that she will be able to keep more of the money she earns  instead of having the government take it to pay for Speaker Pelosi's  and President Biden's liberal agenda.   The Republican Study Committee's budget is a departure from  Democrats' irresponsible policies and a return to fiscal sanity for  American families.   Republicans have built a comprehensive plan that balances the Federal  budget in just 7 years, works to eliminate waste, and enables Americans  to keep more of their hard-earned money.   Growing up in America, raising a family, and running a business  taught me that budgets matter.   After reading President Biden's 2023 budget, it is clear he doesn't  have a clue on how to budget responsibly. It is time we stop leaving  financial disaster for the next generation.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Hern and my colleagues on the  Republican Study Committee for their work in putting forth a  responsible budget that meets the needs of the American people, places  the American people first, and doesn't cater to the wishes of Joe Biden  and Nancy Pelosi.
