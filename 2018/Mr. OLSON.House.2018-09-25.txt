 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 1320) to amend the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990  related to Nuclear Regulatory Commission user fees and annual charges,  and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1320         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Nuclear Utilization of       Keynote Energy Act''.       SEC. 2.

SEC. 9. REPORT ON STUDY RECOMMENDATIONS.         Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this       Act, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission shall submit to       Congress a report on the status of addressing and       implementing the recommendations contained in the memorandum       of the Executive Director of Operations of the Commission       entitled ``Tasking in Response to the Assessment of the       Considerations Identified in a `Study of Reprisal and       Chilling Effect for Raising Mission-Related Concerns and       Differing Views at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission' '' and       dated June 19, 2018 (ADAMS Accession No.: ML18165A296).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1320, the Nuclear Utilization of Keynote Energy Act  is a bipartisan bill. The NUKE Act, as it is known, was sponsored by my  Energy and Commerce friends, Adam Kinzinger from Illinois and Mike  Doyle from Pennsylvania. The bill went through regular order in the  committee. With only one single amendment, it went through the full  committee by a voice vote.   The NUKE Act makes targeted reforms to the Nuclear Regulatory  Commission. It reforms the fee structure, which, at present, threatens  to increase the financial burden of our Nation's nuclear fleet, nuclear  suppliers, and those working on cutting-edge technology. This will be  critical in the coming years as a large number of reactors are taken  out of service.   The bill also streamlines some of the licensing steps and other rules  at the NRC. It means Congress will get useful information for oversight  so we can find even more steps to keep the NRC on track. We need to  make sure the old rules on nuclear power, dating back as far as the  1960s, still makes sense today.   Overall, H.R. 1320 will help the nuclear industry with more clear and  straightforward rules. And in doing so, average Americans and  companies, large and small, will benefit. Nuclear technology can be  part of the future for industry, medicine, and clean energy. Nuclear  power is unique. It is the only baseload power we have that has no  hydrocarbon emissions, zero. We also make sure that global leadership  on nuclear power stays right here in America. That is important not  just for jobs but for our national security.   There is no question that nuclear power in America is flying into a  headwind, but there is also no question that the industry provides  important and sometimes underappreciated benefits to America. Congress  can help lighten the burden while still making nuclear power the safest  in the industry.   H.R. 1320 is a key piece of this effort to ensure we have a robust  nuclear industry going forward. I urge my colleagues to support this  bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Walden), the chairman of the full Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Kinzinger), the author of the bill.    Madam Speaker, the ranking member of the full committee  said it just perfectly: Support this bill. It is a good bipartisan  bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
