 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  outstanding work of one of my congressional classmates, now one of my  closest friends here, Congresswoman Cindy Axne.   In 2018, less than 100 years after women gained the right to vote, we  were elected as part of the largest class ever of women elected to the  House--a record we broke again 2 years later. Breaking the glass  ceiling was just the start.   Cindy Axne is a true trailblazer. No issue is too big or small. As a  fellow mom in Congress and a lifelong education advocate, I have seen  Cindy's passion for the next generation. Even before her time in  Congress, as a mom at local school board meetings, Cindy fought to make  real change and to promote education equity with the implementation of  full-day kindergarten across her children's school district. That  passion and can-do character has followed her to Congress, too.   Congresswoman Cindy Axne is a rare breed here on Capitol Hill.  Bipartisanship is a word many of us use here in Congress, but few of us  can back it up quite like Cindy. Her energy and enthusiasm are endless,  and I have seen firsthand how she brings it to her work here in  Washington.   As the lone Federal Democrat from the Hawkeye State, she has taken  that Iowa-nice attitude to a whole new level--working with anyone,  Democrat or Republican, to get the job done.   Las Vegas, Nevada, and Des Moines, Iowa, may be looking a little bit  different, but Cindy and I have worked together to find common ground  that transcends partisanship and works for every single American.   As the tallest woman in Congress--although Representative Lori Trahan  might have a point of order on that--she also bears one of the tallest  lists of accomplishments in her time in this House.   She personally helped her constituents recover from catastrophic  flooding. She led the charge to keep our communities safe with the  Invest to Protect Act. Cindy led the charge to tackle inflation with  the Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act, as well.   Her legacy for Iowa lives on in the millions of dollars that she has  brought home for her constituents, in the legislation she has fought to  get across the finish line, and in all of us fighting to end  the divisiveness and to bring the collective spirit of compromise to  Congress.    I thank Cindy for everything--for her leadership, for her unwavering  spirit, and, most importantly, for her friendship.                            ____________________
