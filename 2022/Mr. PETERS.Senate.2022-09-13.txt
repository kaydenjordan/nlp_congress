 Mr. President, while returning to Washington, DC, on  September 12, my flight was temporarily grounded by inclement weather,  delaying my return to Washington, DC. As a result, I was unable to  attend the vote on the confirmation of Executive Calendar No. 986,  Salvador Mendoza, Jr., of Washington, to be United States Circuit Judge  for the Ninth Circuit.   I would have voted yea on the confirmation had I been able to attend  the vote.                            ____________________
