 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to praise the work of the  Military Order of the Purple Heart and, specifically, chapter 717.   My friends and neighbors there who serve in this chapter are working  to erect a monument on the Treasure Coast of Florida to those who were  injured in battle while defending our great Nation. They may have been  targeted by a sniper, a victim of an improvised explosive device, or  they may have been charging a hill somewhere in Vietnam.   The marker that they have worked to erect at Indian Riverside Park in  Martin County will bring awareness and recognition to the true cost of  freedom, which is the blood that is shed by selfless men and women who  have served across the world in defense of  [[Page H5766]]  others because of their sense of duty to America.   I thank all members of the Military Order of the Purple Heart for  never forgetting and never for one second taking for granted the price  paid by our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and coastguardsman.   May God bless the work they are doing.                            Alzheimer's Awareness     Mr. Speaker, I rise today so that we think about the over 5  million Americans, including thousands of Floridians and nearly half a  million American veterans, who are living with Alzheimer's and  dementia.   Alzheimer's is the only one of the top 10 causes of death that cannot  be prevented, cannot be cured, and cannot be slowed. As the sixth  leading cause of death in Florida, and with so many affected by this  incurable disease, we have to continue to stress the importance of  early diagnosis and the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and related  illnesses.   But awareness is never enough. As a member of the Congressional Task  Force on Alzheimer's Disease, I am determined to make progress for all  those affected. We must act proactively to achieve breakthroughs in  prevention and treatment. We also have to act to ensure that those who  currently have Alzheimer's have the tools that are needed to manage  their symptoms, reduce pain, and increase comfort.   Nearly half of all people with Alzheimer's and other dementias are in  hospice care at the time of their passing, but less than half of  nursing homes have some sort of palliative care program. For people  with advanced dementia, palliative care improves their quality of life,  controls costs, and enhances both patient and family satisfaction.   As the demand for this kind of care grows with the aging population,  more has to be done to ensure that there is a workforce equipped to  provide that care. That is why I recently signed onto the Palliative  Care and Hospice Education and Training Act, a bipartisan bill that  will help our Nation's seniors who are struggling with the effects of  Alzheimer's.   I have spoken to a few Members in this House who have not been  touched by this serious illness in one way or another. Whether they  have been impacted personally, supported a loved one during a tough  time, or prayed for a friend who needed help, we all know how difficult  that situation is.   This is a great bill. I urge my fellow colleagues to think back to  that person that they have known and how much this could have benefited  them.   Mr. Speaker, let us take some decisive action to help patients with  Alzheimer's and their families. Let's pass this bill.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, on rollcall No. 369, I mistakenly voted ``no''  when I intended to vote ``yes.''                     Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. Gosar     Mr. Chairman, I rise today because veteran suicide is an  epidemic. Nearly every week, I hear from a veteran who is thinking  about taking their own life--maybe walking into their garage, turning  on their car, and never coming out.   That is why I introduced the Oath of Exit, and why I urge you to pass  this bill as a part of the National Defense Authorization Act. The bill  creates a voluntary operation oath for members of the Armed Forces with  a specific aim of reducing veteran suicide.   The idea for this bill came from friends of mine who have struggled  with suicidal thoughts since leaving the military--people like my  friend Boone; people who have actually been there on the edge.   I think we all know that, throughout our lives, the most important  commitments that we make are spoken--  [[Page H5817]]  whether it is an oath upon joining the military, the vows at our  wedding, or saying the Pledge of Allegiance--and this verbal commitment  to reach out to a brother- or sister-in-arms is important, as well.   Mr. Chairman, integrity is more than a word to a servicemember. So,  if we commit that we will reach out to a brother or a sister because we  need help, then we will do it.
