 Madam President, throughout all of human history, in  every generation, there are a handful of people who rise to the level  of greatness. Despite adversity, danger, and sometimes impossible odds,  these great men and women fight for what is right and push our society  forward and make America better for the next generation. That has been  true for the last 230 years.   Representative John Lewis in our generation, who just passed away  last week, was certainly the embodiment of this type of greatness. John  was a titan in the struggle for civil rights and the equality of all  races. Because of him, more Americans can enjoy their God-given rights  to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.   John's lifelong fight against injustice began at a very young age, as  we now know. When his local library banned African Americans from  checking out books, a teenaged John Lewis wrote a petition requesting  and demanding equal access.   From that point forward, John Lewis never backed down from the fight  for what is right. He always remained peaceful, despite receiving  physical violence and going to jail for his protests.   His commitment to nonviolence served as a guiding force in John's  life. He founded the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to fight  for nonviolent resistance across America.   In 1961, he participated in the Freedom Rides to protest segregation  in public transportation.   John's determination for equal rights only grew stronger and more  effective over time. At age 23, he was one of the ``Big Six'' leaders  of the March on Washington where Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., shared  his dream for a better future for everyone.   Later, John bravely marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma,  AL, where he was beaten in what was called Bloody Sunday.   The efforts of John Lewis and others finally paid off with the  passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. That bill gave African  Americans the right to fully participate in our democratic Republic. It  pushed our country forward.   That incredible victory may seem like the end of John's struggle for  equal rights. In reality, it was just the beginning. For the rest of  his life, John Lewis never lost sight of what the real fight involved.   During his time in the Atlanta City Council and later in Congress, he  never gave up the fight for justice.   Today, our country is mourning a hero, a truly great American, and a  great Georgian.   As we continue to say our good-byes, we should also take this time to  reflect on John Lewis's life and what he stood for. We should take this  as a call to action to continue the effort to which he dedicated his  life.   The stain of injustice still marks our country. Just this year, there  have been horrible tragedies that have shaken all of us to our core.  Though John Lewis is no longer with us, we can still carry on his  legacy.   As if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 660, submitted earlier today,  and that the text be read in full.    Madam President, I further ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, the Senate vote on the  motion to invoke cloture on the Kan nomination at 11:30 a.m. tomorrow;  further, that if cloture is invoked on the Kan nomination, the  postcloture time expire at 2:45 p.m. tomorrow; further, that the  cloture motion with respect to the Kaplan nomination ripen following  disposition of the Kan nomination and, if cloture is invoked on the  Kaplan nomination, the postcloture time expire at 4:45 p.m. tomorrow. I  further ask that if either of the nominations are confirmed, the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and  the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action. Finally,  I ask unanimous consent that the cloture motion with respect to the  McFerran nomination ripen at 11:30 a.m., Thursday, July 30; and that if  cloture is invoked on the McFerran nomination, the postcloture time  expire at 1:30 p.m. Thursday; and that if confirmed, the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the President  be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  rollcall votes scheduled for 2:30 p.m. today begin now.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, the word ``bipartisanship'' gets tossed  around a lot in this town. Unfortunately, we don't often see  bipartisanship put into action. However, as we have faced an  unprecedented crisis recently, I believe we have seen the Senate prove  that it can, in fact, get it done. People can come together, and real,  bipartisan solutions can actually happen in this body.   It is actually encouraging to me--and it is simply a function of what  I have known since I was a kid--that Americans deal with a crisis  better than anyone else. In many ways, we put things aside, and we get  together for what is good for the people back home.   Since the COVID-19 crisis began, we have passed three phases of  relief packages to help our country weather this COVID-19 storm. In  these three phases, we ramped up testing in support of our healthcare  workers, we helped Americans who are struggling financially, and we  created the Paycheck Protection Program, which has saved millions of  jobs and many businesses. Today, as we debate a fourth COVID-19 relief  package, it is absolutely critical that we continue to find common  ground and bipartisan solutions to bring our country together again.   The Healthcare Workforce Resilience Act is a real, bipartisan  solution to a serious problem our country faces today in our healthcare  delivery system. This bill is first and foremost a healthcare bill that  will help our hospitals deal with this COVID-19 crisis. It is  absolutely critical that we include it in the next COVID-19 relief  package.   Today in America, many communities are facing severe shortages of  doctors and nurses. Particularly, hospitals and clinics in rural areas  and communities of color are badly understaffed and are struggling to  fill crucial positions.   My home State of Georgia has been especially impacted by this  particular crisis. While Georgia is the 8th largest State by  population, it ranks 39th in the number of active physicians per  capita--39th. Over half of Georgia's 159 counties have been designated  as primary care health professional shortage areas. The Georgia  Department of Public Health has stated that Georgia's nursing shortage  is a full-blown crisis. This is also true in most other States,  actually. They have warned that Georgia is not able to recruit the  nurses or doctors our hospitals need. But we can change that.   The COVID-19 crisis did not start this shortage of healthcare  workers, by the way, but it has exacerbated it dramatically.   Since the beginning of this crisis, I have held conference calls with  thousands of constituents across Georgia over the last 4\1/2\ months. I  have heard directly from healthcare workers who have explained the dire  situation they are facing. Nurses and doctors are working longer hours.  Retirees are being asked to come back to work. Many healthcare workers  have contracted the virus themselves. In fact,  [[Page S4527]]  one study found that healthcare workers account for nearly one in five  COVID-19 cases.   In many areas, hospitals have simply not had enough staff to handle  the COVID-19 patient increase. Albany, GA, was one of the first hardest  hit areas in the country, right there in South Georgia. At one point,  nurses and doctors from all over the country had to be flown in just to  take care of all those who fell ill in Albany. In many cases, patients  had to be exported to other hospitals in the State.   As this virus continues to spread, many hospitals are in danger of  being overwhelmed as we see this recent surge of COVID-19 cases,  particularly in our younger people.   Healthcare workers have been true heroes--there is no question about  that. Right now, we have an opportunity to give them the support they  desperately need. The Healthcare Workforce Resilience Act is a  bipartisan solution that gives our hospitals the support they need to  get through this crisis. Our bill simply recaptures unused green cards  to give highly skilled, foreign-born nurses and doctors the opportunity  to work in our country and help solve this crisis. It will recapture  approximately 25,000 unused visas for nurses and 15,000 unused visas  for doctors. This bill would cut redtape and give our hospitals  critical support quickly as America continues to reopen our economy. It  will ease the pressure on healthcare providers and help save American  lives.   I want to emphasize that this bill will not increase current legal  immigration limits, displace American workers, or negatively impact  healthcare worker wages.   I have always been a supporter of a merit-based immigration system,  and many people on the other side of the aisle are as well. We all  continue to work in that direction. We believe that a merit-based  immigration system can strengthen our economy and protect American jobs  at the same time. This is a policy that President Trump and the  majority of Congress have long supported--on both sides of the aisle,  actually. The Healthcare Workforce Resilience Act is fully aligned with  these merit-based policies.   These immigrant nurses and doctors have already been hired and  approved to work in our country. Many of them live here already. The  only thing preventing them from saving lives is bureaucratic redtape  and the backlog it creates. These folks are highly skilled, well  qualified, and extremely motivated to be on the frontlines in the fight  against COVID-19. They are all ready to go in the areas that need the  most help.   This bill is truly bipartisan. I am very proud to say that today. It  has 36 cosponsors from both parties. I give the lead sponsor on the  Democratic side, my friend from Illinois, Senator Durbin, a lot of  credit for that. He has long been a champion for this sort of help in  this area. This bill reflects what the American people want. It  provides what our healthcare system needs. It has bipartisan support.   Actually, in 2005, Congress passed a similar bill. That bill  recaptured unused visas and helped address a nursing shortage that  existed at the time across the country. It passed with overwhelming and  nearly unanimous support. The coronavirus has put our country in a  similar position today. There is no time to wait. The deeper our nurse  and doctor shortage gets, the more Americans we are needlessly putting  at risk.   President John F. Kennedy once said: ``In a time of domestic crisis,  men of goodwill and generosity should be able to unite regardless of  party or politics.'' I don't think that comment has been any more  timely than it is today in the midst of this crisis.   We are indeed in a time of crisis. We have already shown that we can  unite and find meaningful solutions. It is time to do it again. Let's  get this bill across the finish line and support our healthcare workers  and save lives in America.   Madam President, I yield the floor to my colleague from Illinois,  Senator Durbin, the lead Democratic cosponsor on the Healthcare  Workforce Resilience Act, and I want to thank him for his tireless  efforts in this regard and his strong leadership to help the young men  and women on the frontlines of our healthcare delivery system.
