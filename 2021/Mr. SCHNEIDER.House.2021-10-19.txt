 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of a bold build back  better agenda that invests in addressing climate change, grows our  economy, invests in children and education, and makes sure that every  American has healthcare. We face a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and  we have to move forward.   We have to invest in our children, and we cannot allow for an  obstinate few to threaten to squander any of this for their own vanity.   We have to come together to find a center path forward. It is not  this side or that side, but it is, rather, let's work together for  progress that improves the security and the prosperity of the people we  represent.   Already, we have seen the immense good that policies like the  expanded monthly child tax credit can do. The child tax credit is  slashing child poverty.   I recently spoke with Amanda Douglas, a single mother in my district  with two young children, Axel and Avery. With the child tax credit,  Amanda said that she no longer feels unbearable stress on a daily  basis, that she is able to pay her bills and provide for her sons. So  for Amanda, Axel, and Avery, for every family striving to realize the  American Dream, we need to be investing in our families and young  people to ensure that every child has the opportunities they deserve,  not playing political games or holding people's futures hostage.                            ____________________
