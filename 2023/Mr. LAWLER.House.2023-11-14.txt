 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, today, I rise to urge the House to adopt my  amendment, which would strip colleges and universities of Federal  funding if they authorize, facilitate, provide funding for, or  otherwise support any event promoting anti-Semitism on their campuses.   In the wake of the horrific October 7 attack on Israel, we have seen  a startling rise of anti-Semitism in our country and across the globe.   On college campuses, we have seen students carrying signs, pins, or  flags supporting Israel be violently attacked. This kind of behavior,  and colleges and universities condoning it, is abhorrent.   As I have said before, the U.S. Constitution grants people the right  to say what they want, but that doesn't mean that the taxpayers should  be paying for it, especially not at a time when the scourge of anti- Semitism is yet again on the rise.   From 2020 to 2021, anti-Semitic hate crimes increased by 20 percent.  From 2021 to 2022, anti-Semitic incidents in the United States rose by  36 percent. This year, anti-Semitic incidents have skyrocketed.   I have people living in my district who are scared to go to their  synagogues on the weekend for fear of being attacked. It is wholly and  totally unacceptable.  [[Page H5832]]    This disturbing trend cannot be allowed to continue, and it is  incumbent upon each of us to speak out and denounce anti-Semitism  wherever it rears its ugly head. That starts by refusing to subsidize  this hate on college campuses.   It is a simple concept: If you want to maintain your Federal funding  or student aid, don't hold events that peddle in the same anti-Semitic  tropes embraced by the enemies of Israel and America throughout the  world who want nothing short of the destruction of both.   People chanting ``glory to the martyrs'' and praising the resistance  of Hamas are objectively partaking in horrific anti-Semitism, praising  the largest slaughter of Jews since the Holocaust. Chanting ``from the  river to the sea'' is calling for the eradication of Israel. It is  vile. It is wrong. It is unacceptable. This amendment serves colleges  and universities notice that it will not be tolerated.   Madam Chair, this morning we watched a video that was the raw footage  of the terrorist attack on October 7--women, children, babies were  slaughtered. Hamas terrorists were joyful with glee. One terrorist  called their parents to brag about slaughtering 10 Jews with their bare  hands.   Why?   Because at a young age in Gaza, in the West Bank, they are taught to  hate Jews, taught that killing Jews is acceptable.   Here in the United States of America, college campuses, universities  are teaching that anti-Semitism is okay, that calling for the  eradication of Israel is okay.                                time  2130    Anti-Semitic hate is at the root of the terrorism that we are seeing,  and it must stop. People have the right to free speech. They have the  right to voice their opinions, but we do not have to pay for it. If  colleges and universities don't have the courage to crack down on this  crap, then they should be defunded.   Frankly, I question the judgment of anybody who would vote against  this. Taxpayer money should never be used to fund hate.   Madam Chair, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, today, I rise in support of my amendment No.  146 to the Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill, which increases  funding for the Head Start program.   Head Start is a critical program that provides comprehensive early  childhood education, health nutrition, and parental involvement  services to low-income children and families.   My district alone has almost a dozen Head Start locations, each  providing crucial services to families in Rockland, Westchester,  Putnam, and Dutchess Counties, which is why it is so critical that we  continue to provide robust funding for Head Start.   My amendment does just that, increasing funding to the Head Start  program by $100 million and ensuring that this critical service has the  support that it needs.   As a father of a young daughter, I am seeing just how inquisitive and  curious she is, and I know that there are tens of thousands of children  like her in my district who would benefit from an early childhood  development program. That doesn't even include the tens of millions of  children who have benefited from the program's existence across the  Nation.   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to support amendment No. 146 and show  the American people that we want to build on the successes of Head  Start.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I would remind the gentlewoman from  Connecticut there is a reason she is the ranking member and not the  chair, and it is because when her party was in complete control of  Washington, they spent $5 trillion in new spending in just 2 years. The  American people elected a House Republican majority to govern, to rein  in much of the spending that occurred in the prior 2 years.   I believe the Head Start program is critical, which is why I have put  forth an amendment to increase the funding  [[Page H5854]]  by $100 million. According to the gentlewoman's statements, she is  opposed to taking $100 million from the management account of the  Department of Education because we need to make sure that we have  bureaucrats, rather than providing the funding for disadvantaged  children across this country.   My objective is to make sure that the money that we spend actually  goes into our communities rather than Washington, D.C., and the  bureaucracy that has been created here.   I think this amendment is important. I thank the gentlewoman for  acknowledging she does not believe we should increase the funding  further by opposing this amendment. She thinks we should spend the $100  million on bureaucrats rather than the children. I thank her for  acknowledging that.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, clearly the gentlewoman hasn't met a dollar  that she doesn't like to spend.   We don't have a revenue problem in Washington, D.C. In fact, our  revenue is at its highest levels ever.   This is not an issue of revenue; it is an issue of spending.   In the prior 2 years, in the prior Congress, the Democrat majority  increased spending by $5 trillion in 2 years in new spending. It is  unsustainable. It is why we have dealt with record inflation under this  administration. It is why energy costs have skyrocketed; grocery costs  have skyrocketed.   The gentlewoman would like to continue down that path and just keep  spending money we don't have. This appropriations process that we are  going through, we have to make decisions. We have to make cuts that  actually bring our government into size.   If it was up to her, not only would we spend everything they have  spent over the last 2 years, they would probably increase it another $5  trillion because who cares? It is not their money; it is the American  peoples' money. It is the taxpayers' money.   We have to make decisions. That is why we were elected, to govern.   I felt this amendment appropriate because I do think the Head Start  program is important. I do think it provides valuable opportunities for  underprivileged children across this country, and we need to continue  to fund it, but the gentlewoman would just like to spend money we don't  have, make it up out of thin air. It doesn't work that way.   Mr. Chair, I would encourage all of my colleagues to support this  amendment, to increase funding for this critical program, and pay for  it by eliminating funding for bureaucrats in Washington and spending  that money on the children.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
