 Mr. President, let me start by expressing my gratitude to  the Senator from Wyoming, Senator Barrasso, for laying out the nature  of the border crisis that we are experiencing and have experienced at  the highest levels in 20 years, during the year and a half--or year and  a quarter, I guess, of the Biden administration.   But I want to come to the floor and talk about an aspect of the  border crisis that has not been sufficiently discussed or noticed, and  that is the connection between the flood of illegal drugs coming across  the border--not just with the 100,000 drug overdose deaths we  experienced in America last year, but also with crime and gangs and  guns in every community across the United States, from Maine to Texas,  from Virginia to California.   A Gallup poll published earlier this month found that 80 percent of  Americans are worried about crime and violence. It seems like there is  a new headline every day about acts of violence in cities across our  country.   Two weeks ago, for example, a gunman set off smoke grenades and  opened fire on a crowded New York City subway car. Chicago just  experienced its most violent weekend this year, with 8 people murdered  and 42 others shot.   Earlier this month, a gang shootout in Sacramento killed 6 and  wounded 12. The American people aren't just noticing this trend; they  are demanding solutions. Rising crime rates have caused many leaders to  change their tune on this idea, this crazy idea called ``defund the  police.''   New York City, Oakland, and Baltimore are among the cities to reverse  their previous cuts in police funding. And that is for a very simple  reason. It is because defunding the police is dangerous.   There is no question that law enforcement plays an important role in  stopping crime, but we have to remember that this crime surge is tied  to far more than just police departments. I am reminded of a quote by  H. L. Mencken:         For every complex problem, there's a solution that is       simple, neat, and wrong.    So when looking at the factors that fuel this upsurge of violence and  crime in our cities across the country, we can't ignore a big  contributor of that, which is the crisis occurring along our southern  border. Some of the numbers are familiar to all of us. For example,  Customs and Border Protection encountered more than 200,000 migrants  along the southern border last month  [[Page S2208]]  alone, the highest number in more than two decades.   The total number of migrant encounters over the last 12 months  exceeds 2.2 million. You might be tempted to ask what in the world is  going on; why are things changing? I want to make one thing clear,  though. I am in no way suggesting that all of these individuals coming  across the border are dangerous criminals. Many of them are economic  migrants looking for a better life. Something we all understand.   But there are definitely people coming across the border who are  dangerous criminals, primarily associated with the drug cartels, who  threaten public safety in every city in America every day.   We need to acknowledge that a human flood of people, even people  potentially associated with legitimate asylum claims, but that flood of  humanity, just the--having to deal with that many people, opened  gateways for truly dangerous criminals and the drugs that are smuggled  across the border undetected.   I will give you an example of how that happens. Last fall, more than  15,000 migrants, primarily Haitians who had been living in South  America, arrived at the small border town of Del Rio, TX, a town of a  population of 35,000 people.   So all of a sudden, 15,000 migrants show up in a town of 35,000  people. It is not by accident. To state the obvious, the Del Rio Border  Patrol Sector did not have the capacity to process and care for that  many migrants at a given time. But that was part of the plan of the  drug cartels and the criminal organizations associated with them. But  in response, the administration moved Border Patrol agents from other  checkpoints to the Del Rio sector to try to help. But, of course, that  is exactly what the cartels hoped for.   Taking people off the frontlines in other sectors to handle the surge  of migrants in Del Rio opened up avenues for the drug cartels to  smuggle their poison into the United States.   Administration officials later told Congressional staff that this  massive surge of migrants was, they acknowledge, part of a coordinated  effort by the cartels. They directed the Haitian migrants to show up at  a single location in a small town on the border to make sure that other  paths into the United States would be cleared for their illicit  contraband of drugs.   Talk to any Border Patrol agent and they will tell you that this  happens all the time. The cartels are very sophisticated. They know how  to game the system. They watch, they wait, they coordinate, and at the  right moment, they bring their poison into our country.    In many cases, they are moving drugs--everything from marijuana to  methamphetamine to heroin. But in recent years, Customs and Border  Protection has seen an alarming increase in synthetic opioids, fentanyl  coming across the border.   As we all have learned, fentanyl is a uniquely dangerous drug because  it is so potent, a lethal dose can fit on the tip of a sharpened  pencil.   In the first 3 months of this year, Customs and Border Protection  seized nearly 1,200 kilograms. Now, a kilogram is 2.2 pounds, so that  is 2,640 pounds of fentanyl were seized at the border, enough to wipe  out the entire U.S. population.   Cartels and criminal organizations aren't just trying to smuggle  their product into the United States, they have to have a way to  distribute those drugs across our country. And that is where the  criminal gangs come into the picture.   Last Tuesday, agents from the Rio Grande Valley Border Patrol Sector  arrested an MS-13 member. MS-13 is one of the most violent gangs on the  planet. The following day, agents arrested an 18th Street gang member,  and, over the weekend, agents arrested four additional gang members.  This all happened in one Border Patrol sector in less than a week's  time.   What we need to remember when we look at all this data is that these  are just the ones we know about. We have absolutely no idea how many  drugs and criminals have slipped through the cracks. Now, the Border  Patrol has a name for this, they call it ``the getaways,'' but the  truth is we don't really know how many people have gotten away,  undetected, to smuggle drugs or dangerous criminals into the United  States.   By one estimate, 385,000 getaways came across the border in 2021. And  there is a reason they didn't turn themselves in to the Border Patrol;  they are not seeking asylum. They are not saying: I have been  persecuted in my home country, and, thus, eligible for asylum  potentially in the United States.   These people, these getaways, are the ones that don't want to be  detected by law enforcement because they are up to no good.   I think this chart shows the network of gangs and criminal  organizations operating within the United States.   You know, most of the time we all think, well, the drugs come across  the border, and we forget what happens next. But as you can see,  cartels--this is a DEA, a Drug Enforcement Administration, chart--as  you can see, the cartels in transnational criminal organizations have a  presence in most major cities across the United States.   Many of these are members of dangerous gangs who want to make money,  so they sell drugs in their local community, and they fight for  territory, for market share. They commit other property crimes, other  crimes of violence, carjacking, larceny, armed robbery, in order to  fuel their need for money.   So once cartel members and their gang associates get drugs across the  border, where do they go? Well, they go to Chicago. They go to Detroit.  They go to Atlanta. They go to New York. They go to San Diego. They go  to virtually every community in our country where they are then  distributed to people to feed addictions, which result in overdoses and  death. It is not just a border problem. This affects every single  community in our country.   Last year, the special agent of Chicago's DEA office spoke about what  happens when these drugs and criminals reach your backyard. He said  cartels use every means possible to get drugs from Mexico into the  United States and then to local markets. In Chicago, that means  predominantly to the gangs that control the drug markets in Chicago.   But it is not just Chicago. It is literally every community in  America. These are the same gangs that fuel the overdose epidemic, the  same ones that perpetuate crime and gun violence. These are the same  gangs that engage in deadly fights over control for territory and  market share. And the cruel reality is, this is happening on a daily  basis in every community in our country, which is contributing to the  spike in violent crime and the public's reasonable concerns that they  have expressed about it, including boneheaded ideas like defunding the  police.   A Drug Enforcement Agency report from 2017 acknowledged that drug  trafficking profits ``increase the staying power of both street gangs  and drug trafficking organizations.'' The more money they make, the  more drugs that are manufactured and brought into the country and  spread throughout our communities.   No community in America is safe. A rural, an urban, a suburban  community, none of them have been spared the pain and suffering of the  drug overdose epidemic, drugs which predominantly come across our  southern border by these criminal cartels.   I mentioned it before, but it is worth noting that last year we hit a  grim milestone in America. For the first time on record, more than a  hundred thousand Americans lost their lives to drug overdoses in a 12- month period.   Now, I remember what happened when Al Qaeda hit the United States and  killed 3,000 Americans on 9/11. We declared war, and we committed  ourselves to rooting out these terrorists that exported this terrorist  plot to hit our homeland.   When 100,000 Americans die of drug overdoses, what do we do? Well, we  throw up our hands. We say there is not much we can do about it. Supply  meets demand. And there is some truth to that, but it is not the whole  story.   As I said, in recent years, the number of drug overdose deaths caused  by synthetic opioids, including fentanyl, has skyrocketed, and so have  the seizures of fentanyl at the border, virtually all made from  precursors from Asia, primarily China, shipped to Mexico, manufactured  there in an industrial operation which can make a fentanyl tablet look  a lot like some other medication  [[Page S2209]]  that you might take. Many people--too many people--have died thinking  they were taking a drug for some condition, only to find out it was  laced with fentanyl, resulting in their drug overdose death.   The alarming increase in the supply coming across our border  foreshadows even worse overdose statistics in the months to come.   Fentanyl isn't the only dangerous drug--methamphetamine, cocaine,  heroin. According to the DEA--the Drug Enforcement Administration-- threat assessment, 92 percent of the heroin that comes to the United  States comes from one place: Mexico. Ninety-two percent.   So when you zoom out and get a broader perspective and quit looking  through a soda straw at what is happening at the border, you see it is  not just an immigration issue. The drugs pouring across our border make  this a public health crisis as well.   The criminals sneaking across our border who are distributing these  drugs in our communities all across the country are a public security  crisis, a public safety crisis. The unlicensed guns that the gangs use  to protect their territory makes this a gun violence crisis as well.   Every single American should be outraged by what is happening at the  border, but if you don't care about 2.2 million people showing up on  our front doorstep, if you don't care about the 100,000 Americans who  died of drug overdoses, do you care about the spikes in violence and  crime in your neighborhood, in your local community? All of these are  inextricably intertwined.   I don't care if you are a liberal Democrat or an Independent or a  conservative Republican, this failure of the Federal Government to deal  with our border crisis is absolutely appalling, and it hurts us all.   I have heard someone say that every city is a border town these days,  and this makes that point. This state of chaos is dangerous for the  migrants who turn themselves over to human smugglers who care nothing  about them, only the money they can generate from smuggling them into  the United States. I have seen the bleached bones of migrants left  behind, injured or sick, because the coyotes, the smugglers, care  nothing about them but just the money they can garner from smuggling  them into the country, not to mention the girls and women who are  sexually assaulted on the long trip from their home country into the  United States.   It is unfair to the border communities I represent. We have 1,200  miles of common border, Mexico and Texas. My Governor, my State  legislature, the people I represent are outraged that the Federal  Government is not living up to its responsibilities. It is unfair to  those communities, most of which are Hispanic majorities by large  majorities, who are sympathetic to the desire of people for a better  life, fleeing no jobs or violence, but they are having to pay the price  now, not just with the flood of people coming across the border, for  which the Federal Government is completely unprepared, they also have  to deal with the opioid abuse and the criminal organizations that are  flooding our communities with fentanyl, heroin, and other dangerous  substances.   But it is not just the border. Cities all across this country are  combating violent crime at numbers that we have not seen for decades.  This is directly tied to the drug business at the border because the  criminal gangs are the ones who distribute those drugs in our  communities.   The status quo is deeply unfair to the dedicated men and women of law  enforcement, including the Border Patrol, who put their lives on the  line to secure our border and protect our communities.   Last week, Texas lost a 22-year-old soldier who was doing a job that  the Federal Government should have done, but he was there at the  southern border as part of a State National Guard effort called  Operation Lone Star.   Texas Army National Guardsman SPC Bishop Evans was attempting to  rescue two migrants who appeared to be drowning as they were crossing  the river from Mexico. He disappeared into the treacherous waters of  the Rio Grande and, tragically, did not survive. Making matters even  worse, initial reports from law enforcement indicate that the two  migrants whom Specialist Evans was trying to save are suspected of drug  trafficking.   There are a million and one reasons why President Biden should want  to address this border crisis, and it is absolutely inconceivable to me  that his administration has done nothing to make this better, and I  would argue that through some of the policies promulgated by Director  Mayorkas, he has actually made it worse. He has made it more attractive  for more people to come and attempt this dangerous journey from their  home into the United States. He has made it easier, given the business  model of the cartels, to get more of those drugs across the border and  into our communities, contributing to the crimewave that is shocking so  many people.   As we head into the summer months, which are traditionally the  busiest times for border crossings, the Biden administration needs to  do something. And let me just say, I am prepared--I know a lot of us  are prepared on a bipartisan basis to do what we need to do to end this  crisis. If the Biden administration doesn't want to lead in the effort,  at least they could allow those of us here in the Congress to come up  with ideas, like my bipartisan, bicameral Border Solutions Act, to try  to address this crisis that we cannot tolerate any longer.   I yield the floor.                           Vote on Compound Motion
