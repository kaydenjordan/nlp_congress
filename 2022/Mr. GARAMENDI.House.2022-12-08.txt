 Mr. Speaker, the Subcommittee on Readiness continues  its works to ensure that our bases and our personnel are prepared for  anything, from climate change to floods, fires, housing, and the like.   Mr. Speaker, as I look at you there on the podium, I am saddened. I  am going to miss you. I am going to miss the work that you have done  and the extraordinary efforts you have made over your many, many years.   Behind me is another woman who I am also going to miss, Jackie  Speier, and   Jim Cooper, who is not with us this morning. An  extraordinary group of people, the three of you. You have carried this  committee. You have carried all of us, and we thank you.
