 Mr. Speaker, it is a great day for America when we are  advancing the civil rights of all Americans, and that is what the  Equality Act does.   All of the free exercise constitutional arguments being advanced  today--  Mr. Speaker, all of the constitutional arguments being  advanced today by our colleagues have been decisively repudiated and  rejected by their hero, Justice Antonin Scalia, in the 1990 decision  Employment Division v. Smith, where Justice Scalia, for the Court,  emphasized that there is no religious free exercise exemption from  secular laws of universal application, including civil rights laws,  including child labor laws, including child abuse laws. And every  scoundrel in American history has tried to dress up his or her  opposition to other people's civil rights in religious garb.   We saw that in 1964, in the Heart of Atlanta Motel case and in the  Ollie's Barbecue case, where motel owners, hotel owners, lunch counter  owners came in and said: We have a religious free exercise right not to  serve interracial groups or interracial couples. We don't want to allow  an interracial couple--you get where I am going.
