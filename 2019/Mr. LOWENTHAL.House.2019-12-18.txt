 Madam Speaker, the facts in this case are as simple as  they are tragic. Witness after witness attested to these facts. No one  has credibly refuted them.   President Trump tried to coerce Ukraine to interfere in the 2020  elections. He used the power of his office for personal political gain.   By withholding aid to Ukraine, the President has endangered our ally  Ukraine and undermined our own national security. When he got caught,  the President attempted to cover up the crime and shut down any  investigation by obstructing Congress.   We have overwhelming evidence that this President poses an urgent  threat to our elections, to our national security, and to the rule of  law. Congress must vote to impeach him to protect our constitutional  Republic. There is no alternative.
