 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate House passage of  H.R. 5378, the Lower Costs, More Transparency Act.   During my time in Congress, I have advocated for restoring patient- centered, cost-effective, and market-driven solutions to our Nation's  healthcare system to drive down costs. For too long, families have  faced the financial burden of unexpected medical bills, overly  expensive prescription drugs, limited healthcare choices, and hidden  fees.   In nearly every industry, consumers know the price of a product  before purchasing it. Healthcare should be no different. That is why I  am so proud of the work done on the Lower Costs, More Transparency Act.   This monumental bill delivers much-needed transparency and ensures  Americans have access to timely, quality, and affordable healthcare  that suits them best.   Specifically, this bill requires hospitals to disclose their actual  prices and forces insurance companies to show patients what they will  pay before receiving care.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to serve on both committees that helped  craft this historic overhaul of our healthcare system.                            ____________________
