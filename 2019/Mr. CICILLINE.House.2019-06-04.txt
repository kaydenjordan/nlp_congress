 I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   I rise in strong support of H.R. 6, the American Dream and Promise  Act.   This legislation will protect 2.5 million people as American as  everyone in this Chamber but for a piece of paper, young people who  came here as children, brought by their families to pursue the American  Dream. That is why we call them Dreamers.   They did what we would expect of any other good American. They worked  hard. They served in our communities. They served in our military. They  studied at our schools. They strengthened our communities.                                time  1615    We had a hearing of examples of Dreamers, these young people who did  extraordinary things, who enriched the lives of their own communities,  who are scholars, community activists, teachers, doctors, and lawyers,  people making incredible contributions.   I have met with Dreamers in my home State, where 6,000 people will be  protected by this legislation. They are valued and productive members  of our community.   There is also protection in here for TPS designees. In the State of  Rhode Island, we have the largest Liberian community, who make  unbelievable contributions and live with such uncertainty.   We, of course, need comprehensive immigration reform, but protecting  Dreamers is first.   We have heard a lot of arguments about other problems with our  immigration system. We agree, but I haven't heard anyone say that these  young people don't deserve protection in this debate today.   This bill doesn't solve all the problems, but it solves three  specific problems: TPS, DED, and Dreamers. It is voting to give  protections to these young people.   This is a very powerful symbol of our patriotism and our love of our  country because we are a stronger and better America because of these  young people and because of the magnificent contributions of these  Dreamers. There is nothing more American than passing the Dream Act and  ending the uncertainty in the lives of these young people and  acknowledging they represent the best of America.   I wish everyone in this country could have watched that hearing of  just some examples of the differences these young people have made in  the lives of their communities.   Let's do the right thing. Let's pass this in a bipartisan way and  give certainty to the lives of these young people who know no other  country but this great country.
