 Madam Speaker, as Veterans Day approaches, I rise  today to mourn the loss of Paul Baffico, a dear friend and pillar of  our local veterans community.   We met 30 years ago while working together at Sears. Over the years,  I learned the full breadth of his story and the depth of his character.  Paul served in Vietnam in the 101st Airborne Division, participating in  206 combat assaults.   Like so many of his era, Paul was not welcomed home the way he  deserved. It was an experience that informed his career and his  volunteering throughout his life.   Paul committed his life to serving our Nation's veterans. For more  than 15 years, Paul volunteered as a docent at the Vietnam Veterans  Memorial in Washington, D.C.   In 2012, he founded the Lake County Veterans and Family Services  Foundation, engaging with and advocating on  [[Page H5542]]  behalf of thousands of veterans and families.   Paul was a big man and leaves an even bigger legacy, and his memory  will forever be a blessing.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record an oral history Paul shared  with the Pritzker Military Museum & Library in 2013.         [From Pritzker Military Museum and Library, Nov. 17, 2023]                       Paul Baffico, First Lieutenant         Paul Baffico's story of service truly represents the       turmoil our nation faced in the early 1960s--a college       student in San Francisco who chose to enroll in the ROTC as       Americans were becoming more and more divided on the issue of       the Vietnam War, Baffico served with the famed 101st Airborne       Division in an area that saw heavy action, before returning       home to a community that either couldn't--or wouldn't       understand what the military's sacrifice had been about.        Differing from some of the public universities at the time,       the school that Baffico attended--the University of San       Francisco--had a requirement that all students participate in       ROTC for their first two years with the option to continue on       voluntarily after that. Despite the more conservative nature       of the school, the university's proximity to landmarks of 60s       counter-culture--Haight-Ashbury, The University of California       at Berkeley, and San Francisco itself--made putting on a       uniform and going to class that much more intense in an       environment where heated debates about Vietnam were raging.       Watching as peers were pulled out of class and taken to the       draft board, however, and hoping to postpone being drafted       himself, Mr. Baffico chose to continue with ROTC after the       school's initial requirements had been met.        After completing his undergraduate studies, Baffico was       trained as a Signal Officer at Ft. Gordon, Georgia before       moving on to Ft. Sill, Oklahoma, and finally landing at Ft.       Hood, Texas. From there, he deployed to Vietnam and joined up       with the 101st Airborne Division as a Signal Platoon Leader       at Camp Eagle, in the hotly contested DMZ. From the time he       landed in Vietnam--coming into Tan Son Nhut and making the       30-minute drive by jeep to Camp Eagle--Baffico was enveloped       by the dangers of the conflict that would be ever-present in       his 206 combat assaults.        One day, in particular, stands out to Baffico and       represents the intensity he experienced:        As dawn broke on the morning of May 6th [1970] I was called       to Division Tactical Operations Center (the Situation Bunker)       and told that Firebase Henderson was under heavy attack and       partially overrun. It was a sapper attack and the ammo dump       was on fire and cooking off. My three men had been hit: two       killed and one MEDEVAC'd out. The battle was at full peak and       the only working communications for the entire firebase was       the Pathfinder radio (LZ air traffic control). I was ordered       to get a new team and equipment ready and get them installed       at Henderson within 45 minutes regardless of the situation. I       was not to leave the firebase until my men were in place and       the equipment was back on air.        That during his interview Baffico chooses to focus on       issues of leadership surrounding this moment, and what it       means to support the troops in such a situation, is perhaps       telling of how hard it is to revisit certain moments in the       past. Mr. Baffico does suggest it took him many years to be       able to even write about that day. The understanding of       leadership that Baffico took away with him that day continued       to shape him as he came home to a community protesting the       war in Vietnam; as he married and raised a family, and as he       began a long career with Sears Roebuck & Co.--a company that       understood his service and supported him.        Baffico, who lives in Lake Bluff, Illinois and is one of       the founders of the Lake County Veterans and Family Service       Foundation, takes time each month to volunteer at The Vietnam       Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., where he talks with       visitors about the war-time sacrifices he witnessed and what       it actually means to be of service to your country.                            ____________________
