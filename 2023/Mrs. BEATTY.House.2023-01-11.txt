 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the 110th  Founders' Day of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Incorporated, founded in  1913 by 22 collegiate women from Howard University who refused to be  denied the right to march in the women's suffrage march.   I am so proud today as we push forward with fortitude to join the  seven female Members of Congress standing strong here in the Halls of  Congress, working together just as our Founders did, to advance the  fight for voting rights, for women's reproductive rights, for criminal  justice, housing, HBCUs, and education.   Most importantly, I am proud to join my Delta sisters: Congresswomen  Clarke, McBath, Plaskett, Crockett, Lee, and Foushee.   To my sisters and Deltas and all members of Panhellenic, we say thank  you for your service. But most importantly, today I say Happy Founders'  Day.                            ____________________
