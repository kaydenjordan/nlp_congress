 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 76th celebration of  National Bible Week. As I reflected on what I would share with everyone  tonight, I couldn't get away from my background and my family heritage  of being raised by Christian parents, who were raised by Christian  grandparents, who worked hard and believed that the instruction book  for life was the Word of God.    Bryon and I have chosen to raise our children in much that same way.  In fact, when I was telling my family--we have a group text that we  text in all the time with my kids, my husband and I. I was telling them  that it was National Bible Week. I said to them: Do you kids remember  what the Junior Bible Quiz answer is? For the very first question in  the Junior Bible Quiz book is: What is the Bible?   And my middle daughter, Kennedy, who is 20 years old, immediately  texted back, and she said: The Bible is the inspired Word of God and is  His revelation to all people of Himself and His plan for salvation. I  said: Good job, Kenners.   You see, because we--my grandparents grew up going to church and  became very frustrated that it was religious; that it wasn't a personal  relationship with the Lord. In fact, so much so, that they decided that  they would plant their own church. It is the church that I go to today,  that our entire family goes to today. But for a year, they held Bible  studies in homes seeking God's will for their lives and what it meant  to have a personal relationship with Him and to spread it to their  community.   They were very poor, but they knew that everything in their life,  their success, and their family's hope and future relied on the Lord's  will and them being obedient to it.   Mr. Speaker, I grew up as a young girl coming downstairs in the  middle of the night for a drink of water to find my dad on his knees  reading his Bible in the middle of the living room. He had a bad back.  He worked hard. He was always in pain, and whenever he had a difficult  time on the farm or couldn't sleep because of the pain that was in his  body, the first thing he would do would be to read his Bible.   Oftentimes, we didn't realize how much time he really did spend  worshipping God, and reading His words to find comfort and release  through some of the difficult times that he had gone through.   I remember being 13 years old and being very insecure. In fact, my  mom said she worried about me. She wondered if I was going to be a  young girl who would grow up proud. I didn't have many friends. I  didn't think I was attractive. I didn't think I had any gifts. She sat  me down at the kitchen table, and she read to me Scriptures out of the  Bible that told me how God saw me; that God saw me above and not  beneath; that He saw me as someone who had plans for me from the time I  was in the womb. And you know what? I bought it. I completely changed  my attitude and my perspective of myself that day because of God's Word  that was spoken over me by my mother.   So we as a family, from the time I was little, went to church Sunday  mornings. We went Sunday nights. We went Wednesday evenings.                                time  1845    We knew that if the doors were open on church, we were to be there,  and we were to be meditating on God's Words in our lives. That is how  Bryon and I have chosen to raise our kids as well. We put them in  Junior Bible Quiz because we wanted God's Word hidden in their heart. I  am thankful that today they still have God's Word hidden in their  heart.   Mr. Speaker, Jesus tells us in Matthew 7: ``Anyone who listens to My  teaching and follows it is wise, like a person who builds a house on  solid rock. Though the rain comes in torrents and the floodwaters rise  and the winds beat against that house, it won't collapse because it was  built on bedrock.''   How often does it feel like we are stuck in that storm, as though the  [[Page H9249]]  floodwaters are rising around us and around people of faith, as though  the winds are beating on our door?   It is during these times that we must lean on our foundation, the  Bible, our instruction book.   It is in that Bible that God reveals how He would like to use us as  instruments of faith and as defenders of freedom that show Christ's  love and compassion to our community, Nation, and world. Allowing Him  to guide us through His Word is the surest way to navigate any storm.   But so many times, people try to navigate our policy debates in this  Chamber by fighting to change one another's minds. Mr. Speaker, I am  convinced what we ought to be doing is seeking God to change their  hearts, gearing their hearts toward Him. I recognize that that takes  trust, and it takes faith, but that is what we are directed to do.   It is written in Proverbs: ``Trust in the Lord with all your heart  and lean not on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge  Him, and He will make your paths straight.''   Mr. Speaker, I pray that we are being servants for God's good, that  we allow Him to light our path, and that we humble ourselves enough to  build our house on His firm Biblical foundation. In this way, whatever  we do, we do it to the glory of God.
