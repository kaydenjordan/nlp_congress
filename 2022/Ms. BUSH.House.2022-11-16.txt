 Mr. Speaker, St. Louis and I rise today in full support of  President Biden's student debt relief plan in the face of Republican  efforts to block economic relief for millions of people.   The $1.9 trillion student debt crisis has cost people more than just  money. It has stripped countless people of the opportunity to start a  family, buy a home, start a business, or further their education.   My office has been collecting heartbreaking stories from constituents  across Missouri's First District about how student debt relief would  impact their lives for the better. Here are some of their stories.   Michelle H. writes: ``The ongoing gloom and constant worry of student  loan debt will lessen significantly. Even if some of the debt I have  accumulated through student loans was forgiven, my entire quality of  life will drastically increase, and my mental health would also  increase. This would be absolutely life-changing.''   Amy V. notes: ``We will be able to buy a house, my first mortgage.  This will allow me to pay off other bills and increase my credit score.  I cannot afford the monthly payment of over $900 per month.''   Alison M. writes: ``I have been swimming in debt since I graduated  college with a degree and a job. At one point, I couldn't even afford  to move out of my parents' because my student loans were over $1,000.  Sallie Mae ruined my credit score, and now that I finally have somewhat  of a stable income. If this debt relief comes through, I can actually  see a light at the end of still a long tunnel. But, before, I never  even thought there was such a light.''   These are just three of the 43 million borrowers who are depending on  transformative student debt relief measures that will change their  lives forever.   I share my own personal story of my journey grappling with immense  student loan debt. As a single mom of two, working an hourly job that  made less than $10 an hour, even after working there for 10 years, I  struggled to provide for my family and myself. I knew I needed a  change, a career change, but that meant I would need to go back to  school and that I would ultimately incur student debt.   I thought that once I graduated and got a steady job, I would be able  to pay it back quickly. So, I enrolled in nursing school, took out  loans, and a few years later, I was a registered nurse.                                time  1030    For the most part, everything went as I expected, and it wasn't until  I was faced with that first payment that I realized just how  astronomical this debt burden became. Even with a job that paid more  money than I had ever made before, it still felt impossible to be able  to pay it off.   Ultimately, I was able to pay off my student loans, but it took  years. During those years I struggled to pay these loans, I faced  multiple eviction notices and was evicted, had difficulty feeding my  two babies and affording childcare as I worked long and odd hours as a  nurse. It was hard, and at times it felt impossible. I would have  welcomed debt relief, and it is why I am pushing so hard to remove that  economic burden for current and future generations.   Education should be affordable, equitable, and accessible to  absolutely everyone. It should lead to prosperity and opportunity, not  debt.   I share these stories with you, my colleagues, and implore us all to  continue supporting the Biden administration in backing down the dark  money and right-wing attacks on student debt relief and to continue  standing with borrowers by extending the payment pause beyond December  31st and using every single legal authority to deliver student debt  relief. We have a responsibility and an obligation to cancel student  debt now.                            ____________________
