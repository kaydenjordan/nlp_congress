 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Mr. Shane  Delande Gilbert, born July 16, 2007, and wish him a happy 10th  birthday. A Granite Stater from Merrimack, Shane possesses a deep love  for our country and its history. Shane recently was graduated from  Thorntons Ferry Elementary School, where he was an excellent student in  Mrs. DeFrancisco's fourth grade class and enrolled in the school's  gifted and talented program. This fall, Shane will enter the fifth  grade at James Mastricola Upper Elementary School in Merrimack.   Shane is deeply engaged in his community. He is a member of his  school's Junior Lego League and is involved with the For Inspiration  and Recognition of Science and Technology--FIRST--Lego League, as well  as karate.   Shane has, with tremendous strength of spirit, shouldered the  responsibility of fighting non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and every day  exhibits remarkable bravery and courage. Shane is an active participant  in the Greater Nahua Relay for Life. For his 10th birthday, in lieu of  gifts, Shane asked that donations be made instead to his Relay for Life  team ``Spuddie's Against Cancer.'' He raised $150 towards cancer  research and achieved his personal best by walking 10 miles.   Shane's civic mindedness extends to all aspects of life. He is  nicknamed. ``The Mayor'' due to his gregariousness and passion for  helping others. A keen political observer and participant, Shane spoke  to many Presidential candidates during New Hampshire's most recent  primary season and has expressed interest in 1 day running for that  office himself. He is also a student of the American Civil War, and  recently visited Gettysburg National Military Park in Pennsylvania and  will be touring the U.S. Capitol today.   Shane's commitment to his community and his love of our country and  its history gives me great hope for our future. I join Shane's parents,  Laurie-Ann Gilbert and Christine Delande, in celebrating Shane on the  occasion of his 10th birthday.                            ____________________
