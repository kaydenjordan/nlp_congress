 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia, and I  appreciate his unwavering support for the Second Amendment.   Madam Speaker, I rise today because, just last week, our President of  this country spoke about using the nuclear option. He wasn't talking  about getting rid of the 60-vote rule in the Senate. He was actually  contemplating a nuclear conflagration with the citizens of this  country, with the patriots of this country. He said they should get F- 15s and nuclear weapons if they wanted to keep this government in  check.   Those aren't the words of George Washington. Those would be the words  of King George.   Imagine if a dictator--just imagine the dictator of North Korea or  the despot who runs Iran had muttered or stuttered or uttered these  words like our President would and did. There would be an international  outcry today to have that dictator removed.   We need to hold our chief executive accountable for these words. And  our chief executive of this country would do well to understand what  the Second Amendment is really about. It is about keeping an  overzealous executive in check. It is about securing all of the other  liberties in this constitution. It is about the patriots who are  willing to tell the government: We are in charge.
