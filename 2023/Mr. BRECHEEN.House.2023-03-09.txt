 Mr. Speaker, Article I, Section 1 of the United States  Constitution says that all legislative powers are to be vested in the  Congress. In the Congress, not the President.   The Biden administration's WOTUS rule is a perfect example of the  administration usurping the authority, the supremacy of the United  States Constitution.   This rule impacts private property, small business, farmers,  ranchers, including Jess Kane--I just got off the phone with him 20  minutes ago. Jess has a ranch south of Bartlesville, and he has about a  thousand acres in a floodplain. He is concerned about his ranch and how  this rule of the President will impact his ability to do what he has  always done and be able to manage a cow-calf operation.   Regulatory costs are a hidden tax and are now expected to be at least  $2 trillion, according to the Competitive Enterprise Institute. If you  think of regulation as a tax, it comes out to more than $14,000 per  family. It is a hidden tax, $14,000 per family, because of the  regulatory state.   Congress has the authority and duty to rein this in. We must inject  common sense, horse sense for our farmers, ranchers, small businesses,  and private property owners when the Presidency is going the opposite  direction.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.J. Res. 27 and  overturn the WOTUS rule.
