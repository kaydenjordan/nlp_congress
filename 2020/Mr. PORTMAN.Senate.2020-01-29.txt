 Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Ohio.    I send a question to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator Portman's question is directed to counsel  for the President:         Given that impeachment proceedings are privileged in the       Senate and largely prevent other work from taking place while       they are ongoing, please address the implications of allowing       the House to present an incomplete case to the Senate and       request the Senate to seek testimony from additional       witnesses.    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, Senators. I think  this is one of the most important issues that this body faces, given  these calls to have witnesses, because the House managers tried to  present it as if, oh, it is just a simple question; how can you have a  trial without witnesses? But in real litigation, no one goes to trial  without doing discovery. No one goes to trial without having heard  [[Page S654]]  from the witnesses first. You don't show up at trial and then start  trying to call witnesses for the first time.   The implications here in our constitutional structure, trying to run  things in such an upside-down way would be very grave for this body as  an institution because, as the Senator's question points out, it  largely prevents this Chamber from getting other business done as long  as there is a trial pending.   The idea that the House can do an incomplete job in trying to find  out what witnesses there are, having them come testify, trying to find  out the facts--just rush something through and bring it here as an  impeachment and then start trying to call all the witnesses--means that  this body will end up taking over that investigatory task, and all the  regular business of this body will be slowed down, hindered, prevented  while that goes on.   And it is not a question of just one witness. A lot of people talk  right now about John Bolton, but the President would have the  opportunity to call his witnesses, just as a matter of fundamental  fairness. There would be a long list of witnesses if the body were to  go in that direction. It would mean this would drag on for months and  prevent this Chamber from getting its business done.   There is a proper way to do things and an upside-down way of doing  things. To have had the House not go through a process that is thorough  and complete and to just rush things through in a partisan and  political manner and then dump it onto this Chamber to clean everything  up is a very dangerous precedent to be set. As I said the other day,  whatever is accepted in this case becomes the new normal. If this  Chamber puts its imprimatur on this process, then that is the seal of  approval for all time in the future.   If it becomes that easy for the House of Representatives to impeach a  President of the United States--don't attempt to subpoena the  witnesses, never mind litigation because it takes too long, but then  leave it all to this Chamber--and, as I said the other day: Remember,  what do we think will happen if some of these witnesses are subpoenaed  now that they never bothered to litigate about? Then there will be the  litigation now, most likely, and then that will take time while this  Chamber is still stuck sitting as a Court of Impeachment.   That is not the way to do things, and it would forever change the  relationship between the House of Representatives and the Senate in  terms of the way impeachments operate.   So I think it is vitally important for this Chamber to consider what  it really means to start having this Chamber do all that investigatory  work, how this Chamber would be paralyzed by that. And is that really  the precedent? Is that the way this Chamber wants everything to operate  in the future? Once you make it that much easier--and we have said this  on a couple of different points, both in terms of the standards for  impeachable offenses but also in terms of the process that is used in  the House. If you make it really way too easy to impeach a President,  then this Chamber is going to be dealing with that all the time.   As Minority Leader Schumer had pointed out at the time of the Clinton  impeachment--he was prophetic, as White House counsel pointed out the  other day--once you start down the path of partisan impeachments, they  will be coming again and again and again. And if you make it easier,  they will come even more frequently, and this Chamber is going to be  spending a lot of time dealing with impeachment trials and cleaning up  any incomplete, half-baked procedures, rushed partisan impeachments  from the House if that is the sort of system that is given the  imprimatur here.   That is a very important reason for not accepting that procedure and  not trying to open things up now when things haven't been done properly  in the House of Representatives.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Delaware.
