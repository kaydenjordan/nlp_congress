 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a  colloquy with my colleague from Virginia, Senator Kaine.    Mr. President, I am here today to discuss worrying  developments in Mexico, one of the United States' most important  international partners and our neighbor to the south.   The nearly 2,000-mile border that our nations share both binds us  together and presents a series of challenges, including illegal  migration, drug trafficking, and human trafficking. As we work through  those difficult issues, our robust economic relationship has provided a  firm foundation to strengthen and stabilize our efforts with an eye  toward the future. The innovative United States-Mexico-Canada  Agreement, or USMCA, deepened the connections between our economies  such that Mexico is now one of our largest and most strategic trading  partners.   However, actions over the past 2 years by the government of Mexican  President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador have weakened that bond and are  threatening the economic and diplomatic ties between our nations.  Through increasingly arbitrary and aggressive moves against companies  based here in the United States and their lawfully owned assets in  Mexico, the Mexican Government has abused its permitting and regulatory  powers in ways that violate the letter and the spirit of our trade  agreements, not to mention the special relationship historically  enjoyed between our two countries. These decisions directly impact  critical sectors of the U.S. economy from agriculture to energy and  mining and from transportation to tourism.   These capricious actions, which are falsely labeled as ``reforms,''  risk substantially undermining confidence in the commercial rule of law  in Mexico. They also jeopardize the essential economic relations  between North American partners. Further, these actions likely violate  our trade agreements by abrogating contracts, stripping investors of  value, and eliminating private competition and oversight, thereby  sending a clear message to U.S. capital markets that Mexico is no  longer safe or profitable for investing.   I want to highlight the specific case of Vulcan Materials. For almost  2 years now, President Lopez Obrador has personally harassed,  interfered with, and obstructed Vulcan's lawful operations in Mexico.   Vulcan is a U.S.-based construction aggregates company with a strong  Tennessee and, I might add, a strong Virginia presence that has more  than a 30-year track record of responsibly operating in Mexico and  investing in the community that surrounds its Mexican facility.   In May of 2022, President Lopez Obrador ordered the illegal shutdown  of Vulcan's operations, which had an immediate and detrimental impact  on the supply of construction aggregates to the United States.   Then, in March of 2023, President Lopez Obrador ordered a military  invasion of Vulcan's property and occupied the company's quarry and  port for 2 weeks. As shocking as this sounds, video footage of this  invasion is available online.    President Lopez Obrador has initiated a process to illegally take the  company's property by declaring it a supposed naturally protected area.   The President of Mexico is abusing a process designed to protect  regionwide ecosystems in order to illegally expropriate land that,  coincidentally, exactly matches Vulcan's property lines. This is an  egregious abuse of the law that undermines the very trust that should  be foundational to the U.S.-Mexico relationship.   By illegally closing Vulcan's business and now attempting to steal  their property, the Mexican President is signaling to other American  companies that Mexico cannot be trusted when it comes to foreign  investment.   If not quickly corrected, actions like these risk choking off the  economic relationship between our two nations.   Many important supply chains stretch across the U.S.-Mexico border,  supplying millions of good jobs and making both countries more  attractive for capital investment.   This is certainly true for my home State of Tennessee. Because of the  successes that I witnessed between my home State of Tennessee and  Mexico, I have been a strong advocate for reshoring integrated supply  chains from Communist China to North America.  [[Page S5727]]    Building upon the successes of USMCA as a foundational component of  North American competitiveness supports both American and Mexican  economic prosperity and both nations' national security.   But without a basic respect for private property and the rule of law,  the prospects for expanding our shared economic and national security  via commerce and investment are greatly diminished.   In fact, failing to protect private property and the rule of law will  inevitably lead to the disintegration of our economic ties. Therefore,  I again urge President Lopez Obrador to reverse course before more  damage is done.   Instead, we should be looking for opportunities to work together to  attract investment and unlock the economic opportunity that is being  presented to both of our nations as supply chains are rebalanced away  from communist China.   Let's seize this opportunity together rather than damage our shared  interests for short-term political gains.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I thank Senator Kaine for lending his  expertise as a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee  and, most importantly, as chair of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee.  I thank the Senator from Virginia for bringing his respected voice to  this matter of serious diplomatic concern. As former Governor of his  home State of Virginia, he has an acute appreciation of the economic  opportunity that exists that is in danger of being destroyed by the  illegal actions of the Mexican President. So thank you very much for  joining me in this.    I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to address my colleagues in  the U.S. Senate and to posthumously honor the life and achievements of  Mr. Shoichiro Toyoda of Japan.   Mr. Shoichiro Toyoda built upon the strong foundation established by  both his grandfather, Sakichi Toyoda, the founder of the successful  Toyoda Automatic Loom Works, and his father, Kiichiro Toyoda, who  transitioned the company to automobiles by establishing Toyota Motors.  Shoichiro, while never intending to join the family business, stepped  in at the age of 27 to help following the unexpected death of his  father. Determined to ``develop a high-quality passenger car that would  perform well anywhere in the world,'' Shoichiro Toyoda's efforts  eventually established Toyota as a world leader in quality and  introduced one of the bestselling cars of all time.   Both a talented engineer and businessman, Shoichiro expanded Toyota's  production globally and deployed manufacturing facilities in 22  countries, specifically investing billions in Toyota's U.S. operations  and creating an untold number of jobs for American workers. He was  inducted into the U.S. Automotive Hall of Fame in 2007 and served on  the board of Denso, a valued corporate citizen of my home State of  Tennessee, for 58 years. On a very personal level, I would also like to  acknowledge the tremendous accomplishments of his son and my friend,  Akio Toyoda, who continues his father's legacy, ably leading Toyota  Motor Corporation as chairman of the company's board of directors.   I applaud Shoichiro Toyoda's contributions in making Toyota a shining  example of the Japanese commitment to excellence, and I appreciate the  great legacy that he left in support of U.S.-Japan relations.                            ____________________
