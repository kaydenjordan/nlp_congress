 Madam Speaker, on behalf of my constituents in the  Bronx and Queens, New York's 14th Congressional District, the most  impacted district in America, calling people losing their families  every day, it is a joke when Republicans say that they have urgency  around this bill.   The only folks that they have urgency around are folks like Ruth's  Chris Steak House and Shake Shack. Those are the people getting  assistance in this bill. You are not trying to fix this bill for moms  and pops. And we have to fight to fund hospitals, fight to fund  testing. That is what we are fighting for in this bill. It is  unconscionable. If you had urgency, you would legislate like rent was  due on May 1st and make sure that you include rent and mortgage relief  for our constituents.
