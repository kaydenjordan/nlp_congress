 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to speak about the  nomination of Steve Mnuchin to be Secretary of the Treasury and the  concerns I have about his nomination.   I want to start with a Pennsylvania story. It is a story we wish we  didn't have to highlight, but it is relevant to the discussion and  debate on this nomination.   I am looking at a document that is a written summary of a television  investigative news report from January of this year. It is from the  Pittsburgh television station WTAE, and it is dated January 16, 2017.  The headline on the document is ``Trump Pick for Treasury Secretary  Foreclosed on Hundreds of Homeowners in Western Pennsylvania.'' The  article says in pertinent part about this one Pennsylvanian:         Nellie Mlinek lost her husband to cancer. She lost her son       to an overdose. And then she lost her home to OneWest Bank.    It goes on to describe the interaction between this individual and  the bank, and of course this is the bank of which Steve Mnuchin was a  part owner.   I also want to read what she said about the circumstance she was in.  She was hoping that because of the circumstances with regard to her  home, that she would be able to work with the bank instead of having  foreclosure. That was not to be.   The article goes on to talk about others in the region who had  foreclosures as well. A house in White Oak, PA, was foreclosed in 2014;  a house in North Versailles was foreclosed in 2013; a house in Penn  Hills in 2012; a Pittsburgh house was foreclosed in 2011. These are all  communities in Allegheny County, Southwestern Pennsylvania, and Nellie  was from Westmoreland County, which is just to the east of Allegheny  County. So that is what the article summarizes--foreclosures throughout  a corner of Southwestern Pennsylvania, as the headline says, hundreds  of foreclosures.   The article starts with this line: ``Critics say President-elect  Donald Trump's pick for treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, ran a  foreclosure machine at a major bank,'' and it goes on from there. That  is one in Pennsylvania, and then references to foreclosures that I read  from are summaries of what happened to some others.   Then we go to the other end of the State. This is in Southeastern  Pennsylvania, the region within which Philadelphia sits. In this case,  the individual is Ruth Guerriero. Ruth is from South Philadelphia, and  she remembers the day she got the letter that ``scared me to death.''  The letter threatened a foreclosure because of a reverse mortgage that  she didn't know existed. The headline of this article is ``Reverse- mortgage nightmare can start after borrower dies.''   In this case, Ruth lost her husband. The article says that this  particular piece of mail in October 2013 was from OneWest Bank,  informing Ruth that it was foreclosing on the house in the 2800 block  of South Hutchinson Street that she and her late husband had bought in  2006 for $200,000. Without her knowledge, Ruth Guerriero said, her  husband, 23 years her senior, had taken out a reverse mortgage in  September 2007. It goes on from there.   So anyone who has had that experience of losing a home or becoming  the victim of a reverse mortgage when you didn't have prior knowledge  can relate to what has happened to these individuals. This is part of  the debate. These are not the only considerations we weigh, but when  you have, in this case, a nominee for Treasury Secretary who comes into  the nomination process not having held public office or not having held  appointed government office, this is part of the record you are to  review. It is really the only record--the record in this case as a  banker or a businessperson, and in his case, his work on Wall Street.   I had the opportunity, of course, as a member of the Finance  Committee, to meet Mr. Mnuchin in my office and to question him more  than once in the question period for the Finance Committee. In our  meeting, I asked him, for example--and these are other relevant  questions in terms of presenting accurate information, presenting  information that will fully answer questions--I asked him how many  times his financial institution chose to modify mortgages as opposed to  foreclosing, and he told me that there were about 100,000 mortgage  modifications. Yet we  [[Page S1114]]  know the documented evidence tells a different story; it is about one- third that number, closer to 35,000 modifications.   I realize that someone could not remember the exact number, but I was  surprised at how far off he was in something so substantial in  someone's life, whether it was a person like Nellie or other  individuals. A mortgage foreclosure, as opposed to a modification,  which is a better result for an individual or family--that is a  substantial difference in their lives. And I would hope that when you  are in any way involved in a foreclosure, as a banker or as a part of  an entity that is foreclosing, that you would carefully weigh the  consequences before you choose to pursue foreclosure or pursue a  different path, the path of modification, which, of course, everyone  would prefer in that circumstance.   I asked Steve Mnuchin how many Americans his bank had foreclosed on  during the financial crisis, and he has yet to provide an answer to  that question. I know others may have asked a similar question, and I  wonder if they got an answer. We will see what the public record shows.   Mr. Mnuchin was also asked to provide a copy of a letter he said he  sent to the Department of Housing and Urban Development raising  concerns about the impact of the company's reverse mortgage guidance.  It was almost a month ago that we asked for that information to be  produced, that letter, and we still haven't seen it. So I wonder about  the statement he made with regard to information from HUD.   I also asked Mr. Mnuchin whether his financial institution engaged in  the predatory practice of so-called robo-signing, and this is a  question which was asked by a couple of Senators. I asked him for that  information, and he said that wasn't the case. But now we know from the  documented evidence in an answer that he later changed that there was  robo-signing taking place at the time we alleged that it did.   So when you ask a question in a hearing and you get an answer that  was wrong or incomplete or misleading or otherwise, that is one thing.  You could sometimes have a circumstance where someone didn't  intentionally want to mislead or tell a lie, or they may have answered  a question imprecisely or without a lot of information. But I think it  is a little different when you ask a question in writing, where the  individual had the time to analyze a question and provide an answer in  writing with some time to reflect, some time to consult some other  sources of information before they draft their answer and then submit  it to you as part of the nomination process. In this case, Mr. Mnuchin  had a different answer than the facts showed, and I will go through  that a little bit later.   At some level, there is a question of accuracy, maybe even rising to  the level of trust, and that is something we have to consider when we  are making a determination about a nominee, because almost any Cabinet  agency has to transmit information, very specific, detailed  information. People have to be able to rely upon the information, the  accuracy of it and the completeness of it. And if he has had problems  in his nomination process, that causes us to raise some real questions.   I wanted to start with OneWest Bank--another entity called Financial  Freedom. I don't know how far we will get into this in the limited time  we have. In 2009, Mr. Mnuchin and his business partners bought OneWest  Bank at the height of the financial crisis for $1.6 billion, paying  about 5 cents on the dollar for the bank's assets. Mr. Mnuchin was able  to buy the bank at such a significant discount in part because he was  entrusted to modify as many home mortgages as possible so homeowners  could stay in their homes. He foreclosed on more than--I should say  OneWest Bank foreclosed on more than 40,000 Americans, so we are told.   We don't know how many foreclosures they engaged in in Pennsylvania,  but, as I read a couple moments ago from an investigative report from  WTAE, it is at least hundreds in one region of the State. We have 67  counties. Depending on where you draw the line, Southwestern  Pennsylvania is 10 counties, 12 counties, somewhere in that range,  maybe as high as 15 if you went as far north as Erie. Let's say it is  15 counties. Hundreds of foreclosures in that region is substantial.   Later, after all of those thousands of foreclosures across the  country, Mr. Mnuchin sold OneWest Bank for $3.4 billion in 2015. The  sale itself yielded the group of individuals, including Mr. Mnuchin,  billions of dollars--that would be Mr. Mnuchin and also investors.   I mentioned the foreclosures before and the individuals involved. I  wanted to go a little deeper into the particular circumstances.   I mentioned and highlighted Nellie's story. Here is what took place  in that circumstance--or what she had hoped would take place. Nellie  was hoping that she would be able to work something out with the bank,  so she asked OneWest to help her keep the house by adjusting her  payment. That often happens when a bank initiates a foreclosure. It  begins a process but works something out with a homeowner, and that  would be called a modification. In this case, Nellie asked OneWest to  help her keep her house by adjusting her payment, but she said the bank  refused and then foreclosed on her. She said: ``They should have worked  with me to meet a payment that I could make.'' She filed for  bankruptcy, but even that did not save her house. She said it cost her  ``a lot of depression.'' That is what Nellie said about her own  circumstances, and I mentioned the other communities in Western  Pennsylvania.   That is the reality foreclosure brings to bear on the life of one  individual who is struggling, who, in Nellie's case, has had a series  of setbacks, deeply personal, tragic circumstances compounded by the  foreclosure. The same is true of Ruth in South Philadelphia, in terms  of the impact of that decision. We have a lot of ways to summarize  information like this, and I will just highlight maybe one or two.    For example, according to the National Consumer Law Center, in March  of 2012, a Philadelphia senior citizen with a reverse mortgage from a  wing of Mr. Mnuchin's bank--in this case, the name of the entity was  Financial Freedom--sought assistance because he had been served with a  preforeclosure notice. The reverse mortgage company owned by Mr.  Mnuchin gave this individual 30 days to pay almost $5,000.   What was the bill for? Well, without his knowing it, Financial  Freedom charged him over $2,000 for forced-placed insurance coverage  from 2010 to 2012. Financial Freedom threatened to go forward with the  foreclosure unless this senior citizen made immediate monthly payments  equal to almost 35 percent of his monthly income. With legal  assistance, those payments were reduced.   I would hope you would not need to hire a lawyer to get those  payments reduced, but sometimes when you are up against a powerful  financial institution, that is the only way to proceed.   Instead of immediately informing this senior citizen of his lapsed  coverage, Financial Freedom charged excessive amounts for forced-placed  coverage. Financial Freedom then waited 2 years to begin collection,  but it expected this senior, who was living on a fixed income, to pay  within 30 days. Financial Freedom also did not tell this senior citizen  he could apply for a longer repayment plan due to his low income.   According to the National Consumer Law Center, in 2015, Financial  Freedom notified a Pennsylvania reverse mortgage holder's heirs that  the only way to avoid foreclosure on the family home was by repaying  the loan balance or selling the property for at least 95 percent of its  appraised value. They said the appraised value for the Pennsylvania  home was $170,000, even though their own appraisal of the property just  one month earlier was $67,000. There is a big difference between  $170,000 and $67,000. It seems that $170,000 was the appraised value at  loan origination, way back in 2007. Now, of course, it is years later,  and that was, of course, before the market collapsed. So for the  purposes of preforeclosure notice, Financial Freedom used an appraisal  over $100,000 more than the actual value of the home. They were trying  to force the heirs to pay more than $100,000 above the home's value to  prevent foreclosure of the family home.   So these are a couple of Pennsylvania stories--Ruth and Nellie and  then some others, whose names aren't in the text of my remarks, but  give similar stories about some of the foreclosure practices  [[Page S1115]]  that Mr. Mnuchin was part of when he had these individual banks.   Here is the question on robo-signing that I mentioned earlier. I  submitted a question for the record in writing and gave it to him, and  here is what his response was to the question. The question was this:         One of the most significant scandals during the financial       crisis was the practice of ``robo-signing'' whereby bank       employees rapidly approved foreclosure documents without       thorough review. Many were wrongfully foreclosed upon on       account of these practices. Did OneWest Bank ``robo sign''       documents relating to foreclosures and evictions?    His response was pretty shocking:         OneWest Bank did not robo-sign documents, and as the only       bank to successfully complete the independent foreclosure       review required by Federal banking regulators to investigate       allegations of robo-signing, I am proud of our institution's       extremely low error rate.    The reason I say that it was a shocking answer is because he had  signed his name to a 2011 document that found that OneWest Bank did, in  fact, robo-sign. The findings from the Office of Thrift Supervision  does not explicitly state robo-signing--that is not a legal term of  art--but it does set forth a fact pattern for robo-signing, which  involves an employee signing foreclosure documents without reviewing  them. Instead of reviewing the details of each, robo-signers assume the  paperwork is correct and sign it automatically. Almost anyone who lived  through the financial crisis of 2008 knows what robo-signing is, and  many were victims of this practice.   So that is a problem, obviously, when you answer a question in a  manner that is totally inconsistent with the facts.   I know I am low on time, and I want to wrap up. What I will do for  the record--or if we have time to come back later--is to get into some  other issues. But one of the real concerns I have about his nomination  is not just his record as a banker, as a person working on Wall Street  and working in that world. It is one thing to say you did something in  your prior life, but once you put on the mantle of public service and  the heavy responsibilities of Treasury Secretary, you set aside that  other work you did or that other position you had, maybe, on some  issues. But, apparently, some of his work--or at least some of his  points of view--will continue in the Treasury Department, because I  think it is pretty clear, based upon some reporting back at the end of  November, that Mr. Mnuchin believes that one of his prime  responsibilities is to begin to dismantle, or substantially alter, what  we know as the Dodd-Frank legislation.   We know what happened prior to that. We know what happened to the  economy. We know that the United States lost about $19 trillion in  household wealth. That is $19 trillion, with a ``t.'' More than 8  million jobs--by one estimate, 8.7 million jobs--were lost. So I would  hope that as Treasury Secretary, were he to be confirmed, he would make  sure that we never go down that path again--that before you dismantle  Dodd-Frank, you better think about the consequences to real people's  lives.   So I will wrap up because I know we have to go, but I will put more  information in the Record.   Let me conclude with one thought before we move on. One of the  concerns I have about his nomination, also, is not something you can  point to in a document. It is just a gut instinct or a judgment that I  have made, and it is a judgment that can be summarized this way: I have  a real concern about his commitment to public service. Why do I say  that? It seemed that, in this whole process of disclosing financial  information--turning over documents, answering questions, answering  follow-up questions--Mr. Mnuchin was kind of resistant to scrutiny or  seemed to be burdened by this, and that somehow he was disclosing too  much. His demeanor, when you would ask him some questions, appeared to  me to be a demeanor that was not consistent with what public service  must be about. When you are in public service, whether you are elected  or appointed, you are, in fact, a servant. You don't work for a bank,  you don't work for a financial institution, and you don't work for a  company. You don't even work for a President. You work for the people.   I was taught a long time ago that the closer you can get to this  ideal--which is inscribed on a building in our State capitol in  Harrisburg: ``All public service is a trust, given in faith and  accepted in honor''--the way you accept your public duties is not only  to disclose what you should disclose, to answer questions which you  must answer, but to do it in a manner where you are doing it with a  belief that you are a public servant and with the spirit of public  service. If you are labored and if you are chafing under that or  resisting, you should probably do something else with your life.   I hope I am wrong about that. I hope once he is in office--and it  appears that he may be confirmed--and if he is confirmed, we see a  different approach to the duties of public service and the burdens of  public service. I hope I am wrong about him, but my instincts tell me  otherwise.   I yield the floor.
