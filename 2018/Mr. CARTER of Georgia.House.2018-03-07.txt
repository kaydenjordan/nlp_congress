 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Blocking Regulatory  Interference from Closing Kilns Act of 2017. This bill is very simple,  Mr. Speaker, as it simply aligns the timeline for compliance with  judicial review of these rules and regulations.   American businesses are finding themselves facing millions of dollars  in compliance costs due to burdensome EPA regulations. It is estimated  that the EPA's rules may cost the brick and ceramics industry millions  annually, with the cost of compliance for the average facility at over  $4 million.   Industry won't be able to meet the requirement deadlines imposed by  the rule, which is currently being reviewed  [[Page H1462]]  in our court system. The EPA's first attempt at a rule was vacated, but  not before the industry spent millions in compliance measures that were  ultimately found to be invalid.   Small brick and ceramics businesses have been the hardest hit by the  first rule; and if something isn't done, many of these small businesses  will be forced to close their doors for good.   H.R. 1917 would provide much-needed regulatory relief to brick and  ceramics businesses by simply stating that we need to let the judicial  review process move ahead before we penalize hardworking people.   I encourage my colleagues to support this bill and to support  businesses all across the country.
