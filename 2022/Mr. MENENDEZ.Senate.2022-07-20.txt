 Mr. President, I rise to highlight the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee's vote to favorably report the Peace Corps  Reauthorization Act to the full Senate for its consideration. This  legislation, the first reauthorization since 1999, is critically  important to strengthening American leadership in the world.   Last year, the Peace Corps celebrated its 60th anniversary of when  President John F. Kennedy established this important program, run by  its first Director, Sargent Shriver. The Peace Corps' mission then, as  it is today, is to ``promote world peace and friendship'' by  encouraging economic growth and well-being to underserved populations  abroad, as well as giving Americans a better understanding of the wider  world and vice-versa.   The Peace Corps is emerging from one of the most challenging crises  it has ever faced. On March 15, 2020, as the gravity and uncertainty of  the COVID pandemic gripped the world, every mission was suspended for  the first time in the Peace Corps' history. In addition to executing  the enormously complex operation of evacuating more than 7,000 Peace  Corps volunteers from all around the globe, the Peace Corps was faced  with the challenge of how to operate and serve during a period of  global social isolation.   As the world continues to recover from the pandemic, the Peace Corps  is busy executing plans for reentering countries and resuming its  mission of service around the world. While the  [[Page S3536]]  Peace Corps' return is a testament to the resilience and adaptability  of this vitally important branch of U.S. foreign affairs, COVID's  continued presence around the world requires the Peace Corps to  undertake a wide array of new public safety measures to keep  volunteers, staff, and host communities healthy and safe.   And so this reauthorization comes at a most critical time for the  Peace Corps. This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to enact long  overdue reforms and to make sure the agency can effectively promote  international peace, development, and people-to-people engagement. And  it represents significant reforms and strong bipartisan congressional  support for the Agency at an inflection point in its history.   This legislation will strengthen the Peace Corps, giving it the  baseline budget it needs to build the program that Americans deserve.  It sets a $375 per month minimum for the Peace Corps volunteers'  readjustment allowance. It suspends student loan interest during  volunteer service. It extends healthcare coverage for returned Peace  Corps volunteers. And it provides greater whistleblower protections so  the Peace Corps will be transparent and accountable, honoring the  standards and aspirations of its original vision, as outlined in 1961.   The Peace Corps is on track to redeploy volunteers to 30 countries by  the end of this fiscal year. And it has set an aggressive goal of  returning volunteers to almost all of the prepandemic countries by the  end of fiscal year 2023. The programs and policy reforms authorized in  this legislation are crucial to ensuring the safe and successful return  of volunteers to the field.   I am especially proud of the bipartisan work that has gone into this  bill and appreciate the collaboration of the ranking member of Senate  Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Risch, for joining me on this  important legislation. And I am pleased that we are joined by our  colleagues, Senators Cardin, Young, Shaheen, Portman, Feinstein, and  Cornyn, who should be commended for their support of the Peace Corps  and to ensuring the Peace Corps can continue to support and enhance  America's leading role in the world.   I also want to salute the tremendous input from the Peace Corps  community. Their commitment to improving security, conditions, and  opportunities for future Peace Corps volunteers is vital to the  introduction of this bill and improves our national security as well.   So I urge my colleagues to support this bill and its swift passage.  Passage of this bill will help bring about a revitalized, retooled  Peace Corps. Making this bill law will help ensure the return of  volunteers executing the important work of the Peace Corps,  representing the United States of America overseas.                            ____________________
