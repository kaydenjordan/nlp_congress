 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Most  importantly, I want to express and extend my gratitude to the gentleman  from Missouri. This has been a three-year journey for this particular  legislation; not uncommon in this environment. But it was a difficult  journey at times. At no step along the way did the gentleman from  Missouri ever waiver from his commitment to working as collaboratively  as possible, in a willingness to work to find a solution, and he did  just that, and I thank him for that.   Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank Ranking Member Waters for her  efforts, without which this bill would never even have made it to the  floor. I do believe that this bill is stronger as a consequence of the  amendments that we have made, the changes that we have made to it; most  importantly, those changes that will ensure that we do not interfere  with the important work of law enforcement.   I have been very up-front about this. From my perspective, my  interest in this bill grows out of my work on helping my State find  ways to make sure our State-regulated marijuana businesses have access  to banking services so that we can avoid the public safety risks that  arise from huge cash stockpiles building up at these businesses.   Sadly, we have already seen these risks materialize. Before, on this  floor, I had mentioned the name of Travis Mason, 23 years old, a Marine  veteran, working as a security officer at a retail establishment for  marijuana in Colorado, studying to become a law enforcement officer,  who was, a year ago last summer, shot dead by perpetrators who believed  that there was a stockpile of cash behind those doors.                                time  1715    Travis left behind a widow and, yes, three small children. He had a  set of twins. So part of what this bill will help is that there be no  more Travis Masons--no more Travis Masons. We are passing this bill, in  fact, in part to prevent another tragedy like that.   Now, Mr. Luetkemeyer and I worked together with the FDIC to provide  clarity to their banks, and I think the FDIC's financial institutions  letter of January 2015 was a key breakthrough for banks in Washington  State and others. It simply said for banks worried about customer  risks, like the Bank Secrecy Act and antimoney laundering--which is the  main concern, frankly, around marijuana businesses--the FDIC does not  expect them to avoid entire industries, but rather to make  determinations on a customer-by-customer basis.   This was assurance that Washington banks needed to begin providing  banking services to well-regulated, good-actor marijuana businesses. So  now a handful of Washington banks and credit unions are serving  marijuana businesses. Our State banking regulator is working closely  with the State marijuana regulator. Scores of Washington marijuana  businesses have set up bank accounts. We are getting cash out of those  businesses and into the financial system, where it can be monitored. We  draw down that cash stockpile. We reduced the public safety risk that I  talked about earlier. We have an improved public safety condition. It  is a model that needs to be spread to other States who have adopted, as  it were, expanded marijuana legislation.   I view this bill as codifying the FDIC's financial institutions  letter and expanding it to other bank regulators so that all lenders  can operate under this same principle: that we judge consumers  individually rather than by the industry they are in.   Let me repeat that: that we judge consumers individually rather than  by the industry that they are in.   Mr. Luetkemeyer has been dedicated to that principle for years. I  have been honored to work with him in this endeavor and I am pleased to  be at this point where we have broad bipartisan support for this  legislation.   Again, my hat is off to Mr. Luetkemeyer. To all of my colleagues, I  urge a vote in favor of this underlying bill, in favor of a more  balanced regulatory scheme, and a bill in favor of increased public  safety.
