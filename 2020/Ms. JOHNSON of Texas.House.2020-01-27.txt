 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  4704, the--Advancing Research to Prevent Suicide Act. I want to thank  Representative McAdams for his leadership in this good bipartisan bill,  which I am proud to cosponsor.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        January 27, 2020, on page H550, the following appeared:  Madam Speaker, I rise today to support S. 153,  the Supporting Veterans in STEM Careers Act.   The future of this Nation will be driven by science, technology,  engineering, and mathematics. STEM careers are among the fastest  growing and highest-paying occupations. Despite these trends, we are  failing to produce enough STEM workers to support the current pace of  growth and innovation and ensure we continue to lead the world in  science and technology development.   As a Nation, we are forever indebted to the men and women who choose  to serve in the military and put their lives on the line to protect the  freedoms that we hold dear. At a minimum, we must ensure veterans  interested in pursuing STEM careers here at home have the support that  they need.   Veterans are uniquely positioned to contribute to our STEM workforce,  often having training in cybersecurity, avionics, nuclear physics, and  medicine. However, significant obstacles often stand in their way when  transitioning to a civilian STEM career.   S. 153 establishes an interagency working group to identify these  obstacles and develop a plan for addressing them. The bill also directs  the National Science Foundation to improve its outreach to veterans and  report on veterans in the STEM workforce. These are important steps for  honoring our commitment to our veterans and for ensuring we have a  competitive STEM workforce.   I want to thank Representatives Dunn and Lamb, and our colleagues in  the Senate, Senators Rubio and Klobuchar, for their leadership on this  important issue. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the  following exchange of correspondence between myself and Veterans'  Affairs Committee Chairman Takano. I appreciate his willingness to work  with us to pass this bill today and send it to the President for  signature.                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Veterans' Affairs,                                    Washington DC, January 24, 2020.      Hon. Eddie Bernice Johnson,      Chairwoman, Science, Space, and Technology Committee, House           of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Johnson: I am writing with respect to S.       153, the Supporting Veterans in STEM Careers Act. Thank you       for  [[Page H553]]       consulting with the Committee on Veterans' Affairs regarding       the matters in S. 153 that fall within the Committee's       jurisdiction.        As a result of your consultation with us on this measure       and in order to expeditiously move the bill to the floor, I       forego further consideration of S. 153. The Committee on       Veterans' Affairs takes this action with our mutual       understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction over the       subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and       the Committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as       the bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may       address any remaining issues that fall within our       jurisdiction. Further, I request your support for the       appointment of an appropriate number of conferees from the       Committee on Veterans' Affairs during any House-Senate       conference involving this or similar legislation.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding regarding S. 153 and would ask       that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be       included in the Committee Report and the Congressional Record       during floor consideration of the measure. Thank you for the       cooperative spirit in which you have worked regarding this       matter and others between our respective committees.
