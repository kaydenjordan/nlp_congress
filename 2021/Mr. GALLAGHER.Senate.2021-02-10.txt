 Mr. President, you have got to stop this.       You are the only person who can call this off. Call it off.    And then, when the President didn't answer his pleas on Twitter,  Representative Gallagher went on live television.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)          I mean, this is insane. I mean--I--I have       not seen anything like this since I deployed to Iraq in 2007       and 2008. I mean, this is America, and this is what is       happening right now. We need--the President needs to call it       off. Like, call it off. Call it off.    Representative Gallagher, you see there, said he had not seen  anything like this since he was deployed in Iraq.   The message around the President was clear, from everyone: You need  to call this off. Stop it.   But does he? No. His next tweet was not until about 3:13 p.m. Once  again, it is important to consider what was happening between Donald  Trump's 2:38 p.m. tweet and his next tweet at 3:13 p.m.   You will see footage from the attack during that time on the right  and Donald Trump's tweet on the left.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         Unidentified Speaker. We've been informed that protesters       have penetrated the Capitol.        Unidentified Speaker. This is my fucking building.        Unidentified Speaker. I tell ya, the sentiment in the       streets is really getting to a different level. This is       spinning out of control. This is turning violent. This is       getting dangerous.        Unidentified Speaker. Stand up for America.        Unidentified Speaker. Don't touch me        Unidentified Speaker. Don't get in his way.        Unidentified Speaker. Get the fuck out of here.    This isn't 10 minutes into the insurrection. This isn't just after  his speech earlier that day. That is what our Commander in Chief saw  happening, and that was his response.   You will notice one of the things he says to his mob, to these  insurrectionists, rather than to stop or to leave, was to say thank  you. Thank you. Thank you for what? Thank you for shattering the  windows and destroying property? Thank you for injuring more than 140  police officers? Thank you for putting in danger all of our lives and  the lives of our families?   How about, instead of ``thank you,'' Donald Trump, on that day, acted  like our Commander in Chief and stopped this, as only he could, and  told those people to leave.   Here is what former Governor Chris Christie, his very good friend,  said after that tweet.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         Mr. Christie. It's pretty simple. The President caused this       protest to occur. He is the only one who can make it stop.       What the President said is not good enough. The President has       to come out and tell his supporters to leave the Capitol       grounds and to allow the Congress to do their business       peacefully, and anything short of that is an abrogation of       his responsibility.    He is right. Chris Christie is right. We know how Donald Trump acts  on Twitter and otherwise when he has a message to convey. In fact, I  asked you to remember those tweets earlier this morning when he yelled  on Twitter: ``STOP THE COUNT.''   When he wanted to incite his supporters to show up on January 6,  President Trump tweeted 16 times between midnight on January 5 and his  noon rally/speech the next day--16 times to get them to do something he  wanted. And his message in those 16 times was clear: ``Fight.'' ``Stay  strong.'' ``Be strong.''   But when the violence started, he never once said the one thing  everyone around him was begging him to say: Stop the attack. He refused  to stop it. And as Governor Christie and Representative Kinzinger and  others made clear, only Donald Trump could have stopped that attack.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)
