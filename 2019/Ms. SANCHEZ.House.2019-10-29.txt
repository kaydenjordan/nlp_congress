 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this  resolution to recognize the Armenian genocide.   This tragedy is one of the most painful moments in our world's  history. We owe it to the more than 2 million victims and their  decendents never to forget.   It is heartbreaking that some choose to deny our past rather than to  learn from this painful moment in history. It is an insult to millions  who died and the millions who risked their lives to escape violence.   Denial is all too easy. It is harder to face the truth, and facing  the truth is the right thing to do.   When we rewrite the darkest chapters of our history, we open the door  to them happening again. The United States cannot be complicit in that  denial.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to send a resounding message to the  world that we stand with the Armenian community: We will not forget; we  will not obscure.
