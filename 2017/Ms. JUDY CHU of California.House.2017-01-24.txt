 Madam Speaker, on Saturday, millions of  people took a stand against the assault on women's rights. Today, I  stand with them once again to say we have had enough.   Only 2 days after these historic marches, Republicans in Congress  have introduced H.R. 7 to silence women by limiting their  constitutional right to make personal choices about their reproductive  health, without undue government interference.   H.R. 7 is a woman's health catastrophe. Not only would it codify the  discriminatory Hyde amendment, it would penalize employers who offer  healthcare plans with comprehensive coverage and prevent the 80 percent  of ACA enrollees who receive subsidies from purchasing plans that cover  abortion services. In effect, it makes abortion an option only for the  wealthy.   The law of the land does not say that only some women have the right  to choose; it says that all women have the right to choose.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this reckless legislation.
