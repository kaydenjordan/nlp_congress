 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Aaron  Warner, CEO of ProCircular Inc., in Coralville, Iowa, who was named  Iowa's 2023 Small Business Person of the Year.   Mr. Warner founded ProCircular in 2016 with the goal of being a  dedicated cybersecurity and compliance firm, offering analysis,  testing, governance, risk management, and compliance services. In the  company's first year, its revenue grew over 200 percent and has  continued to grow steadily year over year. The company now has 69 full- time staff and 19 interns.   In addition to running a booming small business, Mr. Warner is also  heavily involved in his community. He volunteers with a number of  different organizations, including the Technology Association of Iowa,  the Iowa City Area Development Group, Junior Achievement, Rotary  International, and the March of Dimes. He and his wife also started a  trust to provide scholarships to students in need.   Mr. Warner is truly a pillar of his community and very deserving of  this honor. I look forward to seeing what the future holds as his  business and activism in southeast Iowa continue to grow.                        Recognizing Police Canine Kilo     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize police  canine Kilo, of the Indianola Police Department, for assisting in a  drug bust during his first week of being on patrol with his handler,  Officer Treyton Nixon.   As the newest member of the Indianola Police Department, Kilo made an  immediate impact by helping find over 7 grams of methamphetamine during  a traffic stop.   A canine's keen sense of smell helps them to detect items that a  human officer might miss, especially drugs and bombs. In a time when  record levels of illicit narcotics are pouring in through our southern  border and killing American citizens, poisoning them with synthetic  fentanyl, it is increasingly important that police departments utilize  every resource available to keep their communities safe.   I hope Kilo sets the example and proves the need for canine units  across our police forces, including at the border. If one canine  officer could handle this drug bust in Indianola, imagine what a full  squad could accomplish at our ports of entry.   Thank you, Kilo, for your service to the city of Indianola. We wish  him and the rest of the Indianola Police Department the very best in  the future.                    Monitoring Mississippi River Flooding     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss major  flooding in seven counties in southeast Iowa along the Mississippi  River.   I appreciate Governor Reynolds' efforts to protect these communities,  and I encourage residents in these areas to stay cautious.   Each year, as snow north of Iowa melts, it floods the communities  along the Mississippi River in Iowa. While these floods can be  devastating, we are lucky to be able to predict the severity of floods  each year.   In Davenport, crews have been working 24-hour shifts at pump stations  for over a week to protect their 9 miles of the riverfront.   As we continue to monitor the flooding, I remain grateful for the  close eye of the Governor's office, disaster resources, and the United  States Army Corps of Engineers' efforts to ensure pumps are working  flawlessly.   I also appreciate the University of Iowa Flood Center to be able to  monitor and sense rising waters.   My office remains open as a resource if southeast Iowans are in need  of assistance. Together, we can again power through this flooding  season.   I want to take a moment to wish a very happy birthday to my sister,  Mariette Stanson.   Happy birthday, Mariette.                            ____________________
