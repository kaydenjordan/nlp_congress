 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.   I applaud Mr. Schneider and Mr. Zeldin for sponsoring this important  resolution. I especially thank Chairman Eliot Engel for his very  eloquent comments a moment ago.   Not wishing to be redundant, I will just say this because I associate  myself with their strong and persuasive remarks: The great former  Soviet refusenik and religious prisoner Natan Sharansky, who testified  at two of about a dozen hearings that I have chaired on combating anti- Semitism, proposed what he called a simple test to help us distinguish  legitimate criticism of Israel from anti-Semitism. Sharansky called it  the three Ds, demonization, double standard, and delegitimization.   When the three Ds are advanced, we know that anti-Semitism is the  issue. The BDS movement demonizes Israel and, by extension, Jews, who  are always cast in the role of oppressors, who are always in the wrong.  In so doing, it applies a double standard, whereby Israel is always  wrong and the oppressed Palestinians are always in the right,  regardless of whether groups such as Hamas are engaging in terroristic  acts upon Israeli citizens. The objective of this is to delegitimize  the State of Israel, to deny its very right to exist.   Mr. Speaker, I applaud them on this bill, and I hope this vote is  unanimous.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for  yielding. I yield myself 2 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer my strong support for H.R. 1837, the  U.S.-Israel Cooperation Enhancement and Regional Security Act,  supported and introduced by Mr. Deutch and Mr. Wilson. I thank them for  their leadership, as well as Eliot Engel and   Michael McCaul, our  ranking member.   Israel is by far our closest ally in the Middle East with which we  share common values, including a commitment to democracy and to the  rule of law.   Sadly, Israel often comes under attack, at the United Nations and in  the region, both by words and by bullets. Israel is judged by a double  standard by which real or imagined flaws are magnified, while Israel's  virtues as a robust democracy are ignored.   Mr. Speaker, we must stand with Israel, and this bill is a means to  achieve that. Among other things, it would authorize--and this is the  core of the bill--it would authorize military financing for Israel at  $3.3 billion per year, over 10 years, and enhanced cooperation with our  key ally in a host of other areas from cybersecurity, to agriculture,  to assisting veterans.   It is mutually beneficial, allowing us to access Israel's knowledge  and to benefit from its leadership in sectors such as desalinization  technology, which has helped make the desert bloom, one of the most  visually-evident ways Israel has positively impacted the land.   The bill encourages energy cooperation in the Eastern Mediterranean  which, presumably, includes ongoing ventures with friendly countries,  such as Greece and Cyprus. In short, the bill greatly enhances the  mutually-beneficial ties which exist between our two great nations.   This is a good piece of legislation. It is bipartisan, and I strongly  urge my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon).   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, I think this is a  very important bill, and I am proud to support H.R. 1837, the United  States-Israel Cooperation Enhancement and Regional Security Act, that  will make our bilateral security and economic cooperation stronger and  more stable than ever before.  [[Page H7198]]    On September 14 of 2016, the U.S. and Israel signed a memorandum of  understanding ensuring $33 billion of military and strategic support  over a 10-year period.                                time  1630    It reaffirmed the importance of continuing annual U.S. military  assistance to Israel, our cooperative missile defense programs, in  addition to other shared economic and technology interests.   The bill before us codifies that assistance for the next 10 years,  while providing us with the flexibility to increase that support should  Israel be under an imminent threat of a military attack.   It strengthens Israel's qualitative military edge and advances our  collaboration on a range of issues, such as cybersecurity and space  exploration, as well as authorizing $12 million for the U.S.-Israel  Energy Center and, through USAID, advances our common goals of  promoting agriculture, education, and trade with other countries around  the world.   As our strongest and most capable ally in a turbulent region, Israel  is an essential U.S. strategic partner.   Israel is also a target for hostile actors who call for her  destruction. Just 2 months ago, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas  terrorist groups launched over 600 rockets and mortars at Israeli  civilian targets, killing four and wounding eight. May was Israel's  deadliest month in almost 2 years.   In addition to the threat coming from these terrorist groups, Israel  faces a threat of a resurgent Iran, whose militias and proxies, from  Iraq to Syria to Lebanon, continue to grow in numbers, weapons, and  strength.   Just recently, Chairman Deutch and I heard firsthand from Prime  Minister Netanyahu some of these complex and serious existential  challenges that seek to undermine our strategic ally.   Mr. Speaker, it is now more important than ever that the United  States stand with the democratic Jewish State of Israel and what she  represents, which is freedom, democracy, and equality in that region.  For that, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume to close.   I want to, first of all, thank the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss  Gonzalez-Colon) for her very eloquent statement and for her deep  concern for the State of Israel. I thank her for that leadership.   I would also like to thank, in closing, Mr. Deutch, Mr. Wilson,  Chairman Engel, Ranking Member McCaul, and the Foreign Affairs  Committee membership for their bipartisan work, and the staff, to  ensure that the United States and Israel can work together to respond  to shared challenges.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1850, the Palestinian  International Terrorism Support Prevention Act of 2019.   In so doing, I first want to note Congressman Brian Mast's great  personal sacrifice in the war against terror and how inspirational it  is for each and every one of us to see him raise his voice time and  again in this great battle of our age.   I also want to thank my good friend from New Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer)  for his lead cosponsorship of this legislation.   H.R. 1850 would require the President to report to Congress on those  who knowingly provide financial and material support to terror groups  such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and then apply sanctions.  These groups in particular have vowed to wipe out our ally Israel, and  their support of terror is well known.   Beyond that, the legislation would require a listing of foreign  countries where Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad engage in  fundraising, financing, or money laundering, as well as list those  countries which fail to take adequate measures to freeze the assets of  these known terror groups.   Mr. Speaker, Hamas, a designated foreign terrorist organization, has  killed over 400 Israelis and 25 Americans, rules the Gaza Strip with an  iron fist, and uses its proximity to threaten Israel with impunity. As  a result, the Israelis live in constant fear of Hamas rockets, tunnels,  and other means of bringing violence to Israeli citizens.   Earlier this year, in a single weekend, Hamas fired over 600 rockets  into Israel, killing four civilians, including an American.  [[Page H7202]]    As part of our close partnership with Israel, the United States has  long sought to help Israel counter that threat. We have worked together  on development of the Iron Dome aerial defense system. We continue to  work together on counter-tunnelling technology.   And again, now, with this bill, we will help Israel to counter Hamas  and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad by denying these groups the use of  funds for their terror operations.   For over a decade, Mr. Speaker, the executive branch, across multiple  administrations, has sanctioned many individuals as well as a select  number of foreign entities that are associated with Hamas, all under  the general authority of broad executive order.   This bill will codify and standardize those sanctions in statute and  require the administration to comprehensively assess whether other  supporters of Hamas should be sanctioned who have thus far remained  unaffected by their support of this terrorist group.   The bill also requires the President to report on whether foreign  governments are supporting Hamas or the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.   Mr. Speaker, we know well that Iran is the world's leading state  sponsor of terrorism, and Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad are  among Iran's many terrorist beneficiaries. In fact, it was reported  just a few days ago a senior Hamas delegation was in Tehran.   This legislation will ensure that the Iranian regime is held to  account for its maligned activity undermining peace and security in the  Middle East. Bahrain's Foreign Minister said, last week, were it not  for Iran's support for Hamas, there would be a better chance of  achieving peace between Israel and the Palestinians.   The goal of this legislation is to cut off Iran's support for  terrorism and, therefore, make peace more probable.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 358, calling on the  Government of Cameroon and armed groups to respect fundamental human  rights and pursue dialogue to resolve the crisis in the anglophone  region of that country.   Mr. Speaker, I especially want to thank Congresswoman Karen Bass, the  chairwoman of the Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and  International Organizations Subcommittee, of which I serve as the  ranking member, for this resolution. It is a bipartisan resolution,  and, again, I thank her for her leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I would note that in the last Congress, I chaired a  hearing on this Cameroon crisis as it was festering, seeking a way  forward for peace. Sadly, that effort and all efforts made by the  international community have been elusive thus far.   The conflict in Cameroon has its roots in long-simmering tensions  between that country's francophone majority and the anglophone  minority, concentrated in the northwest and southwest regions.   In 2016, protests by anglophone teachers and lawyers over  marginalization and the lack of government services were met with a  heavy-handed response. The government failed to genuinely address those  legitimate grievances, which further inflamed tensions.   Brutal fighting between government security forces and local armed  groups who called for separatism continues.   Today, there are over 500,000 displaced persons in the anglophone  region.   Mr. Speaker, entire communities have been burned to the ground.  Humanitarian convoys struggle to reach local populations or are even  blocked and attacked by armed groups. Over half of the health  facilities and hospitals have been damaged and forced to close.  Children have been out of school for over 2 years.   According to the U.S. Department of State's Human Rights Report on  Cameroon from 2018: ``Government security forces were widely believed  to be responsible for disappearances of suspected anglophone  separatists, with reports of bodies dumped far from the site of the  killings to make identification difficult.''   This, in turn, is fueling resentment and separatist violence.   This resolution reiterates the U.S. position that all parties must  immediately cease fighting and come to the negotiating table without  preconditions. The Swiss-led mediation process is a hopeful step in  that direction, which deserves support.   I would also note the critical role that has been played by the  Catholic church, in particular Cardinal Tumi, in trying to reach common  ground, and the need to support such efforts.   Hopefully, by weighing in, Congress can help promote the cause of  peace and justice in the Republic of Cameroon.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
