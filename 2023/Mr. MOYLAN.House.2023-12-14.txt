 Mr. Speaker, I would like to express my heartfelt  gratitude to Speaker Emeritus McCarthy for his dedication and service  in Congress and for leading the Republican Party courageously.   We saw this year how he prioritized doing the right thing and  maintaining his integrity above all else, regardless of the  consequences. His unwavering support for my district, the island of  Guam, and his tireless efforts in fighting for the island's interests  will never be forgotten.   His legacy will continue to inspire future leaders and his impact  will be felt for years to come in my district and in the Halls of  Congress.   Mr. Speaker, as Speaker McCarthy embarks on new endeavors, I know  that he will be greatly missed. May God bless and guide him in all his  future endeavors.
