 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for  his kind remarks and for his tremendous leadership.   From the first minutes of the assault on our country, Chairman Nadler  was there to meet the needs of our country as we protected, but also to  meet the needs of those who rushed in to save lives.   I want to also salute Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney, who has worn a  firefighters jacket through the heat of the summer now, but all spring,  until this bill was brought up on the floor. I thank the gentlewoman  for not only wearing the jacket, but for her relentless, persistent  advocacy on behalf of our 9/11 heroes.   I am so proud that this time this bill is bipartisan, and I thank the  distinguished gentleman, Mr. King from New York, for his leadership,  for his recognition of the bipartisan nature of what we are doing, what  we did then and what we are doing now. I thank the gentleman, Mr. King,  for his leadership as well.   H.R. 1327 is the Never Forget the Heroes: James Zadroga, Ray Pfeifer,  and Luis Alvarez Permanent Authorization of the September 11th Victim  Compensation Fund Act--a big name, a tall order, and long overdue.                                time  1100    When we talk about 9/11, we tread on sacred ground. On that dark day,  our Nation suffered loss we could never have imagined, and we witnessed  heroism that we will never forget.   Because of our heroes, 9/11 is etched in our Nation's history not  only as a day of profound loss and tragedy but also a day of powerful  unity and resilience. On September 11 and in its aftermath, our brave  first responders were there for us. We must always be there for them.   The Never Forget the Heroes Act takes long-overdue action to provide  the financial security and support that 9/11 heroes, survivors, and  families deserve. Today, we are honored to take this action to ensure  that all people suffering from illnesses related to 9/11 or by the  debris removal and cleanup efforts in their aftermath and their  families get the full awards they have been promised.   It is critically important that we restore the compensation to those  hit by drastic, unfair cuts and ensure that their claims will be fully  paid in the future.   One of the reasons that we have to have this additional legislation  is because there are so many more diagnoses of cancer and the rest that  followed.   This bill honors the heroes after which it is named, James Zadroga,  Ray Pfeifer, and Luis Alvarez. Those heroes showed courage beyond  measure not only by running toward danger that day but by giving their  last days to fight for all harmed on 9/11.   We are blessed by the presence of members of their families and other  advocates, including first responders suffering from 9/11-related  illnesses, here in the Capitol today. They have done the outside  organizing as we did the inside maneuvering. They have made the  complete difference.   I thank Jon Stewart for raising the profile of this issue so that  when we pass the bill here today, it will be received positively by the  United States Senate.   Two weeks ago, as we all know, America lost Luis Alvarez, an NYPD  detective and advocate who died from 9/11-related cancer. It was a holy  moment for us when he testified before Congress last month before he  was scheduled to receive his 69th round of chemotherapy. He said then  to Congress: ``You all said you would never forget. Well, I'm here to  make sure that you don't.''   With this bill, we honor the sacrifice of Luis and many other heroes  and say: We will never forget.   Madam Speaker, I urge a strong, overwhelming, bipartisan vote for  this bill for our responders, survivors, and their families and do so  with eternal gratitude to them for what they have done. I urge a  ``yes'' vote.
