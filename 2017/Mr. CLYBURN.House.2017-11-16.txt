 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Larson for yielding me this  time.   Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today is a wolf in sheep's clothing.  Republicans can dress it up and call it good names, but that will not  change the fact that H.R. 1 is a scam that will be perpetrated on  America's middle-income families.   This bill will make it harder to own a home, raise a family, and  afford a postsecondary education.   It should come as no surprise that President Trump wanted to call the  bill: ``Cut, Cut, Cut.'' That would have been apropos. The first cut is  for him and his family, the second cut is for his wealthy friends, and  the third cut is for large corporations and businesses that ship jobs  overseas.   H.R. 1 certainly does not cut taxes for middle-income families or  small businesses; in fact, it does just the opposite.   Under H.R. 1, millions of Americans, middle-income families, will pay  more--500,000 of whom live in South Carolina. Middle-income families  and first-time homeowners who utilize mortgage interest deductions will  pay more, because the GOP scam lowers the cap, making homeownership  more expensive and driving down property taxes for current homeowners.   Middle-income families with children in college or recent graduates  will pay more, because the GOP scam eliminates deductions for interest  on student loans. This includes 12 million American families, 156,000  of whom are South Carolinians.                                time  1100    Middle-income families struggling to pay costly medical bills will  pay more because the GOP scam shamefully eliminates that deductibility.  This includes 9 million American families, and nearly 140,000 live in  South Carolina.   Middle-income families with children in daycare, nursery school, or  aging parents will pay more because the GOP scam eliminates the  deductions for dependent care assistance.   Middle-income schoolteachers will pay more because the GOP scam  eliminates their ability to deduct the cost of the supplies they  purchase for their classrooms.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1 is an attack on middle-income families. It will  subject the good people of this country to a second Great Recession and  raise taxes on 36 million middle-income households.   According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, this GOP  tax scam will add $1.5 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years  and trigger massive funding cuts across the government next year.  Medicare will see a $25 billion-per-year cut.
