 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank the line workers in my  district. They are literally keeping the lights on.   When ice storms hit, when the winds are hitting 60-miles-an-hour in  my district, when we are warm in bed, the folks who work on the power  lines are getting in their trucks and they are working in these  conditions to keep and get the lights on.   Power transmission is not sexy. It does not get the status and the  attention that a Tesla does or that many of our electrification  projects do. But transmission is critical for grid resiliency and clean  energy. We have got to focus our efforts on increasing transmission  capacity.   I take this opportunity to specifically thank the linemen in my  county, Skamania County. A few weeks ago, we had a huge winter storm. I  woke up to 20 inches. A lot of people like me get our water from a  well, so when the power is out, we don't have water.   From the bottom of my heart, I thank all of those line folks who are  keeping the power on, getting up in the middle of the night, and taking  care of our power supply.                       Funding for Water Infrastructure     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about water  infrastructure in my community.   A few weeks ago, I was reviewing congressional funding requests, and  one pervasive theme that came up over and over was municipal water  infrastructure problems in the district. This issue touches every  county in my district and every home, from Underwood to Long Beach to  Washougal.   Over and over, we see infrastructure that is past its recommended  life span, undersized, or on the brink of collapse, frankly. In order  to resolve this, communities are forced to either slap a Band-Aid on it  or take out massive loans. Some wastewater systems are also beginning  to fail, and they have been releasing sewage into the environment,  which places a lot of people at risk.   Local governments alone can't address this issue. In the past, the  government has mandated state-of-the-art equipment, essentially  requiring that these folks put a Lamborghini sewer system in when what  they really need is a Toyota Corolla. This makes it incredibly  expensive and difficult to keep up with maintenance in a small  community.   I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to pass Federal legislation that will ensure all Americans have  access to clean energy.                         Prescription Drug Shortages     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the drug  shortages happening across the country.   Like most Americans, I live on a budget. My monthly prescription just  went from $16 a month to $250 a month, and we are seeing this across  the board. We are seeing shortages in Infants' Tylenol and in cough  syrup. We have shortages of vital drugs. It is becoming incredibly  difficult for everyday people to keep up with the cost of these  necessary medications.   No surprise, Big Pharma can find the capacity to manufacture the  expensive on-brand drugs, and they are actively stonewalling efforts to  produce the generic drugs that working families can actually afford.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  address this critical issue and ensure folks across the Nation can  access their medications.                        In Support of Law Enforcement     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of law enforcement  officers in my district and across the Nation.   The national starting wage for police officers is $67,000 annually.  That is not very much, folks. These are careers that we are asking  people to step into the line of fire for us, and these wages do not  reflect the risks of the job.   As a result, no surprise, recruitment and retention of good officers  is the top issue facing law enforcement agencies across the country.  But our Federal priorities don't reflect this necessity. We are  continually funding capital projects and not operating expenses. So  while the cost of living is going up and up and up, we are funding, I  kid you not, body cameras for dogs.   In my district, one of my local sheriff's offices received Federal  funding  [[Page H1472]]  for dog body cameras at a time when their deputy wages are struggling  to keep up with the cost of living. We have got to make sure Federal  resources are being spent wisely, not on, literally, pet projects.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in working to realign  our Federal spending to reflect the real issues facing law enforcement.                    Celebrating the Life of Larry Cassidy     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of Larry  Cassidy.   When I first met Larry, I remember how amazed I was by his constant  positivity. Larry was born in Portland but moved to Vancouver, the good  side of the river, his home since 1966. He was a husband, father, and  grandfather. He was passionate about salmon and steelhead in the  Northwest and was a community activist and conservationist before  receiving a Governor-appointed position on the Washington Game  Commission.   Sadly, Larry passed away in January of this year after battling  prostate cancer for 25 years.   I thank Larry for being a friend and a mentor. I stand with my  community in being grateful to Larry for all he did in Washington's  Third Congressional District.                            ____________________
