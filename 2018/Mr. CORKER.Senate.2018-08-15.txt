Transmittal No. 18-27       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The MK 54 Torpedo is a conventional torpedo that can be       launched from surface ships, helicopters, and fixed wing       aircraft. The MK 54 is an upgrade to the MK 46 Torpedo, which       is currently in-service in Netherlands. The upgrade to the MK       54 entails replacement of the torpedo's sonar and guidance       and control systems with modem technology. The new guidance       and control system uses a mixture of commercial-off-the-shelf       and custom-built electronics. The warhead, fuel tank and       propulsion system from the MK 46 torpedo are re-used in the       MK 54 configuration with minor modifications. There is no       sensitive technology in the MK 54 or its support and test       equipment. The assembled MK 54 torpedo and several of its       individual components are classified CONFIDENTIAL. The MK 54       operational software is classified as SECRET. Netherlands       will not be provided with the source code for the MK 54       operational software.        2. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures or       equivalent systems which might reduce system effectiveness or       be used in the development of a system with similar or       advanced capabilities.        3. A determination has been made that the Government of the       Netherlands can provide substantially the same degree of       protection for the sensitive technology being released as the       U.S. Government. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the       U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives outlined       in the Policy Justification.        4. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Netherlands.                            ____________________
