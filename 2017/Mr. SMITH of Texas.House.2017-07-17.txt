 Mr. Speaker, if Donald Trump, Jr., were a  Democrat, the media would be defending him for doing what every  campaign does: conducting opposition research. The media would be  praising him for ending a meeting when it became obvious there was no  evidence to back up an informant's allegations. The media would be  pointing out that many countries' leaders openly supported Barack Obama  for President, including those from the United Kingdom, France, Sweden,  and Nicaragua.   Maybe the real crime is the media's double standard. In their  irrational obsession with destroying the Trump Presidency, the liberal  media have forgotten journalism's profound responsibility: to be fair  and objective.                            ____________________
