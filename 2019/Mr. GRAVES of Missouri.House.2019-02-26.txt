 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the President clearly laid out the case for the  declaration of a national emergency in his State of the Union Address  right here. National  [[Page H2131]]  security is obviously the President's highest priority, and I support  his efforts to build a wall.   There is a crisis. There is a crisis at the border that could have  been addressed much sooner and prevented. Open border policies of the  last administration compounded this growing problem.   We have schools, hospitals, and other services that have become  overcrowded. American workers have been hurt by reduced job  opportunities and lower wages. At the same time, human and drug  trafficking has thrived.   In many communities, the notorious MS-13 gang has grown. We have seen  tragic cases of crimes committed by illegal aliens who have been  deported not once, not even twice, but multiple times.   I want to cite just one example from my home State of Missouri. A man  named Pablo Serrano-Vitorino was deported to Mexico after a felony  conviction in 2003. He later returned to this country illegally and was  arrested again in 2014 and 2015 after several more violent incidents,  but he remained in the U.S.   Then, in 2016, this individual, who had no right to be in this  country, was charged for murdering five people in Kansas City, Kansas,  and Montgomery County, Missouri.   Stories like this are not unique to Missouri, Mr. Speaker. These  horrifying events are happening across this country.   This is a crisis. The men and women who put their lives on the line  every day to bring order and security to our borders deserve the tools  that they need to do the job, and now this President is taking decisive  action to finally address the crisis using the authority provided to  him by the Congress.   The National Emergencies Act is very clear. The provisions the  President will use under title 10 explicitly provide the President with  clear authority.   I support the President's efforts. I believe he is well within the  law in making this declaration, and I urge my colleagues to oppose H.J.  Res. 46.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, let's be clear: Congress  explicitly authorized the President to undertake certain military  construction projects that are not otherwise authorized by law when it  passed the National Security Act. The President is working within the  legal boundaries that the Congress gave him.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Meadows).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins), who is on the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much  time is remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I might remind my colleagues that Title 10, Section 2808, explicitly  authorizes the President to change the appropriation for military  construction. He is operating within the law.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr.  Rogers), who is also the ranking Republican of the Committee on  Homeland Security.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I might point out to my colleagues just how much of a national  emergency this is.                                time  1600    It was President Obama who recognized the crisis at the border. In  2014, President Obama requested $3.7 billion in emergency supplemental  funding for what he described as a humanitarian crisis, a humanitarian  crisis at the border. He specifically cited an increase in family units  trying to cross the border and the lack of resources to accommodate  them.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr.  Aderholt).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Crawford).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire the amount of time  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from West Virginia (Mrs. Miller).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Olson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from West Virginia (Mrs. Miller).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Kinzinger), who just came back from  deployment down at the southern border.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we did take an oath of office to defend the  Constitution. The Constitution applies to citizens of the United  States. It does not apply to people who are not citizens of the United  States.   Border security officers have made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens  in the last 2 fiscal years.   These include criminal aliens charged or convicted of assaults, sex  crimes, and killings. These are not victimless crimes.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1645     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we keep hearing that most drugs coming into this country  are coming in at ports of entry, and I would make a correction: Most  drugs that are caught are caught at ports of entry. We don't have any  idea what is coming in across the border.   When we say that, this is like saying we are going to reinforce the  front door, but we are going to leave the back door wide open. We don't  know how many drugs or the amount of drugs that are coming across the  border, particularly in rural areas, because we just simply can't  patrol it.   As the gentleman from Illinois pointed out, you can't deploy Border  Patrol quick enough to catch much of this. So we don't know how many  drugs are coming through in other areas. We have a pretty good idea at  ports of entry because we catch them there.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I make a point of clarification because the statement  was made that individuals from outside this country coming to ports of  entry seeking asylum were entitled to that. No one outside of this  country is entitled to anything in this country.   They can be heard, but they are not entitled to asylum in the United  States just because they ask for it, just because they seek it. They  aren't entitled to anything within this country.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, is the majority prepared to  close?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   I find it ironic, I guess, and actually it is kind of ludicrous, that  we talk so much about how much this wall is going to cost and how  inhumane it is and how immoral it is, yet we build thousands and  thousands of miles and spend millions and millions of dollars on noise  abatement wall, 30 feet high and 20 feet high, in our suburbs and our  urban areas all over the country. Yet we can't do something to protect  our border.    That is not a crisis, Mr. Speaker. This is a crisis. What we are  talking about today is a crisis.   President Obama agreed when he requested emergency funding in 2014 to  deal with the crisis on the border, when he declared a national  emergency because of transnational drug traffickers.   Since fiscal year 2012, Customs and Border Patrol has seized 4  million pounds of drugs at ports of entry and more than 11 million  pounds of drugs between ports of entry. And nearly three times as many  drugs are seized between ports, Mr. Speaker.   Many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle recognize the  need for a border wall, voting to authorize a wall in 2016 and again  under President Obama in 2013. Last year, we passed bipartisan  legislation to address the growing impacts of opioids in our  communities, drugs that continue to flow into our country through our  southern border. We all agreed, on a bipartisan basis, that there was a  crisis, but now, suddenly, they are calling this a manufactured crisis.   The National Emergencies Act is clear, Mr. Speaker. The President's  authority is clear. The President is acting within the authority that  Congress has given him.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this resolution, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
