 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Protecting  Our Kids Act. I am a parent of two great kids. When they were young, my  husband or I would drop them off at school, and we were confident that  they were in a safe space. But for so many parents, that is no longer  the case.   I recently hosted a roundtable with some of the over 1,000  constituents who have written or called into my office following the  tragedies in Uvalde and Buffalo and the over 240 mass shootings in  2022.   It is heartbreaking to hear how parents have to explain to their kids  what to do if there is an active shooter, as if it is inevitable.   We know what we can do to help prevent future tragedies like Uvalde.  We can pass commonsense gun safety policies like this legislation.  Enough is enough. We have to end the senseless deaths of our children  and our neighbors. Vote ``yes.''
