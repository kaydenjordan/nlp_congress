 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a friend  and someone I looked up to, Mayor Greg Pettis, of Cathedral City,  California.   Motivated by his drive to fix the injustices that the LGBTQ community  faced back in the late eighties, Greg took action and entered public  life during a time when acceptance and understanding was not the norm.  He inspired many, including me, by taking a courageous stance and  living life as his true self, becoming Riverside County's first openly  gay elected official. It was Greg's persistence that encouraged me to  continue pursuing my passion to serve my community, regardless of the  setbacks I faced as an openly gay person.   Though he was initially motivated by his passion to improve the lives  of LGBTQ people, his lifetime of service brought justice to all people.  As mayor of Cathedral City, Greg helped improve transportation  infrastructure in his region and recognized LGBTQ veterans in his city  by erecting a monument in their honor. If his memorial service was any  indication, Mayor Pettis' legacy will live on for years to come.                            ____________________
