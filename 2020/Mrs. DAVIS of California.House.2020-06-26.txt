 Mr. Speaker, there are 240,000 defrauded  students waiting for student loan relief. Over 40,000 of those students  are from my home State of California.   After doing nothing for students who have been defrauded by predatory  colleges, the Department has come out with a new borrower defense rule  that only makes things worse--in several ways--under the guise of  protecting the taxpayer from footing the bill. But we have to remember,  our students are taxpayers, too.   This new rule clearly gives preference to the very colleges causing  the harm from the borrower defense rule that it was intended to  prevent. If a school closes before delivering on its promises to  students, they should have automatic discharge of their loans to that  institution. Students who have spent years bettering themselves working  to get into jobs, sacrificing in the hope of improving financial  conditions for their families are being told that they simply don't  matter.   Colleges, on the other hand, can use this system to keep taking money  and they don't have to deliver what they promise. Our students deserve  protection from predatory practices.   Mr. Speaker, the resolution before us today is the first step toward  blocking the new fraud borrower defense rule from taking support, and I  urge its support.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to  take from the Speaker's table the concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res.  38) to establish the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural  Ceremonies for the inauguration of the President-elect and Vice  President-elect of the United States on January 20, 2021, and ask for  its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.
