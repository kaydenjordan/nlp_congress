 Mr. President, before addressing the topic that I want to  take up--and I know it is one that is near and dear to the Presiding  Officer's heart--which is rural healthcare, I want to express my  admiration and thanks to Senator Reed, the Senator from Rhode Island,  and Senator McCain for their incredible leadership of the Armed  Services Committee. They show us what it is like to lead. They show us  what it is like to take on difficult issues and to work out difficult  problems, and I would like to express my appreciation to them for that.   I see the Senator----    Absolutely.    Absolutely.    Absolutely.    I thank the Senator.   I say to Senator Reed, I appreciate your leadership.    Mr. President, I did a mathematic calculation a couple of  years ago, and it resulted in an interesting conclusion. The Senate is  a rural body. Eighteen Members of the U.S. Senate represent a majority  of Americans. That means 82 percent--or 82 out of 100 Senators-- represent smaller States, more rural communities.   Today, I want to talk about a disastrous development that is headed  for our rural communities that we have the capability to fix, and it is  one we should fix sooner rather than later. I am talking about Federal  funding for federally qualified health centers, which expired on  October 1. Seventy percent of the funding for the FQHCs expired on  October 1. One hundred percent of the National Health Service Corps  funding expired on October 1.   These are vital programs that serve rural America and provide  incredibly important healthcare services. They are an overlooked part  of our national healthcare system, in part because they are  traditionally in rural and outback locations.   In Maine, we have 20 centers and 70 facilities scattered all over our  State, and they are providing services every day to over 200,000  people. This is a vital part of our healthcare system. Yet the funding  expired at the end of September, and so far nothing has been done.   How important is it? In Maine, there are 1,700 employees at these  facilities; a total economic impact of over $300 million a year; $8  million in State and local tax revenue and $32 million in Federal tax  revenue. They provide $16 million worth of uncompensated care that goes  to Maine people who need the help. They are efficient. In Maine, they  have saved Medicaid over $100 million, and $257 million is the estimate  for what they have saved the overall healthcare system. Again, FQHCs  provide 1,700 jobs and support another 1,000 jobs in their communities.   But this isn't only about economics and economic development and  jobs; it is about healthcare. One in six people in Maine gets their  healthcare from FQHCs--210,000 people. They accept everybody who comes  to their door. I have been to them all over the State. They use a  sliding-fee scale for people who are low income, who don't have  insurance, and they provide all manner of services. It depends on the  center; different centers have different services. They have medical,  behavioral health, dental, substance abuse treatment and support, case  management, optometry, podiatry, OB/GYN, prescription assistance,  outreach and enrollment, pharmacy, radiology, and school-based  healthcare services. These are the healthcare providers for rural  America. And it is not only Maine; it is across the country. There are  10,000 sites across the United States. Some 26 million patients are at  risk.   Well, what is the big deal? The big deal is that people are going to  lose their healthcare services. We estimate that in Maine, we are going  to lose about 400 clinicians and administrative and support staff who  will have to be laid off at the beginning of the year unless we solve  this problem in the immediate future. At least 25 of these sites will  be forced to close, and we believe there will be almost 30,000 Maine  residents who will lose access to their healthcare system.   Most of the FQHCs--federally qualified health centers--are getting by  on their funding from last year, so the expiration of the funding  hasn't hit them yet, but it will begin to hit them on January 1. That  is what we have to respond to.   It is also already having an effect just by creating uncertainty. I  got an  [[Page S7291]]  impassioned letter from the leader of one of our centers in Maine about  the fact that they have been very diligently recruiting a dentist to  come to their community. Dentists are very hard to come by in rural  America. They had one who was ready to come, and then suddenly they  heard about the uncertainty surrounding the funding--that it may or may  not come through--and that dentist is now reconsidering their decision  to go to this Maine community. That is a tragedy. That is a tragedy for  the people of that town, where these services are literally not  available.   So what does it matter? It matters because we are talking about  people losing their healthcare services.   This has never been a partisan issue. I don't think there is a heck  of a lot of debate around here about the importance of FQHCs and that  we need to get them refunded. In fact, the Presiding Officer and  Senator Stabenow have sponsored a bill, the CHIME Act, that would  resolve this issue. We just need to get it on the floor and get it  done.   We have proved today by the passage of the National Defense  Authorization Act that we can take major issues, bring them to the  floor, and move them forward, especially those that aren't particularly  controversial. But my concern is that even though there doesn't seem to  be controversy, it is just not happening, and now our centers are  having to make plans for layoffs, for closures, and for closing their  doors to the people who need the care.   This is something we can do. This is something we can resolve. It is  within our power. The legislation is ready to go, and we should get  this done.   We are leaving today for the Thanksgiving holiday, but if we leave at  the end of the year and haven't done this, it will be a tragedy for  rural America. It will be a betrayal of rural America. It will be a  betrayal of our constituents.   All of us have been to these centers and seen the care that they  provide, the caring that they provide, the passion that the people  bring to the services in their communities, and how much they mean to  their communities. This is one of the best Federal programs ever  created, and it has always been supported on a bipartisan basis.   I urge my colleagues today to prepare ourselves to get this done as  soon as we possibly can when we get back after Thanksgiving. We have so  much to be thankful for, and I want my people in Maine to realize that  they can be thankful for those health centers that are literally  lifelines in their communities and mean so much to them. I believe this  is something we can and should and will do.   Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you for being a leader on this  issue.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________
