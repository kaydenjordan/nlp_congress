 Madam Speaker, I rise today in total opposition to H.R.  1, the Republican polluters over people act that just passed a few  minutes ago.   Why? Because our fossil fuel-driven economy is making us sick, and  H.R. 1 can, literally, kill us.   It comes back to community. I have heard directly from constituents  in my district, mayors and environmental activists who shared with me  how badly they need resources and support to address increased  flooding.   We know that it is happening because of increased extreme weather  events, and we know that it is happening worldwide. Catastrophic  floods, deadly heat waves, wildfires choking us with smoke. Oil, gas,  and coal are polluting our air and killing Americans every single year.  We have a climate catastrophe that is hitting Black and Brown  communities the hardest.   Instead of further subsidizing the fossil fuel industry with no  protections for people, we need to tackle the manmade climate crisis  with green investments that Democrats secured in the Inflation  Reduction Act.                            ____________________
