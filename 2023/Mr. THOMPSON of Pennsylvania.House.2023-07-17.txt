 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the passionate team of problem solvers at Common Threads, including its  executive officer and cofounder, Linda Novick O'Keefe.   Common Threads operates across the Nation, providing children,  educators, caregivers, and healthcare professionals with the resources,  curriculum, and training needed to champion healthy cooking and  nutrition education. Since its inception, Common Threads has reached  more than 550,000 students and 103,000 adults with more than 4.3  million snacks and meals served.   Common Threads recognizes nutrition education is the cornerstone to  healthier communities. Their programs give families the tools to make  better nutritional choices by focusing on nutrition basics, meal  affordability, and healthy substitutions.   There is a lot of talk about how food is medicine, but food is also  prevention. With effective and evidence-based nutrition education, we  can continue to curb the disastrous instances and impacts of diet- related chronic diseases.                            ____________________
