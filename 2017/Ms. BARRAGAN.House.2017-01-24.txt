 Madam Speaker, women's reproductive rights are under  attack. We have heard today H.R. 7 disproportionately affects women of  color and low-income women, like my family.   Growing up in Carson, California, my two older sisters got pregnant  as teenagers--one at 15 and one at 16--so I know from my own family  experience and personal experience the importance of being able to make  your own choices for your own body and your own beliefs. As a teenager  without health insurance, I, like many women in my community, relied on  services like Planned Parenthood to access contraception, which I would  not have been able to afford otherwise.  [[Page H644]]    Despite what the other side claims, taxpayer dollars do not fund  abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or to preserve the life of a  mother. Like millions of other women, I am grateful for these services  and the opportunity to make decisions that are right for me. I oppose  the attack on women's reproductive rights.
