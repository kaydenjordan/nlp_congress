 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the  dedicated public service and congressional career of a phenomenal  woman, Vivian Piereschi.   In August 2001, the people of south Florida's 20th Congressional  District, which later became the 23rd District that I proudly represent  today, received a precious gift in the dedicated service of Vivian.   After more than 20 years, this daughter of Cuban refugees, who  emigrated to Florida in search of a better life, ended her career  making the lives of so many others better.   Vivian became a trusted adviser, advocate, and community leader.   Through four administrations and two Members of Congress, Vivian  navigated the Federal Government, in all the ways it serves the  American people, with a nurturing spirit and patient persistence.   When we passed the Affordable Care Act, a jubilant Vivian Piereschi  said: ``Now, we can help so many more people.''   Whether it was passing life-changing legislation, going door-to-door  to give  [[Page H3980]]  hurricane relief and assistance, providing immigration help, or just  hugging the families that lost loved ones in the Surfside condo  tragedy, Vivian has always been there for our people.   Vivian sought out a career in public service to be a voice for the  voiceless, to speak for those who don't have a seat at the table. Every  day of her 20-plus years of service, she has done just that.   I know that Vivian will continue to do this self-sacrificing work as  she moves on to serve seniors in our community in her new role.   The constituents of Florida's 23rd Congressional District and the  State as a whole benefited from Vivian's dedicated, diligent work ethic  and her compassion.   I know that Vivian's husband, Alex, and sons, Eric and Nicholas, are  so proud of her and all the work that she has done, and so am I. I  thank Alex, Eric, and Nicholas for sacrificing their precious family  time with Vivian so she could serve the people of south Florida for all  these years.   I will miss my friend, but I know that we will end up spending many  more hours of personal time together.   On behalf of my constituents, current and former staff, and all its  stakeholders, we proudly thank Vivian and congratulate her as she  begins the next chapter of her service.   Te quiero, mi amiga. I love you, my friend.                            ____________________
