 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate  National Nurses Week. We all know a nurse who has helped us throughout  our time in life, and I am no different.   My story starts with my grandfather. He had an eighth-grade  education. He was a rancher. When his country called, he proudly served  in World War II. He came home and became a civil servant at Kelly Air  Force Base.   He went off to raise seven beautiful children. One of those was my  aunt, who became a nurse. And I have two cousins, Natalie and Sandy,  who are nurses.   But the story for me is much more personal than that. Ten days from  now will be my 3-year anniversary of life. I went into BAMC medical  facility for a routine procedure. I was intubated incorrectly. I coded.  I had brain trauma. I had kidney failure. I was in a coma for 3 days. I  was in the hospital for 23 days.   I praise God that those nurses at BAMC brought me back to life. In  particular, there were three nurses: Monica, Alyssa, and Jenna. Alyssa  was my day nurse. She is the one who kept me alive in the daytime.  Jenna kept me alive at night. Without nurses, I wouldn't be here.   Many of us have similar stories. Many of us know of similar stories.   In this institution, we lose sight sometimes of the everyday people  who roll up their sleeves and go to work and make this country better.  This partisanship that divides this country does not happen in the  nursing world. Nurses don't care who you voted for. They don't care  about the color of your skin. They don't care who you pray to. They  care about life and protecting life, all the opportunities for a great  quality of life.   I am grateful to all the nurses out there, particularly those serving  at BAMC.                            ____________________
