 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  legacy of Haven J. Barlow. Utah lost a community giant who lived to be  100 years old. It is hard to believe, but Haven's life was nearly cut  short when at just 9 months old, a train struck the Model T Ford he was  riding in, killing his mother and three other passengers.   Fortunately, he survived, and he lived a life full of service to  others. Haven served our country as a Navy ensign in World War II and  was the longest-serving State legislator in Utah history, first elected  in 1953 and served until 1995.   Haven's service to Utah and Davis County is immeasurable, where he  spent much of his time focused on matters pertaining to education. He  led the fight to establish and fund the first State vocational  institution in Davis County, now Davis Technical College, the  establishment of Weber State/Davis campus, and Utah's creation of the  weighted pupil index (WPU), ensuring a child can get the same level of  education regardless of where they lived.   In addition, Haven helped establish the Hill Aerospace Museum, the  Freeport Center, the restoration of Utah's Governor's mansion, and was  behind the original Utah Symphony Endowment Fund.   Haven was married to Bonnie Rae Ellison for 58 years before her  passing, and raised six children. He is a Utah legend, and we honor him  in his passing.                            ____________________
