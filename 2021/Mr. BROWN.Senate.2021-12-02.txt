 Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in  confirming Brian Nelson to serve as Under Secretary for Terrorism and  Financial Crimes at the Department of Treasury.   Mr. Nelson is highly qualified. He has had years of dedicated public  service to our country.   Early in his career, he clerked for two distinguished Federal judges.  He served in the National Security Division at the Department of  Justice, first as special counsel to the Assistant Attorney General for  National Security, later as the Division's Deputy Chief of Staff.   In these roles, Mr. Nelson supported the development, the  implementation, the coordination, and the review of U.S. intelligence,  counterintelligence, counterterrorism, and national security policies.   He went to work for the California Department of Justice, where he  served as special assistant attorney general and then as general  counsel to then-attorney general, now-Vice President Harris.   He worked to combat threats like human and drug trafficking by  prosecuting international criminals, starving them of their financial  resources.   As Under Secretary, Mr. Nelson will be responsible for protecting our  financial system from terrorists, from rogue states, money launderers,  weapons proliferators, and other criminals who threaten our national  security.   His nomination is another example of the Biden administration's  serious--underline ``serious''--efforts to protect both our economy and  our national security.   He would take on this job at a critical time for protecting our  country's national security, as we work to rebuild alliances abroad,  while threats of domestic terrorism are on the rise at home.   Treasury's Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence is one of  the cornerstones of our country's efforts. That is the importance of  this nomination of Mr. Nelson, one of our country's efforts to combat  terrorist financing here and around the world.   The FBI Director recently testified that racially motivated and anti- government extremists are likely to be the biggest domestic threat this  year and in 2022.   Think about that. The FBI Director testified that racially motivated  and anti-government extremists--and we remember that day so well just  10 months ago--11 months ago. They are the likely biggest domestic  threats to our country this year and next year.   Mr. Nelson will be the first African American serving in this  important national security position. When we have people in these  roles who reflect the country they serve, we get better, more competent  government.   That is what always flummoxes me about hiring practices in this body  and around the country. When you hire people that don't necessarily  look like you, you get a better office that understands different  perspectives. It understands better the way this country works and  helps us to better serve the people whom we serve.   Unfortunately, we have seen far too many of this administration's  nominees held up for months in the nominations process. You just heard  an example of that in the speech right before me; not because of their  background, experience, and qualifications--those are unquestioned in  Mr. Nelson--but for reasons completely unrelated to that nomination.   That is what has happened here. It is the kind of partisan posturing  the American people hate. Blocking critical national security and other  policy nominees for months over unrelated policy issues is  counterproductive; it is misguided; and it is wrong for our country.  Going after human trafficking, going after drug trafficking, going  after international criminals of all kinds isn't a partisan issue; it  is something my Republican colleagues and I work together on all the  time. So let's come together today and confirm Mr. Nelson, who is  exceptionally well qualified.   He is joined today by his wife and his son.   I urge this body to support Mr. Nelson's nomination, getting in place  right away an important part of our national security team.                              Order of Business    Mr. President, under the agreement reached by the two leaders on  November 16, the Senate will now vote on confirmation of the Nelson  nomination.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
