 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to take a stand against  Governor Abbott of Texas and his decision to end our refugee  resettlement in my home State of Texas. This decision is going to  welcome xenophobia and bigotry and is contrary to the values that we  hold dear in Texas.   Texas, as some of you may or may not know, has historically led our  Nation in refugee resettlement. Our State has always opened its doors  to people in need and welcomed refugees with open arms to provide an  opportunity for refugees to contribute to the general common good of  all Texans.   Texas has now become the first State--I say that with shame--to bar  resettlement of those fleeing violence and religious persecution. This  isn't what we stand for in Texas.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the Governor to look at Tarrant County, which is  the county that I live in, and the decision that they made to continue  taking refugees.   As of today, the courts have stayed this heinous order. This decision  still sets a dangerous precedent.   I urge him to reverse his decision and show the rest of the Nation  that Texas stands for inclusion, and let these churches--evangelical  churches, liberal churches, Black churches, White churches--work  together on these refugee programs. Let's let them continue to work  together for the greater good of the country.                            ____________________
