 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Michigan and former  chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee for yielding me the time.   I am disappointed that during National Clean Energy Week we are  considering a bill that fails to prioritize affordable and reliable  energy for all Americans and only furthers the radical left's socialist  Green New Deal priorities.   H.R. 4447 spent more than $135 billion of hardworking Americans' tax  dollars while ignoring meaningful reforms of our rural communities.  Specifically, they want to establish a $20 billion Federal green bank  to subsidize preferred green projects at the expense of others, like  nuclear energy. The bill would also exclude nuclear energy from their  proposed Blue Collar to Green Collar energy workforce grant program.  This is unacceptable.   Nuclear energy fuels our Nation while helping to provide America with  environmental, economic, and national security. I am proud that  Georgia's 12th Congressional District is home to two nuclear power  plants: Plant Vogtle and Plant Hatch, almost 80 percent of Georgia  Power's nuclear capacity.   This industry directly supports well-paying jobs, powers our national  defense, and currently generates nearly 20 percent of our country's  electricity without any carbon emissions.    Madam Speaker, if my colleagues want to have a real policy  discussion about clean energy and focus on solutions, they should  oppose this partisan power grab and support nuclear energy.   Georgia has some of the most competitive electricity rates in the  country thanks to our energy policy.
