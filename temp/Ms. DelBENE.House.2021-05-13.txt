 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight a historic piece  of the American Rescue Plan: the expanded child tax credit. Prior to  this relief package, the child tax credit left behind one-third of all  children because their parents earned too little to access the full  benefit.   The American Rescue Plan changed that by making the credit fully  refundable, increasing the credit to $3,000 per child per year, $3,600  for kids under the age of 6, and providing the credit in monthly  payments starting this July. This 1-year expansion was a critical first  step, but we must go further to rebuild our middle class. Children  don't grow up in just 1 year or 5 years. We must make this expansion  permanent.   In Washington State, this is estimated to benefit 1.4 million  children and reduce childhood poverty by 40 percent. I will continue  fighting to make this expansion permanent and provide all kids with a  fair opportunity to succeed.                            ____________________
