 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would increase and decrease  the Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer at the Department of  Housing and Urban Development to express concern regarding the  inherently divisive nature of the Diversity Council and the associated  race, ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation-based Affinity or  Employee Resource Groups.   Right now, HUD has several different employee affinity groups for  different racial, ethnic, gender, or sexual orientations. These groups  include Blacks in Government, for African American HUD employees; HUD  AANHPI for Asian American, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander; and HUD  FedQ for LGBT employees.   The so-called Diversity Council is reflective of this  administration's drive  [[Page H5461]]  to divide America. In other words, we should go to work every day, and  Hispanic employees should be in one room and talk about what they have  in common and Black people should be in another room and talk about  what they have in common, and the gay people should be in another room  and talk about what they have in common. On the face of it, it is a  little bit ridiculous. It is divisive by its nature, as is so much of  the affirmative action mania that has taken over this country.   A growing volume of research demonstrates that professional  development programs and other trainings in DEI are abject failures.   There was a piece in The New York Times, by author Jesse Singal, that  compared different DEI interventions and noted: ``Racial affinity  groups, a popular intervention in which participants are temporarily  separated by race so they can talk about race, have perhaps proved even  more problematic. They've sparked complaints, in places like  Jacksonville, Florida, where a principal was temporarily reassigned  after she attempted to separate White students from students of color.  . . .''   In any event, the purpose of the groups is to tell people: Because  your great-grandfather or grandfather came from Cuba, we are going to  put you with these other people and you are supposed to share something  in common with these people. In other words, people are labeled as  being different by their race or by their gender, which on the face of  it is such a racist and sexist thing to do.   I am not sure we should have a HUD, but if we are going to have a  HUD, it should focus on its goals of providing housing or making sure  we have affordable housing for the country, not setting aside groups of  people who come from wildly different backgrounds and telling them  because you are a Pacific Islander, or you are Hispanic, or you are  Black you should think in a certain way.   I talked to an employee who has to put up with one of these groups in  private at a business. That is exactly what they are. They have some  expert diversity person telling people that because you are Black, you  should think such and such a way, or because your grandfather is from  Cuba, you should think such and such a way, or because your grandmother  is from Korea, you should think in such and such a way. It is just  anti-American across the board.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I would comment that I think the gentleman  has kind of a bizarre view of the world and I don't think is accurately  analyzing what America is today.   E pluribus unum, out of many, one, is the way we view America.   When they define members of these groups, if you are one-quarter  American Indian or one-quarter Hispanic or one-quarter Black, you are  considered part of a group. To think that these people all have  something in common because of where their grandparents were born,  maybe grandparents who have long since died, is a little bit offensive  on its face.   If you look at how different groups do in this country, by the way,  frequently the most economically successful group today are Asian  Americans from India, then from the Philippines. Cubans do better than  the average American.   Like I said, they are kind of bizarre. For the purpose of identifying  people or setting aside these groups, you are going to have people  classified by one grandparent, supposedly of color, even though nobody  under the sun even knows what their ancestry is, is divisive on its  face.                                time  2045    I believe the only reason people keep pushing this garbage is they  want to divide America and they want to have people who are perfectly  happy Americans walk around and being told that because your  grandfather was Native American or because your grandfather was Korean,  you know----    Mr. Speaker, I am going to address today a news story  that has not received probably as much publicity as it should have.  Nevertheless, it goes a little bit more to the wokization of all levels  of government including local government, apparently including even  what you would consider to be a conservative city of Nashville,  Tennessee.   Mr. Speaker, you will recall last March there was a Nashville  shooter, Aiden Hale, who killed six people in The Covenant School in  Nashville.   At the time we were told that nobody knew what his motivation was,  that he just had a rambling manifesto, and us little people didn't have  to know anything more about it. It recently came out on the internet  that this murderer of six people was a transgender who was motivated in  part by Christian hatred and apparently a negative on blind hatred,  too. In other words, he was a superwoke person who decided to kill six  people.   As scary as that is, it is just as scary that the authorities in  Nashville are now investigating who leaked what motivated the shooter.  In other words, our new government is scared to death of any narrative  that intervenes with the overall woke agenda.   Mr. Speaker, I hope in the future the press corps does not say that  it is a problem when this is exposed but encourages local police to  expose manifestos of multiple shooters so we know what really motivates  them even if it is something like transgenderism.                            ____________________
