 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, my Republican colleagues voted to  condemn college presidents.   I wish they were condemning anti-Semitism, but don't let the title of  that resolution fool you. This was never about that.   We know that because they did not condemn anti-Semitism when the  Unite the Right rally chanted: ``Jews will not replace us.''   They didn't condemn anti-Semitism when their former Speaker shared a  cartoon suggesting that Jewish bankers controlled the world.   They didn't condemn anti-Semitism when Donald Trump said that he only  wanted Jews to count his money.   In every case, they have stood by in silent cowardice and defended  hate speech as free speech. Yet, they have the gall to ask college  presidents to resign for emulating their cowardice.   Donald Trump's rhetoric led to a spike in hate crimes, anti-Semitic  and anti-Muslim hate crimes. Both spiked again after October 6.   If you are only calling it out when it is politically convenient, you  are not helping, you are a part of the problem.                            ____________________
