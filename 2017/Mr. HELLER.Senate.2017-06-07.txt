 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Helen and  Bobby Feldman for their strong leadership in the Jewish community.  Bobby and Helen have been involved in a number of causes that celebrate  their Jewish heritage as well as make a difference by putting the needs  and well-being of others before themselves.   Bobby and Helen have worked with many organizations, including Stand  With Us, an organization dedicated to educating individuals all over  the world about Israel and ways to combat anti-Semitism, and  HonestReporting, a media watchdog organization dedicated to providing  facts, figures, and statistics to journalists across the world to  ensure Israel's story is told fairly by the media.   Bobby Feldman's interest in Jewish culture and causes stemmed from  his early interest in environmental issues. He worked with the Jewish  National Fund in Las Vegas where he now serves as the president of the  southern Nevada chapter. Their organization is working to revitalize  areas in Israel by planting trees, creating parks, and working to build  a better country for years to come.   Helen Feldman has a list of accomplishments herself. She helped  organize the Women's Alliance of the Jewish National Fund. This  organization encourages future generations of Las Vegas women to  celebrate our solidarity with Israel. She also volunteered her time at  local nursing homes; there she shows off her amazing singing talents  and brightens the day of so many Nevada seniors.   On Sunday, April 30, the Jewish National Fund is hosting their annual  Love of Israel brunch where both Helen and Bobby will be recognized for  their involvement in the community. These two individuals should be  proud of all that they have done together.   Earlier this week, Israel celebrated their Holocaust Remembrance Day,  honoring and remembering the 6 million Jewish people who were the  victims of Nazi hatred. It serves us all as a reminder for the need to  turn away prejudice and racism and embrace others. That is why I am  both humbled and honored to acknowledge Helen and Bobby for their work  here in the great State of Nevada. I also want to congratulate them on  29 years of marriage, and I look forward to seeing more from them as  they continue to make us all very proud.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Betty Fox  and not only wish her a happy birthday, but also reflect on her years  of service. Betty Fox served her country in the Armed Forces and  remains an active leader in the community. On April 22, Betty Fox  turned 98 years old, and to this day, she makes us proud to call her a  fellow Nevadan and American.   Betty Fox joined the Marine Corps in April 1943 shortly after the  beginning of World War II. She was stationed at the Marine Corps Air  Station, MCAS, located in Cherry Point, NC. She was then sent to the  MCAS in El Toro, CA, there she received the Honorable Service Lapel  Button marking her outstanding service to her country. Betty Fox was  promoted to private first class on August 20, 1943, then to corporal on  January 24, 1944. She was discharged on February 5, 1944, but her  promotions and designations reflect on her service and our country will  never be able to fully repay her for the sacrifices she made in the  defense of freedom.   In 1956, she moved to Las Vegas, NV, and has been a Nevadan ever  since. Despite no longer being Active military personnel, Betty Fox  remains involved in the local community. She epitomizes an age-old  saying: ``You are only as old as you feel.''   Betty Fox volunteered at the Las Vegas convention center for the past  18 years. She is an active, lifetime member of the Marine Corps League,  Local Detachment 186, and has marched in several Veteran's Day parades  in order to honor those who, like her, sacrificed to defend America and  its values.   Betty is also a lifetime member of Women Marine Association, WMA, and  was an active member until the local chapter disbanded. After years of  serving her country and community, she volunteered her time at the  local senior living center, brightening the day of many of Nevada's  senior citizens.   I am both humbled and honored to acknowledge Betty Fox for her  service to our country and community. Her sacrifices and continued  commitment to helping those who served makes me proud to call her a  fellow Nevadan. As Nevada's senior Senator, I want to honor her  success, her life of giving back, and wish her the happiest 98th  birthday. Rest assured, we all look forward to her continued efforts  that are sure to inspire us all.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the  Women's Mining Coalition, a Nevada-born group that has devoted 25 years  of service advocating for a strong U.S. mining industry. I am proud to  honor the significant contributions the Women's Mining Coalition has  made to the mining industry in the State of Nevada and throughout our  Nation. I am extremely proud of their successes and am grateful for how  it has benefited the Silver State.   In 1993, three Nevada geologists--Kathy Benedetto, Ruth Carraher, and  Debbie Struhsacker--started the Women's Mining Coalition in response to  the congressional debate to enact major changes to the U.S. mining law  that would threaten the future of Nevada's mining industry and hard  rock mining throughout the country. At that time, they never dreamed  that their concept would involve more than taking a couple of trips to  Washington, to talk to lawmakers about mineral exploration, the  importance of mining, and that mining is a good career for women, but  this Battle-Born Nevada concept has become a nationwide, quarter- century commitment to talk to Members of Congress about how modern  mining provides the building blocks of our society while caring for the  environment and providing family-wage jobs to miners and the many  companies throughout the country that provide equipment, goods, and  services to the mineral exploration and mining sectors.   Each year, WMC's Nevada members travel to the group's annual  Washington, DC fly-in. These Nevada women represent the diverse  domestic mining industry and discuss legislative issues and proposed  rules affecting mining. During these meetings, WMC members put a face  to mining that lawmakers don't expect: women involved in all facets of  mining, from equipment operators and manufacturers, engineers,  executives, miners, metallurgists, geologists, and environmental  scientists.   Last September at a banquet in Las Vegas, the group received the  prestigious Prazen Living Legends of Mining Award from the National  Mining Hall of Fame for their many years of service and commitment to  the mining industry. Not resting on their laurels, the Women's Mining  Coalition is in Washington, DC, this week to continue their work to let  Congress know that a strong mining industry is essential to the future  of Nevada and our Nation.  [[Page S3327]]  Our national defense, our infrastructure, our electricity, our  technology, our agriculture, our transportation, and communication  capabilities all rely on the products of mining. The Women's Mining  Coalition will continue to make this message heard with energy, talent,  and enthusiasm.   As the senior Senator from the Silver State, I ask my colleagues and  all Nevadans to join me in congratulating the Women's Mining Coalition  on its 25 years of thoughtful advocacy on behalf of mining in Nevada  and across the country. This group has advanced Nevada's mining  industry, and I am honored to recognize this important contribution. I  wish the Women's Mining Coalition well in its future endeavors in  creating greater opportunities for mining in our great State.                            ____________________
