 Mr. Speaker, today, I want to honor the life and  service of a brave constituent of mine, Mentor police officer Mathew  Mazany.   Officer Mazany, a 14-year veteran officer, was killed in a tragic  hit-and-run on Sunday morning while helping with a traffic stop.   He achieved his dream by following in the footsteps of his father,  who also served as a police officer for 34 years in Maple Heights, not  too far from Mentor.   His coworkers and those who knew him best described him as a happy- go-lucky kind of guy who enjoyed the Mentor community.   Officer Mazany leaves behind a son, a brother, a father, and  countless others who had the pleasure of knowing him.   His legacy and dedication to public service will not be forgotten.   My prayers are with Officer Mazany's family, his friends, the city of  Mentor and the Mentor Police Department during this difficult time.                            ____________________
