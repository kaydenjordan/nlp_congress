 Mr. President, as Senators in this proceeding, we were  bound by two oaths, to support and defend the Constitution and to  pursue impartial justice as we considered the Article of Impeachment  filed against former President Donald Trump: a charge of incitement of  insurrection.   The Framers of our Constitution gave us the tools to respond to a  moment like this. Having lived under the tyranny of an unaccountable  King, they were well aware of the risks of a President willing to abuse  his or her power. William Davie, one of North Carolina's  representatives at the Constitutional Convention, argued that  empowering the Congress was necessary to protect against the threat of  a President who would spare ``no efforts or means whatever to get  himself reelected.''   Our system of checks and balances as laid out in our Constitution  provides that the Congress can impeach a President for committing  ``Treason, Bribery, or other High Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' The phrase  was meant to encompass any offenses that, as Alexander Hamilton  explained in Federalist 65, include an ``abuse or violation of some  public trust'' and ``injuries done immediately to society itself.''  Impeachment is a remedy for this public harm.   Some of my colleagues argue that the Senate could not sit as a court  of impeachment for a former President. But constitutional scholars from  across the political spectrum agree that the plain language of the  Constitution and the historical precedent are clear that the Senate has  the power to hold former officers accountable for offenses committed  while in office. The question was debated on the Senate floor, we had a  vote, and a bipartisan majority decided that we should proceed. As  Manager Jamie Raskin said, ``[t]he jurisdictional constitutional issue  is gone . . . We are having a trial on the facts.''   As we were all witnesses to what happened on January 6, the facts are  clear. During the trial, we saw evidence that was haunting and  chilling. But more than that, collectively, the evidence presented a  clear indictment of President Trump's role in threatening not only the  lives of those at the Capitol, but the very lifeblood of our democracy.   President Trump's actions on January 6 were consistent with a years- long effort to undermine faith in our democratic system. After spending  months trying to delegitimize our elections and despite losing by more  than 7 million votes, President Trump filed dozens of lawsuits and  called into question the election results across the country. In court  after court, the President's claims were rejected. As Judge Bibas, who  was appointed by President Trump, wrote for the Third Circuit,  ``Charges of unfairness are serious. But calling an election unfair  does not make it so. Charges require specific allegations and then  proof. We have neither here.''   In an attempt to delay the certification of the results, President  Trump privately pressured State election officials, including asking  Georgia's Secretary of State to ``find'' 11,780 votes, a number that  would flip the State in his favor. Thankfully, election officials  followed the law, and by December 11, 2020, all States had certified  the results of the election.   Despite the results being final, however, President Trump convinced  his supporters that there was one last opportunity to interrupt the  peaceful transfer of power: preventing the Congress from counting the  electoral college votes. And they responded to his call. During the  trial, we saw a video of a rioter yelling, ``We were invited by the  President of the United States!'' and examples of the rioters' social  media posts telling President Trump they were there for him, including  a photo of rioters storming the Capitol steps captioned, ``This is  me.''   Law enforcement, sworn to protect the Capitol, were repeatedly  assaulted defending our temple of democracy and our very republic. We  will never forget the shrieks of the police officer pinned in between  the doors at the hands of the rioters, pleading for help. We will never  forget Officer Harry Dunn, who fought against the violent mob for hours  and, after it was over, broke down in tears, telling fellow officers he  had been called the N-word numerous times that day. He asked: ``Is this  America?'' Or Officer Eugene Goodman who ran to take on a growing group  of the rioters by himself, diverting them away from the Senate Chamber  and allowing Senators to move to a secure location.   Tragically, the attack on the Capitol also cost the lives of three  brave officers, including Officer Brian Sicknick who died from injuries  sustained while engaging with rioters. Two other officers died by  suicide following the events of January 6: D.C. Metropolitan Police  Officer Jeffrey Smith and U.S. Capitol Police Officer Howard  Liebengood.   While much of the trial rightfully focused on what President Trump  did on and leading up to January 6, in many ways what he did not do was  even more dangerous. After he sent the mob to the Capitol, putting law  enforcement  [[Page S943]]  in danger and threatening the safety of the Vice President, President  Trump did nothing to stop the violence. Despite calls from Republican  leaders across the country, President Trump did not even send a tweet  to defend our democracy. Hours after the rioters first breached the  Capitol, he finally released a video and told the rioters: ``we love  you; you're very special.''   President Trump betrayed his oath of office to preserve, protect, and  defend the Constitution of the United States. He incited a mob to  attack the Capitol and prevent the peaceful transfer of power, and for  that, he should be impeached.   On January 6, we were all awakened to our responsibilities as  Americans and as Senators. I will never forget walking to the House  Chamber around 4 a.m., with shattered glass from broken windows strewn  in the hallway, joined by Senator Blunt, Vice President Pence, and  alongside two young women who carried the mahogany boxes holding each  State's electoral votes. We knew we had to return to do our jobs, and  that night, we made clear to all: Democracy will prevail.   Thank you.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today to thank the  staff who worked tirelessly to ensure the 59th inaugural ceremonies  were a success even under extreme and extraordinary circumstances.   The Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, also known  as JCCIC, is tasked with the planning and execution of the inaugural  ceremonies of the President-Elect and Vice President-Elect of the  United States at the Capitol. This ceremony is the culmination of 244  years of a democracy. It is the moment when our leaders promise to be  faithful to our Constitution. It is the moment when they become, as we  all should be, the guardians of our country.   I would like to thank the chair of JCCIC, Senator Blunt, for his  outstanding work to ensure that the inauguration was an extraordinary  success. It was a pleasure to work with Senator Blunt and his extremely  professional staff.   I want to commend the entire JCCIC staff, especially Maria Lohmeyer,  the Chief of Inaugural Ceremonies, for their remarkable accomplishment.  I also want to thank Vincent Brown, who works for me on the Senate  Rules Committee, for his work while detailed to JCCIC, as well as my  chief of staff, Lindsey Kerr, who worked diligently with JCCIC and many  other agencies and offices to ensure a smooth Inauguration.   Maria, Vincent, Lindsey, and the entire committee staff have shown  that, through hard work and determination, the entire world can see our  democracy prevail.   This year's inauguration was the 59th in our country's history, and  it may have been one of the most challenging ever to design. Planning  an inauguration under normal circumstances is difficult, but this  year's event occurred in the midst of a global pandemic, just 2 weeks  after rioters climbed the inaugural stage to siege the Capitol.   The inauguration is an important symbol in our democracy. It has  marked the peaceful transfer of power for more than 200 years. It sends  an important message to the American people and the world, of unity and  a commitment to our democratic principles.   Inauguration day represents a new beginning for the country. It marks  the beginning of healing, of unifying, of coming together to get  through this crisis.   This inauguration was the result of Democrats and Republicans working  together to bring about this important symbol of our determined  democracy.   And that spirit of bipartisanship, of working together, was certainly  present on the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies.   Thank you to everyone who made that incredible day one we will  remember forever.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the National  Library Service for the Blind and Print Disabled on its 90th  anniversary. The National Library Service, or NLS, is part of the  Library of Congress, an institution that has long been committed to  serving readers with disabilities. The concept of a national library  for the blind was introduced in 1897 by the seventh Librarian of  Congress, John Russell Young, who established a reading room for the  blind that included more than 500 books and music items in raised  characters.   In 1913, Congress began to require that one copy of each book be made  in raised characters and deposited in the Library of Congress for  educational use; but, as impressive as this collection was, it was only  available to people who were able to visit in person. In 1931,  legislation led by Representative Ruth Pratt of New York and Senator  Reed Smoot of Utah created what we now know as the National Library  Service for the Blind and Print Disabled to help provide services to  blind readers across the country through a national network of  cooperating libraries, in braille or audio formats, mailed directly to  patrons, or available through instant download. Since its  establishment, the service has grown to expand service to children,  serve people with physical and reading disabilities, and encompass an  accessible music materials collection that is now the largest in the  world.   I also want to recognize the central role local libraries play in  connecting the national NLS program to constituents in my State. NLS  and the Minnesota Talking Book and Braille Library provide service to  nearly 6,600 people and over 1,600 institutions in Minnesota, each day  working to make the NLS mission ``that all may read'' a reality.   The National Library Service for the Blind and Print Disabled has  long had an innovative approach to meeting the needs of Americans with  disabilities, with an institutional history that spans phonograph  records, cassette tapes, flash memory cartridges, and the internet  while it continually supplies hard-copy and digital braille materials.  Today, I congratulate the National Library Service for the Blind and  Print Disabled and its dedicated staff on its 90th anniversary and  express my appreciation of their continued commitment to ensuring that  all may read.
