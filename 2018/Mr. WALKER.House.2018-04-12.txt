 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   Our national debt stands at over $21 trillion. This is not a surprise  to anybody. It should frighten us enough to immediately alter the  behavior of this House.   Congress approved the largely unpaid $1.3 trillion omnibus, several  supplementals, and exploded 2 years of spending caps all in the last  few months. Unsustainable, mandatory, and undisciplined discretionary  spending designed decades ago has created a debt monster that is  seemingly unstoppable.   Over the last few months, we have heard a great deal with our  Democratic friends and their newfound concern about the rising deficits  and debt. So my question is: How many would join us in supporting the  balanced budget amendment?   Many Democratic Members in the past were willing to vote for what 49  out of 50 States already have, a balanced budget. In fact, in 1996, a  balanced budget amendment garnered 72 Democratic votes in the House,  including our esteemed colleague across the aisle, Mr. Hoyer.   In 2011, the same version we are voting on today got 25 Democrat  votes in support. I wonder how many have the courage to support it now.  We know what it takes. We should roll back wasteful spending, including  rescinding appropriations that aren't needed. We need to reform our  entitlement programs, including getting able-bodied adults back to  work. This is about hope, not judgment.   Mr. Speaker, I invite my colleagues to join me in supporting this  amendment that is our moral obligation to ensure the American Dream  remains attainable for our children and for future generations.
