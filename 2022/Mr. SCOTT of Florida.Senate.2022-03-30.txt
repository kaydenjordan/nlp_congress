 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I  guess this is a crazy idea, but I believe that Americans should not be  judged by the color of their skin but, rather, by the content of their  character. I believe that every person is made in the image of God, and  that to judge a person simply based on the color of their skin is  wrong.   Unfortunately, across the country, politicians and universities are  trying to divide people by race, skin color, ethnicity, or country of  origin. It is immoral and a corrosive habit of the woke crowd.   Unfortunately, the professional career of this nominee is entirely  wrapped up in promoting critical race theory and dividing people along  color lines. His focus at the university where he works is to teach  kids about how to divide one another into what Karl Marx referred to as  the oppressed and the oppressors.   I am sick of this disgusting ideology, and Americans are sick of it  too. Just look at all the Americans who are rejecting it through local  elections and protests at school boards.   We shouldn't be elevating people who divide Americans. We should be  working with those who want to unite us around our founding principles  that made our Nation the greatest country on Earth.   Therefore, I object.
