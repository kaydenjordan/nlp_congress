 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition  of H.R. 3884, the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement  Act.   As a practicing physician for over 30 years, this bill deeply  troubles me, especially with its researched implications for our youth  population.   Marijuana is one of the most abused substances on this planet. And I  will say, I am sympathetic to those who use marijuana for pain relief;  I really am. It has been clinically proven to have activity in this  area.   That said: A July 2020 study from the National Library of Medicine  concluded that the THC component of cannabis can be the main culprit in  psychosis and schizophrenia. A 2018 study from Duke University, in  fact, showed a five-time increase in psychosis among chronic cannabis  users.   The U.S. Surgeon General, Dr. Jerome Adams, agreed that there are  serious health risks associated with the use of marijuana in  adolescence and in pregnancy.   The bill fails to set any standards to prevent marijuana, THC  concentrates, vaping products, or edibles from getting into the hands  of teenagers and young adults whose brains are still developing.   The MORE Act doesn't help prevent the distribution of marijuana to  minors. It disrespects States' rights, fails to prevent violence and  the use of firearms in growing and distributing marijuana and, lastly,  it allows for the potential of marijuana revenue to fund criminal  organizations, gangs, or cartels.   I have been to the border and have personally seen what smuggling  operations this legislation might allow.   Yes, legalizing weed would create revenue from taxes, but at what  cost? Do we then start legalizing cocaine?   Marijuana is a gateway drug; make no mistake about that. It  undoubtedly leads to further and much more dangerous drug use.   And while I do believe that medical marijuana can have some activity  in chronic pain or those with cancer, this bill simply goes way too  far. I will vote against it on the House floor, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.                                General Leave
