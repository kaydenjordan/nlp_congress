 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for those kind  remarks. This is not just West Virginia, but it is all across this  country. I think we are speaking for all and trying to give a voice all  across the country.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5176, the Preventing Overdoses  While in the Emergency Room Act. The demand  [[Page H5049]]  for these substance abuse services in America's emergency rooms far  exceeds their availability. Treatment is particularly scarce in rural  counties, in spite of having an average overdose rate that is 45  percent higher than more urban areas.   In March, the Centers for Disease Control reported that the emergency  room visits for opioid overdoses had risen 30 percent since July of  2016, in less than 2 years, a 30 percent increase.   That is why I am honored to be joined by Congressman Doyle in  introducing this bipartisan act, also known as the POWER Act. This  legislation will provide competitive grants to ensure that overdose  patients receive the treatment they need while still in the emergency  room, giving them a better shot at recovery. This bill, hopefully, is  intended to reduce repeat overdoses and thereby save lives.   I want to thank the cosponsor of this bill, Mr. Doyle, and  particularly our chairman, Mr. Walden, for their work on this important  issue. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
