 Mr. Speaker, ObamaCare is hurting Texas  families, as the Speaker knows. The law has led to higher costs, fewer  choices, and less access to the quality health care that is what the  American people deserve.   Currently, over 70 percent of the counties nationwide have two or  fewer insurers. Texas could see as much as a 48 percent rate increase  in 2017. This is proof that ObamaCare is failing.   Hardworking Americans and their families have been begging for an end  to the ObamaCare burden. It is up to this House to provide one.   House Republicans have forged a new path to patient-centered health  care. Our plan looks out for the most vulnerable and allows for  Americans to choose a plan that best suits their healthcare needs.   I am committed to repealing the broken promises of ObamaCare and  replacing them with health care that works for Texas families.                            ____________________
