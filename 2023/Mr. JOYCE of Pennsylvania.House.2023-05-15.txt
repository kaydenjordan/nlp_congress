 Madam Speaker, as we begin National Police  Week, we recognize the brave men and women of law enforcement who serve  and protect our communities every day.   It was President Ronald Reagan who said: ``Evil is powerless if the  good are unafraid.''   From carrying out high-risk warrants to patrolling our neighborhoods  [[Page H2318]]  to maintain order, we rely on police officers, our sheriffs, and our  troopers to keep us safe.   The bravery that they show in the face of evil--rushing toward an  emergency is what stands between lawlessness and order on our streets,  and ultimately safety in our homes.   Sadly, we are so often reminded that there are those in this Congress  who have looked to defund our law enforcement--actively working to  strip them of the tools, the training, and the equipment that they need  in order to allow us to remain safe.   So far this year, 135 officers have been wounded by gunfire, 38 by  ambush-style attacks, with 15 officers losing their lives in the line  of duty, the ultimate sacrifice.    While crime continues to rise in our cities, it is unconscionable  that anyone would seek to take away the resources and support for those  who have the courage to serve and protect us every day and every night.   Matthew 5 says: ``Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be  called the children of God.''   The officers across Pennsylvania embody this scripture.   This week, please join me in praying for the men and women who wear  the badge. Join me in praying for their safety.   Let's recommit ourselves to standing with our law enforcement  officers. Let's pledge to never defund the police. In this Congress,  let's promise to always back the men and women in blue.                            ____________________
