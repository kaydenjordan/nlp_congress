 Madam Speaker, back when this national nightmare began,  Speaker Pelosi laid bare her intentions and purely partisan agenda. She  told her Caucus that they needed to ``strike while the iron is hot.''   This was always an exercise in raw partisan politics, contrary to the  warnings of our Founders. And over the last month, we saw the  justification for running the fastest, thinnest, and weakest  impeachment in American history crumble.   Instead of sending the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate for  trial, Speaker Pelosi held them hostage in a failed play to gain  leverage that she did not--and would never--have.   In terms of concessions, she got nothing: no control, no moral  victories--in other words, another failed strategy.   After a month of counterproductive and harmful delays, I have three  questions for my friends on the other side of the aisle, the Democrats:   What happened to impeachment being urgent?   What happened to Congress being ``on the clock''?   What happened to saying the House would be ``derelict in our duty''  if we did not act immediately?   These were all the assertions Democrats made over the past several  months. I guess it turns out none of them are true.   These delay tactics were self-serving, hypocritical, and  discrediting. But they made an important admission, some might even  call it a concession.  [[Page H254]]  They proved a very big point: Democrats do not even believe their case  was robust enough to win in a trial.   Even the Speaker's allies admit the delays undermined their case.  Some have gone as far as describing it as a ``failed'' strategy. These  are those who are closest to her.   Senator Feinstein, the senior Democrat from our State of California  and the hometown of the Speaker, said: ``The longer it goes on, the  less urgent it becomes.''   And Chairman Adam Smith, a confidant of the Speaker, said ``it was  time'' to transmit the articles to the Senate.   Both these statements were made last week, before the Speaker  relented. They are significant because they were public and they were  honest.   I am disappointed these individuals did not have the courage to stand  by their initial comments. If impeachment was truly as urgent as  Democrats claimed, the majority should not have waited for the Speaker  to choose a politically convenient time.   Anyone could have recognized this ploy would not work. The House and  the Senate are different institutions and, at this point in time,  controlled by different parties.   As James Madison wrote in the Federalist Papers, the purpose of  bicameralism is to guard against the dangers of encroachment and to  stop toxic resolutions from taking effect.   We saw separation of powers prevail against an abuse of power, just  as the Constitution intends.   The idea of withholding a sloppy impeachment case to force the Senate  to change its rules is constitutionally and politically unheard of.  Frankly, it is just ridiculous.   In Article I, section 5, the Constitution clearly states: ``Each  House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings.'' It doesn't say the  House may determine the rules of proceedings in the Senate.   If anything, the Speaker's actions have only further persuaded  Members of the Senate that the evidence of impeachment was neither  thorough nor satisfactory.   But do you know what? Let's be honest. This was never about  persuasion. It was never about the rule of law. It was what Alexander  Hamilton warned us, that one party would get control and, just because  of their animosity, demean the process of impeachment.    And by selecting this particular batch of managers, the Speaker has  further proven she is not interested in winning minds and hearts or  even following the Constitution.   Let's take a look at the first three names Speaker Pelosi announced  in her anticipated announcement earlier today:   Chairman Schiff, a man who has already taken on the role of judge,  jury, and fact witness throughout the entire House impeachment process.   Chairman Nadler, someone who campaigned for the chairmanship of the  Judiciary Committee that is responsible for impeachment, beginning as  far back as December 2017, before they were even in the majority, on  the notion that he would be the best person to lead the charge on  potential impeachment against the President.   You see, you get a chairmanship by your conference voting for you.  You campaign for it. You put your best ideas out there as to why you  should be the chairman. In 2017, that was the campaign.   Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, a Member who, almost 2 years ago to this  date, voted in support of impeachment. That was more than a year before  the Ukraine call even took place.   Those are just some of the managers.   If you think about the Members, there are people who, on the day they  were sworn in to this body, told those who supported them that they  were going to impeach him.   As I have said in the past, there is an issue with fairness; but  instead of looking to the Senate, Speaker Pelosi should be looking  within her own Caucus. From the beginning, this investigation was  marred by selective leaks to the media, a completely predetermined  process.   Yes, we have been through impeachment before, but it was much  different. We believed in the rule of law back then: that you could  face your accuser, that you could cross-examine, that the minority  could actually ask for witnesses.   The day that impeachment was asked to come forward, I sent a letter  to the Speaker asking 10 items, none that were made up. Do you know  what they were? The fair process we have always used in the past. The  answer was no. Because they have been working on this for 2\1/2\ years,  they could not let fairness determine the outcome.   Any other prosecutor would be disbarred for such blatant bias,  especially if that prosecutor was a fact witness in the case.   The reason for this impeachment is the same reason it has taken  Democrats 30 days to send the articles to the Senate: just spite. They  wanted to stain the President's record without giving him a fair chance  to clear his name.   Last year, we saw House Democrats invert the burden of proof during  their fair investigation.   For every American watching, take, for instance, if this was your  government, if they switched the burden of proof on you.                                time  1245    We have Congressman Max Rose, a new freshman of the majority, who  characterized it this way: ``The President says he is innocent, so all  we are saying is `prove it'.''   God forbid the government accuses you of something as an average  American and says you have to prove it. We just switched a fundamental  belief of America, but only in this House do we do that.   This ``guilty until proven innocent'' mentality was an admission that  impeachment was not about upholding justice or protecting the rule of  law. Now Democrats have invented an even more destructive standard: you  are guilty because they say so.   Our Founders feared this day. Alexander Hamilton warned us of this  day. I hoped this day would not come. I would hope those that uphold  the Constitution would believe in the rule of law, instead of the spite  or the dislike of an individual. Like the kangaroo courts on college  campuses where an accusation is enough for a conviction.   Even as early as last Sunday in an interview, Speaker Pelosi made  that point very clear to all of us. Asked what a Senate acquittal would  mean, she said it didn't matter, the President is impeached forever.   Is that what this is all about? Just a personality, just an abuse of  power that you have within the House that we all feared this country  would never do. You could almost see the Speaker smile as she spoke  about this new standard. How incredibly solemn she was.   Madam Speaker, when Americans look back on this sad saga, they will  see a rigged process that forever damaged the remedy of impeachment.  Speaker Pelosi got nothing from the Senate, but the American people got  worse than nothing. They got stuck with the bill for a costly never- ending investigation.   The old saying that you get what you pay for does not apply here.  Congress wasted time and millions of dollars on partisan impeachment.  In return, taxpayers get nothing. Democrats' misaligned priorities have  cost the people solutions that could have improved the quality of their  life.   There is no greater contrast than what we are doing right here today  than what is happening down Pennsylvania Avenue, the President sitting  down with a leader of another country and signing a trade agreement-- something people said we could never get done--to make this country  stronger, to make the next century in America ours.   But what are we doing here? We are doing what this majority has  worked their entire time for. Before they were even sworn in they  campaigned for the position of chairman for this moment, for this time,  for the millions of dollars that are spent so they could say the  President is impeached. That is a lofty history. Those are lofty goals  that you now have authored more subpoenas than you have created laws.   Thank God we have got a President in the White House that does not  sit back.   Yes, the President got the United States-Mexico-Canada Trade  Agreement done with, our top two traders. He is signing a trade  agreement with China today, but think about how much stronger his hand  would have been had that agreement taken place  [[Page H255]]  earlier, when he got it. No, it was held. Why? Because we were  impeaching. That is an amazing agenda, but you promised people you  would do it.   This is not a moment this body should be proud of. If Speaker Pelosi  likes to say impeachment is a national civics lesson, let's use this  blunder as a teachable moment.   I will make this promise to the American public, because the day will  come that the majority will switch. We will uphold the Constitution. We  will listen to the words of Alexander Hamilton. And just because  somebody else is in an office that we may not like, we will not change  the rule of law. We will not accuse them of breaking it and say they  have to prove it.   We believe America is more than a country. America is an idea, an  idea that, yes, would make students in Iran rise up for the freedom of  what they know America to be. That the rule of law was so powerful.  This is a moment and a civics lesson we should learn. This is a moment  that will teach our grandchildren that, yes, more than 200 years ago  the Founders crafted an amazing country, but they warned us what abuse  of power would look like. The sad part is we are witnessing it. What a  contrast in a day and time.   Moving forward, we must not redo these same mistakes in Congress, and  my promise to you is: if power were to change, the rule of law would  come back. We would have an agenda focused on people, not politics. We  would have a voice that you are innocent until proven guilty. We would  not abuse our power just for the sheer sake of politics, to say you are  impeached forever because I dislike you.   We are better than this. It is a sad day, but the great thing about  America, it will all change because the people have the voice.    Mr. Chair, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 19.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy  of Harold Meek, a community leader and devoted family man, who, sadly,  passed away on December 24, 2019.   To many of us, Harold was more than a neighbor. We considered him  family, and his legacy will live on through those who knew him.   Harold had a wonderful life with his wife, Kay, and recently  celebrated 48 years of marriage. He will be dearly missed by his loving  wife, Kay; children Mark, Joi, and Vivienne; and grandchildren Cody,  Clint, Jordan, and Julia.   Harold moved to Bakersfield in 1958 to work with his brother, Leo, in  what would be the beginning of a lifelong career in the automotive  industry. After 17 years working at his brother's dealership, Harold  joined Three-Way Chevrolet, which later became Three-Way Automotive  Group, in 1973.   Under Harold's leadership, the Three-Way Automotive Group experienced  years of prosperity, gaining national recognition and receiving  multiple industry awards.   Known as one of the greats among Bakersfield car dealers, Harold led  Three-Way to various accolades, including seven consecutive titles as  the number one retail volume Chevrolet dealer in California, as well as  being named the top retail Chevy dealer in the world in June and July  of 2005.   Harold was also recognized with the 2003 Time Magazine Quality Dealer  Award, a true testament to his commitment to exceptional sales  performance and customer service.   This welcoming attitude extended to his personal life and  philanthropic endeavors. He was involved in more than 250 civic and  charitable organizations, including the American Cancer Society, the  Bakersfield Women's Business Conference, and Make-A-Wish Foundation,  just to name a few.   A dedicated Republican, Harold was also active in local, State, and  national politics. He served on the steering committee of numerous  Gubernatorial and Presidential campaigns in California and managed  campaigns for city council, county supervisor, and State assembly  candidates.   After retiring, Harold enjoyed cheering on his Oklahoma Sooner  football team, Friday night dinners with his close-knit family,  afternoons with his granddaughter, and watching NASCAR races on  television with his son.   Harold truly embodied what it means to be a community leader and,  above all, a family man. On behalf of California's 23rd Congressional  District, Judy and I extend our deepest condolences to the Meek family,  and we join them in honoring the life of Harold Meek.                            ____________________
