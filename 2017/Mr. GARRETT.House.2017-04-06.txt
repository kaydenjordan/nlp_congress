 Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join me today as we remember  the lives of Jaiden Bartee and Tori Perez, ages 5 and 6 years old, who,  as they stood with their mothers waiting for the schoolbus on the  morning of March 30, were struck down and taken from this world far too  soon by a passing truck.   Mr. Speaker, Members, there is no Scripture, no words, no thought  poignant enough to address the loss of these mothers, of the Buckingham  County, Virginia, community, of humanity of these two lives; but in  what is the best effort that I can make, I ask that all of my  colleagues and these Members of the Virginia delegation who join me to  join in a moment of silence to recognize these two young people.                            ____________________
