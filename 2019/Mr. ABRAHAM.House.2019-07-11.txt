 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the heroism of  two Louisianians who served valiantly during World War II: William  Henry Ward and Richard Leon Watson.   William, who recently celebrated his 95th birthday, grew up in New  Orleans and shipped off to Europe in 1943 to join a heavy bombardment  squadron that participated in Operation Market Garden and the Battle of  the Bulge.   During the Battle of the Bulge, his B-24 Liberator got shot down,  took heavy fire, and he was forced into an emergency landing near  Brussels. He hitchhiked back to England and, as soon as possible,  rejoined the fight.   On January 10, 1945, he completed his 35th mission over Germany and  finally telegraphed his mother, Maude Ward, saying, ``Duties completed.  Returning home soon.''   Sadly, Richard Watson came home to Morehouse Parish in a more tragic  way. He died defending our country while aboard the USS Oklahoma, which  sank from a torpedo strike when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. He  was one of 429 crewmen killed in that attack.  [[Page H5591]]    After 77 years, his body was identified and finally sent back home to  Louisiana earlier this year.   Mr. Speaker, our World War II veterans truly are America's Greatest  Generation. It is because of the courageous acts of soldiers like  William Ward and the sacrifices of sailors like Richard Watson that we  are the country we are today.   We owe a tremendous debt to our World War II veterans.   I encourage everyone to thank these wonderful people when you see  them and let them know that a grateful Nation has not forgotten what  they did for us.                            ____________________
