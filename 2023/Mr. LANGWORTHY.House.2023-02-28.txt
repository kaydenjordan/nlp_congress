 Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.  [[Page H950]]     Madam Chair, the amendment strikes the bill's  requirement for an inflation impact assessment when an executive order  will have a significant impact on inflation, but the impact cannot yet  be precisely quantified.   That is exactly the wrong approach to take. If the White House can  determine an executive order will indeed have a significant impact on  inflation, that is what is important. The President should know about  that before he acts.   It would be unwise and dangerous to happily let the President proceed  in the dark about an order's inflationary impacts just because they  cannot be calculated with perfect precision.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, this amendment defines a ``significant  impact on inflation'' as only an impact that would increase or decrease  the Consumer Price Index by at least 1 percentage point.   With all due respect, that is magical thinking. If a single executive  order were to produce a full 1 percentage point increase in inflation,  that would not be just a significant effect; it would be a massive  effect.   The Bureau of Labor Statistics' inflation data from January 23, 2023,  showed that the Consumer Price Index rose 6.4 percent over the prior  year. A 1 percent point rise would constitute 16 percent of that yearly  rise. That is a huge portion of yearly inflation.   Few individual executive orders, even ones that stoke inflation  significantly, would on their own raise inflation by 1 full percentage  point or more.   What the amendment really is trying to do is gut the bill.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.  [[Page H952]]     Madam Chair, this amendment is similar to my  colleague's last amendment. It defines a ``quantifiable inflationary  impact'' as only an impact that would increase or decrease the Consumer  Price Index by at least 1 percentage point.   If a given executive order did not have that level of impact, the  bill, if amended this way, would require no inflation impact  assessment.   But as my colleague's prior amendment, this amendment would not  improve the bill, but instead gut the bill.   Letting off the hook all executive orders with less than 1 percentage  point impact on the Consumer Price Index would mean that all or  virtually all orders would be off the hook. That includes those with  obviously significant inflationary effects.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of this amendment.    Madam Chair, my colleague's amendment states an  obvious fact: It is the responsibility of both the President and the  House of Representatives to combat inflation. I have no quarrel with  that.   In fact, in advancing this bill, the House is taking one step toward  fulfilling its responsibility to combat inflation.   It is doing so by using this legislative authority to help ensure  that the President focuses on combating inflation, not issuing  executive orders that make inflation worse.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a  recorded vote.  Madam Chair, as the designee of Mr. Andy Ogles, I  have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   My colleague's amendment makes sure that inflation assessments  prepared under the bill will address a critical inflationary measure-- the Producer Price Index.   Now, when people think of inflation, they usually think of the  Consumer Price Index. But the Producer Price Index is critical as well.  It measures changes in the selling prices domestic producers receive  for their output. These prices are from the very first commercial  transactions for many products and services. Thus, changes in the  Producer Price Index can signal that changes in prices are about to  ripple through the economy.   These should be accounted for in each inflation impact assessment  that the bill requires.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have no more speakers, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Bean of Florida) having assumed the chair, Ms. Lee of Florida, Acting  Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union,  reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill  (H.R. 347) to require the Executive Office of the President to provide  an inflation estimate with respect to Executive orders with a  significant effect on the annual gross budget, and for other purposes,  had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
