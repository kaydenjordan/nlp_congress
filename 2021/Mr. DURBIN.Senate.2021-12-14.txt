 Mr. President, the monstrous chain of tornadoes and  violent storms that rampaged across Illinois and five other States last  Friday is a terrible reminder in America that we are all one people.   The killer storms didn't stop at State lines. They didn't  discriminate based on skin color, creed, political party, or age. Among  the more than 90 victims that we know of at this moment, the eldest was  86 years old; the youngest, sadly, was a tiny baby of just 5 months  old.   Even as people in my State of Illinois grieve for victims in our  State, we also mourn for and with all those who died and are suffering  in nearby States: Arkansas, Tennessee, Mississippi, Missouri, and  especially our neighbor to the south, Kentucky.   Senator McConnell has spoken, and we have all seen reports, of the  staggering destruction in Mayfield, KY, and other communities.   I want to say a few words about the destruction that was wreaked on  my own State and also about the tremendous outpouring of compassion and  community.   The National Weather Service tells us more than 30 tornadoes tore  through 6 States last Friday night. The most destructive may go down as  the longest continuous tornado in the history of the United States.  That tornado appears to have remained on the ground for 4 hours,  traveling 290 miles across  [[Page S9130]]  four States, pulverizing everything in its path.   From Kentucky, there were reports of objects being lifted 30,000 feet  in the air by the force of the tornado. Treasured family photos were  found 100 miles away. Sadly, at least 80 people have lost their lives  in Kentucky.   In Illinois, we have also suffered staggering losses. Four tornadoes  tore across our State between 7:30 and 10 last Friday. The greatest  devastation was in Edwardsville, IL, Madison County, where a powerful  tornado with winds up to 155 miles an hour peeled the roof off a  massive Amazon distribution facility about 9 o'clock. I know the  facility. I have been there.   Massive concrete walls 11 inches thick and 40 feet high caved in,  trapping employees who were working to fill Christmas and holiday  orders. Fire and rescue crews from at least 20 communities rushed to  the scene. More than 45 workers managed to escape from that mountain of  rubble, but 6 workers died when the warehouse collapsed. The oldest was  62; the youngest was 26. Thirty more workers were hurt. One is still  hospitalized with critical injuries.   I know I speak for millions of Americans when I say that our hearts  go out to all those who perished in Friday's tornadoes and to those  they left behind.   I thank President Biden for responding quickly. Yesterday, our  Governor, JB Pritzker, requested an emergency declaration, and of  course we joined him. The President issued the emergency order just a  few hours after that request. This assistance will help our State  immediately, but there is more to do. Our thanks to the Red Cross and  so many volunteers, local residents in communities across Illinois, for  pitching in to help the victims. Supplementing that fine work are  volunteers who have come to help in any way they can.   It was ironic that last week I had a coffee for a man named Jose  Andres. Jose Andres is well known by many across the country for his  extraordinary efforts to feed hungry people. Last Tuesday, he spoke to  us, a few members of our caucus, about his nonprofit organization, the  World Central Kitchen. They have come to the rescue of people in need  in Puerto Rico and Haiti and all across the United States and around  the world.   Today, World Central Kitchen is on the ground in Mayfield, KY, where  the tornadoes struck last Friday, providing hot food to the victims. It  is a time when America, a divided nation, actually sees our Nation  coming together.   The tornadoes didn't distinguish between red States and blue States,  between Trump supporters and Biden supporters, and it is my great hope  that the Senate will also put aside its politics for a few moments and  stand together to help the victims.    I ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in recess  until 2:15 p.m. and that all time during recess count equally against  both sides on the joint resolution.    For the information of Senators, we expect a rollcall  vote on the passage of S.J. Res. 33 to occur at approximately 4 p.m.  today.                            ____________________
