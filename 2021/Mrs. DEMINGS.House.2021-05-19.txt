 Mr. Speaker, the insurrectionists attacked this very  building we are standing in right now. The violent mob attacked, bear- sprayed, and beat down the police officers who protect us every day.  140 officers were injured, and we need to care about that. Some have  died, and they deserved better.   Mr. Speaker, accountability and truth are the foundation upon which  all of our rights and freedoms exist. We need answers, and this  commission will give them to us. We need accountability, and this  commission will pave the way for full accountability. We need an  independent commission, and a vote against it is a vote for a cover-up.   Choose ye this day whom you will serve. Our democracy or the big lie?   History will remember us.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
