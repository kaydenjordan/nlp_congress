 Madam Speaker, in preparation for reauthorizing the farm  bill  [[Page H5554]]  in 2023, I rise today to deliver the eleventh installment of my farm  bill impact series, where I am highlighting various aspects of the farm  bill that deserve Congress' awareness and support. We need robust  biosecurity in America not only because we need to eat in order to  survive, but also because strong American agriculture will help keep  our country free and self-determining as a Nation.   Manhattan, Kansas, the home of my alma mater, Kansas State  University, is also home of the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility  or NBAF. This state-of-the-art 700,000-square foot facility will be a  national asset that helps protect our Nation's agriculture against the  threat and potential impact of serious animal diseases. Experts believe  that 75 percent of new and emerging infectious animal diseases can be  transmitted from animals to humans. NBAF will be home to the only  maximum biocontainment space in the country, where USDA will conduct  comprehensive research, develop vaccines and antivirals, and explore  enhanced diagnostic and training capabilities.   The United States Department of Agriculture is currently working with  the Department of Homeland Security to bring NBAF online by December  and to begin establishing partnerships between two key sectors heavily  invested in animal health: academia and industry. Working with  scientists and other industry professionals, NBAF will create new  safety and security guidelines that will be critical for the prevention  of future pandemics. Currently, scientists are conducting this very  important research in New York at the Plum Island Animal Disease  Center, which is more than 60 years old. NBAF will replace this aging  facility, create 400 local jobs for Kansans, generate over $100 million  in total economic benefit for our State, and make Kansas the home of  internationally recognized animal disease experts. NBAF isn't just an  exciting development for Kansas, it also marks the future of biodefense  research that will protect the United States and the rest of the world.                                time  1045    The 2018 farm bill contained special authorization for biosecurity  planning and response, which helped make NBAF possible. That version of  the farm bill explicitly mentioned the coordination of ``tactical  science activities . . . that protect the integrity, reliability,  sustainability, and profitability of the food and agricultural system  of the United States against biosecurity threats from pests, diseases,  contaminants, and disasters.'' NBAF is a concrete example of the impact  that we can have when we authorize the farm bill in careful and  creative ways.   During National Agriculture Month in March, I brought House  Agriculture Committee Republican leader GT Thompson on an ag tour of  Kansas, where I was proud to show him NBAF. The technology, scale, and  international significance of the facility are truly second to none.  Once fully operational in December, NBAF won't just support and protect  agriculture; it will protect our country and the world.   I will be back on the floor soon to deliver another installment of my  farm bill impact series and highlight more programs and titles within  the bill that I believe Congress must understand and support to ensure  that agriculture thrives in America.                      Importance of Livestock Indemnity     Madam Speaker, I rise today to follow up on a speech that I  gave in March about the importance of the farm bill emergency  assistance programs like livestock indemnity.   Agriculture is a risky business, and Mother Nature is a tough  business partner. Over the past couple of weeks, Kansas producers have  been losing cattle due to extreme temperatures, and qualified producers  will be able to recoup some of their losses through the livestock  indemnity program.   Just like the flooding and wildfires we saw in Natoma and the  surrounding areas last year, this is another example of how essential  the farm bill emergency assistance programs are to our country's food  supply and the people who produce it.   Emergency programs like livestock indemnity are investments in the  future of our country, and they help ensure that America remains food  secure and self-determining as a Nation.   Natural disasters, diseases, and weather emergencies happen, and we  can't afford to let them cripple the business of the men and women who  keep us fed, fueled, and clothed. That is why emergency assistance  programs like livestock indemnity must remain strong in the 2023 farm  bill.                            ____________________
