 Mr. Speaker, thousands of janitors, bag handlers,  wheelchair attendants, and others at our Nation's airports work for  wages as low as $2.13 plus tips.   That is not a typo. This is called the national subminimum wage, and  it is unacceptable. Workers who help more  [[Page H6827]]  than 3 million airport travelers every day deserve better.   In Chicago, more than 6,000 such workers represented by SEIU Local 1  now get a living wage and decent benefits, but far too many workers  still depend on the luck of a tip jar to augment their measly $2.13  hourly wage. A $2.13 hourly wage will not fly.   Let's ground a $2.13 hourly wage once and for all. Let's pass the  Good Jobs for Good Airports Act now.                            ____________________
