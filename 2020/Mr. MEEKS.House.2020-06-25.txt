 Mr. Speaker, I was born in 1953. Brown v. Board of  Education had not been decided. The Civil Rights Act was not yet law,  and the Voting Rights Act was more than a decade away. African  Americans could be denied sitting on a bus, a room at a hotel, entry  into a school, solely because of the color of their skin.   For my three daughters, such a time is still somewhat unimaginable to  them. They cannot fathom being refused entry into a restaurant or being  legally barred from living in a neighborhood, because the laws on the  books said it was the right thing to do. These are the realities of my  generation, for I recall getting off a train and seeing ``colored'' and  ``white.'' But it is not the realities for my daughters.   But they do know about a world where Black men and women can be  stopped by a police officer on the flimsiest of pretexts, and they  understand the pain of seeing unarmed Black men and women shot, choked,  and kneeled upon until they take their last breath.   I now also have a one-year-old granddaughter. She does not know about  mass incarceration. She has not seen videos of Black men being murdered  by those that are supposed to protect the law. I do hope she learns  about these incidents, like the murder of George Floyd or Eric Garner  or Sean Bell, but in the same way my daughter has learned about  segregation: Through books and movies and history and classes. I hope  she views our current failings as unimaginable problems from an era far  passed.   And this Congress can make a difference. Let's not wait now. The  camera of history is rolling, and it rolled bad on those in 1953. Let  it not roll bad on us today.   Mr. Speaker, let us pass this act. This bill will not take us all the  way to that destination, but it is a real step towards a just world.  Let's pass this bill.
