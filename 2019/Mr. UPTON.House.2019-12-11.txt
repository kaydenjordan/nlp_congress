 Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, the President, speaking at  the National Farm Bureau Convention, called for legislation regarding  agriculture immigration. And he acknowledged that the ag community, in  his words, ``needs people to help with the farms.'' That is what this  bill does.    As much as most of us would like to wave a magic wand and fix a very  broken system, you know, what? We have failed. But it is not for the  lack of trying. We simply haven't had the votes; whether it is more or  less border security; whether it is too comprehensive or too less. We  can't even fix the Dreamer issue. Come on.   This ag bill is going to pass, thank goodness. And I want to thank    Jimmy Panetta,   Dan Newhouse and other members of the bipartisan  Problem Solvers Caucus, particularly Chair Lofgren, who helped deliver  legislation here to the House floor this afternoon.   Would I like to do more? You bet. But, you know, at the moment, this  is the only step that we can do on a bipartisan basis this year. Let's  just face it.   If we can't pass a narrow bill, when is it going to happen? This is  the first step, so let's get it done.   This bill is going to provide a long overdue and desperately needed  overhaul to the H-2A program, and it builds on the July 2019 DOL's  proposal for H-2A reforms.   Key provisions include a freeze on the Adverse Effect Wage, which has  led directly to dozens of farm closures in my district in Michigan; a  streamlined and modernized application process to encourage more  widespread adoption; creating a year-round H-2A visa program, allowing  all of agriculture to utilize the program.   Now is the time, finally, to at least boldly act to pass a real ag  labor reform to ensure that our ag community has the workforce that it  needs to remain the envy of the world. I would urge all of my  colleagues to support this.  [[Page H10074]]
