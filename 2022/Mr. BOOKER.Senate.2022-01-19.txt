 Madam President, I have deep and tremendous respect for  my friend from South Carolina. I am not a Senator from the South, but  my family hails from the South, from Monroe, LA, to Alabama, to North  Carolina. I know my roots, and I know the challenges of Jim Crow, and,  thank God, we are not in a time of Jim Crow.   The history that my friend talked to, I know. I know his history, and  I know my colleagues in the Senate know his history. We are all not  blind to what happened in terms of racial oppression going back to the  founding of this Nation. The Constitution that people have been waving  around, it is hard not to read that and not see that many of the  compromises were based upon an acquiescence to that original sin of  this Nation--slavery. We know the violence of what he said and talked  about.   I am frustrated that we can agree that there has been overwrought  language on both sides of the political aisle around this issue, but we  should be focusing on the facts. I have a hard time listening to people  that want to talk about this issue and don't talk about facts.   In the United States today, it is more difficult for the average  African American to vote than the average White American. That is not  rhetoric. That is fact.   We know that Black voters, on average, are forced to wait on line  twice as long as White voters.   We began this session today swearing an oath to that flag, saying  that this would be a nation of liberty and justice for all. Where is  the justice in a nation where there is, on average, for a Black person  twice as long to vote? It is factual.   But let's keep going because I heard my colleague speak.   During the 2016 Presidential election, residents of entirely Black  neighborhoods waited to vote. They were 74 percent more likely to spend  more than 30 minutes at their polling place relative to residents of  entirely White neighborhoods. That is a fact.   Similar racial disparities were observed right before the pandemic.  In the 2018 midterm elections, the Brennan Center report found that  Latino voters waited almost 46 percent longer than White voters and  Black voters about 45 percent.   The report also found that Latinos and Black voters were more likely  than White voters to wait in the longest of lines on election day.   You could go into State after State and you will see who waits,  factually, on longer lines.   Georgia--are we going to reduce this to just being about water? I  find that law offensive, but that is not the thing that offends me  most.   Do you want to know what is going on in Georgia right now? They have  a historical pattern of dwindling polling places in the diverse areas,  with some voters in Georgia waiting up to 10 hours in predominantly  Black neighborhoods.   Think about this for a second. Do you want to talk about voter  suppression? You are working a job, you are taking care of young kids,  and you are going to give up a day's salary in Georgia to vote? You  want to talk about a modern day poll tax?   And my friends on the other side are saying that race is not an issue  here?   I am going to continue with facts because I was flabbergasted that  someone could stand up here and say there is not a different experience  for Blacks and Whites when voting. I am just going to continue to read  the facts.   Since Shelby v. Holder eviscerated the Voting Rights Act that people  like Goodman, Chaney, and Schwerner died for, Black voters in Georgia  have faced disproportionately longer lines and fewer polling places.   The average number of voters per polling place have grown 40 percent  in diverse Atlanta Metro since 2012, and voters in Black neighborhoods  waited nearly 10 times as long, on average, after polling places were  closed in neighborhoods.   I am looking for an amen from my colleague from Georgia.  [[Page S305]]         I mean, in what country are we, where a certain minority  in predominantly minority communities has to wait 10 times as long?   And so when you read--and I have heard my colleagues read these laws.  They read: Well, what is wrong with having no drop boxes because, hey,  we didn't have them before the pandemic. What is wrong with not having  that many days to vote by mail?   What is wrong with these things is obvious because they are not  designed for voter protection. They are not designed to help voters  have more access to the polls. They are designed to suppress the vote  and create these longer lines. That is the obvious result, and if you  can't see that, I am flabbergasted. I am sorry. It is hard. This is not  my turn to speak, and forgive me to my colleagues. But I am  flabbergasted that the Republican Party, the party of the 14th  Amendment, the party that once fought for equal access to the polls is  now creating this ruse that 19 States--that the States that are passing  these laws, 19 States--this is not about voter protection.   Donald Trump's own person said the last election was the safest, most  secure election in American history. This is not about in-person voter  fraud. Study after study has shown that you are more likely to be  struck by lightning.   This is about lies. I am sorry. This is about lies, and they are  targeting groups.   I am going to go on with facts, but I just want to talk about  students for a second. I heard Senator Jon Tester. I have heard my  colleagues from New Hampshire, and they are not hiding the ball, folks.  They are not trying to tell us: Oh, we are concerned about it.   As early as 2011, the State Republican house speaker at the time in  New Hampshire--Senators, you know William O'Brien; can I get a  hallelujah there--promised to clamp down on unrestricted voting by  students calling them ``kids voting liberal, voting their feelings,  with no life experience.''   I hear what you are saying, that this is--oh, these laws are  innocuous on their face. But if you start looking at the legislative  record, you see groups are being targeted in this country. Polling  places are diminishing on college campuses. Voter ID laws are being  created so complex in Midwestern States that they are saying you can't  use a 4-year ID; it has got to be a 2-year ID. Those are some of the  laws that are being passed.   Can somebody be a witness on that?   And I hear this rhetoric where people pull out one law: Well, look at  this law. This is just about shrinking the days, or this is so  innocuous on its face, and I know there are people at home thinking to  themselves: Hey, that doesn't sound like a big deal. Maybe the  Republicans have a point.   No. Let's return to the facts.   I am going to go to Texas because I heard the Senator from Texas  accuse this body of creating rhetoric that was divisive.   Do you want to know what is divisive to a country that says ``e  pluribus unum'' above where the presiding person is? Do you want to  know what is divisive? It is telling people in the Congresswoman's  State that if you live in a predominantly minority area, we are going  to remove polling places and change laws so that Black folks  disproportionately are waiting 5, 10, 15 times longer.   Facts. The burden of long lines in polling places, closures in Texas  in the post-Shelby County areas often falls disproportionately on Black  and Latino voters.   Congresswoman, of the approximately 750 sites Texas has closed since  Shelby v. Holder, 542 were in the 50 counties with the fastest growing  Black and Latino populations.   Don't lecture me about Jim Crow. I know this is not 1965. That is  what makes me so outraged. It is 2022, and they are blatantly removing  more polling places from the counties where Blacks and Latinos are  overrepresented. I am not making that up; that is a fact.   I am not going to stop because I am tired of hearing that this does  not have to do with singling out certain populations in our country-- students, Native Americans--and not others.   I am not accusing anybody. Please, let's not go around in defense,  where we crouch into defensive postures. I am not accusing anybody of  being racist. I am just speaking to the facts in our country that I  know motivate everybody here. A hundred of my--ninety-nine of my  colleagues know it is wrong to create barriers for some populations and  not others under the guise of a lie that there is a voter security  problem.   Let me continue. I am sorry, Congresswoman, to keep talking about  Texas.   In the Presidential primary on March 3, voters at historically Black  Texas Southern University in Houston waited not an hour, not 2 hours,  not 3, 4, 5--waited 6 hours.   A poll of Texas voters conducted just in the 2020 election  underscored the disparity non-White voters faced in casting their  ballots.   I am sorry. Senator Kaine, you were very good when you talked about  that sign of 98 percent of people happy. I sat here stunned. I was  wondering who they were polling because they were not polling Black and  Latino voters in Texas when they did that.   Let me give you the facts. Forty-eight percent of Black voters and 55  percent of Latino voters in Texas found it easy to vote, but that  leaves a lot of folks who didn't think it was easy. White voters-- actually, 65 percent think it is easy to vote.   Everybody is not happy. People who wait in 6-hour lines are not  happy.   I just want to give a couple more facts. Let's go to my dad's home  State. North Carolina was one of the States most affected by poll  closures. There were 158 fewer polling places in 40 counties with large  Black communities, and African-American voter participation dropped 16  percent. Why? Well, my friend Bennet said this. We still live in a  country where the economic disparities between Blacks and Whites is  what it was in the 1960s. So if you are a Black, struggling family, and  your option to vote means standing in line for 10 hours--compared to  predominantly White counties--where the wait is longer, you don't go  vote.   That is not just Black folks. The stories about disabled voters, with  about 1 in 7 or 1 in 8 pointing out that it is hard for them to vote  because of physical impediments--that is discriminatory against them.  It doesn't mean people here are anti-disabled. We are not throwing  those labels around; I am just talking about the facts.   So I just want my colleagues to know that I can pull story after  story of these States--the 19 that are passing these laws--if you pull  them out and want to read them absent context, you are going to try to  obscure the larger picture of what is going on in our Nation, which is  that we are seeing entirely Republican legislatures--entirely  Republican legislators--passing laws that are disproportionately  impacting certain groups, by the facts.   I want to close with this: On the march across the Edmund Pettus  Bridge, they were stopped and beaten back. They tried to go again with  King and were again blocked by Alabama State troopers. But they finally  got to their destination to protest voting rights.   I love what King said there. He talked about those people whose  hearts were discouraged because they hadn't passed voting rights. I  know there are going to be a lot of people here on this day who are  going to feel that kind of discouragement. But, Reverend Warnock, King  gave one of his best speeches that day where he asked people ``How long  are we going to have to wait? Not long'' because the truth--I am  thinking about the lies we are hearing now, the big lies, the lies of  in-person voting. The truth, crushed to the Earth, will rise again.    Don't lie and say there is not a disparate voting reality for Blacks  and Whites in this country right now; the facts speak differently.  Don't lie and say that these laws are not being done in a way to make  it harder for students to vote. Don't lie and say that we are a nation  that should be doing more to ease access as opposed to putting up more  barriers because to go on more barriers is anti-democratic. Those lies  will not live forever.   I do believe still that the arc of the moral universe is long and it  bends toward justice. I still believe that the best of our democracy  will come out if people do not give up and are not discouraged.   I ask my colleagues right now to continue on the floor today, to  continue to  [[Page S306]]  tell the truth of what is happening in your States, to continue telling  the truth of what is happening in our Nation, because we will win this  fight. I don't know how long it will take, but that will be determined  by how dedicated we are to the principles of this democracy.   We must live in a nation where everyone is equal--not in rhetoric or  in slogans or in salutes, but everyone is equal in the experience they  have to participate in democracy. The vote is the bedrock of our  Nation. It is the foundation of the country, and it does have cracks  that need our repair.   Whether we get down on our knees in prayer or we stand tall, let's  continue the work of this democracy so that freedom and justice do roll  down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream.   Forgive me, colleagues, for speaking well beyond my time, and I  apologize if I demonstrated too much emotion.
