 DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise in  opposition to the SENSE Act. This bill is an unnecessary and permanent  carve-out for waste coal plants that forfeits scientific and industrial  progress.   Waste coal plants may be unfamiliar to many of my colleagues here in  Congress because the vast majority of them are located in my State,  Pennsylvania. These plants take waste coal left over from mining  anytime before the late 1970s and use it as fuel. You see, these areas  were mined before laws required reclamation or remediation of mine  damage.   I would just like to remind my colleagues who rail against government  regulation all of the time, that the reason we have this environmental  catastrophe is because there were no regulations before the late 1970s.  This is what happens when we have industry, no government regulations,  we get environmental catastrophes and now we are left to clean up the  mess.   These piles of waste coal have sat covering hundreds of thousands of  acres in my home State of Pennsylvania for decades because there was no  regulation. Many don't realize, Pennsylvania has produced more coal  than any other State. Our mines powered the country while our steel  mills built it into the world's greater industrial nation, the arsenal  of democracy through two world wars.   But now my home State remains saddled with the leftovers, the legacy  of nearly 200 years of unregulated mining. These piles can directly  affect people's health, their communities, and their environment. These  abandoned sites can contaminate local water sources with harmful  runoff, or combust and release toxins into the air at eye level.   Now, I have seen mining sites reclaimed because of these plants, and  the turnaround is remarkable. Over decades of operating, they have  cleaned up about 4 to 6 percent of the total affected lands across our  State, and they have dramatically improved the land at those sites.   They are an important but minor accessory to the use of abandoned  mine land reclamation funds. Let me provide some context to that. The  Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection estimates that,  using abandoned mine land reclamation funds, the State and outside  organizations have reclaimed 70,000 acres in my home State. The most  recent industry estimate I have seen on waste coal plants reclaims  approximately 200 acres a year.   Now, let's hear the arguments in favor of this bill. Waste coal  plants help facilitate remediation of abandoned mine sites. Some plants  say they are having a hard time meeting clean air standards, so let's  loosen those standards forever.   But my problem is, we know plants can meet these Clean Air Act  protections. Many already are. The scientists at EPA have determined  this, and the Federal courts have upheld the EPA's ruling. In fact, the  largest plant in Pennsylvania can meet the standards that this bill  undermines.   I understand it can be difficult to upgrade emission controls  technologies in current market conditions. I understand that, with the  many issues that are at the nexus of the energy versus environment  debate when one side wins and the other side loses. But coal refuse  plants present us with an exciting opportunity to have a true win-win.  This bill does not.   This bill says, let's sacrifice our air quality and the air quality  of States downwind, and let's give these plants a pass. Let's sacrifice  progress for a few companies' convenience, and let's stick it to those  companies that have already invested in upgrading their plants, and  let's do this forever.    I believe the environmental issues and the energy challenges our  country and the planet face will be solved through technological  progress and innovation, through scientific advancement and thoughtful  policy. For that reason, I oppose this bill.  [[Page H1484]]    Let me be clear. Pennsylvania has inherited and shoulders a debt, the  collective legacy from our Nation's unregulated industrial past. This  debt is levied on our land, our children, and our communities. We need  help, and we deserve help, to continue righting this wrong. That  requires strong environmental stewardship, increased abandoned mine  land reclamation funds. The RECLAIM Act would provide greater R&D into  making fossil fuels cleaner, and the list goes on.   I want to applaud my colleague on the other side of the aisle for  highlighting the importance of this issue. This legislation, however,  is not the answer. It is still not the answer, and I urge my colleagues  to vote against it so that we can try a different, smarter approach.   I think we can make great progress on this issue in the coming  months. I would welcome cooperation and input from colleagues on both  sides of the aisle in doing so. Let's do this the smart way, the right  way. Let's not penalize companies that are spending the money to  comply, by helping a few companies that claim they don't want to.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, let me just say  to my friend--and he is my friend--that none of us have a problem with  these plants. They are providing an important service. The largest one  in our State is complying.   What I don't understand is, when the majority of these plants can  comply and are in the process of complying, why do you want to pass a  law that would exempt them from having to do that?                                time  0945    It seems that when we have this debate, we only define ``burden'' as  one way. When I hear my colleagues talk about the burden, it sort of  has a singular dimension: money, dollars and cents on a business, on an  individual, on a taxpayer.   What about the burden of lower air quality? Is it not burdensome to  the health of our students, the elderly, folks with asthma to breathe  in higher levels of particulate matter? What about those folks?   When we have an opportunity and we have the technology to have these  plants continue to remediate sites, but to do so in a more  environmentally friendly way, why would we not want to do that,  especially when there are only 14 of these sites in Pennsylvania, and  the majority of them are in the process of complying or are complying?   You know, this bill is the same bill you brought here last year that  didn't pass the Senate. This bill is not going to become law either. I  would just encourage my friend to sit down with members of the  Democratic Party, sit down with these stakeholders, and let's work on a  solution that is futuristic, not one that takes us back to the past.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, let me just say  to my friend that at the rate of 200 acres a year, it will be well into  the year 3000 before we reclaim all these sites. So when I say,  ``forever,'' there is not going to be any of us sitting here today  around to see it, nor will our children, nor will our grandchildren, at  that rate.   And, by the way, the quote you give from the EPA regarding that was  under a different rule, not the rule that we are talking about. This  boils down to companies that are already spending the money and  complying. Where is the fairness to those companies, their bottom line,  their workers, when they are complying with this rule?   And then you want, literally, a handful of companies not to comply?  And when you talk about customizing a solution, what you are talking  about is no rules. I mean, you are basically saying they don't have to  comply with anything. So the answer to these 19 plants that operate in  the entire United States, of which better than half are in the process  or already complying, is to tell the ones that aren't complying there  are no rules.   Every year, our technology gets better. Every year, technology gets  cheaper. Why would we want to give a lifetime exemption to a handful of  companies that are reclaiming 200 acres a year? And at that rate, we  are going to be into the year 3000. Why would we say you never have to  comply with any rules, when most of those companies are? It just  doesn't make a lot of sense to me.   No one is saying anything bad about these plants. They are providing  a valuable service. They can do it in a much more environmentally  friendly way because technology is allowing that to happen. And all the  EPA and their scientists who study this and the Federal courts, which  upheld their decision, are saying is let's make the environment even  cleaner.   We have seen what happens to our State when there is no regulation.  It is called ``environmental catastrophe.'' Let's not go back to saying  no environmental regulation to this handful of companies that aren't  complying.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. At the risk of beating this  horse to death--and this will be my final remarks--I would just say to  the Speaker that there are many of these plants that are complying with  this rule, and I commend those plants that are doing that.   It is not fair to those plants that are complying that we exempt  those plants that aren't complying or don't want to comply because they  don't want to spend the money to do so. The idea that all of these  plants are going out of business if they are forced to do that is  simply not based in any reality.   I would encourage the gentleman and the Speaker to reconsider this  bill, which is going nowhere. It may pass the House, but it is not  going any further than that. Let's sit down and work together on a  bipartisan basis to come up with a rule that utilizes the best and  latest technologies, that continues to improve and get cheaper, help  work with these companies that may need a little assistance in  complying and help them comply, and then we truly do have a win-win  situation.
