 Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Cammack for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to advocate for Missouri's children, both  born and unborn, and to urge my colleagues to embrace the science of  life.   We know children yet to be born are miracles. Windows into the womb  reveal that at a mere 6 weeks, a baby's heart begins beating; at 7  weeks, a baby develops pain receptors; at 10 weeks, a baby can kick and  jump if startled. Between 13 and 14 weeks, a baby will respond to light  touches. By 15 weeks, a baby can taste, make facial expressions, yawn,  hiccup, swallow, and suck her thumb. By this point, a baby's tiny heart  has beaten nearly 16 million times.   Each week that passes marks a milestone in a child's development, a  celebration of life. Yet, our country remains under the shadow of  outdated Supreme Court decisions that allowed these tiny humans to be  aborted.   While the United States is a leader when it comes to understanding in  utero development and surgical procedures, our laws are antiquated and  radical compared to other nations when it comes to protecting life in  the womb. In fact, we are only one of seven countries across the globe  that allow for abortion on demand after a baby feels pain, alongside  human rights-violating countries like China and North Korea. In Europe,  47 out of 50 countries limit abortion at 15 weeks or earlier, like the  law being discussed in the Dobbs case.   It is time we allowed our laws to be updated to reflect what we have  always known to be true about the humanity, dignity, and worth of the  unborn. It is time for the Supreme Court to protect life. It is time  that they right this wrong. Let's pray they rule rightly. Millions of  lives, literally, hang in the balance.
