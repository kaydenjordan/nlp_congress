 Mr. Speaker, first, I would like to thank our Oversight  Subcommittee leaders, Mr. Lewis and Ms. Jenkins, for all of their  efforts on the important bills that we have been considering this week.   A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to visit with constituents of  mine who are serving low-income taxpayers in our community through the  Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program. I am so pleased to see that  this important partnership will be made permanent by legislation that  we passed yesterday.   I am grateful to my colleague, Mr. Bishop, for his hard work and for  working with me on this bill, the 21st Century IRS Act. It is an  important bill that enhances needed reforms to enhance cybersecurity  and online access for taxpayers, including small-business owners. It is  long past time for the IRS to enter the digital age and to give  taxpayers a safe, secure, user-friendly online portal to serve their  needs.   As a former State Department of Revenue director and a tech industry  veteran, I know firsthand that coordination between private sector  technology experts and tax administrators at the State and Federal  level can produce real results for taxpayers and a better user  experience for all stakeholders. We should strive to harness technology  to create a more seamless and dependable experience for American  families who are becoming increasingly accustomed to conducting their  financial business safely online.   Something we saw yesterday is an ongoing challenge for the IRS. By  codifying things like the Security Summit and the role of the IRS CIO,  this bill should create some continuity in terms of  prioritizing technology improvements and improving the taxpayer  experience.    I am also glad that we are addressing improvements for small-business  owners, like the development of an online portal for 1099 filings. I  know small-business owners in my district and across the country are  tired of waiting for more user-friendly, web-based systems, and this is  a good first step for them. We should be streamlining the filing  process so that they can spend less time and money on tax compliance  and more on growing their businesses.   While this bill is clearly an incredibly important step forward, I  would like to share the comments of a CPA who weighed in on the  discussion draft of the legislation as a reminder that this is not the  end of our work. He noted that cutting the IRS budget has been steadily  cutting the effectiveness of the IRS for many years, and he said: ``We  are at a perilous point where honest taxpayers are extremely  frustrated. Fix it quick, or it will become too broken to fix.''   After hearing from IRS administrators, taxpayers, and technology  experts over the past couple of years, I think we may be in or  approaching the red zone of becoming too broken to fix. Just like a  pothole that would cost $1,000 to fix today or $10,000 to fix tomorrow,  we need to make some smart investments in IRS technology today before  they become insurmountably expensive tomorrow.   Around 64 percent of IRS hardware is aged and out of warranty, and 32  percent of software is two or more versions out of date. Systems that  the IRS relies on to store taxpayer data are failing, and they have  serious concerns that they could break down or fail to withstand a  cyber attack.   These are not issues we can let fester any longer. Let's build on the  progress we are making here today to get those systems modernized and  really get the job done for American taxpayers.                                time  1445
