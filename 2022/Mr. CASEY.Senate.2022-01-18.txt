 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise tonight to speak about the voting  legislation that we are debating on the floor. Like so many of my  Democratic colleagues, I rise along with those Democratic colleagues in  calling for comprehensive Federal legislation to turn back the  avalanche of voter suppression legislation in various States, all of  it--all of it--animated by the Big Lie about the 2020 election. We will  talk more about that in a moment.   It is clear to me that Republican politicians across the Nation in  State capitals and even here in Washington are attempting to make it  harder for tens of millions of Americans to register to vote, to cast  their vote, and they are even making it harder, of course, for every  vote to count.   This is a subversive threat. It is a subversive threat to our  democratic institutions. I believe it is a clear and present danger to  our elections and also a clear and present danger to our stability as a  nation, and, of course, it is a clear and present danger and a direct  threat to our democracy itself.   Just by way of a significant example, consider what happened in just  one State in the last couple of years, in Pennsylvania. I will start  with a historical backdrop.   Pennsylvania, like a lot of States, had a high-water mark of voting  in 1960 in the election between John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon,  and then in 1964, the numbers were very high as well. So in 1960, about  right at--almost exactly 70 percent of the voting-age population voted,  but after 1960 and 1964, you had a precipitous drop that occurred every  4 years. Some years, it would go up a little higher; other years, it  would go back down. But we never got, in 60 years, to that level again.   For example, just the most recent two elections before 2020 in  Pennsylvania--in the 2012 election, 5.74 million  [[Page S255]]  people voted. That was 57 percent of the voting-age population, so down  from that high-water mark of 70 percent in 1960. Twenty-sixteen was a  big turnout in our State.   The year 2016 was a big turnout in our State. We had more voters than  2012. It was 6.1 million voters, and it went from 57 in 2012 to 61, so  it got over that 60 mark, but, of course, 61 is not 70--so we got  nowhere near, even in 2016, when you look at the percent of the voting  age population. That is the backdrop of 2016: big turnout but not the  turnout level we saw in 1960 or 1964 or a few other years.   Then, in October of 2019--this is just an example of why the voting  measures we are debating here are important in a positive way for  helping people to vote. In October 2019, Governor Tom Wolf, in  Pennsylvania, signed Act 77. This was a historic and comprehensive  election reform bill that sailed through the general assembly with  strong bipartisan support.   Consider this: 133 Republicans voted for this bill, when you add up  the number who voted in the State senate for this bill who were  Republicans and then you add them to the number in the State house who  were Republicans who voted for the bill. When you look at it across the  whole general assembly--both parties, both houses--about 70 percent of  the general assembly voted for it. So there is a lot of give-and-take  and a lot of compromise, and they voted on a strong election reform  bill.   Remember, that was October of 2019, well before the onset of the  pandemic. But thank goodness we had that bill in place during the  pandemic. In addition to enhancing election security, the Pennsylvania  law, so-called Act 77, established ``no excuse'' absentee voting,  better known today as mail-in voting. That applied to all voters.  Finally, we had a mechanism that people could vote by mail, especially  in a pandemic.   But, of course, when they voted on the bill in 2019, no one could  have predicted how useful this legislation would be just a year later.  This law was passed before COVID, but, of course, it was in the face of  a once-in-a-century pandemic during the runup to the 2020 election, but  it proved to be, of course, particularly important.   Now we get to 2020. We have had--over many, many years, many, many  Presidential elections--nowhere near the percent of the voting-age  population voting in the Presidential election compared to 1960 and  1964.   What happened in 2020? In the middle of a pandemic, when everyone was  predicting, not just in my home State of Pennsylvania but other places  as well, that turnout is going to be low because people are worried.  They are worried about--and this is, of course, before vaccines. They  are worried about contracting the virus. So they won't vote; the  turnout is going to be low; and we will see what happens. Well, it  didn't happen that way.   In Pennsylvania, in 2020, 6.9 million people voted--6.9 million  people. That is an increase of roughly 800,000 votes from just 4 years  earlier, and that was a pretty good turnout, a really good turnout in  2016. That 6.9 million votes amounted to 71 percent of the voting-age  population of Pennsylvania, which was a point higher than 1960. No  one--no one--thought that was possible. The only way it was possible  was because we had better voting procedures in place.   In other words, if you look at it not just from 2016 to 2020 but even  from the most recent election before 2016--2012, the 2012 election--the  2020 election from the 2012 was a 20-percent increase in voter turnout.  So there can't be any dispute that Pennsylvania's record-setting 71- percent turnout was made possible only through expanding opportunities  to vote for all voters--all voters young and old and so many others in  between. Mail-in voting enabled almost 3 million Pennsylvanians to  safely and securely cast their ballot.   By any measure, Pennsylvania should be celebrated as a success story  of why these voting provisions help people vote. I hope that we never  fall below that 71 percent of the voting-age population. That ought to  be the standard for voting in a pandemic or not. In fact, that number  should go higher when we are outside of the pandemic because people  have different ways to vote.   A Republican-controlled legislature and a Democratic Governor came  together and enacted strongly supported bipartisan election reform  legislation to increase election security and ballot access.   Unfortunately, we know that the story doesn't end there. We all know  what happened in the next chapter, and it is not unique to  Pennsylvania. In response to the 2020 election, we have seen a new  chapter, one focused on election subversion and voter suppression  written in statehouses across the country. Again, it is attributable to  the Big Lie about the 2020 election.   I want to note for the record that when we voted here on January 6,  the evening of January 6, 2020--after the violent insurrection in the  Capitol where we had people marching through this building, calling for  the death of the Vice President, trying to locate Members of Congress  to bring them harm, and also the whole effort was directed at stopping  the counting of the electoral votes--but I want to note for the record  that a number of Republican Senators, in fact, most Republican  Senators, stood up on January 6 that evening to vote to certify the  election.   Unfortunately, since January 6 of 2020, despite having voted the  right way for democracy that night, a lot of these Republican Senators  since then have only validated the Big Lie. They may have voted the  right way that night for our democracy, but since that time, they  haven't disputed the Big Lie enough--some of them, not all of them, but  some of them. And, of course, now they have at least turned a blind eye  to efforts at the State level that I just spoke of.   I think it is also important for the record to note--I won't read all  of this--but to note what the Associated Press found about the election  of 2020. Here is a copy.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  this Associated Press story titled: ``Far too little vote fraud to tip  election to Trump, AP finds,'' dated December 14, 2021, by Christina A.  Cassidy.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:               [From the Associated Press, December 14, 2021]        Far Too Little Vote Fraud To Tip Election to Trump, AP Finds                         (By Christina A. Cassidy)         Atlanta (AP).--An Associated Press review of every       potential case of voter fraud in the six battleground states       disputed by former President Donald Trump has found fewer       than 475--a number that would have made no difference in the       2020 presidential election.        Democrat Joe Biden won Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada,       Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and their 79 Electoral College       votes by a combined 311,257 votes out of 25.5 million ballots       cast for president. The disputed ballots represent just 0.15%       of his victory margin in those states.        The cases could not throw the outcome into question even if       all the potentially fraudulent votes were for Biden, which       they were not, and even if those ballots were actually       counted, which in most cases they were not.        The review also showed no collusion intended to rig the       voting. Virtually every case was based on an individual       acting alone to cast additional ballots.        The findings build on a mountain of other evidence that the       election wasn't rigged, including verification of the results       by Republican governors.        The AP review, a process that took months and encompassed       more than 300 local election offices, is one the most       comprehensive examinations of suspected voter fraud in last       year's presidential election. It relies on information       collected at the local level, where officials must reconcile       their ballots and account for discrepancies, and includes a       handful of separate cases cited by secretaries of state and       state attorneys general.        Contacted for comment, Trump repeated a litany of unfounded       claims of fraud he had made previously, but offered no new       evidence that specifically contradicted the AP's reporting.       He said a soon-to-come report from a source he would not       disclose would support his case, and insisted increased mail       voting alone had opened the door to cheating that involved       ``hundreds of thousands of votes.''        ``I just don't think you should make a fool out of yourself       by saying 400 votes,'' he said.        These are some of the culprits in the ``massive election       fraud'' Trump falsely says deprived him of a second term:        A Wisconsin man who mistakenly thought he could vote while       on parole.        A woman in Arizona suspected of sending in a ballot for her       dead mother.        A Pennsylvania man who went twice to the polls, voting once       on his own behalf and once for his son.        The cases were isolated. There was no widespread,       coordinated deceit.  [[Page S256]]         The cases also underscore that suspected fraud is both       generally detected and exceptionally rare. ``Voter fraud is       virtually non-existent,'' said George Christenson, election       clerk for Milwaukee County in Wisconsin, where five people       statewide have been charged with fraud out of nearly 3.3       million ballots cast for president. ``I would have to venture       a guess that's about the same odds as getting hit by       lightning.''        Even in the state with the highest number of potential       fraud cases--Arizona, with 198--they comprised less than 2%       of the margin by which Biden won.        Trump has continued to insist that the election was       fraudulent by citing a wide range of complaints, many of them       involving the expansion of mail voting because of the       pandemic. As the Republican weighs another run for president       in 2024, he has waded into some GOP primary contests,       bestowing endorsements on those who mimic his ``Stop the       steal'' rhetoric and seeking to exact revenge on some who       have opposed his efforts to overturn the results.        Trump's false claims of a stolen election fueled the deadly       Jan. 6 attempted insurrection at the Capitol, have led to       death threats against election officials and have become       deeply ingrained within the GOP, with two-thirds of       Republicans believing Biden's election is illegitimate.       Republican lawmakers in several states have used the false       claims as justification to conduct costly and time-consuming       partisan election reviews, done at Trump's urging, and add       new restrictions for voting.        The number of cases identified so far by local elections       officials and forwarded to prosecutors, local law enforcement       or secretaries of state for further review undercuts Trump's       claim. Election officials also say that in most cases, the       additional ballots were never counted because workers did       their jobs and pulled them for inspection before they were       added to the tally.        ``There is a very specific reason why we don't see many       instances of fraud, and that is because the system is       designed to catch it, to flag it and then hold those people       accountable,'' said Amber McReynolds, a former director of       elections in Denver and the founding CEO of the National Vote       at Home Institute, which promotes mail voting.        The AP's review of cases in the six battleground states       found no evidence to support Trump's various claims, which       have included unsupported allegations that more votes were       tallied than there are registered voters and that thousands       of mail-in ballots were cast by people who are not on voter       rolls. Dozens of state and federal courts have rejected the       claims.        White House spokesman Andrew Bates said the AP's reporting       offered further proof that the election was fairly conducted       and decided, contrary to Trump's claims.        ``Each time this dangerous but weak and fear-ridden       conspiracy theory has been put forward, it has only cemented       the truth more by being completely debunked--including at the       hands of elections authorities from both parties across the       nation, nonpartisan experts, and over 80 federal judges,'' he       said.        Experts say to pull off stealing a presidential election       would require large numbers of people willing to risk       prosecution, prison time and fines working in concert with       election officials from both parties who are willing to look       the other way. And everyone somehow would keep quiet about       the whole affair.        ``It would be the most extensive conspiracy in the history       of planet Earth,'' said David Becker, a senior trial attorney       in the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division during the       presidencies of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush who now       directs the nonprofit Center for Election Innovation &       Research.        Separate from the fraud allegations are claims by Trump and       his allies that voting systems or ballot tallies were somehow       manipulated to steal the election. Judges across the country,       of both parties, dismissed those claims. That includes a       federal judge in Michigan who ordered sanctions against       attorneys allied with Trump for intending to create       ``confusion, commotion and chaos'' in filing a lawsuit about       the vote-counting process without checking for evidence to       support the claims.        Even Trump's former attorney general, William Barr, said a       month after the election that there was no indication of       widespread fraud that could change the result.        For its review, AP reporters in five states contacted       roughly 340 election offices for details about every instance       of potential voter fraud that was identified as part of their       post-election review and certification process.        After an election is over, officials research voter       records, request and review additional information if needed       from the state or other counties, and eventually decide       whether to refer potential fraud cases for further       investigation--a process that can take months.        For Wisconsin, the AP relied on a report about fraud       investigations compiled by the state and filed public records       requests to get the details of each case, in addition to       prosecutions that were not initially reported to the state       elections commission. Wisconsin is the only one of the six       states with a centralized accounting of all potential voter       fraud cases.        A state-by-state accounting:        --ARIZONA: Authorities have been investigating 198 possible       fraud cases out of nearly 3.4 million votes cast,       representing 1.9% of Biden's margin of victory in the state.       Virtually all the cases were in Pima County, home to Tucson,       and involved allegations of double voting. The county has a       practice of referring every effort to cast a second ballot to       prosecutors, something other offices don't do. In the Pima       cases, only one ballot for each voter was counted. So far,       nine people have been charged in the state with voting fraud       crimes following the 2020 election. Six of those were filed       by the state attorney general's office, which has an election       integrity unit that is reviewing an undisclosed number of       additional cases.        --GEORGIA: Election officials in 124 of the state's 159       counties reported no suspicious activity after conducting       their post-election checks. Officials in 24 counties       identified 64 potential voter fraud cases, representing 0.54%       of Biden's margin of victory in Georgia. Of those, 31 were       determined to be the result of an administrative error or       some other mistake. Eleven counties, most of them rural,       either declined to say or did not respond. The state attorney       general's office is reviewing about 20 cases referred so far       by the state election board related to all elections in 2020,       including the primary, but it was not known if any of those       overlapped with cases already identified by local election       officials.        --MICHIGAN: Officials have identified 56 potential       instances of voter fraud in five counties, representing 0.04%       of Biden's margin of victory in the state. Most of the cases       involved two people suspected of submitting about 50       fraudulent requests for absentee ballots in Macomb, Wayne and       Oakland counties. All the suspicious applications were       flagged by election officials and no ballots were cast       improperly.        --NEVADA: Local officials identified between 93 and 98       potential fraud cases out of 1.4 million ballots cast,       representing less than one-third of 1% of Biden's margin of       victory. More than half the total--58--were in Washoe County,       which includes Reno, and the vast majority involved       allegations of possible double voting. The statewide total       does not include thousands of fraud allegations submitted to       the state by local Republicans. Republican Secretary of State       Barbara Cegavske has said many of those were based ``largely       upon an incomplete assessment of voter registration records       and lack of information concerning the processes by which       these records are compiled and maintained.'' It's not known       how many remain under investigation.        --PENNSYLVANIA: Election officials in 11 of the state's 67       counties identified 26 possible cases of voter fraud,       representing 0.03% of Biden's margin of victory. The       elections office in Philadelphia refused to discuss potential       cases with the AP, but the prosecutor's office in       Philadelphia said it has not received any fraud-related       referrals.        --WISCONSIN: Election officials have referred 31 cases of       potential fraud to prosecutors in 12 of the state's 72       counties, representing about 0.15% of Biden's margin of       victory. After reviewing them, prosecutors declined to bring       charges in 26 of those cases. Meagan Wolfe, administrator of       the Wisconsin Elections Commission, said the number of cases       in 2020 was ``fairly run of the mill.''        AP's review found the potential cases of fraud ran the       gamut: Some were attributed to administrative error or voter       confusion while others were being examined as intentional       attempts to commit fraud. In those cases, many involved       people who sought to vote twice--by casting both an absentee       and an in-person ballots--or those who cast a ballot for a       dead relative such as the woman in Maricopa County, Arizona.       Authorities there say she signed her mother's name on a       ballot envelope. The woman's mother had died a month before       the election.        The cases are bipartisan. Some of those charged with fraud       are registered Republicans or told investigators they were       supporters of Trump.        Donald Holz is among the five people in Wisconsin who face       voter fraud charges. He said all he wanted to do was vote for       Trump. But because he was still on parole after being       convicted of felony drunken driving, the 63-year-old retiree       was not eligible to do so. Wisconsin is not among the states       that have loosened felon voting laws in recent years.        Holz said he had no intention to break the law and only did       so after he asked poll workers if it was OK.        ``The only thing that helps me out is that I know what I       did and I did it with good intentions,'' Holz said after an       initial court appearance in Fond du Lac. ``The guy upstairs       knows what I did. I didn't have any intention to commit       election fraud.''        In southeast Pennsylvania, 72-year-old Ralph Thurman, a       registered Republican, was sentenced to three years'       probation after pleading guilty to one count of repeat       voting. Authorities said Thurman, after voting at his polling       place, returned about an hour later wearing sunglasses and       cast a ballot in his son's name.        After being recognized and confronted, Thurman fled the       building, officials said. Thurman's attorney told the AP the       incident was the result of miscommunication at the polling       place. Las Vegas businessman Donald ``Kirk'' Hartle was among       those in Nevada who raised the cry against election fraud.       Early on, Hartle insisted someone had unlawfully cast a       ballot in the name of his dead wife, and state Republicans       seized on his story to support their claims of widespread       fraud in the state. It turned out that someone had cast the       ballot illegally--Hartle,  [[Page S257]]       himself. He agreed to plead guilty to a reduced charge of       voting more than once in the same election. Hartle's attorney       said the businessman, who is an executive at a company that       hosted a Trump rally before the election, had accepted       responsibility for his actions.        Additional fraud cases could still surface in the weeks and       months ahead. One avenue for those is the Electronic       Registration Information Center, a data-sharing effort among       31 states aimed at improving state voter rolls. The effort       also provides states with reports after each general election       with information about voters who might have cast ballots in       more than one state.        In the past, those lists have generated small numbers of       fraud cases. In 2018, for example, Wisconsin used the report       to identify 43 additional instances of potential fraud out of       2.6 million ballots cast.        Official post-election audits and other research have shown       voter fraud to be exceptionally rare. A nonpartisan audit of       Wisconsin's 2020 presidential election found no evidence of       widespread fraud and a Republican lawmaker concluded it       showed that elections in the state were ``safe and secure,''       while also recommending dozens of changes to how elections       are run. In Michigan, Republican state senators issued a       report earlier this year saying they had found ``no evidence       of widespread or systematic fraud'' in the 2020 election.        Not only do election officials look for fraud, they have       procedures to detect and prevent it. For mail voting, which       expanded greatly last year because of the pandemic, election       officials log every mail ballot so voters cannot request more       than one. Those ballots also are logged when they are       returned, checked against registration and, in many cases,       voter signatures on file to ensure the voter assigned to the       ballot is the one who cast it. If everything doesn't match,       the ballot isn't counted.        ``Often, we don't get to fraud,'' said Jennifer Morrell, a       former local election official in Utah and Colorado who       advises election officials on security and other issues.       ``Say we have evidence that something might not be correct,       we ask the voter to provide additional documentation. If the       person doesn't respond, the ballot isn't accepted. The fraud       never happened.''        If a person who requested a mail ballot shows up at a       polling place, this will become apparent when they check in.       Typically, poll workers either cancel the ballot that was       previously issued, ensuring it's never counted, or ask the       voter to complete a provisional ballot that will only be       counted if the mail ballot is not.        In Union County, Georgia, someone voted in person and then       election officials found their ballot in a drop box. Since       the person had already voted, the ballot in the drop box was       not counted and the case was referred to the state for       investigation, Deputy Registrar Diana Nichols said.        ``We can tell pretty quick whenever we pull up that       record--wait a minute, this person has already voted,''       Nichols said. ``I'm not saying it's foolproof. We are all       human, and we all make mistakes. But as far as the system is       set up, if you follow the rules and the guidelines set up by       the state, I think it's a very good system.''        The final step is the canvassing process in which election       officials must reconcile all their counts ensuring the number       of ballots cast equals the number of voters who voted. Any       discrepancies are researched, and election officials provide       detailed explanations before the election can be certified.        Often, an administrative error can raise questions that       suggest the potential for fraud. In Forsyth County, Georgia,       election officials were asked by Arizona investigators for       records confirming that a voter had also cast a ballot in       Georgia last November. It turns out that voter didn't cast a       ballot but was listed as having done so because their       registration number was mistakenly associated with another       voter's record in the county's system, according to a letter       sent by county election officials.        In other cases, it could be as simple as a voter signing on       the wrong line next to another person name in a paper       pollbook at their polling place. Once researched, it quickly       becomes clear no fraud occurred.        Republican lawmakers have argued there are security gaps in       the process, using concerns of fraud to justify restrictions       on voting laws. This has happened even in places where       Republican lawmakers have pushed back against Trump's false       claims and said the 2020 election was valid.        The review by Republican lawmakers in Michigan that found       no systemic fraud cited various claims they had investigated.       For example, senators were provided with a list of over 200       voters in Wayne County who were believed to be dead. Of       these, the report noted, only two instances involved actual       dead voters. The first was due to a clerical error in which a       son had been confused with his dead father and the second       involved a 92-year-old woman who had died four days before       the election.        And yet, Republicans in the state are collecting signatures       for a citizen initiative that would allow the GOP-controlled       legislature to approve voting restrictions and bypass a veto       by the Democratic governor. Republicans say mail voting needs       to be more secure as more people embrace it.        ``These bills will restore confidence in our elections,''       said GOP Rep. Ann Bollin, chairwoman of the Michigan House       Elections and Ethics Committee and a former township clerk.       ``Voters want to know their vote will count and that they,       and only they, are casting their own ballot.''        Overall, 80% of counties in the six states reviewed by the       AP reported no suspicious activity after completing their       post-election reviews. This was true of both small and large       counties, something experts said was to be expected given how       rare voter fraud has been.        Limited instances of fraud do occur, as the AP review       illustrates, but safeguards ensure they are few and that they       are caught, said Ben Hovland, a Democrat appointed by Trump       to serve on the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, which       supports the state and local officials who administer       elections.        ``Every credible examination has shown there was no       widespread fraud'' in the 2020 presidential election, Hovland       said. ``Time and again when we have heard these claims and       heard these allegations, and when you do a real       investigation, you see that it is the exception and not the       rule.''     Mr. President, I will just read the first paragraph of  this Associated Press story dated December of this past year:         An Associated Press review of every potential case of voter       fraud in the six battleground states disputed by former       President Donald Trump has found fewer than 475--a number       that would have made no difference in the 2020 Presidential       election.    And, of course, Pennsylvania was one of those States that they looked  at. We know what happened in the election, and we know why we can say  with certainty that the Big Lie is nothing but a lie. After the  election of 2020, in June of 2021, Pennsylvania's Republican-controlled  legislature became one of the many legislatures across the Nation  passing a voter suppression law. Here is what they would have done if  they were successful. If they would have passed it, this bill would  have imposed unconstitutional voter ID restrictions, restricted mail-in  voting--the mail-in voting they just voted in favor of in 2019, the  same legislators--and this bill would essentially have eliminated the  use of drop boxes. Furthermore, it rolled back several successful  provisions of the bipartisan Act 77, including reducing the number of  days permitted to register to vote, and eliminating an option to opt in  to receive an annual mail-in ballot.   While this bill was, fortunately, vetoed by Governor Wolf, the threat  to suppress the vote in Pennsylvania remains ever present as the  legislature continues to work on another omnibus election bill.   Once again, the Big Lie animates the work of Republican politicians  in Pennsylvania and throughout the country. It is not simply a lie; it  is a lie that engenders fear. Sometimes fear of losing your election in  a primary--we understand that fear. We have seen it play out here as  well. But sometimes the fear is deeper than that; that your own  security will be at risk if you don't espouse the Big Lie.   In light of these efforts, it is fair to question, How did  Pennsylvania go from a shining example of bipartisan election reform in  2019 to ground zero in the fight against voter suppression and election  misinformation in 2021 and continuing into 2022?   In the months leading up to the 2020 general election, the former  President led an assault on our election system, sowing seeds of  division, and, without evidence, questioning the legitimacy of voting  methods, including mail-in voting, which has been utilized in the  Nation for decades. By the way, mail-in voting allowed us to set a  turnout record, as I said before, in Pennsylvania, for the first time  in 60 years to go that high--of the voting-age population.   The former President lost his election to President Joe Biden, but  instead of honorably conceding the race, he created the Big Lie that  the election had been stolen from him by raising unfounded allegations  of voter fraud, election irregularities in Pennsylvania and across the  Nation. Of course, there is simply no evidence to justify these claims  of widespread voter fraud or irregularities, as suggested in the AP  story and in their investigation that undergirds their conclusions that  support that.   The Big Lie is the fraud. If you want to talk about fraud, that is  where it is. That is the fraud. The Big Lie is the falsehood and the  con job. It is a deliberate, ongoing attempt to sow instability. We  know that over 60 cases in court after court--from State courts to  district courts, to circuit courts, to the U.S. Supreme Court--all  those courts refused to indulge the unprecedented,  [[Page S258]]  loopy, legal arguments and false conspiracy theories that were put  forward by the President's campaign and some Republicans after the  election.   Despite the lack of any evidence to support claims of widespread  fraud, we continue to hear these baseless conspiracy theories in calls  to roll back Pennsylvania's Act 77 for one reason and one reason only:  to disenfranchise voters. So in order to please one man, rather than  support positive reforms that worked in Pennsylvania, that increased  turnout in Pennsylvania exponentially like no other law has, lawmakers  have introduced, all over the country now, some 400 voter suppression  bills.   There are three types of corrupt proposals that I would like to  summarize. No. 1, shifting election authority; that is one measure of a  corrupt practice. No. 2, attacking election workers; that is corrupt,  and that is what they are trying to do. And No. 3, restricting mail-in  voting.   First and foremost, many of the bills attack the most fundamental  foundational element of our democracy: administering our elections.   According to a report from Voting Rights Lab, in September of 2021,  more than 180 of the bills introduced across the country are an effort  to subvert our current election administration. Some of these bills  would allow the legislature or other partisan actors--really, purveyors  of the Big Lie--to exert greater control over elections and interfere  with local election administrators.   For example, Georgia's SB 202, which has already been enacted into  law--not just proposed--this law will allow a partisan State election  board to remove and replace local election administrators. The new law  empowers the State legislature--the State legislature--to appoint the  chair of the election board, ensuring that the majority of the board  reflects the partisan will of the legislature.   We have also seen numerous lawmakers, including in Pennsylvania,  initiate or attempt to initiate partisan election ``audits'' into the  2020 election results without any evidence of fraud. The better word  for this type of approach is ``fraudit.'' That is what it is. It is a  fraudulent attempt, and it is nothing more than a ``fraudit.''   These efforts fueled by the Big Lie have wasted millions of taxpayer  dollars, money solely in an attempt to further call into doubt the 2020  election and create instability in our elections. Republican effort to  shift election authority undermines people's faith in elections, and it  injects partisanship into our election administration.   The second area of corruption we have also seen in some of these  bills is efforts to pass legislation that create or increase civil and  criminal penalties against election workers. Election officials across  the Nation--Republicans and Democrats alike, from blue counties and red  counties--should be accorded the respect and commendation they deserve.  These are public servants. They should not be subjected to threats,  either legal or otherwise. In the middle of the pandemic, these same  Americans risked their own health and their families' health to ensure  that the elections were conducted safely and efficiently. These  Americans--Republicans and Democrats and Independents--did their job  honorably. Rather than receiving appreciation for their efforts, they  and their families have been threatened with threats of violence,  fueled by the deliberate falsehoods of which I spoke before.   The same falsehoods spread by politicians here in Washington and in  State legislatures across the country. These threats were particularly  relevant in my home State of Pennsylvania when then-Philadelphia  Commissioner, Al Schmidt, a Republican, his family, and his colleagues  were subjected to death threats--death threats--for doing their job.   This is a Republican elected official in Philadelphia subjected to  death threats after election day, simply because he was trying to  fulfill--and the others who worked with him were trying to fulfill--an  essential part of their basic duty, which is counting the votes in that  city.   So despite the widely reported threats against our election officials  and concerns about mass resignations due to the stresses on our  democratic institutions, Republican legislatures have enacted laws that  further threaten these officials with felony prosecutions, and they  also threaten civil penalties for not complying with the election  rules, even inadvertent or technical mistakes.   We have never seen this before in America, but that is what we are  talking about today. So these attacks are a clear attempt to further  undermine our democracy and counter the efforts of many election  officials to help make voting safer and easier during the COVID-19  pandemic.   Finally, the third issue, which I would consider a corrupt practice  that is embedded into these bills, is the question of mail-in voting.  As I have already shared, Pennsylvania's record turnout in 2020 was a  direct result of the bipartisan efforts, 133 Republican legislators  voting for mail-in balloting, so that we would have universal mail-in  voting, and early voting in addition to mail-in voting.   Rather than embracing its success, Republican lawmakers in  Pennsylvania and across the country have worked to greatly restrict or  eliminate--or eliminate--mail-in voting through a variety of methods.  Seven States have reduced the timeframe in which voters can request  mail-in ballots. Another four States limited the use of ballot drop  boxes.   Some States have gutted or tried to gut the ability of voters to  automatically register to receive a mail-in ballot for every election  they are eligible to vote in.   Republican politicians just keep on lying about the 2020 election.  Not a single Republican politician has come forward with evidence of  the type of widespread systemic voter fraud that would necessitate any  of the changes that these laws are predicated on and these proposals  are predicated on.   In reality, these changes are about one thing and one thing only-- making it more difficult to cast a ballot.   Every single American should be alarmed by these efforts. If we allow  voter suppression efforts to go unchecked, they will, eventually and  simply, impact everyone.   I think it was Martin Luther King who talked about injustice--an  injustice that would be validated by these corrupt proposals.  ``Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.''   Voter suppression efforts would make it harder. Here are just a  couple of examples from my home State, and this is true of a lot of  States. Voter suppression laws make it harder for a 90-year-old living  in rural Pennsylvania who can't get to her county election bureau to  vote or to a polling place. She will have a harder time voting in  Pennsylvania and in every other State, if Pennsylvania goes in the  direction of some of these other States.   Pennsylvania has over 800,000 veterans who fought for our freedoms,  including the right to vote, the freedom to vote. Shouldn't that  veteran continue to have the option to vote early or to vote by  mail? After they have served our Nation, shouldn't they continue to  have that option? Or should we just go back to the old ways where that  veteran is limited to one day a year, for a certain number of hours a  year, to vote in a general election?    So these proposals--these voter suppression and subversion  proposals--will impact everyone. It will impact a farmer in  Pennsylvania who might have a very busy day on election day and can't  get to vote for one reason or another.   So, if they are not able to vote, their vote gets cancelled out  because we decided not to have early voting, which we have now; we  decided not to have mail-in ballots, which we have now? All in the  service of one man and one Big Lie, that is what this is all about.   So we can't go back to those days.   How about just another example from Pennsylvania? We have had a long  tradition where men and women serving overseas have voted by absentee  ballot. Guess what an absentee ballot is? An absentee ballot is a mail- in ballot. It is the same thing. We just broadened the category of  folks who could use that same method.   So do we want to go back to a time when we can't have the kind of  mail-in ballots that we had in 2020 that led to that great turnout? And  it is entirely possible that we could go back to a time when even the  votes of men and women serving overseas would be put at risk, because  when you eliminate  [[Page S259]]  mail-in ballots in a State like Pennsylvania, you are eliminating  absentee ballots, as well, by doing that.   So I don't think we want to do that to our fighting men and women. So  we can't go back to the days when farmers and small business owners and  veterans and busy moms juggling their kids' schedules and seniors who  may have trouble voting and need another option to vote--we can't go  back to those days when they couldn't vote if they didn't have the time  on that one single day.   It is one of the reasons why we had such low voter turnout, even in  Presidential elections, for all these years in Pennsylvania and in so  many other States. So we know what we have to do. We have to go back to  our founding principles. And voting is a foundational pillar of our  democracy. And, as elected officials, it is our responsibility to do  all we can to expand voter access and remove institutional barriers to  voting.   But we have got to be clearer about what is happening. Our democracy,  by virtue of these suppression bills, is under siege right now. The  attack here on January 6 continues. What was a violent attack on that  day is now in the form of legislation to attack our elections, to  attack the right to vote, to make it harder to vote.   So attacking democracy at an earlier stage was always met by the  right response. Today, that right response--the correct response--is to  pass the Freedom to Vote and the John Lewis Act to prevent these kinds  of attacks on voting rights.   It would protect election officials by criminalizing intimidation,  threats, or coercion of election officials. It would mandate  systematic, nonpartisan, risk-limiting audits to combat against the  unfounded partisan approaches by Republicans.   It would create national standards for early voting, mail voting,  voting restoration, voter identification, and voter registration. It  would also include some of the provisions of my bill--the Accessible  Voting Act--to create an accessible voting experience for every voter,  ensuring that the needs of people with disabilities are met.   That is another category of Americans whose votes will be  suppressed--people with disabilities--if these Republicans get their  way.   This bill we are trying to pass reflects feedback from State and  local officials to ensure that people responsible for implementing  these reforms can do so effectively.   And, furthermore, it would restore the full strength of the Voting  Rights Act of 1965 after the Supreme Court gutted several of the Voting  Rights Act provisions in recent years.   These provisions work hand in hand to improve access to the ballot  and protect against election subversion. We should restore the Senate  at the same time, by allowing plenty of time for debate, as well as a  robust amendment process, so the minority party in the Senate has full  opportunity to debate issues like voting rights.   So we have got to do more than just simply move a bill forward  tomorrow on voting rights. We should also change the Senate rules  appropriately to allow that bill to be passed by a majority after we  have a robust debate. Debating voting rights has never been more  important. The time to do that is now.   I yield the floor.
