 Mr. Chief Justice, I have a question for both sets of  counsel, sponsored by myself, Senator Cruz, Senator Scott of South  Carolina, Hawley, Sasse, and Rubio.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senator Burr and the other Senators is for both  parties. The House will answer first:         Hillary Clinton's campaign and the Democratic National       Committee hired a retired foreign spy to work with Russian       contacts to build a dossier of opposition research against       her political opponent, Donald Trump. Under the House       Manager's standard, would the Steele dossier be considered as       foreign interference in a US election, a violation of the       law, and/or an impeachable offense?    Mr. Manager Jeffries. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and distinguished  Senators. I thank you for the question.   The analogy is not applicable to the present situation because,  first, to the extent that opposition research was obtained, it was  opposition research that was purchased.   But this speaks to the underlying issue of the avoidance of facts-- the avoidance of the reality of what President Trump did in this  particular circumstance.   Now, I have tremendous respect for the President's counsel, but one  of the arguments that we consistently hear on the floor of this Senate,  this great institution in America's democracy, is conspiracy theory  after conspiracy theory after conspiracy theory.   We have heard about the deep-state conspiracy theory. We have heard  about the ``Adam Schiff is the root of all evil'' conspiracy theory. We  have heard about the Burisma conspiracy theory. We have heard about the  CrowdStrike conspiracy theory. We have heard about the whistleblower  conspiracy theory. It is hard to keep count.   This is the Senate. This is America's most exclusive political club.  This is the world's greatest deliberative body, and all you offer us is  conspiracy theories because you can't address the facts in this case,  that the President corruptly abused his power to target an American  citizen for political and personal gain. He tried to cheat in the  election by soliciting foreign interference. That is an impeachable  offense. That is a crime against the Constitution. That is the reason  that we are here. That is what is before this great body of  distinguished Senators.  [[Page S720]]    The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.
