 Madam Speaker, on opening day, we take an oath of  office. We take an oath not to a king, not to a President, but to  protect and defend the Constitution. It is our solemn duty.   In fact, this resolution sets forth the procedures for the next phase  of our impeachment inquiry. We know substantial evidence has been  presented that the President abused his power, undermined our national  security, and undermined the integrity of our elections.   We are duty-bound to proceed. It is a sad day, but not because  Congress has the courage to stand up for our democracy, but because the  President's conduct has forced this action.   I urge my colleagues to approve this resolution.
