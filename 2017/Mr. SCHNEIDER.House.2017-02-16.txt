 Mr. Speaker, I rise today deeply disappointed that the  House has again put attacking women's health over the important  priorities the American people sent us here to address.   More than 4 million individuals across the country, many of them low- income, uninsured, or young, depend on title X for family planning and  related preventative care. This is lifesaving care: birth control, HIV  and other STI testing, and cancer screenings, to name a few.   The resolution that passed today allows States to deny trusted  reproductive healthcare providers from receiving title X funds for  purely ideological reasons. Already, 14 States have taken official  action to exclude Planned Parenthood and other critical reproductive  healthcare providers from serving patients through the title X program.   This shameful legislation puts politics ahead of women's health and  does a disservice to women and families across our Nation.                            ____________________
