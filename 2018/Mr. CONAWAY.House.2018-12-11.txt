 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I  thank the ranking member for bringing forth this resolution that I  cosponsored.   Mr. Speaker, Nord Stream II is an underwater gas pipeline that, if  completed, will transport natural gas from the Russian Federation-- Russian gas--through the Baltic Sea to Germany.   This project may seem innocent enough, but it does several very  dangerous things. One, it circumvents Ukraine, and the impact it has  there. Two, it further dominates the European energy supply. Three, it  will threaten European security and stability. And, four, it attempts  to drive a wedge between NATO allies.   This project is being sold to our European allies and partners as  many things. They are being told, and we are being told, that the  current routes lack transit capacity to meet the demand in Western  Europe. Mr. Speaker, this is false. There is a 55 billion cubic meter  surplus in transit lines existing currently through Ukraine that Nord  Stream II plans to completely circumvent, which is the capacity of the  Nord Stream II.                                time  1545    In other words, Mr. Speaker, Russia is working to strangle Ukraine's  existing pipeline. Once Nord Stream II reaches its planned terminus in  Germany, it is to move southward away from Western markets and back  into existing lines.   Mr. Speaker, the impact that that will have on the Ukraine pipeline  is that, if it goes empty, then it will cease to exist and cease to  operate. The argument that if Russia tried to use Nord Stream II as  some leverage they could revert back to using the gas going through  Ukraine lines is simply false and is misleading.   We are also being told that the pipeline will reduce gas prices in  Europe. This also is false. Nord Stream II circumvents market  competitors and further reinforces Russia's dominance in the market,  essentially creating zero incentive to lower energy prices.   We are also being told that Nord Stream II is a commercial deal with  zero geopolitical impact. Compared to Nord Stream I, which is owned by  a variety of stakeholders from Western Europe, Nord Stream II is 100  percent Russian owned and operated through Gazprom, which is controlled  by the Russian state, i.e., Vladimir Putin, who is known to pursue  political goals and whose chairman, Alexey Miller, is currently  sanctioned by the United States.   Mr. Speaker, the handwriting is on the wall. It could not be clearer,  and we can no longer kid ourselves what Nord Stream II is and what it  is not. It will provide greater latitude for the Russians to continue  defiance of global norms, sovereign borders, and international law. The  project is simply another tool for Vladimir Putin to wield in Russia's  ever-increasing aggressive and subversive activities against the West.   Mr. Speaker, Nord Stream II is a danger to peace as we know it. Our  German and NATO colleagues should see clearly what it is. It allows  Vladimir Putin to have an additional place to put his boot on the  jugular of Europe.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage support for this resolution.
