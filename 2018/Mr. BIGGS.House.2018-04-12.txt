 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his work on this  bill, bringing it forward, as well as his graciousness for letting me  speak today.   Mr. Speaker, I will say that what I am hearing from the other side  leaves my head spinning. I hear yammering, but I constantly wonder: Did  they bother to read this particular balanced budget amendment?   The struggle I have with this balanced budget amendment is not what  they say. They say this is going to go directly to spending reductions.   The issue for me is, when I look at it, I see that we make it easier  to raise taxes, that is what we make it easier to do, by a 51 percent  vote. When I see it, we make it easier to spend like we did in the  omnibus, the bipartisan omnibus bill, because that only requires a  three-fifths vote to set aside the balanced budget restraints by this  administration. That gives me concern, because 61 percent of the vote  in the House would have exceeded that just a couple weeks ago with the  omnibus bill. In the Senate, it was by more than 60 percent. So that is  a bit problematic for me.   I will make one last point here before I continue on to the previous  point, and that is we are going to see 7 years, roughly, for the  ratification process and then another 5 years after that before this  actually is enacted. That is 12 years. That means that we are going to  have probably around a $30 trillion national debt by then.   Now, my friends on the other side who are using scare tactics and  saying, ``This is going to cause this cut here and this cut in programs  there,'' they don't know that. They are making assertions to do what  David Horowitz calls ``inspire through fear,'' and that is what we are  seeing here.   I think this bill could be better, significantly better, but I also  think that hyperbolic rhetoric does not do this body or the American  people good when we are discussing something of this magnitude.
