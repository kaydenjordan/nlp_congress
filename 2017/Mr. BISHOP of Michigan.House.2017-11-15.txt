 Mr. Speaker, I am honored to be here today to  recognize three National Blue Ribbon schools in my district.   Each year, the Department of Education recognizes some of the top  schools from across the United States. The Blue Ribbon award is a  remarkable achievement that recognizes the outstanding work done by  exceptional educators and the hard work of dedicated students.   I would like to congratulate Hamlin Elementary School; Brewster  Elementary School; and my own alma mater, Rochester Adams High School,  for being recognized as being some of the best educational institutions  there are.   I know this personally, as two of my children attend Rochester Adams  High School. From my experience with these schools, what sets them  apart is the teachers don't wait to generate enthusiasm for learning.  Each and every student is empowered to do things for themselves, to  take on challenges, to push their minds, and to think of things in  different ways.   All of these schools are exceptional and are filled with the love of  learning and are devoted to preparing students for all stages of life.  All three schools serve the Rochester community and my hometown of  Rochester.   Mr. Speaker, congratulations again to all these outstanding schools.  Their selfless devotion to their students is something for which we all  can take to heart. Our children are our future, and these Blue Ribbon  schools are committed to making it a bright one.                            ____________________
