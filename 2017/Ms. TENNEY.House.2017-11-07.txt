 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Joe Fraccola  of New Hartford, New York, my hometown.   Joe was drafted into the United States Army in 1968, serving in the  Vietnam war. On June 7, 1969, Joe was injured during an enemy rocket  attack, earning the Purple Heart medal.   After returning home from Vietnam, Joe worked for the United States  Postal Service and became active in veterans advocacy in central New  York, serving as the commander of Central New York Chapter 490 Military  Order of the Purple Heart.   Under Joe's leadership, the chapter has visited wounded soldiers,  sailors, airmen, and marines at Walter Reed; supported military honors  at funerals and events; assisted in honor flights to the World War II  Memorial in Washington, D.C., and helped to commemorate the 50th  anniversary of Vietnam.   Joe is also active in the Vietnam Veterans of America and supports  our local Gold Star Mothers.   Our community owes Joe our gratitude for his service and sacrifice  for this country and for all he has done to support veterans and their  families after his service.                            ____________________
