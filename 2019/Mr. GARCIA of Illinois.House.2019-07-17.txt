 Mr. Speaker, I would like to honor the life  and legacy of one of my constituents and a friend for over 50 years,  Michael Gonzalez. He was a professional engineer, deeply involved in  many Chicago community issues and affairs.   As one of the founding members of the Illinois Latino Legislative  Caucus Foundation, Michael paved the way for younger Latinos to follow.  In his role as vice chair, Michael was instrumental to the growth of  the foundation for 17 years. His invaluable work for our community  ensured that hundreds of talented Latino and Latina students received  scholarships to college.   Michael's dedication and unwavering commitment to the foundation did  not go unnoticed. He was often referred to as ``the heart and soul'' of  the foundation. Most notably, he never received a dollar for the  thousands of hours he dedicated to the foundation.   Michael Gonzalez leaves a legacy of engagement that continues to  shape the foundation. His passing is a true loss for the foundation and  the community. His presence in the community will be missed by many.   I extend my condolences to family, neighbors, and friends.                            ____________________
