 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support to En Bloc No. 7,  which includes Jackson Lee Amendment No. 242.   I wish to thank Chairman McGovern and Ranking Member Cole of the  Rules Committee for making this Jackson Lee Amendment in order.   I thank Chairman Price and Ranking Member Diaz-Balart for their hard  work in bringing Division E, the Transportation Housing and Urban  Development portion of this omnibus appropriations legislative package,  to the floor.   I include in the Record letters of endorsement for this Jackson Lee  Amendment provided by Bike Houston and the League of American  Bicyclists.   I thank them all for this opportunity to explain the Jackson Lee  Amendment, which makes a good bill even better by providing $10 million  to support urban bicycle and pedestrian safety programs.   In June the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration published  its traffic fatality report which showed a one percent decrease in  traffic fatalities and a four percent increase in pedestrian fatalities  but a whopping 10 percent increase in bicyclist fatalities.   On March 30, 2019, in the city of Houston, at the intersection of  North Shepherd Drive and West 10th Street located in the 18th  Congressional District of Texas, Lesha White, 54, was driving with her  daughters when she saw Jesus ``Jesse'' Perez struggling to cross the  intersection in a wheelchair.   Ms. White pulled over and got out of her car to help Mr. Perez cross  the street when another vehicle struck them, and they were both killed.   On March 7, 2019, 23 year-old David Leon Loya was killed in a  collision with a school bus while riding his bicycle in The Heights  area of Houston.   Police report that Mr. Loya was in the bike lane and tried to avoid  the accident by sliding under the bus, but unfortunately he was run  over by the back axle.   This young man was greatly loved by his family, the lives of the  people he touched in his volunteer work, and the bicyclist community.   This amendment was offered in remembrance of Lesha White, Jesus  ``Jesse'' Perez, David Leon Loya, and all of the other pedestrians and  bicyclists who have lost their lives in accidents with motor vehicles  in urban areas.   In the past sixteen years, the Houston area has seen 2,000 deaths of  bicyclists and pedestrians, at an average of 100 a year, with the last  three years seeing the rate increase to 150 a year, according to  federal statistics.   In 2017, the most recent year for which comprehensive statistics are  available, according to the Texas Department of Transportation  (``TDOT''), the numbers were no more encouraging.   According to TDOT, 1,409 Houston-area pedestrians were injured in  roadways crashes:   275 of them were injured seriously; 146 pedestrians were killed in  roadways crashes; 639 bicyclists were injured in roadways crashes; and  82 bicyclists were injured seriously.   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has called the  number of deaths a `public health crisis.'   The problem is no more encouraging on the national level as Texas  ranks third nationwide in bicycle deaths, behind California and  Florida.   Nationwide, the number of fatal bicyclist accidents is rising and are  also amounting to a greater percentage of total traffic fatalities.   Cities are uniquely susceptible to this problem, as the National  Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that 70 of bicycle  fatalities occur in cities.   City of Houston Mayor Turner has launched a Vision Zero Policy  initiative to address the issue of bicycle and pedestrian fatalities.   In May 2019, Mayor Turner invited bike advocacy groups like Bike  Houston to partner with LINK Houston to identify the 10 highest  priority intersections for improving pedestrian and bicyclist safety.   LINK Houston analyzed motor vehicle crashes involving pedestrians and  bicyclists from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2017, to identify  priority intersections across Houston.   This work identified seven priority intersections that if addressed  could reduce pedestrian and bicyclist fatalities and injuries:   Fanning & Pierce; Rochester & Bellaire; Westheimer & South Dairy  Ashford; Long Point & Gessner; Westpark Dr. & U.S. 59 South; Old  Spanish Trail & U.S. 288 South, Fondren & West Belfort; Bissonnet &  Wilcrest; West & Airline; Bellair & Gessner.   Mayor Turner prioritized twelve intersections for the Safer Streets  initiative by selecting seven intersections selected by LINK Houston  and five intersections proposed by BikeHouston.  [[Page H5051]]    The city then reached out to the Federal Highway Administration to  request their assistance in performing a multi-disciplinary Road Safety  Audit for six of the twelve locations.   The city of Houston could fund six of the areas that are listed as  high priorities and needs funding to perform assessments on the  remaining six.   Additionally, funding is needed to make the needed changes to the  intersections to improve pedestrian and bicyclists safety.   We must come together to tackle this problem and work to ensure that  we stem the tide in these fatalities.   The rising death and injury toll of pedestrian and bicyclists is  alarming and merits serious attention but as we know too tragically,  behind the statistics are stories about people who are treasured and  sorely missed by family, friends, and coworkers.   I ask my colleagues to join me in support of En Bloc No. 7, which  includes Jackson Lee Amendment No. 242 to help reduce the number of  pedestrian and bicycle fatalities in urban areas.                                                    BikeHouston,                                                        Houston, TX.      Lillie Coney, Policy Director,      Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee (TX-18), Washington, DC.        Dear Ms. Coney: BikeHouston is writing to endorse Jackson       Lee Amendment 103 to the Transportation. Housing and Urban       Development Appropriations section of HR 3055. Cities       throughout the country are experiencing major changes to       urban mobility, including an increasing number of trips taken       by biking, walking, and riding scooters and other micro-      mobility options. At the same time, fatalities are on the       rise for people who walk and ride a bike.        This month, June 2019, the National Highway Traffic Safety       Administration released preliminary traffic fatality data for       2018 that shows while overall traffic fatalities dropped by       one percent, pedestrian fatalities rose by 4 percent, and       bicyclist fatalities rose by 10 percent! Nationally,       bicycling and walking account for 12 percent of       transportation trips, but 18 percent of overall traffic       fatalities, and yet states report spending less than one       percent of their highway safety funds to address the too       common deaths of vulnerable road users. By setting aside       funds to specifically address bicyclist and pedestrian       fatalities in cities, this amendment will help address this       unacceptable increase in fatalities of our most vulnerable       road users.        Thank you again introducing this amendment to set aside       national infrastructure investment funds to address bicyclist       and pedestrian safety in cities. We look forward to       continuing our work with you to address this serious issue.            Respectfully,                                                   Clark Martinson,      Executive Director, BikeHouston.                                   ____                                                       The League of                                             American Bicyclists,                                      Washington, DC, June 18, 2019.      Hon. Sheila Jackson Lee,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congresswoman Jackson Lee: The League of American       Bicyclists is writing to endorse amendment 103 to the       Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations       section of HR 3055.

The immigrant       dish washers had worked the late shift and were both biking       to a nearby pharmacy to buy toilet paper. Only a few feet       from the drug store's parking lot, a brand-new BMW driven by       a law student, Steven Moritz, who had just left the Estate       Lounge, smacked 17- year-old Marcial from behind and launched       him head-long into an oak tree. The vehicle didn't stop,       according to police. It dragged Marcial's orange and white       bike beneath it for six blocks before disappearing into the       humid summer gloom.''If I had not pulled in, we would both be       dead,'' Miguel's brother Palemon recalled hauntingly last       week.        Marcial was one of at least 23 bike riders killed on       Houston streets in the past five years, according to police       and safety reports, as well as court and medical records       reviewed by the Houston Chronicle. But only four times in       five years have drivers been charged with a crime after       fatally hitting a cyclist.        The tally comes as tensions have increased in Houston's       cycling community, with two bike riders killed in recent       weeks in unsolved hit-and run crashes. Outspoken cyclists       contend the city hasn't created enough clean, safe bike       lanes. They also believe police aren't ticketing cars for       coming too close to riders or doing enough to find people who       run them down.        Fred Zapalac, co-owner of Blue Line Bike Lab bike shops and       a cycling community advocate, said anger is simmering over a       lack of accountability.        ``If we are getting run down, and there are no consequences       for the driver's actions then our lives have about as much       value as a stray animal,'' Zapalac said.        A review of municipal court records conducted at the       Chronicle's request found that no citations were issued       during the first six months of a city ordinance that went       into effect in May and required that cars stay at least 3       feet from cyclists and pedestrians, and trucks 6 feet away.        Some motorists, however, counter that certain cyclists       think they own the 'roads and openly defy traffic laws.        City Council Member Ed Gonzalez, who has been an advocate       for cycling issues, said more should be done to protect and       educate riders, as well as motorists, and train police on       enforcing the 3-feet ordinance.        ``We are a very car-centric city,'' he said. ``We are very       dependent on the automobiles, and we don't have a very robust       mass transit system. There are some major shifts that need to       occur.''                               THREE CONVICTED         Crashes that claimed the lives of riders over the past five       years are often a 'blend of bad choices by bike riders and       motorists.        Three drivers were convicted after pleading guilty in       agreements that include deferred adjudication--a form of       probation that enables them to have their criminal records       cleaned if they stay out of trouble.        One was for causing an accident with a death, another for       criminally negligent homicide, and a third for failing to       stop at the scene.        Moritz, a student at South Texas College of Law, was       eventually arrested and faces up to 10 years in prison if he       is convicted of failing to stop and render aid. Marcial's       death was typical among fallen cyclists and reflects a       reality about many people who ride bikes in this city.        He was riding for transportation, not exercise. He was in       the street, not on a bike path.        Marcial and his brother had recently gotten off work. Like       many undocumented workers, they didn't have cars or driver's       licenses, so they rode bikes.        But his death also stands out.        There were witnesses and charges were filed, although       authorities didn't know about Moritz until more than a week       after the incident when a lawyer for the car's owner called       police.        He is not accused of breaking the law by killing Marcial,       but by not stopping afterward and calling for help. Moritz's       lawyer, J. Gordon Dees, declined comment.                             `REALLY FRUSTRATING'         The deaths cross the spectrum of circumstance, from       cyclists who were riding on sidewalks to others who tried to       roll across freeways.        Mohammad Qureshi, then 19, was driving along the Southwest       Freeway in 2010, when he bolted across four lanes of the       highway to make the Hillcroft exit. He lost control of His       Honda Accord and hit a cyclist riding on the sidewalk of the       service drive.        A year later, he pleaded guilty to criminally negligent       homicide in the death of Marcotulio .''Benjamin'' Tzul as       part of an agreement that requires him to serve 45 days in       jail in five-day chunks: nine days each year for five years,       through 2015. In 2010, Carmenza Arreaga, then 24, pleaded       guilty to a charge of ``accident involving death'' of Paul       Miller and was required to pay $18,000 in restitution to the       bike rider's family.        She hit Miller in the early morning hours along the Loop       610 feeder road and drove away, leaving behind pieces of the       front bumper of her Honda Civic. An anonymous tip to Crime       Stoppers led to her arrest.        Jonathan Turner pleaded guilty in 2010 to failing to stop       and render assistance after the death of Anthony Jones, who       was trying to cross Interstate 45 at 10:15 p.m. Turner was       given 30 days in jail and ordered to pay $5,199 in       restitution. A sheriff's deputy caught him at a gas station       trying to pull a mangled bicycle out from under his Chevy       Tahoe.        Harris County prosecutor Alison Baimbridge said it is not       unusual for defendants to serve sentences in segments on the       anniversary of a victim's death to repeatedly remind them       they killed someone and didn't go to prison.  [[Page H5052]]         ``There is no sentence that you can give anybody that would       actually justify losing somebody's life,'' she said. ``You       can't do that, you can't bring them back. You have to look at       the defendant's life, the circumstances and any potential       issues in the case.''        Despite criticism from some cyclists who contend       authorities treat biker deaths as less than a priority,       Baimbridge said the cases are investigated as thoroughly as       the deaths of motorists or pedestrians.        ``Their lives are just as valuable as anyone else's,'' she       said. She said many cases in which bikers have been killed in       car crashes are especially challenging because they often       involve both the motorist and the cyclist doing something       wrong.        ``It is kind of a double-fault situation,'' she said of       cases such as when motorists should have steered clear of a       cyclist, but the cyclist was crossing the street       inappropriately or not having reflectors or lights.        Among the toughest cases are hit and runs where no one saw       the incident, she said. ``It is really frustrating,'' she       said. ``Their families deserve to know what happened, if       nothing else. It is horrible.''                                 HIT AND RUN         In the two hit-and-run crashes in recent weeks there have       been no arrests. Nabor Rosas, 40, was found in the bayou in       mid-January after he was hit riding over a bridge on       Harrisburg at night on the way home and landed in the water.        Chelsea Norman, 24, was killed in the Montrose neighborhood       in early December as she rode home from her job at Whole       Foods, also at night.        Each time a bike rider's death makes the news it hits hard       for Xenia Sanchez. Her daughter, Leslie Roman, 6, was riding       her bike in 2009 in her apartment complex parking lot when       she was hit and killed by a silver PT Cruiser that has never       been found.        ``It comes back,'' she said at a table beneath three photos       of Leslie that were hung on the wall as part of a shrine of       sorts, along with her daughter's Barbie doll perched on a       shelf beneath them.        ``I know exactly how his or her mom is feeling. It is       painful to see other people go through what we went       through.''        Leslie's father, Leonardo Roman, who ran into the parking       lot and picked up his daughter, who was still barely alive,       found some peace in that though her body was badly battered,       she was not crushed.        ``It could have been so much worse,'' he said quietly.        Houston Police Sgt. Carlos Miller, of the vehicular crimes       division, said there are many reasons why motorists flee       after hitting a bike rider.        ``A lot of times they are frantic over what just       happened,'' he said, noting that they can be motivated to       drive away by everything from fear, even if they have done       nothing wrong, to wanting to hide the tracks of other       criminality.        Among the others to die was Cruz Riojas, 67, who worked in       sculpture repair. He was riding back to work in 2011 from an       Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. He had been on the sidewalk on       Sawyer Street, just outside the Heights neighborhood, but was       hit as he tried to cross an intersection.        The car's driver, Ricardo Abonce, 30, said he was coming       back from a Target and drove through the intersection with a       green light. Riojas came over the car's hood and hit the       windshield.        It was a moment of ``silent shock'' as the glass shattered,       then as he got out of the car and other motorists streamed by       honking at him.        ``I feel bad because he didn't make it,'' Abonce said. ``I       can't have that over me all the time.''        Police found that Riojas was at fault for crossing an       intersection when he had the red light. No charges were filed       against Abonce.                                 NEVER FORGET         One of the few sport riders to be killed was Jonathan       Lennard. The 47-yearold aerospace engineer, known for being       meticulous, had once traveled to Europe to see the Tour de       France and cycled across that continent.        He was killed last August, on Memorial, where it cuts       through Memorial Park, after being struck by a 19-year-old       motorist.        The driver told police that he had the green light and       swerved to avoid Lennard. Police found that Lennard was at       fault.        But Kevin Hood, a lawyer who is a cyclist and runner, said       he was watching Lennard and believes the driver was not       paying attention and ran a red light.        Hood said he will never forget what he saw. ``It is       terrifying. You cannot unsee that stuff.''        Back where Marcial lived, a few blocks from where there are       now flowers and a cross rising from the dirt beneath the tree       where he landed, his family waits for answers.        They have adapted to Houston, but some struggle with       English and even Spanish, as they are from a rural region of       Mexico where an indigenous language is spoken.        Marcial had been in Houston three weeks. He was proud of       his first paycheck and planned to save enough to one day go       back home and buy a house.        Family in Houston who had not seen him since he was very       young was just getting to know him. The brothers went to the       store so they would be ready for a party at their apartment       later that Sunday.        They decided to ride in the street because the sidewalk was       a minefield of cracks, telephone poles and trees. The road       was empty.        ``There was no noise,'' Marcial's brother recalled, ``not       even any cars.''     Mr. Chair, let me thank the gentleman from North  Carolina (Mr. Price) and let me thank the gentlewoman from New York  (Mrs. Lowey) for their kindness. I wish to enter into a colloquy with  the distinguished gentleman.   Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Price for the assistance and resources he  has helped direct to my home State of Texas in the aftermath of  Hurricane Harvey and for his commitment to revitalizing the Nation's  infrastructure in a way that preserves our Nation's cultural heritage.   In 1966, President Lyndon Johnson signed into law the landmark  National Historic Preservation Act, which, among other things,  established the National Register of Historic Places.   Independence Heights is just one of the dozens of communities  throughout the United States that can trace its beginning to freed  slaves. Since its beginning in 1915, it has survived economic hardship  and natural disasters in the period of 1919 to 1921 called the  burnings.   Because of its historical significance, Independence Heights is  included in legislation I have introduced, H.R. 434, that will create  the Emancipation National Historic Trail, which begins at the location  in Galveston, Texas, where General Gordon Granger announced President  Lincoln's emancipation of slaves on June 19, 1865.   Mr. Chair, I would inquire of the chairman if he agrees with me that  the requirements of the National Historic Preservation Act and NEPA  regarding the environment apply with respect to USDOT approval of the  I-45 Highway project that may adversely impact historic buildings and  neighborhoods in Independence Heights, Texas, which, in 1915, became  the first African American municipality incorporated in Texas?   Would it be appropriate for USDOT officials to consider the views and  input of civic and community leaders of Independence Heights and others  in  [[Page H5063]]  assessing whether Federal support of the I-45 transportation project  complies with the requirements of the National Historic Preservation  Act and NEPA?   Mr. Chair, will the gentleman work with me to ensure that the  approval process for this I-45 transportation project in my  congressional district is conducted in a manner that complies with the  law and preserves to the maximum extent feasible historic sites in  Independence Heights, in compliance with NEPA, that have national,  State, and local historic significance for the Nation?    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman very much   Mr. Chair, thank you, Chairman Price, for the assistance and  resources you helped direct to my home state of Texas in the aftermath  of Hurricane Harvey, and for your commitment to revitalizing the  nation's infrastructure in a way that preserves our nation's cultural  heritage.   In 1966, President Lyndon Johnson signed into law the landmark  National Historic Preservation Act, which, among other things,  established the National Register of Historic Places.   Independence Heights is just one of dozens of communities throughout  the United States that can trace its beginning to freed slaves and  since its beginning in 1915 it has survived economic hardship, natural  disasters, and the period of 1919-1921 called the ``Burnings.''

Mr. Chair, may I ask how much time is remaining.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman very much. If I  might, I would like to thank the chairman again for an amendment that  increases and decreases by $10 million funds for the National  Infrastructure Investment Account to provide funding for urban bicycle  and pedestrian safety programs.   Let me say that, tragically, we lost a brilliant young man on May 30,  2019, at the intersection of North Shepherd Drive and West 10th Street  in the 18th Congressional District. When Lesha White was driving, it  was Jesus ``Jesse'' Perez who was struggling to cross the intersection,  and this caused him to lose his life.   Let me also indicate that we know that, in Houston, there are 2,000  deaths of bicyclists and pedestrians. We would like to make sure that  we increase opportunities for safety.   Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman and the Rules Committee for this  amendment being made in order.   According to TxDOT, 1,400 Houston area pedestrians are injured, and  275 of them are injured seriously.   We hope that this will work for both pedestrians and bicyclists.  Bicycling in Houston has taken off in the State of Texas and  everywhere, and we certainly want to make sure that they are safe.   Mr. Chair, let me also thank the gentleman for an amendment that  gives $2 million for the Office of Inspector General account to  investigate the Department of HUD's delay in releasing $4 billion in  Hurricane Harvey disaster community block grant dollars.   We are still desperate. Every day, people ask me when their homes are  going to be able to be fixed. We do know that we are working to move  that along, but we know what is important is to make sure that those  dollars get to those individuals and that we can restore our  communities.   We are going into hurricane season again, and I thought it was very  important that we work strongly to ensure that these citizens are made  whole.   Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for including them in the en bloc  and for allowing Houston to stand up again after a devastating  hurricane, Hurricane Harvey.   Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk; it is listed in the Rule  as Jackson Lee #243.   I wish to thank Chairman McGovern and Ranking Member Cole of the  Rules Committee for making this Jackson Lee Amendment in order.   I thank Chairwoman Price and Ranking Member Diaz-Balart for their  hard work in bringing Division E, the Transportation Housing and Urban  Development portion of this omnibus appropriations legislative package,  to the floor.   I thank them all for this opportunity to explain the Jackson Lee  Amendment, which makes a good bill even better by providing $2 million  to an effort to explain why the Department of Housing and Urban  Development has not released the funds appropriated almost two years  ago to the State of Texas, the City of Houston and Harris County to  rebuild following Hurricane Harvey.   In August of 2017, Hurricane Harvey paralyzed the Houston region  dumping nearly 60 inches of rain, claiming 88 lives and causing $113  billion of damage.   In February of 2018, Congress appropriated $4.383 billion to Texas  through CDBG-DR funds. In June of 2018, HUD approved the State Action  Plan Texas submitted by The General Land Office (GLO), which outlined  how the CD BG-DR grants would be distributed throughout the state.   This money still has not made it to Texas to help those in need.   While the waters receded nearly two years ago, many Texans are still  struggling to put their lives back together and rebuild.   Homes and neighborhoods remain with visible damage from the flood  waters.   I, along with members of the Texas House and Senate Delegations have  made numerous requests to HUD Officials to move the process of  releasing funding forward, but without success.   The last resort left is to seek the assistance of the Inspector  General of HUD to determine the cause of the delay in distributing  funds and to determine what needs to be done to release the funds.   The mission of the Office of Inspector General (OIG) is to prevent  and detect fraud, waste, and abuse in the programs and operations of  HUD by conducting independent audits, evaluations, and investigations.   The OIG can get answers on why the process of releasing funds is  taking so long and whether there is any waste, fraud or abuse  associated with the delay.   Hurricane Harvey was the most economically destructive hurricane to  hit Texas in its history and the second-most expensive hurricane in  American history.   Hurricane Harvey and the resulting flood impacted over 1,000 square  miles along the mid-to-upper Texas Gulf Coast, and into the state's  interior.   Congress immediately recognized the vast extent of the damage  throughout the state and that federal action would be needed to help  Texas start to rebuild and recover.   Finally, it would be beneficial to Congress to know if there are  other factors within the agency that may be hindering effective  administration of the duty to distribute the Harvey Disaster Block  Grant Development funds such as agency vacancies, skills and competence  of personnel, or administration policy that may be contributing  factors.   As the lead state agency for administering CDBG-DR funds, GLO entered  into an agreement with HUD and has worked closely with the agency to  define the meaning of mitigation and to identify projects that would  best help those impacted by Hurricane Harvey.   Despite the collaboration between the GLO and HUD, the rules have not  yet been published in the Federal Register.   As a result, the GLO has been significantly delayed in implementing a  State Action Plan for the funds, the critical next step needed before  the grants can get to those who need them.   I ask my colleagues to support this Jackson Lee Amendment that may  pave the way for the funding appropriated in 2017 to reach those still  in need of disaster recovery assistance.   Additionally, funding is needed to make the needed changes to the  intersections to improve pedestrian and bicyclists safety.   We must come together to tackle this problem and work to ensure that  we stem the tide in these fatalities.  [[Page H5064]]    The rising death and injury toll of pedestrian and bicyclists is  alarming and merits serious attention but as we know too tragically,  behind the statistics are stories about people who are treasured and  sorely missed by family, friends, and coworkers.   I ask my colleagues to join me in support of this Jackson Lee  Amendment to help reduce the number of pedestrian and bicycle  fatalities in urban areas.
