 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Yesterday, Secretary Mayorkas testified the ``border  is secure and the border is not open.''   Yet the situation on our southern border has required FEMA, the  Federal Emergency Management Agency, to be called in. So either this is  the first time FEMA has been deployed just to admire a situation that  is going smoothly or the administration is not being straight with the  American people.  [[Page S1625]]    Here are the facts. Customs and Border Protection recorded more than  100,000 migrant encounters in February--100,000. That was up 28 percent  from January. DHS projects the March totals will keep 2021 on pace for  the most border encounters in 20 years. Unaccompanied child arrivals  have jumped 63 percent, on pace to shatter all-time records.   This would be a humanitarian crisis under any circumstances, but it  is even worse during a global pandemic. These thousands of  unaccompanied kids are being housed in three-high bunk beds in  facilities now stuffed at more than triple capacity. During the  pandemic that is keeping kids out of schools and small businesses from  fully reopening, these failing policies have us crowding these kids  together down at the border.   And, don't forget, the Biden administration policy directs CBP to  release migrants on U.S. soil while they await asylum rulings. That is  without--without--a negative COVID test. So good luck to the  communities on the border.   This isn't just a health and humanitarian crisis, though. It is a  security crisis as well. New reporting suggests that multiple people  arrested at the border in recent months have been matched to names on  the FBI's terrorist watch list.   Democrats claim this overall influx is not because of their new  administration. Well, that would be news to the migrants themselves.  Some of these people have told reporters it was Democrats' rhetoric  that led them to come. Some have shown up wearing T-shirts with the  Biden campaign's logo on them.   Administration officials keep sending mixed messages, repeating  phrases from the White House podium like ``now is not the time to  come.'' So there will be an appropriate time sometime later for people  to enter our country illegally?   Speaking of mixed signals, this week, the House is voting on  immigration bills. Are they leaping into action to repair the crisis?  No, that is not what they have in mind. They are taking up an amnesty  plan that would create a special new pathway to citizenship for illegal  immigrants working in certain industries.   So to summarize, the administration can't admit they have caused the  crisis. They have yet to address the crisis. And House Democrats are  backing policies that would only exacerbate the wrong incentive.                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, on a completely different matter,  I remember distant days long, long ago, way back through the mists of  time, when Democrats said it would be wrong for Washington to overturn  a State-certified election result.   No, wait a minute. That was 2 months ago. Two months ago, every  Democrat, cable news channel, and every liberal newspaper was melting  down over some Republicans' efforts to dispute State-certified election  results here in Congress. I vocally opposed those efforts myself.   But right now, as we speak, Speaker Pelosi and Washington Democrats  are literally trying to overturn a State-certified election here in  Congress. That is exactly what they are doing over in the House right  now.   The voters of Iowa's Second District spoke in November. They counted  the votes. They recounted the votes. The outcome was certified. That is  the magic word, ``certified,'' that we heard over and over and over  again in November and December.   There was the opportunity to present complaints in court. Sound  familiar? But the defeated Democrat passed up the opportunity to go to  court. The process played out in a way that every liberal in America  spent November, December, and January insisting was beyond question.   Ah, but there is a catch. This time--this time--the Republican won,  and the Democrat lost. So Speaker Pelosi and Washington Democrats have  set out trying to overturn the result from right here in Congress.   Congresswoman Miller-Meeks has been sworn in. She is here. She is  working. But Democratic leadership is trying to use brute political  power to kick her out and replace this Congresswoman with the Democrat  whom she defeated.   You don't often see hypocrisy this blatant and this shameless so  quickly.   Naturally, now that the Democrats stand to benefit from this, the  concept of Washington overturning a certified election has gone from a  massive outrage--a massive outrage--to a minor afterthought for much of  the national media.   This is happening at the same time that House and Senate Democrats  are pitching a massive takeover of all 50 States' election laws. The  same people who are trying to overturn this certified election result  want to ram through a bill that would let them control the democratic  processes that will determine whether they keep their jobs and their  majority in 2 years' time.   This isn't about principle. It is just an attempt to use a temporary  majority to pull off a permanent partisan power grab.   Democratic leaders have razor-thin majorities in both Chambers. They  are obviously afraid they are going to lose them, so they have decided  their top priority is a Washington rewrite of election rules.   The Second District in Iowa is just the appetizer. Soon Democrats  want to come for the main course. Every congressional district, all 50  States, every election for every Federal office would have to be run  the way liberal Washington lawyers who donate to Democrats prefer.   Voter ID? Their bill bans it unless States implement a huge loophole  that makes it meaningless. But ballot harvesting, where paid political  operatives can hand in stacks of absentee ballots with other people's  names on them? It won't just be allowed; it will be mandatory  nationwide.   Those are just two examples from an endless list. Outside special  interests are putting tens of millions of dollars behind this.   In fact, some Democrats are so desperate to rewrite the rules of our  democracy that many of them want to break the Senate's rules in order  to do it. They want to break the Senate's rules in order to rewrite the  rules of our democracy all over America. People will argue that it is  worth destroying the legislative filibuster over H.R. 1 because the  rules that govern our democracy are so important.   Of course, that is backward. The rules that govern our democracy are  indeed uniquely sensitive and important. That is why this issue, of all  issues, must be addressed in a fair and bipartisan way.   This isn't a uniquely justifiable place to shred the Senate's rules  and ram through something partisan. It is a uniquely unjustifiable  place to do it.   I worked with Chris Dodd to spearhead the Help America Vote Act back  in 2002, a big landmark election bill that made it easier to vote and  harder to cheat. It passed the Senate 92 to 2--92 to 2.   That is the kind of consensus you build if you want to tune up our  democracy. That's the kind of broad bipartisan support that exists for  making it easier to vote but harder to cheat, a far cry--a far cry from  overturning a result from the last election and dictating the terms of  the next one.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on one final matter, this week  marks the end of Jennifer Hemingway's service as the Senate's Acting  Sergeant at Arms. I am happy and grateful that Jennifer is actually not  going anywhere. While she is stepping aside from the top job, as is  custom when party control flips, Leader Schumer had the excellent  judgment to retain Jennifer as the Sergeant at Arms Chief of Staff.   So, instead of a farewell, I just want to offer a few thanks.   I cannot imagine tougher circumstances than those in which Jennifer  stepped into in this job. She had already impressed everyone as Deputy  Sergeant at Arms, but when the Capitol was breached on January 6, she  leapt into action on a whole new level.   It then fell to Jennifer to take the reins during challenging times.  Her sure-handed leadership and institutional knowledge helped us get  through a safe and successful inauguration just 2 weeks after January  6. Then came the fourth-ever Presidential impeachment trial, and there  have been all the critical daily missions the Sergeant at  [[Page S1626]]  Arms team fulfills, from physical security to IT infrastructure.   So we were lucky to have such a poised professional on the job, and  we are lucky she is sticking around. I know all of my colleagues share  their gratitude for Jennifer's superlative service.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.
