 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded    Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the significance  of the unprecedented events now occurring in Puerto Rico.   According to the May 16 editorial in the Wall Street Journal, ``The  legal brawl over Puerto Rico's bankruptcy begins this week, and it will  be long and ugly.''   As we have seen in Greece and Detroit, what is happening in Puerto  Rico should be a wake-up call for fiscally distressed States--meaning  our 50 States, our cities, and our territories--to get their own houses  in order. It is the canary in the mine that ought to be available to  everybody. At the same time, it should be a cautionary tale for those  who seek to extend similar bankruptcy authority to our own 50 States.   In 2015, after years of fiscal mismanagement and borrowing to finance  their operations, Puerto Rico declared that its debt was unpayable and  had to be restructured; however, because Puerto Rico lacked access to  chapter 9 of the Bankruptcy Code, restructuring its complex debt  outside of the court presented a challenge.   I held a hearing in the Judiciary Committee to examine this issue in  December of 2015. We learned at that hearing that while bankruptcy is  an effective tool to restructure debt, it merely treats the symptom and  it doesn't solve the disease. I told you so, in that vein. I shared my  views and the views of many others that unless Puerto Rico addressed  its fiscal mismanagement woes, extending bankruptcy authority alone  couldn't fix the problem. I told you so that, instead, it would merely  kick the can down the road and harm thousands of retirees in Iowa and  elsewhere who would bear the costs of Puerto Rico's irresponsible  fiscal behavior. The Obama administration, though, pressed Congress to  act and to provide Puerto Rico with an orderly bankruptcy-like process  to restructure its debt.   According to the testimony of one Treasury official, ``Without a  comprehensive restructuring framework, Puerto Rico will continue to  default on its debt, and litigation will intensify. . . . As the  cascading defaults and litigation unfold, there is real risk of another  lost decade, this one more damaging than the last.'' So now, even with  a comprehensive restructuring framework, there is still a real risk of  another lost decade.   Ultimately, this debt restructuring framework was coupled with an  independent oversight board and adopted as the Puerto Rico Oversight,  Management, and Economic Stability Act, referred to as PROMESA. This  approach,  [[Page S3116]]  we were told, would tackle Puerto Rico's debt crisis in an orderly way  and would help to remedy the years of fiscal mismanagement.  Nevertheless, I remained concerned that PROMESA and its bankruptcy-like  provisions would invite years of litigation and uncertainty due to the  lack of existing court precedent.   So it should be no surprise that a recent Bloomberg article titled  ``Puerto Rico's Bankruptcy Fight is About to Plunge Into the Unknown''  described the bankruptcy process as ``a circular firing'' squad with  ``no established rule book to shape what comes next.'' The article  reports that one market analyst ``foresees a chaotic brew of lawsuits''  because ``nobody has any idea what is going to happen.''   According to one news report, this is just the beginning, as  PROMESA's bankruptcy provisions are ``more likely to face years of  appeal than a typical case.''   Despite assurances otherwise, what happens next in the months and  years to follow may be far-reaching and likely will impact us all. In  particular, prior to the enactment of PROMESA, Puerto Rico, like the  States, couldn't declare bankruptcy. I told you this last year, and it  is as I predicted last year--granting Puerto Rico the authority to  restructure all of its debts, including its State-like constitutional  obligations, would be viewed as precedent for giving States similar  authority.   I am not really surprised to see this is happening right now.   Getting back to the fact that I told the Senate a year ago. This past  September, William Isaac, the former head of the FDIC, called on  Congress to pass a law ``giv[ing] Illinois the option of utilizing  chapter 9, which is akin to what Congress just did for the Commonwealth  of Puerto Rico.''   The New York Times reported on May 3 that ``bankruptcy lawyers and  public finance experts are watching Puerto Rico's case closely, to see  if it shows a path that financially distressed states like Illinois  might also one day take.''   The Chicago Tribune's editorial board recently wrote that investors  are growing nervous about the talk of States seeking a bankruptcy  system after the fashion of Puerto Rico, calling Puerto Rico ``the  frightening ghost of Illinois future.''   The editorial wondered how much more difficult it would be for States  to borrow money if lenders knew the States could shirk their  obligations in bankruptcy when that debt becomes due.   For those who weren't listening to me last year, those who dismissed  concerns that PROMESA would set a troubling and dangerous precedent  should take notice and make sure that a one-time piece of legislation  does not create a new norm. I hold out hope that PROMESA might manage  to provide some help for Puerto Rico.   Success, though, will ultimately require strong leadership from the  Commonwealth's leaders, which, for years, that leadership has been very  lacking.   There is a lesson to be learned. The fiscal crisis in Puerto Rico  should motivate all 50 States, our cities, and territories to find the  courage now to make tough choices, which are the foundation of  responsible governance, rather than look to the Federal Government and  bankruptcy as a way out. If they do not, the effect could be long- lasting, harming the vulnerable both within their populations and  outside of their borders.   Obviously, what a lot of smart people told us a year ago to solve  Puerto Rico's debt problems simply has not worked out.   So at a time when States, citizens, and markets are all watching, we  must stress fiscal responsibility and pay attention to what is  happening there in Puerto Rico. Otherwise, the uncertainty and chaos we  were assured would not come to pass may be just over the horizon.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
