 Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to Dr. Benjamin  Tuggle who served as the regional director for the U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Service's southwest region. A skilled communicator and  accomplished biologist, Dr. Tuggle dedicated more than 38 years of  service to advancing the mission of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.   I had the opportunity to work directly with Dr. Tuggle on a number of  issues important to Arizona, including restoring the Willow Beach  National Fish Hatchery, which is a key economic asset for Lower  Colorado River communities. We may not have always agreed on agency  policies, but Dr. Tuggle maintained an open dialogue and willingness to  engage directly with local communities.   The challenges faced by the service and Region 2 are daunting. Our  unique southwest landscape and wildlife are under constant threat from  oppressive drought and catastrophic wildfire. Dr. Tuggle was rarely  presented with easy decisions to make, but he always labored to strike  the right balance between competing interests on complex issues. I  thank him for his service.                            ____________________
