 Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate the 129th  birthday of Dwight D. Eisenhower. Eisenhower was a fellow Kansan, a  strong trailblazer, and an exceptional American. His lifetime traversed  many important eras in our Nation. Ike was born as the American  Frontier came to an end, and passed away only a few months before the  United States stepped foot on the Moon, beginning an exploration into  the new frontier of space.   Born in Denison, TX, on October 14, 1890, and raised in Abilene, KS,  Eisenhower grew up in a humble environment. He always worked hard for  what he wanted. From his early years of working 12-hour shifts at a  creamery, to pursuing an education at the U.S. Military Academy, to  earning the rank of Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in Europe during  World War II, to becoming the leader of our Nation and the free world,  Ike continually strived for the best. Like so many of his generation,  he achieved a great deal for himself and our country, but didn't seek  personal credit for his accomplishments. Eisenhower's determination,  leadership, and honorable character are the reasons that he remains  respected around the world to this day. In fact, just 2 years ago in  2017, historians with expertise on Presidential rankings revised  previous figures to now include Eisenhower among the top five of all  U.S. Presidents.   Although there are numerous examples of Ike's international respect,  one particular instance can be drawn from his 1945 Guildhall Address.  After Eisenhower received the key to the city of London upon leading  the Allies to victory in World War II, he said, ``No petty differences  in the world of trade, traditions, or national pride should ever blind  us to our identities in priceless values. If we keep our eyes on this  guidepost, then no difficulties along our path of mutual co-operation  can ever be insurmountable. Moreover, when this truth has permeated to  the remotest hamlet and heart of all people, then indeed may we beat  our swords into plowshares and all nations can enjoy the fruitfulness  of the Earth.''   Today, we are surrounded by Eisenhower's enduring leadership and  ideas. The effects of his creative innovation and his focus on the  future gave us the Interstate Highway System, the Federal Aviation  Administration, the Saint Lawrence Seaway, NASA, and the Department of  Health, Education, and Welfare, now known as the Department of Health  and Human Services, and the Department of Education. Ike also supported  legislation that welcomed Alaska and Hawaii into the Union; eradicated  segregation in our Armed Forces; and deployed the Army's 101st Airborne  to Central High School in Little Rock, AR, ensuring that the law of  educational integration was followed by all States.   As the chairman of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial Commission, I am  pleased to announce that the completion of the Dwight D. Eisenhower  Memorial, commemorating and memorializing the general and President, is  on budget and on schedule. A dedication ceremony is slated for May 8,  2020, the 75th Anniversary of the Allied Victory in Europe, V-E Day,  during World War II. It is truly exciting to realize that, in about 7  months, our Nation will dedicate a Presidential memorial in Washington,  DC, celebrating the life and legacy of Dwight D. Eisenhower.   I ask you to join me in honoring Eisenhower's 129th birthday. Ike not  only championed the free world as an exceptional military strategist,  but also led our country to times of prosperity serving as a visionary  guardian of the country's well-being. Hailing from America's heartland  and devoting his life to the pursuit of liberty, Ike left behind an  extraordinary legacy that created a better, more peaceful world.                            ____________________
