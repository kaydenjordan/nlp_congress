 Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in favor of S. 178, the  UIGHUR Act of 2019.   This bill has the best of both worlds: It has a Senate bill number  and House of Representatives content. The bill came over from the  Senate, and then we unanimously adopted, in the Foreign Affairs  Committee, my amendment in the nature of a substitute,  [[Page H9206]]  which put together three bills focused on the Uighur issue. It included  the work of Senators Marco Rubio and Robert Menendez found in S. 178;  the work found in H.R. 649 of Chris Smith and  Tom Suozzi of this  House; and the legislation that I reintroduced with the ranking member  of the Asia, the Pacific, and Nonproliferation Subcommittee, Ted Yoho,  H.R. 1025.   So this bill represents putting together those three bills to deal  with the detention of over 1 million Uighurs and other Muslim  minorities in Xinjiang and other Chinese repression of its Muslim  minority population.   The Chinese Government has sought to erase the distinct Uighur Muslim  culture and religious traditions through mass detentions, reeducation  camps, and a coordinated campaign under the banner ``Strike Hard  Against Violent Extremism'' launched in 2014.   Thanks to recently leaked Chinese Communist Party documents, we now  know that the impetus for this campaign came from the highest levels of  the Chinese Communist Party.   In April 2014, General Secretary Xi ordered the party officials to,  and these are the words, show ``absolutely no mercy'' in using ``organs  of dictatorship,'' another quoted phrase, to suppress Muslim  minorities. More than a million Uighurs were then imprisoned in camps.   In a country with the rule of law, you are incarcerated by the state  because you have been convicted of a defined statutory offense. Why are  1 million people behind barbed wire in the Xinjiang province of China?  The charge against them is ``their thinking has been infected by  unhealthy thoughts.''   Where in the world would anyone be free if a million people can be  incarcerated because the government has determined that their thoughts  are unhealthy?   Along with reeducation camps, the Strike Hard campaign has also  involved high-tech surveillance and monitoring of Uighurs, monitoring  and suppressing Muslim religious practice, including funeral practices,  and suppression of the Uighur language.   Beyond its borders, the party has tried to intimidate Chinese Muslim  minorities who are living abroad. And in China, some individuals with  permanent residency status in the United States have been prohibited  from leaving the region. In Xinjiang, the party has forced Uighur  families to have Han Chinese agents live in their homes.    The extent of this Chinese effort to, in effect, ``sinofy'' the  Muslim population of western China is staggering. The legislation  before us is an important start, but it is only a start in our efforts  to counter Chinese repression of its Muslim minorities, and we will  have hearings in the Asia, the Pacific, and Nonproliferation  Subcommittee to develop additional steps that America could take.   I want to highlight two parts of this legislation. First, the bill  requires the President to impose the Global Magnitsky sanctions against  all Chinese officials who are responsible for the repression of the  Uighurs. We are long past the point when this should have been done,  and it should not be linked to ongoing negotiations on trade or any  other issue.   Second, the bill requires the Commerce Department to update our  export controls to ensure that the Commerce Control List, which covers  dual-use items, is updated to create a special regime for China.  Commerce will be required to identify items that assist in the  monitoring, surveillance, mass detention, and forced labor we see going  on in China today, and deny licenses for the export or reexport of  those items to China.   U.S. technology should not be used to further one of the most  egregious human rights abuses of our time. And in writing this  legislation and the amendment in the nature of a substitute that came  out of the Foreign Affairs Committee, we worked diligently to ensure  that we avoid capturing too much and unduly hindering legitimate and  beneficial commerce, including thorough discussions with the tech  industry.   So I thank Chairman Engel and Ranking Member McCaul, of course, our  Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, who was here. I thank Senators Rubio and  Menendez, Chris Smith, and  Tom Suozzi. I thank  Jim McGovern for his  work, and I thank my partner in running the Asia, the Pacific, and  Nonproliferation Subcommittee, Mr. Yoho.                                time  1745
