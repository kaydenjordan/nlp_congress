 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes.    Mr. President, on Sunday I had the great honor of joining  President Trump in welcoming Prime Minister Modi to the Lone Star State  in an event that was appropriately named ``Howdy, Modi.''   When his trip was announced, people on the west coast and the east  coast wondered, ``Why Texas?'' They thought, maybe, he would go to  Silicon Valley to talk to Big Tech executives or spend some time in  Washington hobnobbing with diplomats and legislative leaders. Those are  great places to visit, but Houston is the energy capital of the world.  It is providing literal fuel for our growing relationship with the  Nation of India.   After nearly a four-decade ban on U.S. crude oil exports was lifted,  Texas sent the first American crude oil to India, and today India is  increasingly running on American natural gas. The reason that is  important is, when I visited India for the first time in 2004, I  witnessed a country that is a study in contrast--some highly populated  areas like Delhi and others, and then rural areas on the way to the Taj  Mahal in Agra, you can see people literally living off the land and  using dried cow manure as fuel for their food and for warmth.  Obviously, India needs access to affordable energy that America--and  Texas, in particular--can provide to help improve their standard of  living.   This trade is also vital to our economy in Texas, and we will keep  exporting our greatest natural resource to our friends in India and  around the world as a result of the energy renaissance we have seen and  as a result of the use of unconventional extraction techniques like  fracking and horizontal drilling.   Those must sound like foreign words to people in Washington, DC, who  think we ought to be able to live on solar panels and windmills  exclusively, but I always say, as important as renewable energy is--and  it is important--Texas generates the most electricity for any State in  the Nation from wind turbines. The wind doesn't always blow and the Sun  doesn't always shine, and you need some sort of baseload to try to keep  the electricity flowing so people can be afforded the comforts of life  and particularly in hot Texas summers make sure the air-conditioner  continues to work.   For as deep as our economic ties are, our cultural ties are just as  strong. Texas is home to a vibrant Indian diaspora, with more than  150,000 Indian Americans living in the Houston area alone and perhaps  about half a million across our entire State. I was glad the Prime  Minister had a chance to witness the Indian culture that is woven into  the fabric of our State and meet a number of proud Indian Americans,  including the 50,000 who showed up for the ``Howdy, Modi'' events in  Houston on Sunday, from 48 States, I am told.   Knowing the importance of a strong U.S.-India relationship, 15 years  ago I cofounded the U.S.-India Caucus in the Senate. That was at the  request of one of my constituents who founded one of the Indo-American  Chambers in the metroplex in Dallas, TX, years ago. He is the one who  encouraged my wife and I to travel to India in the first place, where I  learned a lot about the country--the study in contrasts I mentioned but  also that this is the world's largest democracy, and we shared so many  values with that country because of our common English heritage and  particularly our respect for the rule of law and use of the English  language predominantly.   We also saw the advantage of collaborating with India economically-- 1.3 billion people--a great market for the things we make and grow in  the United States and a great way to raise the standard of living in  India as we deepen our ties militarily and from a national security  standpoint. The difference between today and what things were like as  recently as 2008, in terms of trade, is just like night and day.   In 2016, the United States designated India as a ``major defense  partner,'' with the goal of elevating our partnership with India to the  same level as those of our other closest allies.   Since then, we have taken a number of steps to strengthen our defense  relationship, such as establishing ministerial dialogue, increasing  arms sales to India, and the first U.S.-India triservice exercise later  this year. We have made real progress, but there is more we can do to  ensure that our efforts are aligned, just as our interests are aligned.  Particularly as China is on the march, having a strong and vibrant  economy and a strong defense partner in India is more important than  ever.   Earlier this year, I also introduced an amendment to the National  Defense  [[Page S5652]]  Authorization Act, which requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a  report on U.S.-India defense cooperation in the Western Indian Ocean  within 180 days of enactment.   It will allow us to get a clearer picture of current military  activities and will enable the Secretary of Defense to enter into  military cooperation agreements and conduct regular joint military  training and operations with India in the Western Indian Ocean. This  would be a major step to bolster our relationship and strengthen our  defense cooperation.   I am hopeful this provision will ultimately be included in the  Defense authorization bill that is now going through the conference  committee between the House and the Senate, and I am optimistic we will  be able to get the President's signature and see this critical  legislation enacted into law.   (Ms. McSALLY assumed the Chair.)                            Tropical Storm Imelda    Madam President, briefly, on one other matter, Tropical Storm Imelda  made landfall in Southeast Texas last week and dumped massive amounts  of rain all across the region.   It is just 2 years after Hurricane Harvey, which is a more familiar  name to people up here in DC, but the scenes are heartbreakingly  similar. It wasn't the high winds so much as it was the incredible  amount of water that was dumped into the Houston area and the  surrounding counties. Neighborhood streets began to look more like  rivers than roads. Folks were wading in the water, carrying children on  their shoulders, and personal belongings washed away with raging  floodwaters.   We have learned before, and we were reminded again, that these storms  aren't only disruptive; they are incredibly dangerous. Five people have  died as a result of the storm, and hundreds more remain displaced.   Imelda was the fifth wettest tropical cyclone in the continental  United States, with some areas receiving more than 3\1/2\ feet of rain  in a very short period of time. But as we have learned before, these  trying times seem to somehow bring out the best in people.   A group of residents in the small community of Cheek, TX, waded  through chest-high water to rescue nine horses. Furniture store owner  Jim McIngvale, known to all of us as ``Mattress Mack,'' once again  opened up his stores as a shelter for victims. His employees were  running rescue operations, taking furniture trucks out to pick up those  who had been stranded by high water. There was even a 21-year-old  college student who worked all night alone at a Beaumont hotel for 32  hours straight. Not only did he singlehandedly manage a hotel, he and  other guests ventured out into the flood to help distribute food and  water to truckers stranded in their trucks.   I am grateful to the countless people who have helped their neighbors  in big and small ways alike and who will no doubt continue supporting  their communities in the months ahead.   For many Texans, this is the second time in 2 years they have had to  recover from extraordinary flooding. The storm completely devastated  communities throughout the southeast part of my State, and folks are  just now beginning what will undoubtedly be a major cleanup effort.   With waters receding, local officials are now taking stock of the  damage and moving from response to recovery. These rain events--these  huge floods--are often more than any one city or one county can manage  alone. It is an all-hands-on-deck moment that brings together local,  State, and Federal officials, as well as nongovernmental organizations.   Governor Abbott declared a state of disaster in several counties to  ensure State resources are available to local government agencies.   Last week, I spoke to many of the county judges who have jurisdiction  over much of these flooded areas, the hardest hit areas, and I offered  my support. I want to assure everyone who has been impacted by the  storm that they are not alone and that we are committed to working  together as State, local, and Federal officials to ensure that they  have what they need to recover from this devastating Tropical Storm  Imelda.   I yield the floor.
