 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, before I get into my remarks, I have  one bit of business. I understand there is bill at the desk that is due  for a second reading.    Madam President, in order to place the bill on the  calendar--and this is H.R. 4521, the COMPETES Act that came over from  the  [[Page S816]]  House--under the provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further  proceedings.    For the benefit of the public, that is done so we can  actually move forward on the bill. In the arcane rules of the Senate,  that is what we have to do.                            ____________________     Madam President, first, I want to compliment Senator  Leahy, our Senate pro tempore, for his wonderful reading of George  Washington's Address. This is a tradition in the Senate, and I am very  glad we are continuing it.                            ____________________     Madam President, now, on world affairs, today I chose  the colors of my suit and my tie in honor of the Ukrainian flag and in  solidarity with the people of Ukraine during these hard times. I will  have more to say about this later on in my speech.                            ____________________     Madam President, first, I was deeply saddened this  morning to learn of the passing of my friend, and our dear colleague,  Dick Blum, husband of over 40 years to our friend and colleague Senator  Feinstein. Senator Feinstein is our Senate colleague, but Dick Blum was  also a colleague because he was a friend and adviser to so many of us.   In his 86 years, Dick truly led a remarkable life. He was a force of  nature, gifted with a winning smile and keen intellect that he applied  to the benefit of California, America, and even international causes,  including the American Himalayan Foundation, because he cared so much  about those folks. Every now and then, he would call me with his  frequently insightful--often brilliant--ideas. The only problem was his  enthusiasm was so intense, it was sometimes hard to get him off the  phone.   He was a strong and wonderful partner to Senator Feinstein, and he  fought valiantly against illness in the final chapters of his life--a  life so well lived.   Our thoughts are with our friend Senator Feinstein. She and he were  so close. She was so dependent on him and he on her. And so our  thoughts are with her during this time of mourning. We join her in both  our grief and in remembering Dick's wonderful legacy.   I talked with Senator Feinstein this afternoon. And I told her that  when my father passed away a few months ago, I felt a loss, but some of  the pain--a little bit--was sad because I would feel I was so close to  him, he is still with me. And I told her that is how I believed Dick  will be with her. And she told me that gave her a little solace, so  that made me feel OK.                            ____________________     Madam President, now, next, on Judge Ketanji Brown  Jackson, on Friday, Joe Biden--President Biden--made history, wonderful  history, by announcing his nominee to replace Stephen Breyer on the  U.S. Supreme Court, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson.   As promised, President Biden named, for the first time in history-- the first time in history--a Black woman to sit on the High Court. As  promised, his nominee is beyond qualified and brilliant. And as  promised, the Senate will now begin the work of quickly confirming  Judge Jackson to the Supreme Court of the United States of America.   Appointing individuals to the High Court, as we all know, is truly  one of the awesome responsibilities of any President. And in choosing  Judge Jackson, President Biden has hit a home run with an evenhanded  and so gifted jurist.   More importantly, I congratulate Judge Jackson for this historic  honor--one that reflects her skills, her accomplishments, and, above  all, her dedication to our democracy. I have been doing a lot of  reading on Judge Jackson over the last month, and I cannot recall any  one of her colleagues, anyone from her private life, or anyone in the  public sphere say anything negative about her. It is amazing. That is  how fine a person she is and how fine a mind she has. Judge Jackson  encapsulates the two b's: brilliant and beloved. That is a rare  combination. And her nomination is a cause for immense celebration.    I will be meeting with Judge Jackson Wednesday when she comes to the  Capitol for the first time. Meanwhile, I am working with Chairman  Durbin to schedule confirmation hearings on Judge Jackson as soon as we  can. Once the Judiciary Committee completes its consideration of Judge  Jackson, I will move to have her nomination come immediately to the  floor of the Senate so the Senate wastes no time fulfilling its  constitutional duty. We are going to have a fair but speedy process  where Members from both sides will get to ask their questions and  explore the judge's record.   Of course, Judge Jackson is no stranger to the Senate. This will be  the fourth time--the fourth time--she comes before this body. In each  previous instance, Republicans and Democrats together voted in favor of  her various nominations. We voted last year to confirm Judge Jackson to  the influential DC Circuit Court of Appeals, and she received support  from all 50 Democrats and 3 Republicans. And, of course, the first time  she came before us as a district court judge, it was a voice vote,  which meant no one objected to her getting on the Federal bench--no one  in the Senate, anyway.   Judge Jackson's various nominations have won bipartisan support in  the past, and her nomination now merits bipartisan support in the  present. I hope both sides can work together in a fair and speedy way  to make it happen.   I will have more to say on Judge Jackson's remarkable profile in the  days and weeks ahead, but today, I want to congratulate her on her  nomination. I thank President Biden for selecting her, and I look  forward to meeting with her on Wednesday when she arrives at the  Capitol.                            ____________________     Today is the fifth day since Russian President Vladimir  Putin undermined decades--decades--of stability in Europe by launching  an unprovoked, immoral, and terribly violent, vicious assault on  Ukraine. This evening, the Senate will receive a classified update from  the administration that Senator McConnell and I have requested, and we  will be briefed on the situation on the ground and the steps that  President Biden has taken to help the Ukrainian people.   In the coming weeks, the Senate will also work on a bipartisan basis  and in lockstep with the Biden administration to build a robust  assistance package for Ukraine. The administration has asked for a $6.4  billion package of humanitarian aid, of economic aid, and of the kind  of military aid that will help the Ukrainians defend themselves, and we  intend to work on a bipartisan basis to include it in the upcoming  omnibus bill.   Already, the reports of civilian casualties in Ukraine are just  tragic. At least 350 civilians have been killed according to the  Ukrainian Government. But amidst the violence, one thing is clear: the  Ukrainian people are giving Putin a tougher fight than he, in his  monomaniacal overconfidence, bargained for.   There are two people in particular who deserve recognition in these  early days: President Zelenskyy and President Biden. On the one hand,  President Zelenskyy is facing the worst nightmare any head of state can  face: a full assault on his country's sovereignty. But his bravery and  defiance is inspiring. Many said he should leave the country. Putin  thought he would run away. He said: Even though I may be their No. 1  target, I am staying. What courage. What strength. And it gave the  Ukrainian people and all the people in the Western world courage and  strength as well to unite and do everything we can, each in our own  way, to help the Ukrainian people keep their independence, their  freedom, and their sovereignty. President Zelenskyy is admired all  around the globe and most by the Ukrainian people whom he stood so  strong for.  [[Page S817]]    President Biden also deserves credit--credit that is due him for  successfully bringing democracies together against Putin with crushing  sanctions and an outpouring of security assistance. Today, President  Putin is more isolated than ever before while democracies have rallied  together, and this is much to the credit of President Biden. He has  done an amazing job.   Here in the United States, we stand unflinchingly with the people of  Ukraine. Twenty-one years ago, in the aftermath of 9/11, Americans  rallied together after our democracy was attacked here at home. Today,  as democracy is under assault, we must come together in solidarity with  the Ukrainian people. We should all be together supporting this  country's efforts.   When I said the President did an amazing job, here is one thing I was  referring to: No one thought that the Europeans would go along with  removing parts of the SWIFT system from the Russian financial system;  no one thought that we would sanction the Russian Central Bank--two of  the most powerful weapons we have, but the Europeans were going to be  reluctant. Because President Biden was strong, was patient, was  persistent, and didn't let himself get pushed around by would-be  critics, that is now happening. Over the next several months--even now,  today, but even more so as time goes on--those are going to have severe  effects on President Putin.   So he deserves a lot of credit, and I just hope we will all, all of  us, come together, just as we did after 9/11 when freedom was under  assault in our own country, and rally, united in supporting the  President and what he is doing.                            ____________________     On the Women's Healthcare Protection Act, later today,  the Senate is going to vote on a simple yet urgent question: Will this  Chamber agree to begin debate on protecting a women's right to make her  own healthcare choices?   Across the country, it is a dark, dark time for women's reproductive  rights. Last year, we saw the most--the most--abortion restrictions  passed by State legislatures in a single year. Some of them were almost  vicious--the vigilantism of Texas's law. I call it vicious vigilantism.  Many of these new laws are downright extreme, effectively extinguishing  women's ability to even exercise their rights at all. The new, extreme  restrictions fly largely in the face of public opinion. They also fly  in the face of commonsense health practices. Frankly, they fly against  common decency itself, and sadly it seems like the Supreme Court is  close to drastically restricting this long-established right in the  coming months.   So the Senate today is going to take action because abortion has  never been more at risk in America. Indeed, this will be the first time  the Senate takes a vote on a stand-alone bill to proactively codify  Roe. Let me say that again. This will be the first time that the Senate  takes a vote on a stand-alone bill to proactively codify Roe. Every  American--every American--deserves to know where his or her Senator  stands on an issue as important as the right to choose, and today's  vote will do that.   From the moment that Roe was decided in 1973, the most extreme  elements of the Republican Party have plotted its demise. The  Federalist Society was founded with the intent of cultivating a  generation of judges loyal to conservative causes.   Sadly, it seems like the Supreme Court is posed to severely limit  abortion rights in the coming months. That is why this bill is  essential.   Congress must codify into law what most Americans have long  believed--that abortion is a fundamental right and that women's  decisions over women's healthcare belong to women, not--not--to  extremist rightwing legislatures.   We must vote in favor to hold a debate on this bill. I will proudly,  strongly vote yes. I urge my colleagues to do the same.                            ____________________     Finally, on postal, this week, the Senate is also going  to keep working to pass long-overdue postal reform to strengthen mail  deliveries, take care of our postal workers, and put the post office on  a path to long-term stability.   I want to be clear that this bill has enough bipartisan support to  ultimately become law. It is the product of weeks and months of good- faith negotiation by my colleagues, especially my friend Senator  Peters. We could have passed postal reform at the end of the last work  period were it not for the capricious obstruction from the Senator from  Florida. Nevertheless, postal reform remains on the right track, and I  expect we will be able to send it to the President's desk very soon.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, the vote before the Senate asks a  simple question: As women's healthcare comes under assault in ways we  have not seen in living memory, shall the Senate respond? The  legislation we are  [[Page S826]]  considering today, the Women's Health Protection Act, is the first  time--the first time--the Senate has taken an affirmative vote on  stand-alone legislation to enshrine the right to an abortion in law.   And it is needed now more than ever, as reproductive rights are on  the chopping block in the legislatures, in the courts, and, most  dreadfully perhaps, even in the Supreme Court. The right to choose is  intensely personal, and, by and large, the American people support the  protections enshrined in Roe. So Americans deserve to know where their  Senators stand on this crucial issue. This vote--because we are in the  majority--will, for the first time, accomplish that. The other side did  not want to put this vote on the floor.   When the House passed abortion rights legislation last fall, I said  the Senate would act, and now we are holding a vote. I want to thank  Senators Blumenthal, Baldwin, and Murray for their leadership in  pushing the Women's Health Protection Act. And it is with strong  enthusiasm that I will vote yes.   I yield the floor.                                Cloture Motion     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Presiding Officer of the Senate be authorized to appoint a committee on  the part of the Senate to join with a like committee on the part of the  House of Representatives to escort the President of the United States  into the House Chamber for the joint session to be held at 9 p.m. on  Tuesday, March 1, 2022.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10:15 a.m. on  Tuesday, March 1; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of  morning business, the Senate resume consideration of the motion to  proceed to Calendar No. 273, H.R. 3076, Postal Service Reform,  postcloture; that the Senate recess from 12:30 p.m. until 2:15 p.m. to  allow for the weekly caucus meetings.    Madam President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 9:48 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, March 1, 2022, at 10:15 a.m.                            ____________________
