 Madam President, today I wish to recognize the  achievement of HealthPartners, a healthcare provider based in  Bloomington, MN, which was selected by the Centers for Medicare and  Medicaid Services to receive a Health Equity Award for its efforts to  improve healthcare quality, access, and outcomes among underserved and  minority populations.   Founded in 1957, HealthPartners is the largest consumer-governed  nonprofit healthcare organization in the United States. HealthPartners  serves more than 1.8 million consumers with its medical and dental  plans and operates a multispecialty group practice of more than 1,800  physicians. To accomplish its mission of improving the health and well- being of its patients and broader community, HealthPartners has brought  together more than 26,000 employees. As demonstrated HealthPartners'  receipt of the Health Equity Award, their hard work has paid off.   As recognized by the award, in just 3 years, HealthPartners was able  to significantly reduce disparities in colorectal screening and  antidepression medication compliance. In just 1 year, HealthPartners  nearly eliminated the gap in mental health length of stay for patients  with a limited ability to speak English.   Minnesota has long been recognized as a leader in healthcare  innovation, and I am proud to recognize HealthPartners' contributions  to that work.   Thank you.                            ____________________
