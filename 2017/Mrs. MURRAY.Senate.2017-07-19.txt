 Mr. President, at a time when millions of people  nationwide are speaking out and making absolutely clear ``no to more  attacks on women's health and women's rights and no to the kind of hate  and division President Trump sowed on the campaign trail,'' it is  unconscionable that my Republican colleagues are moving now to confirm  a circuit court nominee who is so clearly anti-women, anti-choice, and  so clearly unqualified and unfit to serve on the bench.   Our Republican colleagues may think that no one is paying close  attention to this nomination, that perhaps they will just slip this one  through. They are wrong. Today I am here, along with many of my  colleagues, to take a stand, to make sure that families know just who  President Trump is trying to fill our Nation's court system with and  call on Republicans to reject this nomination of John Bush to the Sixth  Circuit Court of Appeals.   I consider my decisions about whether to support judicial nominees to  be among the most important and consequential choices I make as a  Senator. Like Supreme Court Justices, circuit court judges have  lifetime appointments. They set legal precedent. They decide on the  majority of Federal cases. They can change and shape the lives of  generations to come. So it is a responsibility I do not take lightly.   There are so many troubling aspects of this nominee's record-- previous statements, writings, legal views--they should alarm every  American, from his views on LGBTQ rights, race, and campaign finance  reform, to his vision of the environment and election laws.   I would like to start with one aspect of his record that is  especially important to me as a woman, a mother, a grandmother, and a  U.S. Senator, and that is what this nomination would mean for women.  For nearly a decade, Bush has made countless inflammatory, offensive,  and troubling comments on a number of issues important to women. It is  not possible to go through them all, and, frankly, most should not be  repeated on the Senate floor, but I do want to make clear what kind of  nominee this is.   Bush has likened a woman's constitutionally protected right to choose  to that of slavery, calling it one of the greatest tragedies in the  history of our country. This harmful view is a pattern with Bush. In  fact, he consistently uses anti-choice rhetoric, whether he is writing  about the right to privacy or other case law.   On top of that, Bush has attacked essential health programs for women  and children. For example, he has called the Maternal, Infant, and  Early Childhood Home Visiting Program--which helps provide at-risk  pregnant women the resources they need to raise healthy children-- wasteful.   He has authored an amicus brief advocating for the Virginia Military  Institute to continue excluding women from admission, where he stated  that there are ``different developmental needs of women and men.''   Most recently, on his Judiciary Committee questionnaire, he failed to  disclose memberships with various organizations that do not admit  women, as well as people of color.   I could go on and on, and any of these alone would be enough for me  to oppose this nomination. There are a lot more. Along with his views  about women, we have learned of a disturbing pattern of hostility  toward the LGBTQ community.   In several articles, Bush has praised court decisions that attack  LGBTQ rights. He has used anti-LGBTQ slurs in his personal speeches. He  has publicly applauded statements made by candidates for office and  government officials that oppose marriage equality.   When given an opportunity to explain any of these comments or  previous writings during his committee testimony, he was evasive and  dodged questions, and he certainly did not apologize or clarify any of  those comments.   I don't think I need to go any further, but I hope it is becoming  increasingly clear that this is not a normal nominee. This is someone  who lacks the qualifications and character and  [[Page S4071]]  temperament to be appointed to a lifetime position on the Federal  bench.   It is time for President Trump to stop trying to divide our country  and use Federal court nominations to push his extreme agenda and undo  progress for women and the LGBTQ community.   I will remind my Republican colleagues, we have joined together this  year to reject extreme nominees like this before--Andrew Puzder and  Mark Green. Those, by the way, were temporary Cabinet positions. This  is a lifetime appointment. I hope we do the right thing and reject this  nomination.   Before I conclude, it is my understanding that Senate Republicans may  attempt to misrepresent Bush's harmful record on women. In case there  is any confusion, I would like to read a statement from Planned  Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky on the Bush nomination:         Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky calls on Sen.       Mitch McConnell and Sen. Rand Paul to reject the nomination       of John Bush to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.        Bush has demonstrated that he is unqualified for this       federal court in upholding fundamental constitutional rights       in his writings comparing abortion and slavery, while       applauding statements that demonstrate a record of hostility       to women and LGBTQ individuals.        Sen. McConnell's statements citing PPINK board members       support on the Bush nomination do not reflect the       organizational position of the Planned Parenthood affiliate       in Kentucky and Indiana and we urge the Senate to reject a       nominee that lacks the independence and temperament necessary       for a federal judgeship.    Mr. President, I urge our Republican colleagues to make the right  choice: to reject this nominee and put in place a person in a court  position that is a lifetime appointment, one who all Americans feel  will represent them on the bench.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
