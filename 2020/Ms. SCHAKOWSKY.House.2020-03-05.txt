 Mr. Speaker, I rise to remind my colleagues of what  is at stake at the Supreme Court in coming weeks.   Yesterday, the Court began to hear arguments in a major abortion  rights case, June Medical Services v. Russo.   If the Louisiana law in question goes into effect, only one clinic  remains in the entire State. Only one physician would continue to  provide abortion services to the 10,000 women who seek them every year.  That outcome would deny thousands of women in Louisiana their  constitutional protection: the protected right to access abortion care.   In 2016, the Court already decided that an identical case was  unconstitutional. But since President Trump has added two conservative  Justices to the Supreme Court, it is more important than ever for us to  speak out about what is at stake, and I am proud to do that today.   The Court should not uphold the Louisiana law and should overturn it.  [[Page H1524]]                                ____________________
