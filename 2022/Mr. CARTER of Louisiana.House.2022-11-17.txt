Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on S. 3092, as  amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I rise in support of S. 3092, the FIRE Act. This legislation led by  Representative Lofgren in the House and Senator Padilla in the Senate  is designed to ensure FEMA's preparedness and response efforts address  the unique nature of wildfires.   The bulk of FEMA's programs are designed to serve the victims of  disasters caused by floods and hurricanes. However, climate change has  made the threat of wildfire in communities grow each year. FEMA must  serve all disaster survivors equally and adapt their programs to meet  the challenges of wildfires.   This legislation encourages FEMA to predeploy assets during times of  high risk of fire, evaluates public assistance eligibility post-fire,  addresses equity of assistance for Tribal communities, and requires  trainings for crisis counselors and caseworkers to ensure that they are  equipped to meet the needs of economically disadvantaged survivors.   I support this effort and ask my colleagues to do the same.  [[Page H8559]]    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lofgren), the author of this  outstanding piece of legislation.    Madam Speaker, in closing, it is time that  communities impacted by wildfires receive the same quality of  assistance as communities impacted by hurricanes and floods. S. 3092  addresses the threat of fire head-on and will make communities safer.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this good legislation,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 8416) to improve individual assistance provided  by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 8416         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(3) The Administrator, after consulting with disaster       assistance agencies, publishes standard rules of behavior for       disaster assistance agencies, block grant recipients, and       personnel granted access to disaster assistance information       to protect such information from improper disclosure.        (c) Collection and Sharing of Additional Records and       Information.--        (1) In general.--The Administrator may authorize the       collection, maintenance, sharing, and use of additional       disaster assistance information by publishing a notice on       DisasterAssistance.gov that includes a detailed description       of--        (A) the specific amendments to the collection, maintenance,       and sharing of disaster assistance information authorized;        (B) why each such amendment to how disaster assistance       information is collected, maintained, or shared is necessary       to carry out the purposes of a disaster assistance program       and consistent with the fair information practice principles;       and        (C) the disaster assistance agencies and block grant       recipients that will be granted access to the additional       information to carry out the purposes of any disaster       assistance program.

(3) Waiver of information collection requirements.--        (A) In general.--Upon the declaration of a major disaster       or emergency pursuant to sections 401 or 501 of the Robert T.       Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42       U.S.C. 5170; 5191), the President may direct the       Administrator to waive the requirements of subchapter I of       chapter 35 of title 44, United States Code, with respect to       voluntary collection of information for the duration of such       major disaster or emergency.

APPLICABILITY.         The amendments made by sections 4, 5, 7, 9, and 12 shall       only apply to amounts appropriated on or after the date of       enactment of this Act.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 8416, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 8416. This legislation,  introduced by Subcommittee Chair Dina Titus, significantly improves  disaster assistance programs for individuals and families.   It is undeniable that climate change has transformed the nature and  severity of natural disasters in the United States. This has caused  real and devastating impacts for those who find themselves living in  the path of these disasters. Their lives will be upended by the loss of  savings, homes, loved ones, and peace of mind.   Survivors turn to their government, especially to the Federal  Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, for support after what may have  been the worst day of their lives. We know this by firsthand experience  in my home State of Louisiana. In Congress, we must do everything in  our power to ensure that Federal Government offers a hand of support  that is fair, capable, and compassionate.   This package includes several key provisions to improve disaster  assistance programs and survivor outcomes. First, this package will  create universal application for direct Federal assistance and enable  Federal agencies to share relevant disaster assistance information with  each other.   The bureaucracy of the current application and evaluation process can  leave survivors so overwhelmed that they give up hope on accessing the  aid they are, in fact, entitled to. I have heard this from my own  constituents. It is a travesty. It adds insult to injury. That is why I  support this substantial step forward to cut red tape, streamline  survivors' access to assistance, and reduce the time it takes for our  communities to recover.   Second, this legislation gives FEMA new authorities that  significantly expand the agency's ability to make disaster damaged  homes more resilient. It is common sense to encourage mitigation  activities in disaster-prone areas. Homes that were impacted once by a  disaster are likely to be impacted again, and those hard-hit households  may need extra help to rebuild stronger.   Third, several amendments were made to the Stafford Act which enables  FEMA to support innovative post-disaster housing solutions. Natural  disasters can exacerbate housing crises already existing in communities  much like those which I represent. This bill seeks to help.   For example, it authorizes the agency to provide direct repair  assistance to homeowners, which may reduce the amount of time survivors  spend in temporary shelters or housing before returning home. It also  authorizes FEMA to reimburse States that implement their own innovative  post-disaster housing solutions.   Lastly, this legislation includes a series of reports and studies  that may identify existing challenges in the administration of current  post-disaster housing programs and propose new solutions.   H.R. 8416 is designed to put survivors first and get them back on  their feet after disasters faster. Disasters recognize no boundaries,  and we must in turn strengthen and continually improve our disaster  preparedness, response, and recovery systems from sea to shining sea.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to support this effort, and I reserve the  balance of my time.

Dear Chairman DeFazio: I am writing with respect to H.R.       8416, the ``Disaster Survivors Fairness Act of 2022''. Thank       you for consulting with the Committee on Small Business       regarding the matters in H.R. 8416 that fall within the       Committee's jurisdiction.        As a result of your consultation with us on this measure       and in order to expeditiously move the bill to the floor, I       forego further consideration of H.R. 8416. The Committee on       Small Business takes this action with our mutual       understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction over the       subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and       the Committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as       the bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may       address any remaining issues that fall within our       jurisdiction. Further, I request your support for the       appointment of an appropriate number of conferees from the       Committee on Small Business during any House-Senate       conference involving this or similar legislation.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming our understanding regarding H.R. 8416 and would       ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be       included in the Committee Report and the Congressional Record       during floor consideration of the measure. Thank you for the       cooperative spirit in which you have worked regarding this       matter and others between our respective committees.            Sincerely,                                                Nydia M.

Hon. Nydia M. Velazquez,      Chairwoman, Committee on Small Business,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Velazquez: Thank you for your letter       regarding H.R. 8416, the Disaster Survivors Fairness Act of       2022.

I agree that the Committee on Small Business has valid       jurisdictional claims to certain provisions in this important       legislation, and I further agree that by forgoing formal       consideration of the bill, the Committee on Small Business is       not waiving any jurisdiction over any relevant subject       matter. Additionally, if requested I will support the       appointment of conferees from the Committee  [[Page H8564]]       on Small Business should a House-Senate conference be       convened on this legislation.

In       addition, should a conference on the bill be necessary, I       would support your effort to seek appointment of an       appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate       conference involving provisions within this legislation on       which the Committee on Financial Services has a valid       jurisdictional claim.        I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation,       and I will ensure that our exchange of letters is included in       the Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R.       8416.
