 Madam Speaker, I stand here today on behalf of the  hardworking Nevadans hurt most by this recent shutdown: The 3,512  Federal workers in Nevada who are missing out on paychecks; the 34,000  people in my district who could lose their nutritional assistance; the  1.1 million Nevada families whose tax refunds could be delayed; the air  traffic controllers and TSA agents at McCarran International Airport  who are forced to work without pay.   It is time to reopen the government and stop this shutdown from  taking even more money out of their pockets. That is why I voted for  bipartisan legislation to end this shutdown on the very first day of  this new Congress.   It is time to reopen the government and get back to work on behalf of  the American people and the people of Nevada's Fourth.                            ____________________
