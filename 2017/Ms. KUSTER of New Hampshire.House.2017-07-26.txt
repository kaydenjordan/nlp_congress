 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because it is  long past time that the American people got a better deal.   All Americans want the same thing: a fair chance to get ahead and a  better deal than the raw deal that many have right now.   Granite Staters in my district want to have the skills to get ahead  in the 21st century economy. We want better pay and better jobs. Many  women, and increasingly more men, are what we know as the ``sandwich''  generation, caring for young children and aging parents and relatives,  often at the same time.   That is why we need paid family leave and sick leave. We need to  expand our educational system and skills training for all types of  opportunities.   Just this week, the Girl Scouts of America announced 23 new merit  badges in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. This is  symbolic of what we need to do as a nation. Encourage young people,  boys and girls, to pursue their interests in the fields that will be  the cornerstone of the 21st century economy.   America deserves a better deal, and that is what we are offering.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained.  Had I been present, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 414.
