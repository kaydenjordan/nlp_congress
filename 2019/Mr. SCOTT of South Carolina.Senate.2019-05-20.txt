 Mr. President, it is my privilege  to recognize and commend the Montessori School of Greenville for nearly  50 years of community service and teaching. At the end of this month,  former teachers, directors, local educators, alumni, and students will  gather to honor this longstanding educational leader in the Upstate as  they close their doors.   The Greenville Montessori School has been a true model of education,  since its humble beginnings from a church basement in 1970. At that  time, it was the first Montessori school in the State of South  Carolina. Since then, it has maintained the authentic principles and  practices of the Montessori curriculum and developed a skilled staff  and educational materials that provided training to countless teachers,  helped establish other Montessori schools, and influenced alternative  education models in the region and State.   This school developed a passion for learning, a sense of  accountability, and a value for independent work in thousands of  children in the Upstate. Many of these children grew up and sent their  own children to this school, and it became a place for families and  lifelong friends.   Today I celebrate the parents and educators who pushed and continue  to push for improved educational offerings and programs like this one.  Their work is informing and guiding the evolution of the school system  and its offerings to provide safe environments and rigorous curriculums  that will ensure our State's children can effectively compete in the  local and global workforce and productively contribute to our society.   I would like to recognize and honor the Montessori School of  Greenville and every type of K-12 school--public, private, charter  school, homeschool, and online--that helps prepare our next generation  for college, the workforce, and the amazing opportunities that lie  ahead.   I pass along my sincerest gratitude to the many directors, educators,  and local leaders involved with Greenville Montessori School in the  past 50 years for contributing to and perpetuating the most important  and precious opportunity we can offer our children: an  education.                            ____________________
