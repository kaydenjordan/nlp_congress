 Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join Chairman DeFazio,  Ranking Member Graves, and Ranking Member Rouzer in bringing to the  floor the bipartisan and bicameral Water Resources Development Act of  2022.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        December 8, 2022, on page H8851, in the third column, the  following appeared: Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join Chairman DEFAZIO, Ranking  Member GRAVES, and Ranking Member ROUZER in bringing to the floor  the bipartisan and bicameral Water Resources Development Act of  2022.      The online version has been corrected to read: Mr. Speaker, I  yield back the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, I  am pleased to join Chairman DEFAZIO, Ranking Member GRAVES, and  Ranking Member ROUZER in bringing to the floor the bipartisan and  bicameral Water Resources Development Act of 2022.    ========================= END NOTE =========================      The Water Resources Development Act is our legislative commitment to  investing in and protecting our communities from flooding events,  restoring our environment and ecosystems, and keeping our Nation's  competitiveness by supporting our ports and harbors.  [[Page H8852]]    Through the biennial enactment of WRDA legislation, the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee has addressed local,  regional, and national needs through authorization of new U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers projects, studies, and policies that benefit every  corner of the Nation.   We held 4 hearings in preparation for this bill including a Member  Day hearing. We had a formal process to receive legislative, policy and  project ideas from Members which resulted in over 1,500 ideas submitted  to us by Members. I thank all Members for engaging with the Committee  on this bill and advocating for the needs of your districts. We were  able to incorporate most of the requests from Members into this bill.   I am particularly thankful that we were able to make a commitment in  this WRDA to address the needs of tribal and disadvantaged communities.  The bill requires the Army Corps of Engineers to improve outreach to  these communities by creating liaison programs in each Corps district  region across the country. WRDA includes provisions to develop  technical assistance programs that provide guidance to tribal  communities on water resource projects, identify opportunities and  challenges on existing Corps projects, and provide planning assistance  for future projects. The bill gives Corps personnel the training and  tools to effectively address issues on tribal lands of ancestral,  historic, and cultural significance, including burial grounds.   WRDA also continues the effort that we started 10 years ago to  improve water supply at Corps dams by addressing managed aquifer  replenishment so that dams can hold water for recharge to local ground  water basins. The bill addresses the buildup and removal of sediment in  reservoirs to improve the operations and capacity of dams. The bill  requires the Corps to take a particular focus on infrastructure in the  west to evaluate opportunities to improve water management, water  supply, and address the impacts of climate change.   The bill continues congress's goal of improving dam safety by  assessing the status of all dams maintained by the Corps and  determining the needs for rehabilitation, retrofit, or removal.   The bill includes bipartisan legislation Ranking Member Rouzer and I  introduced titled H.R. 7762, the Army Corps of Engineers Military  Personnel Augmentation Act. It amends an outdated 1956 law, which is  prohibitive against current soldiers who have the technical skills to  provide engineering support to the civil works mission of the Army  Corps.   In 1956, there were very few NCOs with advanced degrees, so it was  presumed that only commissioned officers would be properly trained to  handle Civil Works responsibilities. However, since that time and the  development of the professional army, there are many NCOs, National  Guard Officers, and Warrant Officers with advanced engineering and  technical skills, and it no longer makes sense to exclude them from  positions in Civil Works. This change is supported by the Secretary of  the Army, the Chief of Engineers, and the National Guard Association of  the United States.   The bill also provides for hundreds of local concerns throughout the  country. I am proud that this bill transfers the authorization of 31  debris basins in my region to the Los Angeles County Flood Control  District. These debris basins are locally owned, and have been  successfully operated and maintained by Los Angeles County for decades.  This provision will formalize the current operation of these debris  basins.   WRDA includes authorizations for the development of stormwater,  sewer, and ecosystem restoration projects in the San Gabriel Valley and  greater Los Angeles County. This will improve flood protection and  boost local water supply at the same time by investing in spreading  grounds, dam infrastructure, and treatment operations.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the many people who have helped  this bill become a reality. Thank you to the leadership at the U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers, Assistant Secretary Connor, Lieutenant General  Spellmon, and their incredible staff who have worked through over a  thousand submissions we received for WRDA 2022.   I am very fortunate to have some of the best water leaders in the  country in my district and Southern California who provided valuable  input for this bill including Col. Julie Balten of the Los Angeles  District, Los Angeles County Supervisors Hilda Solis and Kathryn  Barger, Los Angeles County Public Works Director Mark Pestrella,  California State Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon, and San Gabriel  Valley Watermaster Tony Zampiello.   I would particularly like to thank the Subcommittee Ranking Member  David Rouzer for his friendship and collegiality through the hearings  and meetings that led to this bipartisan accomplishment. And most  importantly I would like to thank the incredible water subcommittee  staff including Alexa Williams, Logan Ferree, Michael Bauman, Ryan  Seiger, Ryan Hambleton, and the rest of the majority and minority  staff.   I urge my colleagues to support WRDA 2022.
