 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 135) to amend the Notification and Federal Employee  Antidiscrimination and Retaliation Act of 2002 to strengthen Federal  antidiscrimination laws enforced by the Equal Employment Opportunity  Commission and expand accountability within the Federal Government, and  for other purposes.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 135.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, today I am very pleased to bring to the floor six  bills from the Committee on Oversight and Reform. Each bill, I am very  glad to say, enjoys bipartisan sponsorship. These measures will  strengthen protections for Federal employees and for congressional  interns and enhance accountability and improve the Federal procurement  and grant processes.   The first measure we are bringing today is H.R. 135, the Federal  Employee Antidiscrimination Act. This bill is essentially identical to  legislation that has passed the House in each of the two previous  Congresses. In the 114th Congress, the measure passed by a vote of 403- 0; and in the last Congress, it passed by voice vote.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues--Representatives Meadows,  Norton, Sensenbrenner, and Jackson Lee--for working with me on this  measure.                                time  1245    I thank them for their leadership and their commitment for improving  our Federal equal opportunity programs.   Let me also thank Tanya Ward Jordan, Paulette Taylor, and all the  members of the Coalition 4 Change, known as C4C, for their work on this  measure and for their years of perseverance as we have worked to try to  get this measure enacted into law.   One of my highest priorities as chairman of the Oversight Committee  is to protect the right of every single Federal employee, every Federal  job applicant, and indeed of every citizen, to equality of opportunity.  While the clear majority of Federal workplaces are in compliance with  the standards for a model Equal Employment Opportunity program  promulgated by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, sadly, some  still are not. It is past time for these failures to be corrected.   During our committee's bipartisan investigations of several different  agencies--including the Forest Service, the Park Service, and the  Transportation Security Administration--we have seen firsthand the  consequences that employees suffer when agencies fail to operate model  EEO programs or when they do not handle complaints of harassment and  discrimination in a fair, timely, consistent, and thorough manner.   We have also seen how employees who file complaints with their  agencies' EEO programs can be victimized again if appropriate steps are  not taken to prevent the disclosure of complainants' identities and  personal information.   H.R. 135 would strengthen the management of Federal EEO programs by  requiring that they operate independently of agencies' human resources  and general counsel offices. H.R. 135 would require that the head of  each agency EEO program report directly to the head of the agency. This  policy is critical to ensuring that agencies prioritize their EEO  programs at the highest levels and that their sole purpose is to ensure  equal opportunity for all employees.   H.R. 135 would strengthen the accountability mechanisms that are  central to effectiveness of the EEO process. The bill would also  prohibit any forms, policies, or agreements that seek to prevent an  employee from disclosing waste, fraud, or abuse to Congress, the Office  of Special Counsel, or an Inspector General.   Madam Speaker, the provisions in this bill are very simple, and the  entire House has repeatedly supported them on a bipartisan basis. I  urge my colleagues to support H.R. 135, and I urge the Senate to pass  this bill as quickly as possible.   Let me be clear that while the measure before us is important to  improving our Federal workplaces, many of those workplaces are shut  down today, and they have been shut down longer than at any time in our  great Nation's history. As the legislation before us proves, we can  come together in a bipartisan manner to enact measures that will help  the millions of Americans who work for the Federal Government.   As I have often said, our Federal employees do not want us, the  government, to hurt them; they want us to help them. We ought to be  able to come together on a bipartisan basis and take the simple step of  reopening our government and ensuring that the programs and services on  which our Nation depends are functioning and that the people who work  for us get paid so they can take care of their families and take care  of their bills, for they give their blood, their sweat, and their tears  to keep our country together.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from the  District of Columbia an additional 2 minutes.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time  remains?    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I just want to associate myself with the words of the  gentlewoman from the District of Columbia. So often what we see is our  Federal employees often being criticized when it came to trying to find  money when we have budgetary problems. It seems that there is an effort  to constantly go in to the Federal employees and make them pay. And  they do all kinds of jobs. I agree with the gentlewoman. This bill does  not solve the problem with the shutdown.                                time  1300    At least I hope that we are sending a message to them that we care  about them and that we understand and we feel their pain.   I agree with the gentlewoman. In some kind of way, we ought to be  able to move from where we are to getting folks back to work, an  independent group looking at, perhaps, the issues that confront the  compromisers--that is, looking at this wall--and deal with that at some  other time. But we need to get people back to work.   People are in pain. They are feeling it. Not only are the employees  feeling it, but all the people who are coming into the various parks or  whatever, who simply want to have a nice day, who simply want to have  some reasonable entertainment that does not cost them a lot by going  for a walk in the park; for getting the services that are needed; for  making sure that our airplanes do not have folks on them carrying guns.   These folks who we saw in the airport over the weekend, they are the  same ones who are coming in day after day and working for no pay. We  are better than that, and I am praying that we will get this issue  resolved.   The gentlewoman from the District of Columbia talked about the number  of people who she has in her district who are Federal employees. We, in  Maryland, have over 100,000 Federal employees, and we have so many  people who work for the Federal Government through contracting. There  must be a way to get this done.   I am going to close, but I will give the gentlewoman her opportunity,  and then I will come back, Madam Speaker. Therefore, I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I thank my colleagues who worked very hard on this bill: Congressman  Meadows, Congresswoman Norton, Congressman Sensenbrenner, and  Congresswoman Jackson Lee. All of them worked in a strong, bipartisan  way to make this happen.   H.R. 135 is a simple, straightforward measure that would make a  handful of changes to require the Federal agencies' equal employment  opportunity programs conform to the model standards set forth by the  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and to strengthen  accountability.   This bill has had overwhelming bipartisan support from the entire  House of Representatives for years, and I urge the Senate to pass this  measure as soon as possible.   As I close, I do not want to address extraneous issues that have  previously arisen regarding this measure in the Senate Homeland  Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. I want to be crystal clear  that I believe that the supervisors who engage in discriminatory or  retaliatory actions must be held accountable. However, this can be  accomplished without curtailing any existing due process rights for  Federal employees, and I will continue to oppose efforts to roll back  due process rights.   Madam Speaker, I urge the House to vote in favor of this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 136) to amend title 5, United States Code, to protect unpaid  interns in the Federal Government from workplace harassment and  discrimination, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows                                  H.R. 136         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Intern Protection       Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. PROHIBITED PERSONNEL PRACTICES.         (a) In General.--Section 2302 of title 5, United States       Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(g)(1) All protections afforded to an employee under       subparagraphs (A), (B), and (D) of subsection (b)(1) shall be       afforded, in the same manner and to the same extent, to an       intern and an applicant for internship.        ``(2) For purposes of the application of this subsection, a       reference to an employee shall be considered a reference to       an intern in--        ``(A) section 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42       U.S.C. 2000e-16);        ``(B) sections 12 and 15 of the Age Discrimination in       Employment Act of 1967 (29 U.S.C. 631, 633a); and        ``(C) section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29       U.S.C. 791).        ``(3) In this subsection, the term `intern' means an       individual who performs uncompensated voluntary service in an       agency to earn credit awarded by an educational institution       or to learn a trade or occupation.''.        (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 3111(c)(1) of title 5,       United States Code, is amended by inserting ``section 2302(g)       (relating to prohibited personnel practices),'' before       ``chapter 81''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on H.R. 136.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   The bill before us, the Federal Intern Protection Act, would close a  loophole in Federal employment law that currently leaves unpaid interns  open to discrimination and sexual harassment without any legal  recourse.   The Committee on Oversight and Reform has held multiple hearings  about sexual harassment and retaliation occurring in various Federal  agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency, the National  Park Service, and the Forest Service.   During these hearings, both my Republican colleagues and I expressed  our disgust at the exploitation of female employees and interns, and we  demanded action to prevent future abuse.   Unfortunately, the act of harassing unpaid interns on the basis of  race, religion, age, or sex is not currently prohibited by Federal law.  Under existing law, victims rely on the discretion and integrity of  managers to prevent this behavior.   One witness who testified before our committee told us that managers  do not always address the problem as they should and may actually be,  in fact, a part of the problem.   The witness stated: ``Even after finding out about the numerous  harassment victims, the direct reporting manager continued to feed the  harasser a steady diet of young women.''   We saw at our hearings that allowing this kind of behavior to go  unchecked can have serious consequences on the lives and careers of  those who are interested in government service. Our bill will give  Federal interns the same protections already provided to Federal  employees.   This measure passed the House in previous Congresses, and I urge my  colleagues to join me in ensuring that this legislation passes our  Chamber once again today.   I want to speak to the Congressional Intern Protection Act, related  legislation I introduced, which gives protections to congressional  interns and which was passed at the end of the last Congress as a part  of a package of reforms to the Congressional Accountability Act.   This is a great start, but more must be done. Along with the Federal  Intern Protection Act, I introduced the Unpaid Intern Protection Act,  which would provide these protections to interns in the private sector.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 136 is a commonsense measure that would close a  loophole in the Federal employment law that currently leaves the  youngest, most vulnerable group of our constituents open to harassment  and discrimination without legal recourse to protect them.   This bipartisan bill passed our Chamber in the last Congress,  reflecting bipartisan agreement that we need to solidify protections  for Federal interns and ensure they have the same protections already  provided to Federal employees.    As I close, I want to be clear that this bill responds to very real  instances of interns being victimized within the Federal Government.  Without this bill, victims will be forced to continue to rely on the  discretion and integrity of the managers to prevent this behavior.   I still say we can do better than that, so I urge the House to join  me today in supporting this measure. I look forward to working with my  Senate colleagues to move this bill through the Senate and, finally,  get it to the President's desk.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 202) to amend the Inspector General Act of 1978 relative to  the powers of the Department of Justice Inspector General.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 202         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Inspector General Access Act       of 2019''.       SEC. 2. INVESTIGATIONS OF DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE PERSONNEL.         Section 8E of the Inspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C.       App.) is amended--        (1) in subsection (b)--        (A) in paragraph (2), by striking ``and paragraph (3)'';        (B) by striking paragraph (3);        (C) by redesignating paragraphs (4) and (5) as paragraphs       (3) and (4), respectively; and        (D) in paragraph (4), as redesignated, by striking       ``paragraph (4)'' and inserting ``paragraph (3)''; and        (2) in subsection (d), by striking ``, except with respect       to allegations described in subsection (b)(3),''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the measure before us today.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 202, the  Inspector General Access Act. I thank Representatives Richmond, Hice,  and Lynch for the bipartisan manner in which they worked on this very  important bill in the last Congress.   The Inspector General Access Act would allow the inspector general of  the Department of Justice to investigate allegations of misconduct by  Department attorneys. The IG is statutorily independent and currently  has the authority to investigate other DOJ personnel.   The IG is barred from pursuing appropriate investigations into  attorneys at the Department. Under current law, the authority to  investigate attorneys is restricted to the Office of Professional  Responsibility within DOJ. OPR is not statutorily independent, and its  head is not confirmed by the Senate like the IG is. Treating attorneys  differently from other personnel is simply unfair.   Michael Horowitz, the inspector general at the Department of Justice,  recently testified before our Committee on Oversight and Reform, and  this is what he said: ``This bifurcated jurisdiction creates a system  where misconduct by FBI agents and other DOJ law enforcement officers  is conducted by a statutorily-independent IG appointed by the President  and confirmed by the Senate, while misconduct by DOJ prosecutors is  investigated by a component head who is appointed by the Department's  leadership and who lacks statutory independence. There is no principled  reason for treating misconduct by Federal prosecutors differently than  misconduct by DOJ law enforcement agents.''   H.R. 202 would not prohibit OPR from investigating attorneys. It  would simply add the ability to investigate attorneys, when appropriate  to the IG's authority, an additional layer of accountability.   Empowering IGs has been and should continue to be a nonpartisan  issue. The Committee on Oversight and Reform relies on the work of IGs.  We strongly support efforts to help them do their jobs effectively and  efficiently.   A bill identical to the one before us passed the House on a voice  vote in the last Congress. I urge my colleagues to continue their  support for IGs by supporting the Inspector General Access Act.  [[Page H564]]    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from the State of Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   On November 29, 2018, DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz sent a  letter to the Oversight and Reform Committee in support of the  Inspector General Access Act, and this is what he wrote: ``Providing  the OIG with authority to exercise jurisdiction in attorney  professional misconduct cases would enhance the public's confidence in  the outcomes of these investigations and provide the OIG with the same  authority as every other inspector general.''   I include Mr. Horowitz's letter in the Record.                                         U.S. Department of Justice,                                 Office of the Inspector General,                                                  November 29, 2018.      Hon. Trey Gowdy,      Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, House           of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Elijah E. Cummings,      Ranking Member, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,           House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member Cummings: I write to       express my strong support for H.R. 3154, the ``Inspector       General Access Act of 2017'' (Access Act), which your       Committee approved unanimously on September 27, 2018. The       Access Act would amend the Inspector General Act (IG Act) to       provide the Department of Justice (DOJ) Office of the       Inspector General (OIG) with authority to investigate       allegations of misconduct against DOJ attorneys for their       actions as lawyers, just as the OIG has authority under the       IG Act to investigate allegations of misconduct made against       any non-lawyer in the Department, including law enforcement       agents at the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Drug       Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Bureau of Alcohol,       Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), and the U.S. Marshals       Service (USMS). Currently, under Section 8E of the Inspector       General Act, the OIG does not have the authority to       investigate allegations of misconduct made against DOJ       attorneys acting in their capacity as lawyers; this role is       reserved exclusively for the Department's Office of       Professional Responsibility (OPR).        The Access Act has received broad, bipartisan support over       successive Congresses because it promotes independent       oversight, transparency, and accountability within DOJ and       for all of its employees. For these  [[Page H565]]       same reasons, in 1994, the then-General Accounting Office,       now the Government Accountability Office (GAO), issued a       report that found that preventing the OIG from investigating       attorney misconduct was inconsistent with the independence       and accountability that Congress envisioned under the IG Act.        The OIG has long questioned this carve-out because OPR       lacks statutory independence and does not regularly release       its reports and conclusions to the public. Moreover, to our       knowledge, the DOJ Inspector General is the only Inspector       General in the entire federal government that does not have       the authority to investigate alleged professional misconduct       by attorneys who work in the agency it oversees. Providing       the OIG with authority to exercise jurisdiction in attorney       professional misconduct cases would enhance the public's       confidence in the outcomes of these investigations and       provide the OIG with the same authority as every other       Inspector General.        Alleged professional misconduct by DOJ prosecutors, like       any alleged misconduct by DOJ agents, should be subject to       statutorily independent oversight:        Over fifteen years ago, the Department and Congress       recognized the importance of statutorily independent OIG       oversight over all DOJ law enforcement components (FBI, DEA,       USMS, and ATF) when Attorney General Ashcroft authorized the       OIG to conduct additional law enforcement oversight in 2001       and Congress legislated it in 2002. Yet, allegations against       Department prosecutors for professional misconduct continue       to be handled exclusively by OPR. As a result, presently, if       an allegation of misconduct is made against the FBI Director,       it is reviewed by the OIG; by contrast, if an allegation of       professional misconduct is made against the Attorney General,       it is handled by OPR, a Departmental component that the       Attorney General supervises.        The rationale supporting independent oversight for alleged       misconduct by law enforcement applies with equal force to       alleged wrongdoing by federal prosecutors, regardless of the       nature of the alleged misconduct. There is no principled       reason to have two standards of oversight at DOJ--one for       federal agents, who are subject to statutorily independent       and transparent oversight by the OIG, and one for federal       prosecutors, who are not for allegations of professional       misconduct. This is particularly true given the extraordinary       power that Department lawyers have to charge individuals with       crimes, to seek incarceration, and to pursue the seizure of       assets and property.        The OIG's independence, established by statutory       authorities and protections, facilitates objective and       credible investigations of misconduct allegations, as well as       unbiased reports that identify and make useful       recommendations for improving the Department. The OIG is       headed by a Senate-confirmed Inspector General who can only       be removed by the President, with prior notice to Congress.       The OIG's statutory independence is bolstered by the OIG's       dual obligation to report findings and concerns both to the       Attorney General and to Congress. The independent OIG is able       to make critical investigative and audit findings without       fear of reprisal.        Conversely, OPR has no statutory independence or       protections. The OPR Counsel is appointed by and answers to       the Attorney General, and can be removed or disciplined by       the Attorney General. Although a November 27, 2018 letter       from DOJ's Office of Legislative Affairs (OLA) on H.R. 3154       states that ``OPR has always acted independently,'' it does       not point to any protections, statutory or otherwise, that       exist to ensure OPR's independence from the Attorney General,       nor has DOJ proposed strengthening OPR's independence by       adding such protections. Indeed, the letter fails to explain       or even address why DOJ believes it is better to have a non-      statutorily independent entity handle attorney professional       misconduct cases rather than a statutorily independent       organization, as is the case for law enforcement professional       misconduct allegations.        The OIG's independent and transparent oversight enhances       the public's confidence in the DOD's programs and improves       its operations:        In addition to independence, the OIG considers transparency       a crucial component of its oversight mission. With limited       exceptions, the OIG ensures that the public is aware of the       results of our work. The majority of our reports are posted       on our public website at the time of release to ensure that       Congress and the public are informed of our findings, in a       comprehensive and timely manner. The OIG, consistent with the       IG Act, publishes on our website summaries of investigations       resulting in findings of administrative misconduct by senior       government employees and in matters of public interest even       when the subject is not prosecuted. We post such summaries       without identifying the investigative subject consistent with       the legal requirements under the Privacy Act. Because of this       commitment to transparency, there are currently hundreds of       OIG reports, audits, and reviews posted on our web site.       There are also summaries of dozens of OIG investigative       reports posted, including recent reports involving       significant misconduct by senior DOJ officials.        In contrast, there are currently only a total of five       reports (other than annual reports) posted on OPR's website.       Four of those five reports are from 2008 and were the result       of OPR's joint work with the OIG, and which the OIG posted on       our website consistent with the IG Act and our practice. The       fifth report was completed by OPR in 2013 and only released       in 2015 in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)       request. Moreover, although the OLA letter states that ``OPR       discloses a substantial amount of information about its work       and findings in its annual report,'' this information is not       reported in a timely or comprehensive manner. Congress and       the public only find out about some, but not necessarily all,       of OPR's work when it issues an annual report.        An example of this dichotomy can be found in a case       involving an Oregon lawyer who was arrested by the FBI and       wrongly imprisoned after mismatched fingerprints linked him       to the 2004 bombing at a Madrid train station. The OIG       investigated the allegations of FBI agent misconduct, while       the Department's OPR investigated the allegations of attorney       misconduct. This bifurcation led to inconsistent       treatment. The OIG report on the actions of the FBI agents       was published on the OIG's website, but OPR did not       publish the report on the conduct of the DOJ attorneys who       were involved in the same case.        Transparency ensures greater accountability, and sends an       important deterrent message to other Department employees.       The credibility of the Department's disciplinary process is       inevitably reduced when the responsible component operates       under the direction of the Department's senior leadership and       is not subject to public scrutiny because of limited       transparency.        The OIG has demonstrated its excellence in reviewing       complex legal and factual issues, including employee ethics       and misconduct matters:        Over the past 30 years, the OIG has shown that it is       capable of fair and independent oversight of the DOJ. The       jurisdictional limitation of Section 8E(b)(3) is an       unnecessary historical vestige of the fact that OPR was in       existence prior to the statutory creation of the OIG in 1988.       Those who unsuccessfully tried in 2002 to forestall Congress       from providing the OIG with oversight of alleged misconduct       by FBI and DEA agents contended that those cases required       specialized expertise--just like the Department argues       currently that prosecutorial oversight requires specialized       expertise--and that argument was roundly rejected and has       proven to be entirely without merit. The decision by Congress       to extend OIG jurisdiction in 2002 to encompass misconduct by       FBI and DEA agents has allowed for significant and important       oversight of DOJ's law enforcement operations, and has had       significant positive impact on the integrity of those       agencies' operations.        The OIG has consistently demonstrated our ability to handle       complex legal and factual issues related to our misconduct       reviews, including those involving FBI and DEA agents as well       as, on occasion, ethics issues involving DOJ lawyers. In       addition to our recent investigation of the FBI's actions       prior to the 2016 presidential election, which involved       evaluating the professional conduct by FBI agents, FBI       lawyers, and FBI senior officials, we have investigated the       FBI's actions involving its former agent Robert Hanssen, the       FBI's activities related to James ``Whitey'' Bulger, the       DEA's oversight of its confidential informant program, the       DEA and other components' handling of sexual misconduct and       harassment cases, the operation of the FBI laboratory, ATF's       actions involving Operation Fast and Furious, and the FBI's       use of its national security authorities (National Security       Letters, Patriot Act Section 215, FISA Amendment Act Section       702).        Each of those and many other reviews resulted in       independent and transparent findings by the OIG, and resulted       in changes to Department operations that enhanced their       effectiveness and thereby increased the public's confidence       in those programs. Moreover, OIGs throughout the government,       including at the Department of Homeland Security and the       Securities and Exchange Commission, have authority to       investigate misconduct allegations made against attorneys at       those agencies and they have demonstrated that they are fully       capable of dealing with such matters covering a wide range of       complex legal issues. The DOJ OIG is the only OIG, to our       knowledge, that is barred by the IG Act from reviewing       misconduct by lawyers within the agency it oversees.        The Access Act would provide the OIG with oversight over       Department lawyers in a manner that is entirely consistent       with its oversight authority over Department non-attorneys:        The present oversight system that applies to allegations       made against any DOJ non-lawyer, as provided for in the IG       Act and Department regulations, is precisely the oversight       mechanism that the Access Act seeks to apply to Department       lawyers. Specifically, under the current system for DOJ non-      lawyers, all non-frivolous misconduct allegations must be       provided to the OIG for the OIG's review and determination as       to whether it is of the type and nature that warrants and       necessitates independent OIG investigation. Given the OIG's       limited resources, the OIG handles only those allegations       that warrant an independent OIG investigation, and therefore       the OIG returns routine and less serious misconduct       allegations to Department components, such as the FBI's       Inspections Division and the DEA's OPR, for their handling       and investigation. For those matters that the OIG retains,       when the OIG completes its investigation, it sends its report       to  [[Page H566]]       the component so that it can adjudicate the OIG's findings       and take disciplinary action, as appropriate. The Access Act       creates a similar practice, by maintaining the Department's       OPR to handle misconduct allegations that do not require       independent outside review as determined by the OIG, much as       the internal affairs offices at the FBI, DEA, ATF, and USMS       remain in place today.        We are unaware of any claims by Department leaders that       this approach has resulted in ``different investigative       standards,'' ``decrease[d] efficiency,'' or ``inconsistent       application'' of legal standards. There is no evidence that       it has impacted the components ``ability to successfully       defend any significant discipline decision before the Merit       Systems Protection Board.'' Yet this parade of horribles is       precisely what the OLA letter claims will occur if attorneys       are treated in the same manner as Special Agents and non-      attorneys at the Department, rather than continuing to       receive the special oversight treatment granted to them under       the current carve-out provision under the IG Act. This       argument is meritless. Indeed, the disciplinary processes at       the FBI and the DEA have substantially improved since the OIG       obtained statutory oversight authority over those components       in 2002, in significant part due to the greater transparency       and accountability that has resulted from the OIG's       oversight.        I very much appreciate your strong support for my Office       and for Inspectors General throughout the federal government.       If you have further questions, please feel free to contact       me.            Sincerely,                                               Michael E. Horowitz,                                                 Inspector General.     On December 25, 2018, the New York Times editorial  board wrote: ``It makes sense to give Mr. Horowitz's office oversight  authority over the activities of Justice Department lawyers--as other  inspectors general have over lawyers in their departments. Doing so  would aid the cause of justice and strengthen the public's trust in an  institution charged with upholding it.''   On December 30, 2018, the Miami Herald also published an editorial in  support of the Inspector General Access Act. I hope the Senate will  follow the quick and bipartisan action this body will take today when  we pass this bill so that we can get it to the President's desk for his  signature as soon as possible.   With that, Madam Speaker, I urge all of our colleagues to vote in  favor of this very important legislation, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 113) to require the purchase of domestically made flags of  the United States of America for use by the Federal Government.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 113         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``All-American Flag Act''.       SEC. 2. REQUIREMENT FOR AGENCIES TO BUY DOMESTICALLY MADE                     UNITED STATES FLAGS.         (a) Requirement for Agencies To Buy Domestically Made       United States Flags.--        (1) In general.--Chapter 63 of title 41, United States       Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new       section:       ``Sec. 6310. Requirement for agencies to buy domestically         made United States flags         ``(a) Requirement.--Except as provided in subsections (b)       through (d), funds appropriated or otherwise available to an       agency may not be used for the procurement of any flag of the       United States, unless such flag has been 100 percent       manufactured in the United States from articles, materials,       or supplies that have been grown or 100 percent produced or       manufactured in the United States.        ``(b) Availability Exception.--Subsection (a) does not       apply to the extent that the head of the agency concerned       determines that satisfactory quality and sufficient quantity       of a flag described in such subsection cannot be procured as       and when needed at United States market prices.        ``(c) Exception for Certain Procurements.--Subsection (a)       does not apply to the following:        ``(1) Procurements by vessels in foreign waters.        ``(2) Procurements for resale purposes in any military       commissary, military exchange, or nonappropriated fund       instrumentality operated by an agency.        ``(3) Procurements for amounts less than the simplified       acquisition threshold.        ``(d) Presidential Waiver.--        ``(1) In general.--The President may waive the requirement       in subsection (a) if the President determines a waiver is       necessary to comply with any trade agreement to which the       United States is a party.        ``(2) Notice of waiver.--Not later than 30 days after       granting a waiver under paragraph (1), the President shall       publish a notice of the waiver in the Federal Register.        ``(e) Definitions.--In this section:        ``(1) Agency.--The term `agency' has the meaning given the       term `executive agency' in section 102 of title 40.        ``(2) Simplified acquisition threshold.--The term       `simplified acquisition threshold' has the meaning given that       term in section 134.''.        (2) Clerical amendment.--The table of sections at the       beginning of such chapter is amended by adding at the end the       following new item:  ``6310. Requirement for agencies to buy domestically made United States                flags.''.        (b) Applicability.--Section 6310 of title 41, United States       Code, as added by subsection (a)(1), shall apply with respect       to any contract entered into on or after the date that is 180       days after the date of the enactment of this Act.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H.R. 113.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   The All-American Flag Act is a commonsense bill that all Members can  support. It would require that all Federal agencies purchase American  flags that are manufactured right here in the United States using  materials grown or produced in the United States.   Under current law, the requirement applies only to the Departments of  Defense and Veterans Affairs. It should be extended to all Federal  agencies.   As under current law, the bill would provide certain limited  exceptions and allow agencies to purchase American flags made elsewhere  if they are not available in sufficient quantity or quality from  American manufacturers.   I urge support of this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I think this is a very important bill. The American  flag is so near and dear to so many people, and, quite often, folks  think that it is being manufactured here in the United States and being  manufactured with materials grown here; but the fact is, quite often,  that is not the case. So I think it is only fitting that, when we wave  that flag and when we salute that flag, we know that it has been  produced here in our country.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of our colleagues to vote in favor of this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 247) to amend chapter 36 of title 44, United States Code, to  make certain changes relating to electronic Government services, and  for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 247         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Federal CIO Authorization       Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. CHANGES RELATING TO ELECTRONIC GOVERNMENT SERVICES.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure before us today.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   The Federal CIO Authorization Act would make several commonsense  changes to existing law:   First, it would update the name of the Administrator for E-Government  [[Page H569]]  to the Federal Chief Information Officer, and it would require direct  reporting of that individual to the Director of the Office of  Management and Budget. It is very, very important.   Second, it would establish the position of Federal Chief Information  Security Officer, who would report to the Federal CIO and assist OMB in  the cybersecurity efforts.   Finally, this very important bill would require the Federal CIO to  submit a proposal on consolidating IT across Federal agencies,  especially smaller agencies, through the use of shared services.   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to vote in favor of this bill, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I want to join my colleague, Congresswoman Foxx, in  thanking Mr. Hurd, Mr. Connolly, and Congresswoman Kelly for all the  hard work that they put into this legislation.   So often in our Congress, we are blessed to have somebody like Mr.  Hurd, who is very, very familiar with these sometimes very complex  issues, and he brings just a reasonable approach to coming up with  bipartisan solutions to the problems that are facing our country and,  just as significant, bringing solutions that will prevent problems from  happening. So I want to thank him for working so hard on this, along  with our colleagues, Mr. Connolly and Ms. Kelly.    Again, Madam Speaker, I urge all of our Members to vote in favor of  this bill. It is a significant piece of legislation.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 150) to modernize Federal grant reporting, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows                                  H.R. 150         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Grant Reporting Efficiency       and Agreements Transparency Act of 2019'' or the ``GREAT       Act''.       SEC. 2. PURPOSES.         The purposes of this Act are to--        (1) modernize reporting by recipients of Federal grants and       cooperative agreements by creating and imposing data       standards for the information that grants and cooperative       agreement recipients must report to the Federal Government;        (2) implement the recommendation by the Director of the       Office of Management and Budget, under section 5(b)(6) of the       Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006       (31 U.S.C. 6101 note), which includes the development of a       ``comprehensive  [[Page H570]]       taxonomy of standard definitions for core data elements       required for managing Federal financial assistance awards'';        (3) reduce burden and compliance costs of recipients of       Federal grants and cooperative agreements by enabling       technology solutions, existing or yet to be developed, by       both the public and private sectors, to better manage data       recipients already provide to the Federal Government; and        (4) to strengthen oversight and management of Federal       grants and cooperative agreements by agencies through       consolidated collection and display of and access to open       data that has been standardized, and where appropriate,       transparency to the public.

Such requirements shall be carried out using amounts       otherwise authorized.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 150, currently under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, the Grant Reporting Efficiency and Agreements  Transparency Act, introduced by Representatives Virginia Foxx and    Jimmy Gomez, would standardize reporting for recipients of Federal  grants and cooperative agreements.   Grant recipients often have to report the same information in  different ways because Federal agencies do not use the same forms or  even the same terms to describe required information.   Madam Speaker, I have often said that the most important thing that  we must do in our lives is to operate in an effective and efficient  manner, and that also includes this Congress.   Under this bill, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget  and the Secretary of Health and Human Services would be required to  establish governmentwide data standards for grant reporting--again,  efficiency and effectiveness.   The bill would encourage OMB and HHS to make the information that  grant recipients report fully searchable and machine-readable. This  would provide greater transparency into the money spent on the grants  because spending data would be more usable.   The bill also would require that data collected from grant recipients  be published on a single public portal.   Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman, Ms. Foxx, for  working with Representative Connolly last Congress on the use of  nonproprietary identifiers for grants and grantees. She, too, has  worked in a hard, bipartisan way to bring solutions to problems, to  bring practical solutions to problems.   The bill before us would allow this issue to be carefully considered  to ensure it is workable.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, we have no further speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, this bill is intended to reduce the burden on  applicants for Federal grants by enabling a more streamlined electronic  process for completing grant applications. It would require HHS and OMB  to develop uniform data standards for common application elements, such  as the name and address of the organization and the name of the grant.   This will, hopefully, lead to the development of a uniform grant  application that could be used across all Federal agencies. That would  improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the grant application  process immensely.   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to support this measure, and I hope  that the Senate will quickly pass it.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I again thank Ms. Foxx for this very important  legislation and all of the bipartisan efforts that made it happen.   This bill and the others that we have dealt with today, where there  was such great bipartisanship to get it done, I hope that we will take  these as a model of what this Congress can do.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
