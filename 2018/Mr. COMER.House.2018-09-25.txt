 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6316, the  Small Business Advocacy Improvements Act of 2018.   I am proud to be the sponsor of this bipartisan legislation. The  Office of Advocacy at the United States Small Business Administration  plays a vital role in ensuring Federal agencies take into account how  their policies impact small businesses.   While the Office of Advocacy has done excellent work on behalf of our  Nation's small businesses, the current law is silent on whether it can  research and advocate on behalf of small business on international  matters. This is a problem that we can easily fix.   Given the Office of Advocacy's knowledge and research on how  regulations impact small businesses, it is appropriate for the office  to advocate and research small business interests on international  matters. This bill advances the Office of Advocacy's mission to  advocate for America's small businesses and clarifies its authority on  international small business issues.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  bipartisan bill.
