 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I appreciate the bipartisan conversation  that is going on with the chair, and I hope more of that will go on.  That really is a little bit of why I rise today, because I hope and  pray that if there--while we have many legitimate policy differences in  this body, one thing we ought to have absolute, complete agreement on  is that the United States of America cannot afford another government  shutdown.   The last shutdown, which President Trump was so proud to initiate,  cost our economy--and this is the lowest estimate we could find so we  don't look like we are overstating--an estimated $6 billion.   The truth is, that number hardly reflects the human cost of this  self-inflicted disaster our country was led into. A recent survey found  that 62 percent of Federal workers depleted most or all of their  emergency savings, 42 percent of Federal workers took on debt to pay  bills or other expenses, and 25 percent tapped their retirement  accounts. If you tap your IRA, you pay tax penalties, and you get none  of that reimbursed.   Listen to this: 25 percent of our Federal workers who were the  victims of this shutdown--25 percent of our Federal workers, during  this shutdown, had to visit a food bank. If you work for the United  States of America, the greatest Nation in the world, and you are asked  to show up to work without pay, you should not have to visit a food  bank.   I spent most of my career in the private sector, and I am proud of  those activities, but I know very few folks who work for any of my  companies who would have continued to show up day in and day out to do  their jobs if they were going for 35 days without pay--and 35 days  without pay where, frankly, you had some Members of the so-called  board, the Congress, who showed no appreciation at all for their  suffering and many who said they didn't mind if that shutdown continued  indefinitely.   Those fellow Americans are Federal workers, contractors, private  businesses that support Federal installations or the campground outside  the Shenandoah National Park or the restaurant outside Petersburg  National Battlefield--not just Federal employees, folks in the private  sector as well endured tremendous hardship because the President  decided to use their livelihoods as a bargaining chip. That can't  happen again.   While I want to always try to be optimistic and appreciate the  bipartisan agreement that has been reached by the budget negotiators,  unfortunately, we find ourselves in the same spot right now-- potentially just days away from another Trump shutdown.   The President said he is not happy, but he won't say whether he will  sign the bipartisan deal that came from the conference committee. Let's  be clear. The uncertainty itself is having a negative impact on the  operation of the Federal Government and costing taxpayer dollars each  and every day that this cloud hangs over the government. Agencies are  already interrupting investigations and canceling trainings and  meetings. They are being forced to act as if the government will once  again be shut down at the end of this week. This is just plain  mismanagement of government by the Trump administration. It is another  example of the disrespect this White House has shown to our Federal  workforce.   In Virginia, over the past few weeks, Senator Kaine and I have spent  a lot of time listening to Federal workers. We heard from Federal  workers who had to pull their kids out of daycare and send them away to  relatives because they couldn't meet those daycare expenses if they  weren't getting paid and folks who missed student loan payments or  literally had to choose between their medications and paying rent. Now,  these workers have started to receive some of their backpay, and many  of them have not received all of their backpay from the shutdown.   The truth is, those Federal workers who drew down their savings or  incurred a tax penalty from taking money from their IRA or who took an  advance on their credit card are not made whole by receiving backpay  because they have incurred penalties that will never be made up, beyond  the psychic damage that is taking place with their families.   But even if we accept that most of the Federal workers will  ultimately get their backpay, that is not the case for thousands of  Federal contractors in Virginia and around the country. Quite honestly,  the nightmare is not over.   The President's decision to finally reopen the government didn't  magically undo 35 days of missed pay. Unfortunately, no one from the  White House could be bothered to meet with any of these folks, whether  it be Federal workers or contractors who were hurt by this government  shutdown. If they had, they would know how much pain this President's  shutdown continues to inflict on Federal contractors, particularly low-  and middle-income workers. I spent the last couple of months, the last  month and a half listening to these folks describe the anxiety of not  knowing when their next paycheck will come or if it will come at all.    Sometimes when we think about Federal contractors, we think about  high-priced folks, many of whom do a good job working for our  government, many in my State. Sometimes that is the image of a Federal  contractor. I wonder if most of the Members of this body realize that  the people who clean the toilets at the Smithsonian or serve the food  at the cafeteria in the Smithsonian are Federal contractors, and for  the 35 days of the government shutdown--they have no recourse at this  moment in time. They are struggling as we speak, and they will continue  to struggle if Congress doesn't take advantage of this opportunity--if  we get this deal signed by Friday and keep the government open--to make  good on our commitment to those contractors as well. If we end up with  the alternative and the government shuts down again, these folks'  lives--at least their economic lives--will be in jeopardy.  [[Page S1291]]    A number of small businesses--women-owned businesses, minority  businesses, veteran-owned businesses--that tried, through this last 35- day shutdown, to keep their workers on payroll had to take that money  out of their business pockets to try to make ends meet. But after a  couple of weeks, a lot of them couldn't afford to do that. Those  businesses have shut down. Years and in certain cases decades of work  down the drain, not because they did something that was mismanagement,  not because they did something that was irresponsible, not because they  weren't providing the taxpayers with the full value of their work, but  because we here in Congress and the White House couldn't come to a  common agreement on the most basic responsibility of government, which  is to keep the doors open and the lights on.   I held a roundtable recently with a contractor in Springfield, VA. A  contractor there named Barbara told me she is behind on her rent and  had to take her granddaughter out of daycare because she can't pay the  bills. Now, she is glad she is back at work, but that 35 days with no  pay--unless we rectify that with this deal that may come to pass before  the weekend, she is still left in the cold. Another at that same  roundtable told me she had to choose between food and medicine.   A couple of weeks ago, I met a contractor named John, an Afghanistan  veteran, who was picking up groceries at the food bank in Arlington  because the shutdown wiped out his savings. We had some press, but John  didn't want to go on camera. He was a little bit embarrassed that he  had to pick up food at the food bank. This is someone who is a veteran.  This is someone who continued to serve in terms of protecting the  country. Thirty-five days without pay. With the status quo--he will  never get those lost earnings back if we don't rectify that this week.   Another contractor named Joseph, who works as a custodian at the  Department of the Interior, told me this:         We work just as hard as anyone else. We need our backpay so       we can catch up on our bills and survive.    The remarkable thing is, for some of these janitors and custodial  workers, on buildings that were open, they had to continue to work and  still don't get backpay.   One of the most heartbreaking things was listening to these  contractors talk about the shame--the shame of being treated as if  their work does not have value. The truth is, these folks take pride in  their work because they love their country. That same contractor,  Joseph, says he thinks of the building he cleans as the President's  house, and he works hard because he wants to make it shine every day.  What a disgrace that this government can't even honor his service with  back wages so that he can pay his bills and get his personal finances  in order.   Many other contractors take pride in their work because it represents  their independence. Over 45,000 disabled Americans work as Federal  contractors through the AbilityOne Program. I know this program is very  successful in Delaware. The Senator from Delaware will speak on it  shortly.   I have met contractors who are double amputees, veterans with PTSD,  and folks with physical and intellectual disabilities. They are able to  live normal lives and contribute to society because of these Federal  contractor jobs. For many of them, these jobs are more than about pay.  It is about respect. It is about being valued and part of a community,  part of a team at the offices they work in. They suffer more than just  about anyone when their lifeline--that source of income, independence,  and dignity--is cut off because of a government shutdown.   I will close with something a Federal contractor named Constance told  me last week. Even though she and her team of custodians still face  tremendous financial hardship, she told me that she remains hopeful.  She is hopeful because she and her coworkers are now back to work, and  she is hopeful because people in this Chamber are finally starting to  listen to folks like her.   I share her hope that the Senate will have the decency and the basic  humanity to make sure, one, that we don't close down this government  come Friday, and two, that when we come to this deal, we take that  moment--and I see colleagues from both sides of the aisle. We have  gotten the CBO score. It is scored to make sure the backpay for the  contractors, with an emphasis toward low-income contractors, under  $50,000--the cost would be at $1 billion. That is the CBO score. We  ought to make sure that these people's lives--that the work they do is  valued.   I hope, as we have this bipartisan deal to avoid the shutdown, that  we can also make it right for the folks who oftentimes many of us don't  see--who clean the buildings, serve the food, many folks from the  disabled community--who rely upon us to do the right thing.   Congress should pass this backpay for Federal contractors  legislation. The President should sign it, and if the President  doesn't, the Congress should override his veto.   Let's make sure, as we did with Federal workers, that they will  always be assured that they will get their backpay. Let's make sure  that contractors get that same decency. It is time to do the right  thing.   With that, I yield the floor.    First of all, Madam President, I want to thank my  colleague from West Virginia, Senator Capito, for her comments. I know  shortly we are going to hear from the Senator from Pennsylvania. We  heard from the Senator from Ohio.   This is sometimes hard for me to say as a former Governor of Virginia  to a former Governor of West Virginia, but I want particularly those  who are following this issue to know that no one in this body has  fought for miners harder, longer, more passionately, more consistently  than Joe Manchin.   It was only through his repeated efforts--and this man is like a dog  with a bone in his mouth who will not let it go. At times he is stiff  in the spine with folks on this side of the aisle when they wanted to  say: Well, maybe no. We ought to move to something else. He has come  back and back and back again.   So I am honored to stand with him one more time. Let me again say  that it is with some challenge that someone from the Commonwealth of  Virginia has to say these many nice things about somebody from West  Virginia, but the folks in the Gallery ought to know there has been no  one who has been a better advocate for miners than the Senator from  West Virginia.   I don't think there is a Member of the Senate--I know at least on  this side of the aisle--who has not heard at least a half dozen times  about the promises Harry Truman made to the miners in 1946 and how it  is our obligation to keep that word and to keep that promise.   The Senator from West Virginia has indicated why this is timely.  Again, it is because we have the challenges around the pension fund. We  have other challenges, but we have a crisis right now.   We talked about Westmoreland--the Westmoreland bankruptcy, 1,200  miners, 500 of those live in Virginia. If we can't get a solution on  this deal right now on the American Miners Act, then a lot of those  miners and their families are going to go bankrupt because their day of  reckoning is already upon us.   I want to echo what the Senator from West Virginia said to urge the  majority leader and, for that matter, the minority leader that there is  a way--if we do the rational, sensible thing and not shut down the  government on Friday, we ought to take advantage of making sure the  American Miners Act is part of that provision. I can think of nothing  better, as we go into the work period, than to try to give miners some  certainty.   Let me just mention one other item that the American Miners Act had,  and that is the strengthening of the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund.  This is also an issue that, if we don't get it resolved, the amount of  contributions that go into that trust fund will drop in half.   I don't think many folks realize--and I think this is particularly  the case in West Virginia and Southwest Virginia--black lung is still a  real, enormous medical challenge. As a matter of fact, we have now seen  growth in large populations in my State, and I know in West Virginia,  as well, of advanced black lung cases called complicated black lung,  which has an even more devastating effect.   If this trust fund is cut in half, based upon legislation that took  place at the end of calendar year 2018, the ability of the trust fund  to meet the needs of these miners and their families, who are still  hard hit by a debilitating disease--we are not going to be able to give  them, again, the high-quality care they deserve. It is way past time to  fix this problem. Let's take that step.   We have one of these large pieces of legislation, hopefully, that the  President will not decide to veto, that we will get through. Wouldn't  it be--I ask the Senator from West Virginia this  [[Page S1311]]  before I cede to the Senator from Pennsylvania, but sometimes, with  these giant bills, strange things pop out at the end of the day, and  you kind of wonder how they got in. Wouldn't it be great if, on this  mini giant bill, one of the things that popped out might be the  promised relief for our miners in terms of healthcare and their  pensions? This is something I believe, we, as a country, owe to the  miners--back, yes, to President Truman's promise in 1946.   I stand with all of my colleagues on this issue. I particularly  thank, again, my friend the Senator from West Virginia for his great  leadership and his willingness to stand tall time and again. Let's see  if we can get it done this time.   With that, Madam President, I yield to the Senator from West  Virginia.    Right, all we have to try to do with the trust fund is to  get it back to the status quo.
