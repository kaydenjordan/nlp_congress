Section 5317(g) of title 38, United States Code, is amended       by striking ``September 30, 2024'' and inserting ``September       30, 2027''.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Roe) and  the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Walz) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 114, as amended, the VA  Choice and Quality Employment Act of 2017.   It has been a long week of negotiations, but we are here today with  an agreement we--and, more importantly, our veterans--can all be proud  to support. I know that I am.   Ranking Member Walz and I have worked feverishly with our Senate  counterparts to find a solution that can pass both Chambers and ensure  that veterans will continue to be able to access care in the community.   The VA Choice and Quality Improvement Act of 2017 would expand  veteran access to care both inside and outside the Department of  Veterans Affairs healthcare system by, number one, providing $2.1  billion to sustain the Choice Program for the next 6 months,  authorizing 28 VA medical center facility leases, and improving VA's  ability to recruit and retain high-quality employees by including many  of the provisions of H.R. 1367, as amended, which were sponsored by Dr.  Brad Wenstrup, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Health, and  unanimously approved by the House in March. I would be remiss if I did  not impress upon my colleagues a sense of urgency about this  legislation.   The Choice Program was created 3 years ago in response to the  nationwide VA access crisis that began with 40 veteran patients who  died while waiting for VA care in Phoenix, Arizona. Due to much higher  than expected veteran demand for Choice care, the program is slated to  run out of money by mid-August. It would leave devastating consequences  for veterans in its wake.   Starting with an extremely tight 90-day implementation period and  countless contract modifications with third-party administrators, I  will be the first to admit that the Choice Program has been plagued  with problems. But I will also tell you that the program has come a  long way from where it once was and is responsible for more than 1  million veterans getting the care they need closer to home and in a  more timely manner. The good Lord only knows how many lives have been  saved or prolonged. That is a success.   If Choice were to end 3 weeks from now, Mr. Speaker, VA's most senior  leaders, including Secretary Shulkin, have warned that waiting times  for veteran patients will increase to pre-Choice Phoenix levels. They  also said continuity of care would be disrupted for veterans across the  country, and some of our most vulnerable veterans may not be able to  get care without either a long, possibly debilitating wait time or an  excessive travel distance. That is failure.   Passage of this bill today, followed by swift passage by our  colleagues in the Senate, would preserve Choice for the next 6 months.  That would allow the program to continue serving veterans while we  continue the hard work of creating a stronger, more integrated VA  healthcare system for the years ahead.   Some stakeholders have expressed frustration that Congress has not  been adequately supporting VA's internal capacity for care and too much  attention has been paid since the 2014 access crisis to addressing  issues with growing veteran demand for community care programs, Choice  included. They argue that providing increased funding for Choice  without identical increases in funding for VA medical facilities is  harmful to veterans. I totally disagree.   I do not believe that argument is fair or constructive, given the  historic funding increases that VA has received in recent years and the  growth in staffing, programming, and the VA physical footprint that has  resulted from those increases. In fact, VA's budget--that is the  healthcare budget, not total budget. The VA's healthcare budget has  grown more than $83 billion since I came to Congress in 2009.   Mr. Speaker, we were spending $93.7 billion when I was sworn into  this House in 2009. The President's request this year is $186.5  billion. In the same time, the number of VA full-time employees has  increased by almost 63,000. What is more, we just passed a MILCON-VA  Appropriations bill which includes a $3.9 billion increase for VA  medical care.   Nevertheless, I have listened to the concerns of those stakeholders,  which include many veterans service organizations, and I respect their  viewpoints and their willingness to be strong advocates for our  Nation's veterans. As a matter of fact, I belong to many of these  organizations.   That is why this bill includes provisions to increase VA internal  capacity by authorizing 28 medical facility leases, most of which are  for community-based outpatient clinics, and by enhancing VA's ability  to maintain a robust, highly qualified workforce in recognition of the  many challenges VA has in competing for workers in an extremely  competitive hiring market.   To offset a significant portion of the costs of this legislation, we  have used offsets that have been used routinely on a bipartisan basis  over the last decades and that were included in the legislation which  first created the Choice Program 3 years ago.   As I alluded to earlier, this bill was crafted as the result of  negotiations between myself; my friend, Ranking Member Sergeant Major  Walz; and Senators Isakson and Tester, the chairman and ranking member,  respectively, on the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs. I am  grateful to them for this work.   I am also grateful to my friends and colleagues in the House  leadership for their efforts and willingness to do the sometimes  difficult work of finding a solution that is in the best interests of  both veterans and taxpayers and to our VSO partners for their input and  support throughout the past weeks.   There is still much work ahead. This is only a 6-month patch to the  Choice Program. The ranking member and I have a framework agreement for  moving forward, but that will require the cooperation and buy-in from  all my colleagues in the House and Senate.    Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting  this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Maine (Mr. Poliquin), who is my good friend. I had the privilege  of visiting Bruce Poliquin's beautiful State last summer.

Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, since we are doing a Maine  advertisement here today, I will say one thing negative about Maine. I  herniated a disk in my back climbing Mount Katahdin with my good  friend, French Hill from Arkansas, last summer. It wasn't all good.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I do want to associate my remarks with those of the  ranking member.   We have a lot of thanks to go around, but the major thanks go to our  veterans who serve this great Nation. I think it would be remiss on us  and a pox on this body if we didn't do what is right for our veterans.  And we are.    As Mr. Walz said, this is just the first step, although a major one,  in a transformative process that we have been given the opportunity on  this committee to do.   We serve 21 million veterans in this country that have served this  Nation honorably. We have a great organization. I think a lot of times  it doesn't get said that the VA does a lot of good work.   I don't go home where there is not a day that I don't run into  somebody at the grocery store or somewhere that  [[Page H6538]]  tells me of a positive thing that happened to them at the VA. It is not  everywhere, though.   I also get stopped and told and have stacks of documents on my desk  that tell me the problems with the VA. We hear those loud and clear. I  think both of us do.   But I think it is an opportunity for us as a body--not just this  committee, but the entire body--to thank our veterans, pass this bill  unanimously, send it to the Senate, and then to the President's desk  for his signature.   I, once again, thank Mr. Walz, his committee and staff, and our  committee and staff for working in a bipartisan way to pass this.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Members to support S. 114, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Tennessee?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 95, as amended, the  Veterans' Access to Child Care Act. This bill would make the Department  of Veterans Affairs' successful pilot program to provide childcare  assistance to veterans seeking mental or other intensive healthcare  services through the VA healthcare system permanent.   I have been a ``Doctor Dad'' myself, and I know firsthand how  difficult it can be to manage childcare responsibilities on top of  everything else.   We know that the lack of childcare is a barrier to care for many  patients and that assisting veteran parents, grandparents, and  guardians in finding childcare opportunities while they are attending  VA appointments will relieve a major stress point and increase access  to care.   I am grateful to Congresswoman Julia Brownley, the ranking member of  our Subcommittee on Health, for her leadership in sponsoring the  Veterans' Access to Child Care Act.   I am proud to support this bill and urge my colleagues to do so as  well.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, once again, I encourage all  Members to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 95, the  ``Veterans' Access to Child Care Act,'' which makes permanent the VA's  Child Care Pilot Program and expands it so that all veterans who are  primary caretakers have a safe, reliable, and cost-free option for  child care when they use VA healthcare.   As the founder and chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus, I  fully understand the importance of having access to affordable and safe  child care.   The bill provides child care assistance to an eligible veteran for  any period that the veteran receives covered health care services at a  VA facility, and is required to travel to and return from such facility  for the receipt of such services.   My own city of Houston is home to the second largest veterans'  community in the United States in terms of resident veterans.   The U.S. Census Bureau recorded that Houston is home to approximately  282,000 veterans, which is almost one-fifth of the state's veteran  population.   The Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center in the city of Houston has  111,189 veterans enrolled in the center.   For these veterans in Houston and veterans across the country, H.R.  95 provides access to child care for veterans receiving mental health  services and other intensive health care services at VA facilities.   The VA reported that it had provided free childcare to 10,000  children through the pilot program and that veterans were consistently  ``completely satisfied'' with the services received.   H.R. 95 ensures that veterans continue to get the care they have  earned and deserve, and that includes ensuring that those seeking  treatment at VA medical facilities do not miss appointments because  they do not have access to safe and reliable child care.   The lack of convenient and affordable child care has prevented  veterans from getting the medical care they need.   The cost of full time infant care across the United States in 2012  ranged from $4,600 to $20,200 a year.   The cost of full time care for a 4 year old ranged from $3,900 to  $15,450.   Of those seeking childcare, 89 percent were looking for full time  care and only 11 percent were looking for part-time care.   Parents who serve as the primary care taker of a child should not  have to sacrifice their own health to find safe and reliable child  care.   We must remove barriers that impede veterans' access to health care.   Currently, the Child Care Pilot Program offers free child care for  qualified veterans using VA healthcare services at a limited number of  participating sites around the United States.   Congress has reauthorized this popular pilot program three times in  separate bills, but it is time to make this program permanent.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important  legislation.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Roe) that the House suspend the rules and  pass the bill, H.R. 95, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

Reassignment of senior executives         ``(a) Approval of Reassignments.--No individual employed in       a senior executive position at the Department may be       reassigned to another such position at the Department unless       such reassignment is approved in writing and signed by the       Secretary.        ``(b) Semiannual Reports Required.--Not later than June 30       and December 31 of each year, the Secretary shall submit to       Congress a report on the reassignment of individuals employed       in senior executive positions at the Department to other such       positions at the Department during the period covered by the       report.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Roe) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Walz) each  will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Tennessee?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Tennessee?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3262, as amended, the  Grow Our Own Directive--or GOOD--Physician Assistant Employment and  Education Act of 2017.   The PA profession has a long and storied connection with veterans as  the first class of PAs was primarily composed of Army medics and Navy  corpsmen who served in the Vietnam war.   And I might add, when I did basic training at San Antonio, Texas, at  Fort Sam, one of the first PA classes was there.   Today, the Department of Veterans Affairs is the single largest  employer of PAs in the country. Nevertheless, PAs are consistently  identified as one of the top five professions where VA is experiencing  the largest staffing shortages.   H.R. 3262, as amended, would help solve that by creating a pilot  program to provide assistance to veterans who want to pursue education  and training to become a PA and to serve their fellow veterans by  working at VA medical facilities.   I am grateful to Congresswoman Ann Kuster for sponsoring this  legislation and shepherding it through the legislative process, and I  am confident that it will go a long way in resolving existing PA  recruitment and retention issues, ensuring that VA medical facilities  are appropriately staffed with high-quality PAs and, in turn,  increasing access to care for veteran patients.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting  H.R. 3262, as amended, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1115     Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to yield 2  minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bergman), who is the  chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations on the  full Veterans' Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I certainly support this bill, and I want to thank both  General Bergman and Ms. Kuster. We made a trip to Afghanistan together  a couple of years ago. She has a dogged--and I will say ``dogged''-- commitment to the veterans in her district and to this country, and I  want to thank her for bringing this piece of legislation up. I believe  it will make a difference, I truly do, when it is implemented.   And I want to thank the ranking member, and his staff and mine, for  bringing a lot of pieces of legislation to the House floor in the last  couple of weeks. This week, especially, we have had some success here,  and that means veterans had success. Certainly, the post-9/11 GI Bill  that was passed this week is an enormous bill and will do good  generations after no one ever remembers who was on this floor debating  that bill. So I want to thank them and thank my colleagues and wish  everyone a safe recess and a healthy recess.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Shimkus). The question is on the motion  offered by the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Roe) that the House  suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3262, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``A bill to require  the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to carry out a pilot program to  provide educational assistance to certain former members of the Armed  Forces for education and training as physician assistants of the  Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes.''.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
