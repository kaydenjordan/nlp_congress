 Mr. President, one of the outstanding programs  offered in the U.S. Senate recognizes the best of America's high school  juniors and seniors. Since 1963, the U.S. Senate Youth Program has  selected two students from each State who rank high academically, excel  in leadership and volunteerism, and have a passion for public service.  They also receive a $10,000 college scholarship.   These young delegates have come to Washington, DC, every spring for a  week of education and tours highlighting all three branches of  government. Unfortunately, like so many other programs and events, this  year's trip to Washington was cancelled as our Nation faces the  coronavirus threat. This is only the second time in the program's  nearly 60 years that the delegates have not gathered in Washington for  this memorable week.   As one of the eight Senators serving on the Senate Youth Program's  Advisory Committee, I want to congratulate all who were selected to be  delegates this year and assure them we share their disappointment they  could not be with us this month. I also want to recognize North  Dakota's two delegates, Megha Bharadwaj and Rachel Goven.   Megha is a junior at St. Mary's Central High School in Bismarck. Her  leadership positions include being the State treasurer for the North  Dakota Future Business Leaders of America and a board member and  publicity director for AchieveWE. Megha has received top honors  participating in school, district, and State competitions in Voices of  Democracy, debate, speech, and Science Olympiad. In addition, she  reports for her school newspaper, sings in the jazz choir, and speaks  at community events. She plans to attend law school and enter the world  of politics.   Rachel is a senior at Turtle Lake Mercer High School, where she is  the vice president of her senior class and involved in Student Council  and National Honor Society. She attended North Dakota Girls State and  is a North Dakota rural electric cooperative youth leader. Rachel  enjoys band and choir, yearbook, cheerleading, and basketball. In her  church, she is a youth band member and camp counselor and is a willing  volunteer for other community events.   I congratulate both Megha and Rachel for receiving this honor and  welcome them to an alumni group of Senate Youth Program delegates who  are 5,500 individuals strong. Many of them have gone on to distinguish  themselves in every area of public service, including two of my  colleagues, Senator Susan Collins of Maine and Senator Cory Gardner of  Colorado. I fully expect that I will meet up with Megha and Rachel in  the future as they continue to excel in academic and professional  arenas throughout their lives.                            ____________________
