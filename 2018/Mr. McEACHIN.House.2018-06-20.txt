 Mr. Speaker, ZTE, the Chinese telecom corporation,  poses a clear threat to our security. The Pentagon has banned the sale  of ZTE devices on U.S. bases, saying they ``may pose an unacceptable  risk to the Department's personnel, information, and mission.''   Similarly, there is no dispute that ZTE violated sanctions designed  to pressure Iran and North Korea. In April, the Department of Commerce  instituted appropriate penalties.   Now, for transparently political reasons, President Trump has  reversed those penalties, giving ZTE a new lease on life.   As elected officials, one of our most basic responsibilities is to  keep Americans safe. In granting ZTE an undeserved reprieve, the  President did just the opposite. The failure is dangerous and  unacceptable.   Last week, the Senate approved a bipartisan NDAA amendment to restore  the penalties President Trump revoked. I am pleased by their success,  and I will strongly support efforts to maintain that language in the  coming NDAA conference. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  to do the same.   Politics needs to stop at the water's edge. Congress can and must do  what the President will not.                            ____________________
