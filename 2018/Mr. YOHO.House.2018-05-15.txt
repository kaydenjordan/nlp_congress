 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, the sheriff in a  neighboring county, for bringing this and putting this on tonight. I  think it is great that he is doing this because we need to highlight  the successes that we have had.   All across the country, America sees the benefits of lower taxes from  the GOP Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We are hearing about the tax cuts that  benefit hardworking families and those that are benefiting the business  community to grow our economy all across the Nation.   But here in Florida, the average family of four is saving $2,069 due  to the Federal tax reductions. That is $2,000 they didn't have before  that they can use for retirement, college, unplanned expenses, or to  invest back into the Florida economy.   In addition to the personal cuts to Federal taxes, businesses across  the country are giving their tax cuts back to their employees in the  form of bonuses, retirement benefits, family leave, and increased pay.                                time  1945    We see this in millions of jobs across the Nation. I have never seen  this before. I am 63 years old. I remember the `86 tax cut when Ronald  Reagan and the Republicans did it then. This has been so much more  significant, and the impact on the economy is multiples of that.   In Florida's Third Congressional District alone, there are several  businesses--ranging from large corporations like the Walmarts and Wells  Fargo to the small mom-and-pop businesses, such as The Flood Insurance  Agency in my district--who are giving back to their employees in our  local community. The Flood Insurance Agency in my hometown of  Gainesville, Florida, gave $1,000 bonuses to each of their 17 full-time  employees. $1,000. That is $17,000 reinvested into our community  because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that the Republicans passed and  President Trump signed into law.   Additionally, CenterState Bank, which is headquartered in Davenport,  Florida, but has branches in five cities across my district, gave out  $1,000 bonuses to non-officer employees. These bonuses went to roughly  700 people across the State of Florida. Let me do my math: 700 times  $1,000. I believe that is $700,000 being infused into the Florida  economy because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   Cintas, which has a location in Alachua, Florida, gave all employees  of over a year of employment $1,000 bonuses and gave $500 bonuses to  all employees who have worked there less than a year. While $1,000 may  seem like crumbs to some in Congress, as we heard that day of the  vote--they are just mere crumbs--we find that that is not the truth  when we get out to the district.   These bonuses are invested in the people of Florida, not to mention  an investment of over $700,000 into the Florida economy. And this is  just from three businesses listed above, not including Walmart raising  wages for 67,500 employees--that is just in Florida--or the bonuses  Lowe's gave to 21,000 employees, just in Florida.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is benefiting all Americans. Individuals  know how best to use the money they earned, not government, whether by  saving or by reinvesting in their community. By lowering the tax burden  on working Americans and businesses, we have incentivized hard work and  investment. When this happens, tax revenues rise and people thrive, not  only because of a lower tax burden, but also because businesses now  have the means to reinvest in their employees and in their community.   When that money goes back to the people, they know how best to spend  that, not government. It was interesting: As I was touring through our  district, as we often do when we go back home, I have never had this  happen--this is my third term in Congress--I was at an event, a ribbon- cutting, and I had two unsolicited people come up to me, and they  thanked us for the Republicans' Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This happened on  multiple occasions.   One individual came up to me, again, this was unsolicited--we know,  as Members of Congress, that this doesn't happen often--but he goes: I  want to let you know that because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act I am  receiving an extra $120 per paycheck, and I get paid twice a month.  That is $2,880 in crumbs he is getting.   Another individual at the same event came up and said--and they  didn't know each other. This was so neat, because he came up to me and  he said: I just want to let you know, because of the tax cut, I am  getting an extra $500 a month, $500 a month times 12 months. That is  $6,000 a year. He was excited. I was excited for him.   A local trucking company we went by in the small town of Starke, he  had out on his billboard: Beginning January 15, all drivers, all  employees, get a 15 percent pay raise. And when I talked to him, he  said it was because of the tax bill, the tax reform, that we did. These  are, again, unsolicited.   Another individual called me up, he has got an air-conditioning and  heating contract company, he told me that he gave out an extra $74,000  in bonuses due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. And I had a family member  who sometimes isn't user-friendly--he is retired--and he called me up  and said he was receiving an extra $120 a month, and he thanked me.   Again, some from the other side of the aisle claimed that this tax  bill was nothing but mere crumbs, mere crumbs, and only benefiting the  wealthy. The examples I just read off are from the Joe-lunch-box type,  people out there working every day, five days a week, just the average  moms and dads who, at the end of the month, are sitting around their  dining room table wondering if they are going to have more month than  money at the end of the month. They are realizing that they have extra  crumbs at the end of the month, and they thanked me. They came up to  me, they thanked me. They thanked the Republican Party. They thanked  President Trump for signing this into law. And they thanked us for the  extra crumbs.   As I was leaving, one of the individuals--and I had to laugh at  this--says: When the next election comes up, just remind your  colleagues on the other side that it is the economy, stupid. And he  smiled, and that is all he had to say.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman putting this on. Great job.
