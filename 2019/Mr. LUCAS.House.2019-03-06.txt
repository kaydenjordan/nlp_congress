 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the resolution for consideration  of H.R. 1.   H.R. 1 includes provisions that fall under the jurisdiction of the  House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, of which I am ranking  member.   Buried in the 600-page bill are requirements that would greatly  expand  [[Page H2383]]  the role of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST,  in election security. NIST is an important agency under our committee's  jurisdiction. NIST also plays an important nonregulatory role,  providing guidance to State and local governments to help ensure that  election results are secure and accurate.   Keeping our elections safe from cyberattacks and fraud is not a  partisan priority. It is a priority for all of us.   Unlike the more partisan parts of H.R. 1, I believe that if we had  been given a chance on the committee, Chairwoman Eddie Bernice Johnson  and I would have been able to come to an agreement on bipartisan  legislation to update NIST election security activities.                                time  1245    However, the Democratic leadership has rushed this legislation to the  floor without giving our committee an opportunity to even hold a single  hearing on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, quite simply, all of the issues raised from  NIST were ignored. The opportunity to have a hearing on this subject  matter in the committee was ignored.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against the rule and the  underlying bill. We can do better.
