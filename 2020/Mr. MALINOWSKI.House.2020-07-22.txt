 Mr. Speaker, over the last 3 months, the people in my  State of New Jersey have pulled together in extraordinary ways to fight  the coronavirus. Our leaders made good decisions. But, more important,  all of us understood that public health had to come first.   The sacrifices we made were worth making. Today, all our numbers are  looking good. The rate of spread of the infection, testing positivity  are way, way down. If all of America were New Jersey, we could stand  here today and say that America is beating COVID-19. But that doesn't  make the sacrifices any less hard to bear.   And among those who sacrificed were our young people who were looking  forward to graduation; not just the formal ending of their high school  education, but the celebration of it with family and friends, the  dances, the big games, the rites of passage that all of us experienced  when we were their age and that we want for our kids.                                time  0930    Many of our graduating seniors did end up having outdoor graduations,  but they came late and with social distancing. And let's face it, a  socially distanced graduation is kind of an oxymoron. But we have also  seen our communities come together in creative ways to celebrate the  accomplishments of our young people, and I want to recognize those  efforts today.   In Hunterdon County in my district, the parents, teachers, and school  administrators implemented an Adopt a Senior program, where volunteers  adopted a graduating student to send a letter, a card, or a gift to let  them know their communities are rooting for them.   In Berkeley Heights, the light poles downtown are decorated with  seniors' pictures, announcing what college they will be attending in  the fall.   In Bridgewater, an administrator visited the home of every senior in  a bus with a banner celebrating the class of 2020, dropping off a  graduation package and a personalized Bridgewater-Raritan High School  lawn sign for each senior.   In Mount Olive, posters celebrating the graduating class were placed  throughout town.   In Springfield, the school surprised students with a display of  personalized banners on the fence outside of the high school, each one  bearing the name and photo of a member of the graduating class.   In Westfield, a video slideshow played in the window panels of the  historic Arcanum Hall, with montages of senior portraits, pictures from  school events, and a countdown clock to graduation.   These efforts from our communities are wonderful to see and, I am  sure, are tremendously appreciated by the recipients.   During my time in Congress, I have worked hard to reach out to young  people to encourage their interests and involvement in the  conversations that are happening every day here in Congress. I have  visited dozens of schools throughout the 75 towns of my district and  have hosted two classes of my youth advisory council.   This year, about 170 kids in my youth council spent the entire year  breaking up into congressional committees and proposing legislation. I  intend to introduce some of their proposals in this body this year.  Their questions are always thoughtful, and they are always eager to get  involved and make a difference.   It is tough to see them graduate in a time of so much uncertainty and  fear, but throughout the many crises our country has faced in recent  months, I have seen our young people step up and lead time and time  again. If the students in New Jersey's Seventh District are any  indication of young people around the country, the future of America is  in good hands.   Congratulations to all of our 2020 graduates. I can't wait to see  everything they are going to accomplish in the years ahead.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, when President Trump first announced  the Muslim ban, we were told it was temporary, 90 days, according to  the executive order, or until we ``figure out what the hell is going  on,'' in the President's own words.   It has been 3\1/2\ years. Hundreds of thousands of Americans,  including many of my own constituents, are still cut off from their  loved ones, missing births, missing weddings, and missing funerals.   We are still not admitting refugees to this country for the first  time since we turned back Jews fleeing Hitler before World War II. And  by now, we know exactly what is going on.   It has nothing to do with national security, and it never did. There  has never been a deadly terrorist attack carried out in America by  someone from any of these countries. One of them is Iran, after all,  a country whose people have themselves been targeted for extinction by  ISIS.    How many times do we hear from the administration that we stand by  the people of Iran even as we ban them from visiting our country?   These good people were sacrificed for a cheap campaign promise. They  were hurt, and our country's ideals were betrayed, because someone  decided it would be easier to seek scapegoats than solutions to our  country's problems. It is wrong, and it should stop.
