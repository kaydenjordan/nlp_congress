 Mr. President, I rise today to provide clarification  surrounding section 317 of H.R. 302, the Federal Aviation  Administration, FAA, Reauthorization Act of 2018.   New section 44737 of title 49, as added by section 317 of the bill,  allows for the consideration of other means acceptable to the FAA  Administrator that provide an equivalent level of fuel system crash  resistance. I want to state clearly for the record that the intent of  Congress in new section 44737 subsection (a), paragraph (1),  subparagraph (B) is to provide flexibility for the FAA to consider  innovative fuel system designs when determining an equivalent level of  fuel system crash resistance.
