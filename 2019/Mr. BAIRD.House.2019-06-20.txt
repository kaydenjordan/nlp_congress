 Madam Chair, I rise today in support of my esteemed  colleague's amendment to increase the funding for the Distance Learning  and Telemedicine grant program at the USDA.   In Indiana, many of our rural areas do not have access to adequate  broadband coverage, putting them at a disadvantage in our global  economy. In Indiana, many of our rural areas do not have the access  that is necessary to be current.  [[Page H4945]]    Broadband is important to education and healthcare, as well as  economic development and agriculture. By responsibly increasing the  funding for this program, we are providing educational opportunities  and improved healthcare without any additional cost to the taxpayer.   We must equip our students with our 21st century tools to further  their education and ensure that all of our citizens have access to  quality healthcare, regardless of their ZIP Code. I urge my colleagues  on both sides of the aisle to support this amendment on behalf of rural  communities across the Nation.    Mr. Chair, on roll call no. 372, I mistakenly voted  ``yes'' when I intended to vote ``no.''                   Amendment No. 85 Offered by Ms. Stevens
