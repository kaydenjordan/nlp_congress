 Mr. Speaker, more than 4 months ago, the House passed  the HEROES Act, legislation that protects our HEROES on the front line  of this pandemic, our police officers, firefighters, healthcare  workers, sanitation workers, it provides stimulus payments for up to  $6,000 per family, extends unemployment benefits of $600 per week  through January, and gets hazard pay and much-needed resources to  frontline workers.   This bill has sat on my Mitch McConnell's desk since then.   In the meantime, tens of millions of Americans are out of work with  unemployment levels four times higher than they were before this  pandemic. More than a million layoffs and State and local budget cuts  that are crippling services for those who need them the most. A total  of 6.3 million Americans have been infected and nearly 200,000 have  died.   Mr. Speaker, instead of voting on the HEROES Act, the Senate  Republicans put forward their own bill that didn't come close to  addressing the problems we face: The economic catastrophe and the  public health crisis.   The American people deserve better. They need help. They deserve a  Senate and Republicans in the Senate that work for them, and a  President who tells them the truth.   Rest assured, Democrats are going to continue fighting for all those  that our Republican colleagues in the Senate and that President Trump  have left behind.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, last March, as the COVID-19 pandemic  first began to affect our day-to-day lives, the FBI warned that we  could soon see a rise in hate crimes committed against Asian Americans.   In this moment, President Trump could have tried to bring Americans  together. That is not the path he chose.   Instead, the President has poured gasoline on the fire, using terms  like ``kung flu'' and ``China virus.'' The White House has stoked  racial tensions and fed into our country's worst xenophobic impulses.   From March until June of this year, our country saw more than 2,100  reported hate crimes targeting Asian Americans. More than 3 in 10 Asian  Americans now say that they have been the subject of slurs or racist  jokes since the start of this pandemic.   These slurs and jokes aren't just words. They are actions designed to  make Asian Americans feel less than equal, and they have no place in  this country. But that is the reality of life in Donald Trump's  America.   This administration has tried to turn back the clock on racial  equality. This administration has demeaned, belittled, and ostracized  nearly every minority community.   Today, the House is saying no more. We will not stand by as this  administration attacks innocent men, women, and children of Asian  descent.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this excellent  resolution.                                time  0930
