 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4684, the  Ensuring Access to Quality Sober Living Act.   Patient brokering is and continues to be an issue in Florida and  across our nation. In light of the Nation's opioid crisis, an increased  demand for recovery from substance use disorder has sadly attracted bad  actors into the recovery space in order to make a quick buck by taking  advantage of patients and families in crisis.   Currently, regulations for addiction recovery providers vary from  state-to-state and are virtually non-existent in some states. As a  result, patients and families are unable to confidently identify  quality sober living environments.   Upon learning that various mental health and substance use disorder  facilities were making payments to individuals for the referral of  patients identified in Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, homeless  shelters, and other similar environments, Florida's legislature passed  The Patient Brokering Act to prevent it by making the perverse practice  a third-degree felony punishable by up to 5 years in prison. However,  monitoring and enforcement continue to pose a challenge.   As communities and states, like Florida, crack down, these parasites  simply relocate, rebrand, and victimize a new community--leaving broken  patients and families searching for quality recovery in their wake.  Unfortunately, the lack of and adherence to an industry-wide standard  in the addiction recovery space has led to the industry becoming an  incubator for fraud, waste, and abusive practices.   Law enforcement cannot solve this problem alone. It is vital that we  work in a bipartisan manner to address laws and regulations, or lack  thereof, which exacerbates this national crisis. H.R. 4684, the  Ensuring Access to Quality Sober Living Act does just that. H.R. 4684  authorizes the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services  Administration to develop best practices for sober living facilities in  addition to providing technical assistance and support to states  providing renewed confidence to families whose loved ones are in  recovery in sober homes across this country.   Mr. Speaker, in crafting the opioid legislation that the House will  be considering this week, Members of the Energy and Commerce Committee  took the time to hear directly from those who have lost loved ones to  this crisis. H.R. 4684 represents an important step in addressing  concerns voiced by these courageous advocates.   Ryan Hampton's testimony reminds us that no one should have to learn  their friend died of an overdose in a sober living facility due to a  lack of basic operational training.   Lisa Daniels' and Gail Smith's testimony reminds us that no one  should lose a child and learn later that their child was a victim of  patient brokering and only ended up in a substandard recovery facility  due to criminal business practices.   I urge my colleagues to support this critical, common-sense bill to  improve patient safety in sober homes across our country.    Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, June 12, 2018, I was  unavoidably detained and was unable to make votes that evening. Had I  been present, I would have voted ``yea'' for rollcall 258, H.R. 5327-- Comprehensive Opioid Recovery Centers Act; rollcall 259, H.R. 5041-- Safe Disposal of Unused Medication Act; and, rollcall 260, Approval of  the Journal.
