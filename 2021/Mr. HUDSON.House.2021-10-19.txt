 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3635,  Strengthening America's Strategic National Stockpile Act of 2021, a  bill I am proud to have introduced along with Representative Slotkin.   The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the dangers of relying on foreign  countries for needed medical supplies.  [[Page H5654]]    H.R. 3635 will reduce our dependence on foreign sources of supplies  like PPE by boosting domestic manufacturing to make these products here  in the United States. It would also make critical improvements to our  Strategic National Stockpile to ensure it is full and items are ready  to be deployed when needed.   Strengthening our stockpile of PPE and domestic manufacturing has  never been more important for our economy and our national security. I  urge my colleagues to support this legislation so we can be better  prepared for the next public health emergency.   Madam Speaker, additionally, I am proud to have introduced H.R. 4032,  the Open RAN Outreach Act, a bill that will also be considered by this  House today.    The Open RAN Outreach Act will strengthen our telecommunications  supply chains and help protect small and rural communications providers  from Chinese-backed companies. Protecting our supply chains and pushing  back against China are more critical than ever before, especially for  our vulnerable telecommunications networks. Providers backed by the  Chinese Communist Party have tried to undercut the market and expand  their outreach, particularly in our underserved rural communities.   By passing H.R. 4032, we can encourage a competitive market of  trusted vendors to expand network access across our country. Just like  H.R. 3635, this bill is also critical not just for our economy, but for  our national security.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support it as well.
