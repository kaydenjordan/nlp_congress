 Madam Speaker, tomorrow 50 Miami-Dade County  ninth grade boys from various chapters of the 5000 Role Models of  Excellence Project will visit Washington, D.C. They are all college- bound and have earned the promise of a 4-year scholarship from the  program.   5000 Role Models is an in-school dropout prevention program that will  turn 25 years old in January 2018. There are  [[Page H4417]]  6,000 participants in Miami-Dade County, 3,000 in St. Petersburg, and  2,000 in Jacksonville school districts.   The program's goal is to mentor minority boys beginning in elementary  school, middle school, and high school, all the while guiding them  along a carefully charted path to manhood and sending them to college.   Madam Speaker, in this season of youth violence, during which boys  get entangled in the school-to-prison pipeline, we are proud of the  project and the tens of thousands of boys it has helped to become  successful, contributing men in society. For example, Barry Jenkins,  director of the Oscar-winning film ``Moonlight,'' is a 1998 graduate of  the program.   I look forward to welcoming these young men here tomorrow and hope  you will get a chance to meet them, also. If you do, give them a hug  and tell them that you love them.                            ____________________
