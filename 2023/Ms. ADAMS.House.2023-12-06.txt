 Mr. Speaker, there are more than 80,000 American military  personnel who remain unaccounted for from previous conflicts around the  world. Their families, nonprofit organizations, and the Defense POW/MIA  Accounting Agency continue to fight tirelessly every day to bring these  patriots home and to give them the dignified memorials they deserve.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the homecoming of one of these  fallen heroes, Second Lieutenant Fred Lorenzo Brewer, Jr., who after  nearly 80 years has returned home to Charlotte, North Carolina.   Born on August 4, 1921, Lieutenant Brewer was raised in Charlotte's  historic Brooklyn neighborhood where his family attended the historic  Ebenezer Baptist Church.   After graduating from Shaw University in Raleigh, the segregated  South's first Black college, Lieutenant Brewer was commissioned by the  United States Air Force and entered the uniformed service in November  of 1942.   He was soon stationed at Tuskegee Army Airfield in Alabama, and he  joined the 100th Fighter Squadron, 332nd Fighter Group. Completely  segregated from their White peers, he was one of the nearly 1,000 Black  pilots trained at Tuskegee who would eventually become known around the  world as the Tuskegee Airmen.   Known for their extreme bravery and distinctive red-tail planes, the  Tuskegee Airmen fought tirelessly to defend democracy abroad and to  combat racism at home.   On October 29, 1944, Lieutenant Brewer's plane, named Trav'lin'  Light, after the Billie Holiday song, went missing while on a mission  out of Ramitelli Airbase in Italy.   That day, like so many other young Black men in his elite group,  Lieutenant Brewer gave the ultimate sacrifice for a country that did  not yet see him as an equal citizen. In serving and in giving his life,  Lieutenant Brewer showed extraordinary faith in his country and in  democracy that while imperfect in its protection and promotion of his  life and livelihood, it could still be worthy of his ultimate  sacrifice.   While Lieutenant Brewer did not live to see it, generations of  survivors vindicated his sacrifice during the civil rights era,  bringing our Nation closer to the dream of every man and every woman  being created equal. That is the promise of democracy, Mr. Speaker.  That is the promise for which he gave his life.                                time  1015    He was only 23 years old, and he left behind his parents, Fred, Sr.,  and Janie Brewer, and a younger sister, Gladys.   Thanks to the unyielding advocacy of his surviving cousins, Robena  Brewer Harrison and Brenda L. Brewer, and the determined work of the  POW/MIA Accounting Agency, Lieutenant Brewer's remains were identified  in August.  [[Page H6149]]    Last Thursday, exactly 79 years and 1 month since his death,  Lieutenant Brewer returned to Charlotte, receiving a dignified  transfer. The U.S. flag was flown in his honor last Thursday at the  U.S. Capitol at the request of my office.   Today, he will finally be laid to rest at Salisbury National Cemetery  with full military honors.   While we celebrate today, we must never forget the countless  Americans, including 25 Tuskegee Airmen, who remain unaccounted for and  the families that long to bring their beloved heroes home, and we must  never stop perfecting the cause for which they sacrificed.   We welcome Lieutenant Brewer home. We are forever indebted to his  service.                            ____________________
