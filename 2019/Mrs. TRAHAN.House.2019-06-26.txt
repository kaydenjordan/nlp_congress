 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Illinois, our  Appropriations Committee chair, as well as members of the Rules  Committee, for making this amendment in order.   I rise to offer an amendment that serves to remind the FCC that  lawmakers who oversee and fund this agency want answers.   It has been over a year since Congress directed the FCC to  investigate the sale of geolocation data by wireless carriers to third  parties. Location data has been sold through a supply chain with little  oversight, and we are seeing this information end up in the hands of  bad actors. For just a few dollars, stalkers and predatory abusers can  buy geolocation information to prey on unsuspecting victims, a reality  that should set off alarm bells nationwide.   The FCC's delay in reporting their findings from this investigation  puts consumers' security at risk. The FCC must act to remedy its lack  of enforcement and transparency regarding this investigation.
