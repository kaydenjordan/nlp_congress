 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a woman of many  firsts, an upstanding member of our community, and someone I am blessed  to call a constituent. Her name is Dr. Renee F. Washington Gardner.   She is the longest-serving female pastor of Harlem's Memorial Baptist  Church in its entire history, dedicating decades of her life in service  to church, her community, and God. This past Sunday marked her 17th  year of service.   She is the first woman to also be named a moderator of the United  Missionary Baptist Association in the group's 60-year history. Pastor  Gardner  [[Page H5770]]  is no stranger to shattering glass ceilings and paving the way for the  next generation of cleric leaders.   Under her guiding principle of unity, hope, and grace, Memorial  Baptist Church has proven vital to the strength and resiliency of  Harlem, and we are forever indebted.   With Pastor Gardner at the helm, I trust that this work is only the  beginning, and the Memorial Baptist Church will continue their mission  of uplifting our community's most vulnerable and ingraining the spirit  of strength into the fabric of our neighborhood.                            ____________________
