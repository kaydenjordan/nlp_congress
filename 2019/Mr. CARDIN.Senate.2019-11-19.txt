 Madam President, let me first thank Senator Rubio for his  leadership on this issue and Senator Menendez and Senator Risch for  their leadership in our committee and so many others who have been  involved, because tonight we have a chance to reaffirm our commitment  for human rights and democracy.   That is exactly what our legislation does. It recognizes the fact  that for 24 consecutive weeks, the people of Hong Kong have been asking  for their basic democracy and freedom.   On Monday, it was reported--just yesterday--that police fired 1,458  rounds of tear gas, 1,391 rubber bullets, 325 beanbag rounds, and 265  sponge grenades--that is just yesterday--on peaceful protesters.   They are asking nothing more than to exercise the rights they were  told would be protected to express their views and to be able to have  democracy in Hong Kong, which is the way it was in the previous time.   Senator Rubio and I introduced legislation, and the chairman and  ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Risch and  Menendez, joined us, and we passed this bipartisan legislation on June  13. It reaffirms the principles set forth in the United States-Hong  Kong Policy Act of 1992, which supports democratization, human rights,  and the autonomy of Hong Kong.   Now, Senator Rubio already talked about this, but this is a very  important thing. We gave Hong Kong a special status in its relationship  with the United States that China does not enjoy, and we gave them that  special status upon their protecting democracy and human rights in Hong  Kong. That was the commitment.   If they don't comply with that, this special status should no longer  be available, and this legislation requires that we get information on  a regular basis as to whether China is respecting the rights that we  put in our legislation in 1992, that they notify us on a regular  timeframe. That is an important point, because if they don't, we  shouldn't give them that protected status.    Secondly, it identifies persons who suppress basic freedoms, similar  to the Magnitsky Act sanctions. Those that are taking away the human  rights of the people of Hong Kong would be subject to the same type of  visa restrictions to visit America and to use our banking system. That  makes a great deal of sense, and we know that is pretty effective.   So it is time that we back up our words and our commitment to  supporting Hong Kong's democratization, human rights, and autonomy with  action. Let's make sure the people of Hong Kong know that the U.S.  Congress and the American people stand in solidarity with them, as the  Chinese authorities, as we speak, are repressing the legitimate rights  of the people of Hong Kong. We can stand with the people of Hong Kong  for democracy and human rights by our actions this evening.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I implore the Senate to take up  legislation addressing America's gun violence epidemic. We must pass  legislation requiring universal and completed background checks for  individuals seeking to purchase a gun, to help insure that guns do not  fall into the wrong hands, with deadly results.   Last week, on the morning of November 14, it was a normal Thursday at  Saugus High School in Santa Clarita, CA. Just before second period, a  16-year-old boy pulled a semiautomatic pistol out of his backpack. In  just 16 seconds, he shot five of his classmates, killing two. A short  time later, he turned the gun on himself.   After hearing the gunshots, Katie Holt, a teacher at Saugus High  School, rushed students into her classroom and barricaded the door. One  of the injured girls made it into Holt's classroom. Thankfully and  incredibly, Holt had a gunshot wound kit in case of a school shooting.  The girl had been shot twice, and Holt only had one kit. Holt dressed  the two wounds as best she could with one kit, while a freshman student  applied pressure. The injured girl survived.   Katie Holt's preparedness and quick action likely saved that young  girl's life. As we commend her heroic actions, we have to ask  ourselves: How did we get to this point? How did we get a place where  American teachers feel obligated to keep gunshot wound kits in their  classrooms?   We also mourn the tragic loss of life in several other recent mass  shootings. On November 18, three people were killed outside a Walmart  in Duncan, OK. Just this past weekend, on November 17 in Fresno, CA, 10  individuals were shot and 4 were killed at a football watch party. On  October 31 in Orina, CA, five individuals were killed and four wounded  at a Halloween block party. And we all remember the horrific spate of  mass shootings this summer, including those in Texas, Ohio, California,  and Virginia, leading to dozens killed.   In February 2019, the House passed H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background  Checks Act, by a bipartisan vote of 240-190. That month, the House also  passed H.R. 1112, the Enhanced Background Checks Act. Since that time,  these bills have languished in the Senate where the Republican leader  refuses to allow Senate consideration.   By refusing to take up legislation to require universal and completed  background checks, the Senate is failing the American people. We have a  responsibility to pass commonsense gun reform to end the senseless  bloodshed. We need gun reform now, not only to address our country's  seemingly endless cycle of mass shootings, but we need gun safety  legislation now because our communities are ravaged by daily gun  violence that does not make news headlines.   On average, about every 13 hours, someone is killed with a gun in  Maryland. On average, 656 Marylanders die from fatal gunshot wounds  every year. Firearms are the first leading cause of  [[Page S6665]]  death among children and teens in Maryland. African-American children  and teens in Maryland are five times as likely as their White peers to  die by guns. In Maryland, African-Americans are 16 times as likely to  die by gun homicide as White people.   In 2017, 53 percent of the guns recovered from Maryland crime scenes  came from another State. Often, these guns used in crimes in Maryland  are from States with more lenient gun control laws.   American women are 21 times more likely to be killed with a gun than  women in other high-income countries; 4.5 million women in the United  States have been threatened with a gun by their current or previous  intimate partner. It has estimated that 900,000 American women have  been shot or shot at by their current or previous intimate partner.  When there is a gun present during a domestic violence situation, a  woman's risk of being killed goes up 500 percent.   In Maryland, from 2013 to 2017, 48 women were fatally shot by an  intimate partner. African-American women are 1.7 times more likely as  White women to be fatally shot by a partner. These are women like  Maryland resident, Timira Hopkins. Hopkins' relationship with her  boyfriend was abusive, and he had made threats before. One night in  2014, Hopkins' boyfriend delivered on his threats, shooting Hopkins  five times before killing himself. Incredibly, Hopkins survived, but  the right side of her face is paralyzed, and she is deaf in one ear. In  September of this year, Hopkins shared her story on NPR in the hopes  she can help other survivors.   We need to do more for brave women like Timira Hopkins. We need to  join her in the fight to protect people suffering domestic violence.  This body understands the dangerous potential consequences of domestic  violence perpetrators owning guns. That is why, in 1996, we passed the  Lautenberg amendment, banning gun ownership for individuals convicted  of misdemeanor domestic violence. However, without universal background  checks, we can't effectively enforce this prohibition and keep guns out  of the hands of violent abusers.   An estimated 22 percent of U.S. gun owners purchased their most  recent firearm without a background check. When background checks are  not required, domestic abusers get ahold of guns. In 2018, Sara Schmidt  was murdered by her husband, who should have be prohibited from  purchasing a firearm because of a domestic violence felony. Schmidt's  husband purchased the gun he used to murder Sara from an online private  seller, bypassing background check requirements.   Passing legislation to expand background checks to every gun sale,  including those conducted online, at gun shows, and through private  transfers, should be the top priority in Congress. Congress should also  make sure that background checks are fully completed before a gun sale  is finally approved. There is no one answer which will fix America's  gun violence epidemic. But we can't let the complexity of the problem  paralyze us. We need to take steps forward.   The American people deserve action. They are demanding action. An  overwhelming majority of Americans--97 percent--support expanding  background checks. Congress must listen to the 97 percent of Americans  and take action. We cannot wait any longer. While we wait, Americans  are dying, and communities are traumatized by violence. We must do the  right thing and take up the House legislation requiring universal and  completed background checks for individuals seeking to purchase a gun.  The time for action is now.                            ____________________
