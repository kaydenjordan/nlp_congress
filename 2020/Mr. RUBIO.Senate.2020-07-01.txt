 Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  a small business that exemplifies the American entrepreneurial spirit  at the heart of our country. Today, it is my distinct honor to  recognize a family-owned business that not only provides excellent  moving, warehousing, and storage services but also prioritizes  dignified work for its employees. This week, it is my pleasure to honor  AMWAT Moving Warehousing Storage of Tallahassee, FL, as the Senate  Small Business of the Week.   AMWAT was founded in 1997 by college sweethearts Dean and Gloria Pugh  in Tallahassee, FL. After helping several friends move residences, the  couple realized they had the potential to start their own business.  Initially named ``A Man With A Truck,'' the business started as a one- man operation consisting of a pick-up truck and trailer operating out  of Dean's spare bedroom. Soon after, A Man With a Truck moved into a  small warehouse, hired six employees and acquired three moving trucks.   In 2008, Dean and Gloria acquired the largest, oldest moving company  in the Tallahassee area and rebranded as AMWAT Moving Warehousing  Storage. AMWAT has grown to include 26 employees and a 13-truck fleet.  They provide long-term storage, handle shipping for local businesses,  and provide shipping services nationwide. Gloria serves as president  and chief executive officer and Dean is the chief operating officer.   AMWAT's high-quality work has earned awards from business groups,  including the Greater Tallahassee Chamber of Commerce, the Tally  Awards, Angie's List, and Wheaton World Wide Moving. Dean and Gloria  are also active in the American Moving and Storage Association and the  Professional Movers Association of Florida.   From the beginning, Dean and Gloria have understood that providing  dignified work is crucial to personal and community development.  Through training, mentorship, and teamwork, they encourage their  employees to feel a sense of ownership in the company and take pride in  their work. At AMWAT, the employees are the most valued asset.   Locally, AMWAT is committed to addressing poverty, upward mobility,  education, and the arts. Their signature charity event is the annual  Summer Fill-a-Truck Food and Fund Drive, which benefits the Second  Harvest of the Big Bend. They have also partnered with ECHO, Junior  League of Tallahassee, and LeMoyne Arts.   Like many other small businesses, AMWAT experienced a sharp decline  in revenue due to the coronavirus pandemic. When the U.S. Small  Business Administration launched the Paycheck Protection Program, PPP,  Gloria and Dean quickly applied. The PPP provides forgivable loans to  impacted small businesses and nonprofits who maintain their payroll  during the COVID-19 pandemic. When their funding was approved, Gloria  and Dean used it to keep their 26 employees paid and adapt their  business procedures to meet public safety standards. For Gloria and  Dean, the PPP was a ``blessing'' and a ``godsend,'' providing the  security needed to continue serving their customers, employees, and  community.   AMWAT Moving Warehousing Storage is an outstanding example of the  important role small businesses play in creating dignified work in  their communities. I commend AMWAT for providing excellent moving,  storage, and logistical services and uplifting their employees.  Congratulations to Dean, Gloria, and the entire team at AMWAT. I look  forward to watching your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
