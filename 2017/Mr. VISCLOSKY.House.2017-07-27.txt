 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment.   I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Rosen).    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment.   I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Rosen).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Vermont (Mr. Welch).    Mr. Chairman, first of all, I want to commend the  gentleman from Vermont for his amendment and for his thoughtful  approach to this problem.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Lowenthal).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Dingell).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Dingell).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Maine (Ms. Pingree), who is a member of the full committee.     Mr. Chairman, I simply, again, reiterate my support  for the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Indiana is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Correa).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I would point out that the gentlewoman is absolutely correct. The  committee worked hard to increase funding for these accounts.   Also, I would point out, representing the First Congressional  District of Indiana, I am intimately familiar with the problems these  environmental sites have.   There is much to do, many resources we need to look for, and I would  support the gentleman's amendment.    Mr. Chair, I am pleased to accept the gentleman's  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me  time.   Mr. Chairman, I reluctantly join with the chair in opposition to the  gentlewoman's amendment and share the chair's concern over the issue  raised. However, I don't think the approach is an appropriate one in  that we would carve out another budget line.   Given my anticipation that we will not have a full 12-month fiscal  year for this money to be spent, I am very concerned that we will find  enough projects for this money to be spent on. In the meantime, they  would then be eliminated from the existing line for other possible  research.   Mr. Chairman, I would look to work with the gentlewoman to address  this issue in a fulsome fashion, but not in this manner.    Mr. Chairman, as the designee of the ranking member, I  move to strike the last word.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Indiana is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I feel compelled to rise in support of  the gentleman's amendment, as it relates to the detention facility at  Guantanamo Bay, and would simply make a few brief remarks.   This is, I believe, a very substantive and serious issue facing a  constitutional government, our government of laws.   I would point out that it is a sad state of affairs if somewhere in  the United States of America we cannot find a secure facility to detain  41 individuals at this late date, given the fact that President Bush  released over 500 people from Guantanamo, and President Obama released  197.   Mr. Chairman, I would simply close by observing that, within the last  week, the Attorney General of the United States of America could not  find a justification to have an alleged terrorist, who recruits for al- Qaida, having been extradited from Spain, an Algerian, placed in  Guantanamo. That person, as I understand it, as I speak at this moment,  is being detained in the United States of America. That is what should  happen with the other 41 people.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I just have a parliamentary inquiry.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry.    Mr. Chair, I just have a parliamentary inquiry.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry.    Mr. Chair, I have a question on the procedure. I  understand that Mr. Foster is recognized. Did I lose track of an  amendment for Mr. Polis?   The Acting CHAIR. That amendment was called, and the gentleman was  not present.    And Mr. Poe?   The Acting CHAIR. That amendment was also called, and the gentleman  was not present.    I appreciate the information. Sorry for the  interruption very much.   The Acting CHAIR. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman yielding.   I simply would want to rise in support of his amendment. I would  point out that in 2010, the Ballistic Missile Defense Review made no  request for space-based interceptors. Currently, this is a matter under  review by the Department. I think we should allow that review to be  concluded before we expend moneys.   The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman from Illinois has  expired.    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentlewoman for  yielding and join her in opposition; although, I must tell you I am  always very reserved about opposing an amendment put forth by a Notre  Dame graduate.   But, in all seriousness, I would say that I do appreciate the  gentleman's concern with the devolving situation in Yemen in that we do  not want to get involved in a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.   I am also in agreement with much of the intent behind the amendment  and certainly agree that Congress has relinquished much of its  oversight role over Presidential decisions about sending U.S. Armed  Forces into hostilities provided under the War Powers Act. That is why  I am a strong supporter of efforts to develop a new Authorization for  Use of Military Force for the global war on terror. Congress needs to,  finally, after 16 years, carry out its constitutional duty and stop  hiding from this very important debate that the gentleman has raised in  his amendment.   However, I do have concerns that the gentleman's amendment, as  written, is overly broad and would place undue restrictions on U.S.  Forces within the Middle East to respond to legitimate threats within  Yemen.   So, again, very reluctantly, I join with the chairwoman in  opposition, and I appreciate her yielding.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Indiana is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I certainly would acknowledge that Iran  is up to very nefarious purposes as far as sponsoring terrorism  internationally.   I also acknowledge the gentleman referenced the previous  administration more than once during his remarks as far as the issue  before the House today.   In 2016, last year, heavy water was purchased by the Department of  Energy and the State Department, but I would point out this is 2017  with a different administration, and essentially the amendment is a  solution to a problem that does not exist.   The current administration has recertified Iran's compliance with the  agreement twice. Iran does not have a nuclear weapon and is subject to  intense scrutiny by the International Atomic Energy Agency.   But importantly to the point raised today, I would suggest that the  Department of Energy consistently has indicated at the time of the 2016  heavy water purchase from Iran that the United States would not be a  regular buyer of Iranian heavy water.   Since that purchase, the United States has not purchased any  additional heavy water from that country. In fact, the U.S. has,  through refraining from purchases of excess supply, forced Iran to ship  excess heavy water abroad so that it can continue to adhere to the  agreement entered into.   It seems highly unlikely that the current administration would now  seek out an opportunity to purchase this heavy water.   Again, I believe the gentleman has a solution to a problem that does  not exist, and I am opposed to his amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. DeSANTIS. Mr. Chairman, I would just say, if you want money to go  to purchase heavy water from Iran, then obviously you should oppose the  amendment. But if you don't think that is a good idea, then it doesn't  hurt us to have this in here, given what has happened in the past.   I wish I had 100 percent confidence that we would not be repeating  mistakes. I hope that is where we go, but I have not yet seen the real  robust action to turn the tide away from a deal that has put Iran on  the path to a nuclear bomb. The danger with the deal was always less  that Iran would cheat on the deal. I think they probably are, but the  danger is they get a bomb by keeping the deal.   This is a major problem. This is one small area of this to protect  the taxpayer.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back  the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. DeSantis).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.   Mr. DeSANTIS. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida will  be postponed.    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my  request for a recorded vote on the amendment offered by the gentleman  from Florida to the end that the Chair puts the question de novo.   The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman  from Indiana?   There was no objection.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. DeSantis).   The amendment was agreed to.                       Announcement by the Acting Chair    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, proceedings  will now resume on those amendments printed in part B of House Report  115-261 on which further proceedings were postponed, in the following  order:   Amendment No. 10 by Mr. Suozzi of New York.   Amendment No. 12 by Mr. Brendan F. Boyle of Pennsylvania.   Amendment No. 38 by Mr. Nadler of New York.   Amendment No. 43 by Mr. Cartwright of Pennsylvania.   The Chair will reduce to 2 minutes the time for any electronic vote  after the first vote in this series.                    Amendment No. 10 Offered by Mr. Suozzi    The Acting CHAIR. The unfinished business is the demand for a  recorded vote on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York  (Mr. Suozzi) on which further proceedings were postponed and on which  the noes prevailed by voice vote.

There is  1 minute remaining.                                time  1656    Ms. STEFANIK and Mr. DENHAM changed their vote from ``no'' to  ``aye.''   So the amendment was agreed to.   The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.   The Acting CHAIR. There being no further amendments, under the rule,  the Committee rises.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Poe  of Texas) having assumed the chair, Mr. Collins of Georgia, Acting  Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union,  reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill  (H.R. 3219) making appropriations for the Department of Defense for the  fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, and for other purposes, and,  pursuant to House Resolution 478, he reported the bill, as amended by  that resolution and by House Resolution 473, back to the House with  sundry further amendments adopted in the Committee of the Whole.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is  ordered.   Is a separate vote demanded on any further amendment reported from  the Committee of the Whole? If not, the Chair will put them en gros.   The amendments were agreed to.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third  reading of the bill.  [[Page H6510]]    The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was  read the third time.                              Motion to Recommit    Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the  desk.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill?   Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Yes, I am opposed to the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to  recommit.   The Clerk read as follows:         Strike division E.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from California is  recognized for 5 minutes.   Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the  bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If  adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as  amended.   In last year's election, no campaign rhetoric was more infamous than  the President's promise to ``build a great, great wall on our Southern  border'' and ``make Mexico pay for it.''   The reality is the funding would come from U.S. taxpayers, not from  Mexico, as the President promised. This motion to recommit strikes the  $1.6 billion appropriation for construction of nearly 74 miles of  border wall.   Beyond the initial 74 miles, we have no idea of how many miles of  border wall the President plans to build or how much it will cost  because we have not received the required report on the long-term plan  and justification for border security investments.   Even with the plan, we will need time to evaluate whether investments  in the border wall are more cost effective than alternatives and more  urgent than clearly established unmet needs.   With $1.6 billion, we could buy two of the four heavy Coast Guard  icebreakers we need to protect U.S. interests in the Arctic. This  purchase would help minimize the danger highlighted in a National  Academies of Science report, which concluded the Coast Guard requires  four new heavy icebreakers to protect U.S interests in the Arctic,  where Russia has an ever-increasing presence.   The Coast Guard is ready to solicit proposals for new icebreakers in  fiscal year 2018. In this bill there is no funding for essential  icebreakers. There is no acquisition funding for them in the Homeland  Security bill.   The $1.6 billion could also be used for investments in additional  scanning technology in the hiring of thousands of Customs officers at  every U.S. port of entry. This would reduce wait times for travelers,  better facilitate the flow of commerce, and contribute to economic  growth in many of our districts. It would also enhance our ability to  intercept contraband and illegal narcotics mostly smuggled directly  into the U.S. through our ports of entry, not where the wall would be  built.   The bill before us does not adequately address these and other areas  of security vulnerabilities.   As Members of Congress, protecting our Nation and the American public  is our greatest responsibility. It is our obligation to act in their  best interest and to invest their tax dollars wisely. If the only  Homeland Security item in this bill remains the funding for 74 miles of  border wall, we will fail to meet our obligations.   Unfortunately, the President's border wall is now a proxy for the  broader immigration debate. There is a false and misleading assumption  that building a border wall will solve the immigration challenges we  face. The reality is we will never be able to fix our broken  immigration system with an enforcement-only approach that turns a blind  eye to the desperate circumstances that compels so many to make the  often deadly journey to the U.S.   We will never be able to address our immigration challenges by  treating as criminals the millions of undocumented people in this  country, many of whom are our neighbors and friends.   For years or even decades, the vast majority have called the U.S.  their home. They have paid their taxes, acted responsibly, contributed  to their communities, and worked hard to provide opportunity for their  family.   Immigration enforcement is as much a moral issue as it is a legal  one. Our Statue of Liberty has always been a welcoming symbol of hope  for those who, like now, are fleeing poverty, oppression, famine, war,  and violence in their home country. Many of our ancestors come from  somewhere else, often within certain legal status, and made significant  contributions to help our country become the greatest in the world.  Today's immigrants continue to contribute to that noble legacy.   What we truly need is comprehensive immigration reform that protects  our homeland and reflects our American values. Democrats stand ready to  work with Republicans to achieve that goal, but Democrats will not  support the use of taxpayer dollars for an ill-conceived border wall  that has more to do with a campaign promise than the security of our  homeland.   In spite of the President's assurances, Mexico is not paying for this  wall. The American taxpayer is. My motion to recommit would prevent  that from happening. I urge my colleagues to support the motion to  recommit.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer).
