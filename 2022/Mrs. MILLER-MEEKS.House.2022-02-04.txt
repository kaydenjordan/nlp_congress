 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a  man who dedicated his life to serving my hometown.   On January 9, 2022, Ron Brickey of Ottumwa passed away. A fellow Army  veteran, Ron grew up in Ottumwa, graduated from Ottumwa High School,  and went on to earn a degree in finance and engineering from Iowa State  University.   He worked for over 40 years at McCune & Reed Insurance, serving as  president and co-owner.   Ron was a lifetime member of First Presbyterian Church, serving on  the board of elders and singing in the church choir. He is also a  former president and longtime member of the Rotary Club of Ottumwa,  served on the board of the American Home Finding Association, was a  member of the Ottumwa Chamber of Commerce, received the Gene Schultz  Award for community service, served on the Ottumwa Area Development  Council, and was president of the Ottumwa Regional Health Center Board.   He cooked countless chickens for the Ottumwa Rotary Oktoberfest  barbecue, raised thousands for the McCreery Cancer Center and the  Bridge View Convention Center. Ron worked tirelessly to leave the world  a better place than he found it, and he was successful.   Ron's wife, Janet, his two children, and seven grandchildren are in  my prayers.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend,  Congresswoman Steel, for offering her commonsense amendment.   China is the world's leading producer of carbon emissions. For years,  China has been one of the largest emitters of carbon dioxide in the  world. In 2019, China emitted 10.1 billion metric tons of carbon  dioxide, almost twice as much as the U.S., representing nearly 28  percent of global emissions.   For years, the U.S. has set ambitious goals to cut down our carbon  emissions. Meanwhile, China stated their annual CO2  emissions are expected to continue to grow and will not peak until  2030.   The Steel amendment would make it the official policy of the U.S. to  require the Chinese Communist Party to match emission-cutting standards  established by the U.S. This amendment is so simple and easy to  support, I cannot think of a reason it would be opposed.   The Chinese Communist Party has shown us countless times that we  cannot trust them on their word alone. We need formal commitments from  Beijing, and action must be taken.
