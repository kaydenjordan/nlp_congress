 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I would like to use my time today to raise  awareness about an important issue. Actually, it is about an important  person, and his name is Marc Fogel.   Marc is a beloved father and husband. He is also a son, a brother,  and an uncle. Over the course of his life, he has been a formative  mentor to many young minds. You see, Marc Fogel spent 35 years teaching  American history at American international schools around the world and  most recently in Moscow. But after dedicating so much of his life to  the service of others, he is currently detained in a Russian labor  camp.   On August 14, 2021, as Marc returned to Russia for 1 final year of  teaching before a much-deserved retirement, he was arrested in a Moscow  airport for carrying about half an ounce of medical marijuana in his  luggage. Marc had been prescribed the medical marijuana as an  alternative to opioids to manage his chronic pain after undergoing  multiple back surgeries, including a spinal fusion and various other  challenging and painful procedures. Marc did not think that this  healthcare decision would cost him his freedom and maybe even his life,  but following his arrest, a Russian court convicted Marc of ``large- scale drug smuggling'' and sentenced him to 14 years in a maximum  security penal colony. He has been there ever since.   In 2021, the same year as Marc's arrest, the U.S. State Department  described the conditions in Russian prisons and detention centers as  ``often harsh and life threatening.'' They reported overcrowding, abuse  by guards and inmates, limited access to healthcare, food shortages,  and inadequate sanitation as common occurrences--many practices that  most Americans can't even imagine.   Considering the inhumane and harsh treatment reported in these  centers and especially given the health challenges that Marc was  already facing upon his arrest, Marc's family now fears he is not going  to survive his sentence.   This is an injustice at the highest level, and it must not be  tolerated by our government.   It is important to recognize that Marc is not the only American  illegally detained abroad. U.S. Marine Paul Whelan and Wall Street  Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich are both still trapped in Russian  prisons as well.   But while all three of these men are wrongfully detained in Russia,  only Paul Whelan and Evan Gershkovich have been recognized as  wrongfully detained by the State Department. The State Department  considers a formal  [[Page S3715]]  wrongful detention status as being one of the first steps to getting an  American who is detained abroad back home. This determination mobilizes  multiple U.S. Agencies to work with the State Department and the family  of the detained to secure the prisoner's release.   There are currently over 50 American citizens the State Department  lists as wrongfully detained in Russia, China, Iran, and Venezuela.  However, despite being unjustly detained for the last nearly 2 years-- with no end in sight--Marc is still not designated as wrongfully  detained by the U.S. State Department.   You may recall the Biden administration's high-profile negotiation to  bring WNBA star Brittney Griner home after she was detained in Russia,  just after Fogel, over a similar drug-related offense. Ms. Griner is,  thankfully, home. One of the key differences between Brittney Griner's  and Marc Fogel's cases is that, less than 3 months after Griner's  arrest, the State Department classified her as wrongfully detained.  Fogel deserves the same justice, and we should be using every tool at  our disposal to bring him home.   I have had the privilege of getting to know some of Marc's family,  some of whom are Montanans. They have been fierce advocates here  stateside, but they fear they will never see their brother's face again  or hear their father's voice. We can't let that happen.   In working alongside the Fogel family, I have also teamed up with  President Obama's U.S. Ambassador to Russia, Mike McFaul. Mike McFaul  was my former Bozeman High School debate partner, whose son was  actually a student of Marc Fogel when Ambassador McFaul was serving in  Moscow. Mike McFaul and I are working together to implore the State  Department to finally declare Marc as wrongfully detained.   This week, I also worked with colleagues across the aisle to  introduce a resolution highlighting the unjust and disproportionate  criminal sentence by Russia and calling for the immediate release of  Mr. Fogel.   Time is of the essence. Tomorrow is Marc's 62nd birthday, but instead  of celebrating with his friends and family, he will be spending it  illegally detained in a Russian labor camp.   No American should ever have to endure this type of injustice. It is  time the country and the world know about Mr. Fogel's case, and I urge  the administration to help bring this American back home once again.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleague from  Montana, Senator Tester, and all of those who have worked so hard to  get this home today.   This settles a 100-plus-year battle in Montana. This is the last  Indian water rights settlement for the State of Montana--the Fort  Belknap water rights settlement. It codifies existing water rights,  prevents costly litigation, provides clean drinking water, and invests  in irrigation for farmers and ranchers to provide food for our country.   This bill passed out of committee by a voice vote. It is supported by  the Governor of Montana, by the entire Montana congressional  delegation, the Fort Belknap community, all of the locally affected  counties, including the county commissioners, and our farmers and our  ranchers.   This is truly a win for our State and the country. I ask my  colleagues to support this amendment, and I am going to ask for a voice  vote.    Mr. President, today I have the distinct honor of  recognizing David Stamey, chief of emergency services for Stillwater  County, MT, for his dedication to keeping his community safe, no matter  what disaster may ensue.   David has served Stillwater County as the chief of emergency services  for nearly a year and a half, and since assuming his position in April  of 2022, he has managed several disasters that few county DES  coordinators would see in a lifetime.   Just 2 months after stepping into his role, David was tasked with  responding to historic 500-year flooding throughout the region. When  the substantial amount of snow and heavy rainfall from earlier that  spring met the rapidly rising temperatures in June, the snowmelt and  water runoff sparked immediate flooding throughout the Yellowstone  Valley. Agricultural land, homes, roads, bridges, and critical  infrastructure took a significant hit. The Sibanye-Stillwater Mine in  Nye, the world's only viable platinum and palladium mining operation  outside South Africa and Russia, was forced to suspend operations for  roughly 6 weeks due to a road that provided entry to the mine being  washed out. David continued to work tirelessly with local, State, and  Federal partners to ensure the road would be restored in a timely  manner and that his community at large remained on a swift path to  recovery.   Most recently, a portion of a train headed westbound near Reed Point  derailed while crossing a bridge over the Yellowstone River.  Thankfully, there were no reported injuries, but there were multiple  railcars submerged in the river releasing asphalt downstream. About a  week later, all of the railcars involved in the derailment were removed  from the scene, and after just 28 days post outage, the bridge was  newly constructed, allowing the first train to cross over safely as  crews continue to work diligently to remove remaining asphalt from the  river. Thanks to David's effective leadership and coordination within  the Unified Command structure, train service was restored while never  compromising anyone's health or safety.   It is my distinct honor to recognize David Stamey for his unwavering  commitment to keeping residents of Stillwater County safe. He has  selflessly dedicated 30 years of his life to disaster and emergency  services, and I am confident his passion and expertise in this field  will benefit folks in Stillwater County and across the State of Montana  for years to come. Thank you for your continued efforts to keep  Montanans safe, David. You make Montana proud.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I have the honor of  congratulating the Billings High School class of 1973. These graduates  grew up in the shadow of the Cold War, they all remember the  [[Page S3747]]  day that President Kennedy was shot, and they came of age during a  turbulent and restless period of our country. They saw protests over  Vietnam, civil rights, and social unrest. They lived through the space  race, listening on transistor radios as rockets launched into space.  They memorized the names of all the Mercury astronauts, saw men land  and walk on the moon. Some veterans in the class served through four  wars, countless interventions, and many shows of force. They saw phones  go from rotary dials with party lines, to cell phones and smart watches  that can access almost any piece of information with the touch of a  button. They saw television go from black and white boxes to 85-inch  flat screen TVs streaming color events live via satellite around the  world. They saw the dawn of computers, survived Y2K, and lived to see  the birth of artificial intelligence. They have lived through two  different centuries, and they saw and embraced more new technology than  any previous generation. Now in their late 60s, they have children,  grandchildren, and great-grandchildren who will lead the country into  the next millennia.   It is my distinct honor to recognize the Billings High School class  of 1973 for their incredible legacy. They have etched their name on  those majestic sandstone rim rocks that grace their town.                            ____________________
