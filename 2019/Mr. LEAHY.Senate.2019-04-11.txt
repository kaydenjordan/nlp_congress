 Mr. president, Katherine Paterson is a Vermont author with  more than 30 titles to her name and a list of awards that other writers  could only dream of. She has a keenly special knack for introducing  young readers to difficult topics about life and death, as she did with  her well-known novel, ``Bridge to Terabithia.'' She has just added a  prestigious and fitting recognition to that long list, having been  named the American Academy of Arts and Letters' 2019 E.B. White Award  winner. The award pays tribute to her lifetime of achievement in  children's literature.   What is notable about this latest award is the modesty by which  Katherine Paterson comes to it. In an interview with Vermont Public  Radio, VPR, the author who has twice won both the National Book Award  and the Newbery Medal said her latest award held special meaning.   ``Any award that has the name `E.B. White' attached to it brings with  it a great thrill of joy, since he's one of my real heroes,'' she told  her VPR audience. ``He probably was one of the best writers in America,  and yet he respected children so much that he wrote some of his best  work for them. And that makes me incredibly happy.''   Clearly, some of E.B. White's influence has rubbed off, as Katherine  Paterson's own novels show great respect for her readers, young and old  alike. Her writing has been hailed for the compassion she expresses,  taking on life's challenges--and tragedies--in a forthright and honest  exploration for young readers. Her achievement is all the more  impressive given that Katherine Paterson's first language was Chinese,  having been born to Christian missionaries who immersed her in the  culture before being forced to leave China in the late 1930s. Her  studies of both Chinese and Japanese cultures, as well as her religious  interests, are evident in her collection of writings.   We are fortunate that Katherine and her late husband John chose to  settle in Vermont more than three decades ago. On both local and  national levels, she has been most generous with her time, visiting  schools and inspiring young people to read, while advocating for  organizations that promote literacy. It is no wonder that Katherine  Paterson has been named a Living Legend by the Library of Congress.   Marcelle and I are proud and honored to call Katherine Paterson a  friend and, more so, a Vermonter.   Congratulations to you, Katherine, on this latest and most meaningful  recognition. It is so very much deserved.                            ____________________     Mr. President, it is not often that I say the words  ``Vermont'' and ``bow tie'' in the same sentence, except, of course,  when discussing the famed Beau Ties Ltd. of Vermont. Beau Ties,  Vermont's sole bow tie manufacturer, got its start as a mom-and-pop  operation more than 25 years ago and maintains that ethos. They are an  amazing example of the many small businesses that are the heart and  soul of Vermont.   Beau Ties was started in 1993 by bow tie aficionado Bill Kenerson and  his wife Deborah Venman. They ran the company out of their home and  sold their bow ties through the mail. Over the years, the company has  grown to employ 30 Vermonters and now has its own manufacturing  facility in Middlebury. They sell hundreds of different bow ties, and  their selection is constantly changing to keep customers coming back.   Though they are no longer at the helm, Bill and Deborah's desire to  keep the company in Vermont has been honored. In fact, the company has  never left the facility that it moved into in 1999, and many of its  employees have been with Beau Ties for over 20 years.   Among its clientele, Beau Ties Ltd. can count the late Orville  Redenbacher and Bill Nye. The company has also cut cloth for the Obama  White House and is the official tiemaker of the U.S. House of  Representatives and the Vermont Statehouse. I have also sported Beau  Ties before: I wore one of their bow ties to the investiture of Judge  Geoffrey Crawford, now chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the  District of Vermont.   I am proud to recognize the achievements and devoted following that  Beau Ties Ltd. has accumulated over its nearly three decades in  business. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a  ``Seven Days'' article titled, ``Middlebury's Beau Ties Collars the  Market on Dapper Neckwear.'' It tells the story of Beau Ties Ltd., from  its humble beginnings to now and of its importance to Vermont's economy  and its many satisfied customers, myself included.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:  [[Page S2427]]                                      Seven Days                              [March 6, 2019]         Middlebury's Beau Ties Collars the Market on Dapper Neckwear         Anyone who wears a bow tie is making a statement. It can be       ``I'm conservative,'' ``I'm in the wedding party,'' ``I'll be       your server this evening,'' or ``I'm intelligent and       dexterous enough to knot my own bow tie.'' Regardless of the       message, bow ties get noticed, as do the people who sport       them.        Not everyone can pull one off--or tie one on. Those who       wear bow ties are a rarefied set. And for many bow tie       enthusiasts around the country, their bow tie mecca is Beau       Ties Ltd of Vermont: a modern, one-story manufacturing       facility in a Middlebury industrial park. There, bow tie       aficionados are occasionally seen getting their pictures       taken in front of the giant polka-dotted bow tie out front.        Never heard of Beau Ties? That's unsurprising in Vermont,       where few people routinely wear ties of any kind. According       to Elizabeth Smith, copresident and CEO of Beau Ties, most of       the company's clients live out of state and buy their       products online or through their catalogs.        But this predominantly retail business, now in its 26th       year, boasts an impressive clientele of famous bow tie-      wearing blokes: the late popcorn entrepreneur Orville       Redenbacher, science educator Bill Nye ``The Science Guy''       and retired ``CBS News Sunday Morning'' host Charles Osgood,       who has his own signature line of bow ties with the company.        Beau Ties has also produced ties for the Obama White House,       Tiffany & Co., PBS, and countless colleges, prep schools and       fraternal organizations. It's also the official tie maker for       the U.S. House of Representatives and the Vermont Statehouse.       And its private-label clients include fine menswear retailers       Ben Silver, Barneys New York and Brooks Brothers.        On a reporter's recent tour of the facility, Smith and       fellow copresident Cy Day Tall rarely referred to their       clientele as ``customers.'' Instead, they were ``our guys''       or ``our fellas.'' While the bow tie market isn't huge, or       exclusively male, the people who purchase their bow ties,       neckties and other fashion accessories--cummerbunds,       cufflinks, suspenders, cravats, pocket squares--tend to       return time and again. Often they'll phone the company and       ask to speak to a specific employee who helped them in the       past.        ``In our mind, we're a family business,'' explained Smith,       who splits management duties with Tall. Smith handles       customer service and sales, while Tall is the chief marketing       officer and ``wordsmith'' of the catalog, the mainstay of       their retail business.        Beau Ties' familial feel extends to its staff, too. Of the       30 employees, several are mother-daughter or grandparent-      grandchild pairs. Many, including Smith, have been with Beau       Ties 20 years or more. All but three are women. The company       also hires no seasonal help, Smith noted, so that everyone       can earn a decent wage with benefits.        Notwithstanding its reputation for formal attire, Beau Ties       is actually a casual and relaxed workplace, where several       seamstresses were listening to music on headphones and joking       among themselves while sewing. Zooey, a small black pug, and       Margy, an energetic Welsh corgi, enthusiastically greeted a       visiting reporter.        Beau Ties was founded in 1993 by Bill Kenerson and his       wife, Deborah Venman. Kenerson, a native of New Haven, Conn.,       and a Marine Corps veteran who attended Yale University,       moved to Vermont in 1978 to buy the Killington Country       Resort. A year later he took a job at Simmonds Precision       Products in Vergennes, where he worked until 1990. In 1991,       then-governor Richard Snelling tapped him to serve as       commissioner of economic development.        Though Kenerson had a strong business background, he had no       training in men's apparel, Smith said. But he was a dyed-in-      the-wool bow tie aficionado who inherited many of his       favorites from his father and grandfather. Discouraged by the       dearth of quality ties he liked, he and Venman launched their       own bow tie business in the spring of 1993.        Two months later, they hired Vivian LaFave, a New Haven       seamstress, who set up their shop in her basement and began       cutting and sewing ties from fabrics Kenerson and Venman       purchased in New York City's garment district. LaFave is       still with the company and considered the grand dame of       the sewing floor.        Kenerson and Venman began by marketing just eight bow ties       via a one-page circular, which they mailed to 5,000 people;       it eventually evolved into a catalog. The company also       advertised in periodicals that Kenerson assumed would appeal       to fellow bow tie wearers, such as Smithsonian magazine and       the New Yorker.        Smith remembers the surge of business that occurred the day       after Kenerson ran an ad on page two of the Wall Street       Journal in the late 1990s. ``We couldn't answer the phone       fast enough,'' she recalled.        For several years, Kenerson and Venman ran the business out       of their home, said Smith. However, the company quickly       outgrew that space.        ``Deb had to get up and get dressed every morning because       we had to go through their bedroom just to get to our       offices,'' she noted. In November 1999, Beau Ties moved into       its current building. Wanting to maintain the company's homey       feel, Kenerson had it outfitted with a large kitchen, an       outdoor deck, a grill and even a dog run.        Soon, the company was producing 36- to 48-page catalogs       that featured nearly two dozen new ties per month, as well as       some ancillary products. The company's website also lists       another 500 to 600 bow ties, which come as pre-tied, clip-on       or ``freestyle,'' that is, DIY knots.        Basically, the styles fall into two categories, Smith said:       the subdued patterns for ``the conservative fellows'' and the       loud, bold and bright colors for the more flamboyant       dressers. On the day of Seven Days' visit, seamstresses were       sewing plenty of green Celtic themes (for St. Patrick's Day),       hearts (for Valentine's Day), and purple, green and gold       masks (for Mardi Gras). Mostly, the fabrics come from China,       Italy and the UK, Smith said.        It's worth noting that the ``Ltd'' in the company name       isn't an aesthetic flourish but reflects the time-sensitive       availability of its products.        ``Bill and Deb's concept was to be limited, so that people       come back,'' Smith explained. ``I have to have something       [new] to entice them to buy from me every month.''        Beau Ties continued to grow throughout the 2000s. By       September 2012, however, Kenerson, who was facing significant       health challenges, sold the company to its current owners:       David Kramer, who lives in New York State, and David Mutter,       in California. Though other buyers approached him, Smith       said, Kenerson insisted on finding people who would keep the       company in Vermont and run it the same way he and his wife       had.        ``This was Bill's baby,'' Smith added. ``Every single       person who worked here was completely valuable to him.'' As       she noted, Kenerson opened every piece of mail that came in       and usually answered customers himself. A mere two months       after the sale, the ``Beau'' of Beau Ties died at the age of       81.        Though one might assume that the typical Beau Ties customer       is a stodgy, Barry Goldwater-era conservative, Smith said       that members of the younger generation also want to fashion       one on.        Representative of the new demographic is 21-year-old Andrew       Brown of Bristol, who's been working at Beau Ties since he       was 17. His grandmother, Barb, works there, too. The younger       Brown, a dapper youth who sports a bow tie daily, is now the       company's social media manager.        ``The bow tie wearer is the musician. He's the architect.       He's the fella who works in a museum,'' Smith said. ``He's       the attorney and the judge. He's the young guy who wants to       wear something on `bow tie Friday.' He's the preppy kid who       wants something to wear to the yacht club.''        Doctors and other health care professionals tend to prefer       bow ties, too. Why? The short ties don't drape onto their       patients and spread germs, Smith explained. Pediatricians       like them because babies and toddlers can't grab them. In       fact, Burlington pediatrician Joe Hagan belongs to a       professional group of docs from around the country called the       Pediatric Travel Club, which gets its neckwear from Beau       Ties.        Tall, who names all the ties and writes the product       descriptions, said that, when Beau Ties first started, there       were maybe five other bow tie manufacturers in the United       States. Today, there are more than 50. To remain competitive,       she said, Beau Ties keeps its prices in the $45 to $49 range,       though some higher-end ties cost as much as $75.        Beau Ties is unique in another respect, Smith added: It       accepts old neckties from customers who want them converted       into bow ties. Such ``one-off'' special orders are yet       another way to maintain customer loyalty.        ``Some guys will send in a hundred of them,'' Smith added.       ``We make an awful lot of custom ties here.''        Like other industries, Beau Ties enjoys great benefits and       faces challenges from being in the Green Mountain State. Its       location far from its customer base increases the cost of       shipping. For years, the company printed its catalogs on the       East Coast until, as Tall put it, distribution costs became       ``exquisitely painful.''        At the same time, Tall noted, ``Vermont always has a       certain cachet, and we certainly play that up in every letter       we write.''        ``The core of this place is the manufacturing,'' Smith       added. ``I don't mean to sound schmaltzy, but I'm the one who       goes out into the world to sell this stuff, and I'm always so       proud. I never have a product that I don't think is amazing.       And how fortunate am I? I get to see it get made every day.''    (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________
