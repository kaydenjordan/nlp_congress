 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, Democrats continue to negotiate with each  other on their reckless tax-and-spending spree. Democrats are currently  working to lower the bill's top-line number in an effort to meet some  of the demands of the few moderate Democrats who have reservations  about unchecked government spending.   Now, you might think that lowering the top-line number would involve  deciding what programs and spending to eliminate to bring the bill in  at a lower cost. Well, not exactly. Yes, Democrats are reportedly  eliminating some spending, but the word is that, under pressure from  progressives, who are dead set against curtailing their plans for  expanding government, Democrats are planning to keep a lot of their  most expensive proposals, but simply shorten the funding window to make  the costs of these programs seem lower.   Take Democrats' fantastically expensive child allowance. Democrats  have every intention of turning their child allowance into a permanent  government welfare program, but in order to bring the top-line number  of their spending bill down, the word is that Democrats are now  planning to officially extend the allowance for just 1 year.   This is, in fact, a budget gimmick on top of a budget gimmick, as  Democrats were already attempting to disguise the true cost of the  child allowance by officially extending it for just 4 of the 10 years  in the bill's 10-year budget window.   They were never, of course, planning to eliminate the child allowance  after 4 years, and they are certainly not planning to eliminate it now  after 1 year, but by officially extending it for just a year in their  tax-and-spending spree, they can manage to make the program look as if  it will cost hundreds of billions of dollars less than it will actually  cost.   And they are apparently repeating this strategy with a number of  their other spending measures.   That paid leave program? Apparently, the White House has proposed a  smaller version that would supposedly expire after 3 or 4 years.   Those childcare subsidies? Apparently, those may also now,  ostensibly, expire.   The ObamaCare subsidies Democrats want to extend permanently? Well,  once again, it sounds like they are going to try shrinking the apparent  cost with a short-term extension.   But, again, let's be very clear here. These short-term extensions and  short-term programs are nothing more than a budget gimmick to disguise  the true cost of the Democrats' plan. There isn't one program that I  have named that Democrats don't fully intend to make permanent.   Don't believe me? Just ask the Congressional Progressive Caucus,  which outlined the strategy the Democrats are currently adopting in a  letter to Speaker Pelosi.   I quote from that letter:         If given a choice between legislating narrowly or broadly--    the caucus wrote--       --we strongly encourage you to choose the latter, and make       robust investments over a shorter window . . . This will help       make the case for our party's ability to govern, and       establish a track record of success that will pave the way       for a long-term extension of benefits.    So the plan is to make these programs permanent and to permanently  and massively expand the size of government. Democrats hope to get  Americans hooked on the government benefits they are offering while  hiding the true costs of those benefits from the American people until  it is too late.   Frankly, it is not a bad strategy if your aim is to permanently  expand the size of government because the truth is it is pretty hard to  eradicate even the most inefficient and ineffective Federal program  once it has been put into place.   As Ronald Reagan used to say, the nearest thing to eternal life that  we will ever see on this earth is a government program.   That, of course, is what the Democrats are counting on. They believe  that, once they put these programs in place, no one from either party  will be able to get rid of them.   What is less clear is how Democrats believe these programs are going  to be funded in the long term, if, in fact, they have given any thought  to that issue at all. I wouldn't be surprised if they haven't.   It is important to note that the short-term programs and program  extensions in the Democrats' tax-and-spending spree will be paid for by  10 years of taxes. That is right. It will take 10 years of taxes and  other revenue-raising measures to pay for programs that are scheduled  to last as little as 1 year.   So what happens when Democrats want to extend that child allowance  again next year or extend those childcare subsidies for the long term?   Well, that is a really good question, and one for which I would love  to hear the Democrats' answer.   Are Democrats going to trot out more tax hikes to pay for extending  the child allowance or making the childcare subsidies permanent? Or are  they going to just suggest that we add hundreds of billions--and  eventually trillions--to our already dangerously large national debt?  And, if they opt for tax hikes, just who is going to be facing those  tax hikes?   The Democrats are eventually going to run out of money from  millionaires and billionaires, and then they are going to start coming  after the wallets of the middle class.   Of course, when I say that the programs in the Democrats' tax-and- spending spree will be paid for with 10 years of taxes, I mean that  Democrats are claiming--claiming--that those programs will be paid for,  because it is by no means clear that Democrats' tax hikes and revenue- raising measures will actually result in the revenue they are claiming.   Democrats, for example, are claiming that their proposal to increase  IRS enforcement measures, including a new requirement that would allow  the IRS to look into the details of Americans' spending, will allow  them to collect $700 billion in revenue; but the Congressional Budget  Office hasn't confirmed that estimate, and there is substantial reason  to doubt that Democrats will be able to collect anywhere even close to  that amount even with a doubling of the IRS's budget, a massive  expansion of a number of IRS employees, and a number of audits of  everyday Americans.   Even if Democrats do manage to rake in every dollar they are  claiming, the tax hikes and revenue raisers they are proposing would  have long-term costs beyond the dollar amount of the tax hikes.   More than one of the Democrats' tax proposals would have a chilling  effect on investment and economic growth, which would mean a less  vibrant economy with fewer jobs and opportunities for American workers,  and the IRS proposal I mentioned could put the details of Americans'  ordinary bank activities into the hands of the IRS, an agency that we  have seen repeatedly mishandle the taxpayer data it already has, as  recently as earlier this year.   Democrats may be able to come up with a smaller top-line number by  hiding the true costs of the government programs they are  contemplating, but their ``buy now and pay later or pay never''  approach to government spending is going to have serious consequences  for our economy and for the American people.   Unfortunately, by the time the full costs of Democrats' massive  government expansion are felt, it may be too late to do much about it;  and that, apparently, is what Democrats are counting on.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from South Dakota (Mr. Rounds).
