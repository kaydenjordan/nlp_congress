 Mr. Speaker, as the Congresswoman for Ohio's 13th  Congressional District, the birthplace of champions, I rise today to  congratulate Ohio's 13th District Champion of the Week, Ms. Taylor  Mikesell.   Taylor was selected by the Indiana Fever in this year's WNBA draft,  and she is the third Stark County player to be drafted by a WNBA team.   Taylor is an extremely talented shooting guard who honed her skills  at Jackson High School before playing at the University of Maryland and  the University of Oregon, and finally concluding her college career at  The Ohio State University.   She was a two-time All-Big 10 selection with the Buckeyes and ranked  among the top five in the Nation in 3-pointers made per game in both  seasons.   Taylor helped lead Ohio State to the Elite Eight for the first time  since 1993, hitting seven 3-pointers to match a career high, and scored  25 points in her final game.   As we have seen women's basketball continue to grow in popularity, I  am proud of Taylor's contribution to women's sports. Taylor's success  serves as an inspiration to young athletes who dream of pursuing a  career in professional sports, and she has paved the way for future  generations of young athletes to follow their dreams.   Once again, congratulations to Taylor Mikesell, the Ohio 13 Champion  of the Week. I am confident that she will continue to make our  community proud as she takes her talents to the national stage.                            ____________________
