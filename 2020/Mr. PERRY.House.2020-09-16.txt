 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona for  yielding.  [[Page H4483]]    Mr. Speaker, I am still sickened by the sight that I saw, that all of  us saw: two officers who showed up to work, an assassination attempt,  attempted execution, just for sitting in their car, for honoring their  pledge to preserve and protect the safety of the citizens they serve.   For the past month, law enforcement officers have endured attacks,  have been shot at, bottles thrown at, fireworks, glass bottles,  powerful lasers attempted to blind them.   This year, as my friend from Texas said, 43 law enforcement officers  have been killed, nearly twice the rate of last year.   And what is coming from the other side of the Chamber here? You got  it. Silence.   When elected leaders refuse to stand with our law enforcement  officers and continue to bend to the whims of violent mobs, we lose our  civilization. We lose our civil society.   Now, you think, when you watch TV maybe you see it on the news, it is  happening far away, thousands of miles away across our country. But  right in Pennsylvania where I live, south central Pennsylvania, just on  Monday, unfortunately, violent riots came to the streets on the heels  of the death of Ricardo Munoz, a mentally ill 27-year-old who was  captured on a police officer's body camera charging at the officer with  a knife in his hand.   Now, the death of Ricardo Munoz is a tragedy, no doubt, and my  prayers are with Mr. Munoz's family. However, an adult man wielding a  large carving knife over his head while charging at police--by the way,  having a record of doing this in the past, stabbing people--is a clear  mortal threat, and the officers are well within their rights to protect  themselves.   Let me be very clear. Every person in the United States of America  has the right to peacefully protest. Your constitutional right to  protest, however, does not include violent riots, setting fires to  things, looting, and harming and killing other people.   Now, this is an account from that protest which wasn't a protest:         The mob marched from the scene of the shooting on Laurel       Street to the police station, chucking glass bottles, rocks,       bricks, gallon jugs filled with liquid, and plastic road       barricades at the police. A county vehicle parked in front of       the station was damaged.        Numerous buildings and vehicles were damaged, fires were       set--all without regard for the owners and individuals who       could have been physically harmed by the riotous actions.    Mr. Speaker, anyone in this Chamber, any leader in our community who  does not stand up for civil society, for our police officers who take  an oath to protect their citizens, is supporting a dangerous and deadly  violent mob, and it absolutely must end.
