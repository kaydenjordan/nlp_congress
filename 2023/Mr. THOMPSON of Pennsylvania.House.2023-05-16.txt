 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  recognition of John A. Freeman, a 50-year member of the Tri-Town  Volunteer Fire Company in Ulysses, Pennsylvania.   The Tri-Town Volunteer Fire Company No. 47 is an all-volunteer fire  and ambulance department serving Ulysses Borough and the Potter County  townships of Allegheny, Bingham, Hector, and Ulysses. Since 1972, John  has volunteered with Tri-Town where he quickly established himself as  an important and reliable member of the company. As a truck captain and  driver, John has served as an integral part of countless emergency  responses throughout north central Pennsylvania.   As a longtime firefighter and EMS volunteer, I understand the  courage, commitment, and determination it takes to serve your community  as a first responder. First responders miss many important moments with  their loved ones to answer the call whenever and wherever it occurs.  Their service is even more critical in rural areas like Potter County,  where volunteer numbers are falling and placing a strain on those who  do answer the call.   For this reason, I commend John A. Freeman for his 50 years of  service to the Tri-Town Volunteer Fire Company and for the example he  sets for volunteers in Potter County and the Commonwealth of  Pennsylvania.                            ____________________
