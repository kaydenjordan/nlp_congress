 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the rule  and the underlying legislation.   The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, or Micah's Law, is of  utmost importance. Not only does the bill recognize the common humanity  and inherent rights that we share with the most vulnerable members of  our society, it offers our Nation an opportunity to prevent  excruciating pain for those same members, and it will stop a form of  violence that has gone on for too long. This bill is a step forward in  reversing a culture of violence and restoring a culture of life.   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that passage of this  legislation will save 2,750 children per year. That is 2,750 girls and  boys who will have a chance to contribute to our society.   If you want to facilitate a culture of life, vote for this bill. If  you want to begin to prevent violence in our country, vote for this  bill. I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation.
