 Mr. Speaker, America would not be the greatest Nation in  the world today without the valiant effort of our military personnel.   The reason we are the greatest country in the world is because we  have the strongest, most dedicated men and women on the frontlines  defending our freedoms.   Unfortunately, many soldiers come home with scars: some visible, some  not.   Today, I want to take the opportunity to recognize two veterans from  Virginia's Sixth District who started an organization called the Living  Waters Farm Initiative.   Travis Coyle and Mark Lambert returned home from the war in  Afghanistan and began experiencing symptoms of posttraumatic stress  disorder.   After receiving help through the Department of Veterans Affairs,  equine therapy, their faith, and realizing that sufferers from PTSD do  not have to bear this burden alone, Travis and Mark decided they would  like to provide similar support to other servicemembers.   The Living Waters Farm Initiative was started to provide those living  with PTSD a supportive community that can stand together and learn from  others with firsthand experience.   They already have horses and goats at Living Waters Farm and hope to  add a garden soon.   As PTSD Awareness Month begins, I want to thank Mr. Coyle and Mr.  Lambert for their service and dedication to other veterans.                            ____________________
