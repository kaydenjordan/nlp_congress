 Madam President, this resolution urges the inclusion of  the Federal Employee Paid Leave Act in the final conference agreement  on the NDAA. This resolution provides 12 weeks of paid family leave for  Federal employees in all situations already covered under the FMLA.   Too many of our Federal employees have to make the impossible choice  of getting a paycheck or looking after a sick child, caring for an  aging parent, or recovering from a health condition. As a result, many  have been forced to leave their jobs and obtain other employment.   Paid family leave is not only the right thing to do for Federal  workers, but it is the smart thing to do for our Federal workforce.  This is the most practical and fiscally responsible way to provide  family leave for Federal workers.   I yield the floor.
