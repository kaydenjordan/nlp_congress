 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the  Comprehensive Debt Collection Improvement Act, a partisan package of  bills which threatens to limit access to credit and other  financial products that Americans from all walks of life rely on.    Simply put, this legislation undermines the collections process, the  very system that ensures that Americans can access credit in the first  place.   Without a collections process, consumers' ability to obtain credit  cards or other forms of credit would be restricted, and, in many cases,  limited to a cash-only basis. If adopted, this bill will limit  Americans' options and weaken our standard of living, a standard that  every American deserves.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this misguided, partisan legislation  and instead support policies that expand financial inclusion,  strengthen our system of credit, and support businesses that fuel our  economy.
