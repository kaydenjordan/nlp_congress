 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4009) to authorize the Georgetown African American Historic  Landmark Project and Tour to establish a commemorative work in the  District of Columbia and its environs, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4009         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Enslaved Voyages Memorial       Act''.       SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION TO ESTABLISH COMMEMORATIVE WORK.         (a) In General.--The Georgetown African American Historic       Landmark Project and Tour may establish a commemorative work       on Federal land in the District of Columbia and its environs       to commemorate the enslaved individuals, whose identities may       be known or unknown, who endured the Middle Passage.        (b) Compliance With Standards for Commemorative Works.--The       establishment of the commemorative work under this section       shall be in accordance with chapter 89 of title 40, United       States Code (commonly known as the ``Commemorative Works       Act'').        (c) Prohibition on the Use of Federal Funds.--        (1) In general.--Federal funds may not be used to pay any       expense of the establishment of the commemorative work under       this section.        (2) Responsibility of the georgetown african american       historic landmark project and tour.--The Georgetown African       American Historic Landmark Project and Tour shall be solely       responsible for acceptance of contributions for, and payment       of the expenses of, the establishment of the commemorative       work under this section.        (d) Deposit of Excess Funds.--        (1) In general.--If upon payment of all expenses for the       establishment of the memorial (including the maintenance and       preservation amount required by section 8906(b)(1) of title       40, United States Code), there remains a balance of funds       received for the establishment of the commemorative work, the       Georgetown African American Historic Landmark Project and       Tour shall transmit the amount of the balance to the       Secretary of the Interior for deposit in the account provided       for in section 8906(b)(3) of title 40, United States Code.        (2) On expiration of authority.--If upon expiration of the       authority for the commemorative work under section 8903(e) of       title 40, United States Code, there remains a balance of       funds received for the establishment of the commemorative       work, the Georgetown African American Historic Landmark       Project and Tour shall transmit the amount of the balance to       a separate account with the National Park Foundation  [[Page H7932]]       for memorials, to be available to the Secretary of the       Interior or Administrator (as appropriate) following the       process provided in section 8906(b)(4) of title 40, United       States Code, for accounts established under section       8906(b)(2) or (3) of title 40, United States Code.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4009, the Enslaved  Voyages Memorial Act, introduced by my colleague, Representative  Eleanor Holmes Norton.   This bill will authorize the establishment of a memorial on Federal  land in the District of Columbia and its surroundings commemorating the  enslaved individuals who disembarked here after forced migration by way  of the transatlantic slave trade.   This memorial will honor the lives of all enslaved individuals,  celebrate their contributions to our history, and recognize their  remarkable resilience and fortitude throughout four centuries of  slavery.   During this time period, enslavers forced the transport of 12.5  million captive Africans to sell in the Americas. The Georgetown  waterfront has an extensive and long-neglected history of involvement  in the slave trade. In fact, 1,475 enslaved individuals disembarked at  the Georgetown waterfront while the institution of slavery grew on this  continent.   Establishing a memorial to honor those who were enslaved will create  a powerful site of truth-telling and remembrance.   I thank my colleague, Delegate Norton, for introducing this important  and significant piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton), who is the  principal sponsor of the legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill  [[Page H7933]]  (H.R. 6353) to authorize the National Service Animals Monument  Corporation to establish a commemorative work in the District of  Columbia and its environs, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6353         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``National Service Animals       Memorial Act''.       SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION TO ESTABLISH COMMEMORATIVE WORK.         (a) In General.--The National Service Animals Monument       Corporation (referred to in this section as the       ``Corporation'') may establish a commemorative work on       Federal land in the District of Columbia and its environs to       commemorate the heroic deeds and sacrifices of service       animals and handlers of service animals in the United States.        (b) Compliance With Standards for Commemorative Works.--The       establishment of the commemorative work under this section       shall be in accordance with chapter 89 of title 40, United       States Code (commonly known as the ``Commemorative Works       Act'').        (c) Prohibition on the Use of Federal Funds.--        (1) In general.--Federal funds may not be used to pay any       expense of the establishment of the commemorative work under       this section.        (2) Responsibility of the national service animals monument       corporation.--The Corporation shall be solely responsible for       the acceptance of contributions for, and the payment of the       expenses of, the establishment of the commemorative work       under this section.        (d) Deposit of Excess Funds.--        (1) In general.--If, upon payment of all expenses for the       establishment of the commemorative work under this section       (including the maintenance and preservation amount required       by section 8906(b)(1) of title 40, United States Code), there       remains a balance of funds received for the establishment of       the commemorative work, the Corporation shall transmit the       amount of the balance to the Secretary of the Interior for       deposit in the account provided for in section 8906(b)(3) of       title 40, United States Code.        (2) On expiration of authority.--If, upon expiration of the       authority for the commemorative work under section 8903(e) of       title 40, United States Code, there remains a balance of       funds received for the establishment of the commemorative       work under this section, the Corporation shall transmit the       amount of the balance to a separate account with the National       Park Foundation for memorials, to be available to the       Secretary of the Interior or the Administrator of General       Services, as appropriate, in accordance with the process       provided in section 8906(b)(4) of title 40, United States       Code, for accounts established under paragraph (2) or (3) of       section 8906(b) of such title.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration today.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6353, the National  Service Animals Memorial Act, introduced by my colleague,  Representative Susan Wild.   The bill would authorize the National Service Animals Monument  Corporation to establish commemorative work on Federal land in the  District of Columbia, and its surroundings, to commemorate the heroic  deeds and sacrifices of service animals--and handlers of service  animals--in the United States.   The bill recognizes the National Service Animals Monument  Corporation's mission to honor and recognize the broad scope of service  animals through a memorial to educate the public of the contributions  by service animals and of the human-animal bond between service animals  and their handlers.   The memorial will ensure that the contributions of service and  working animals are understood, and that their history is not  forgotten.   In doing so, the bill recognizes the lifesaving and life-sustaining  service these animals so generously provide to our communities.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Representative Wild, for  introducing this legislation and championing this bill on behalf of her  constituents.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for H.R. 6353, a ``yes'' vote, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6734) to amend the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956 to  reauthorize the volunteer services, community partnership, and refuge  education programs of the National Wildlife Refuge System, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6734         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Keep America's Refuges       Operational Act of 2022''.       SEC. 2. REAUTHORIZATION OF NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE SYSTEM                     VOLUNTEER SERVICES, COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP, AND                     REFUGE EDUCATION PROGRAMS.         Section 7(g) of the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956 (16       U.S.C. 742f) is amended by striking ``2018 through 2022'' and       inserting ``2023 through 2027''.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6734, the Keep America's  Refuges Operational Act, introduced by our colleague, Representative  Hakeem Jeffries.   This bill will reauthorize the volunteer services, community  partnerships, and refuge education programs of the National Wildlife  Refuge System.   The refuge system spreads itself across 568 national wildlife refuges  and protects nearly 837 million acres of land, water, and wetlands.  These important lands serve as homes for over an array of species,  including 700 birds, 220 mammals, 1,000 fish, and 250 reptile and  amphibian species.   Volunteers in the refuge system are crucial to keeping the refuges  running, encouraging millions of the tourists each year, and generating  billions of local revenue while creating jobs for neighboring  communities.   Reauthorizing these volunteer services allows the Fish and Wildlife  Service to continue providing transportation, uniforms, lodging,  awards, subsistence, and training for those who selflessly choose to  volunteer on these projects.   During the March hearing on the bill, we heard from Ms. Caroline  Brouwer of the National Wildlife Refuge Association, and Ms. Joan  Patterson from the Coalition of Refuge Friends and Advocates about the  outside role that volunteers and friend groups play in keeping refuges  running, as well as serving and connecting with the local community.   The Fish and Wildlife Service also testified in support of the  legislation. In June, the National Resources Committee reported the  bill to the House by unanimous consent.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the bill sponsor and my colleagues on  the committee for the bipartisan support for this legislation, and I  urge its adoption.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries).    Mr. Speaker, I congratulate all involved on a  significant partnership on this legislation that has brought benefits  historically to our park systems and refuge systems and will continue  to do so. Let me thank my friends across the aisle for their  bipartisanship on that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7618) to designate the Kol Israel Foundation Holocaust  Memorial in Bedford Heights, Ohio, as a national memorial.  [[Page H7935]]    The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7618         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF THE KOL ISRAEL FOUNDATION HOLOCAUST                     MEMORIAL AS A NATIONAL MEMORIAL.         (a) Congressional Recognition.--Congress--        (1) recognizes the significance of the Kol Israel       Foundation Holocaust Memorial in preserving the memory of the       6,000,000 Jews murdered by the Nazi regime and allies and       collaborators of the Nazi regime; and        (2) honors the life and legacy of the Holocaust survivors       who erected the Kol Israel Foundation Holocaust Memorial.        (b) Designation.--        (1) In general.--The Kol Israel Foundation Holocaust       Memorial located in Bedford Heights, Ohio, is designated as a       national memorial.        (2) Effect of designation.--        (A) In general.--The national memorial designated by       paragraph (1) is not a unit of the National Park System.        (B) Use of federal funds.-- The designation of the national       memorial by paragraph (1) shall not require or permit Federal       funds to be expended for any purpose related to the national       memorial.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 7618, introduced by my  colleague, Representative Shontel Brown.   This bill would designate the Kol Israel Foundation Holocaust  Memorial in Bedford Heights, Ohio, as a national memorial.   This bill recognizes the significance of the Kol Israel Foundation  Holocaust Memorial, which helps preserve the memory of the 6 million  Jews murdered by the Nazi regime and honors the life and legacy of the  Holocaust survivors who built this memorial.   Completed in 1961 by survivors of the Holocaust residing in northeast  Ohio, the Kol Israel Holocaust Memorial is likely the first and oldest  Holocaust memorial in the United States.   For more than 60 years, the Kol Israel Foundation has looked over the  memorial, which has the ashes of Jewish victims and other tokens of  remembrance buried at its base. The bill ensures national historic  recognition for the Kol Israel Holocaust Memorial and preserves the  memories and resiliency of the victims and the survivors of the  Holocaust.   I thank my colleague, Representative Shontel Brown, for introducing  this important legislation, for introducing this important  acknowledgment and memorial, and championing the bill to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Brown), the sponsor of the legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 2490) to establish the Blackwell School National Historic Site  in Marfa, Texas, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2490         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Blackwell School National       Historic Site Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds that--        (1) the Blackwell School, located at 501 South Abbott       Street, in Marfa, Presidio County, Texas, is--        (A) associated with the period of racial segregation in       Marfa public schools; and        (B) the only extant property directly associated with       Hispanic education in Marfa since the other buildings were       torn down after the Blackwell School closed in 1965;        (2) the Blackwell School is a tangible reminder of the       period during which the doctrine of ``separate but equal''       dominated education and social systems;        (3) despite being categorized as ``white'' by Texas law,       Mexican Americans were regularly excluded from commingling       with Anglo individuals at barbershops, restaurants, funeral       homes, theaters, churches, and schools;        (4) the spectrum of experiences of students and teachers at       the Blackwell School are an important record of life in a       segregated school in the context of the history of Texas and       the United States;        (5) Mexican and Mexican American culture and history in       Marfa is tied to the Blackwell School, which for more than 50       years served as a leading feature of the Hispanic community,       illustrating the challenge of maintaining cultural identity       in a dominant Anglo society;        (6) Hispanic influences continue to be seen in social and       religious organizations, business and government       institutions, and shared experiences of language, food, and       music in Marfa, Texas;        (7) the historic Blackwell School building is a physical       record of--        (A) the longevity and beauty of the distinctive design and       craftsmanship informed by traditional techniques and       materials; and        (B) the transition from the purely vernacular to the period       of materials, design, and workmanship made available after       the arrival of the railroad;        (8) the original historic school building and grounds on       which the Blackwell School building stands provide an       authentic setting to commemorate and interpret the history of       the Blackwell School;        (9) the Blackwell School is closely associated with the       broad patterns of local, State, and national history in the       area of school segregation; and        (10) Mexicans and other members of the Latin American       diaspora have placed a high value on education as a means of       economic, social, and political advancement, but Hispanics       and Latinos have not always had equitable opportunities and       access to quality educational facilities in the United       States.       SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Map.--The term ``map'' means the map entitled       ``Blackwell School National Historic Site Proposed       Boundary'', numbered 593/178387, and dated February 2022.        (2) National historic site.--The term ``National Historic       Site'' means the Blackwell School National Historic Site       established by section 4(a)(1).        (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of the Interior.       SEC. 4. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE BLACKWELL SCHOOL NATIONAL                     HISTORIC SITE.         (a) Establishment.--        (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), there is       established the Blackwell School National Historic Site in       the State of Texas as a unit of the National Park System to       preserve, protect, and interpret for the benefit of present       and future generations the Blackwell School, including--        (A) the role of the Blackwell School as an academic and       cultural cornerstone in Marfa, Texas; and        (B) the function of the Blackwell School within a       segregated system of education in Texas and the United States       from the period of 1885 through 1965.        (2) Determination by secretary.--The National Historic Site       shall not be established until the date on which the       Secretary determines that--        (A) a written agreement has been entered into by the       Secretary with the Marfa Unified School District providing       that the Blackwell School shall be donated to the United       States or co-managed with the Secretary for inclusion in a       national historic site to be managed consistently with the       purposes of a national historic site; and        (B) a sufficient quantity of land or an interest in land       within the boundaries of the National Historic Site has been       acquired to constitute a manageable unit.        (b) Map.--        (1) Boundaries.--The boundaries of the National Historic       Site shall be the boundaries generally depicted on the map.        (2) Availability of map.--The map shall be on file and       available for public inspection in the appropriate offices of       the National Park Service.        (c) Acquisition of Authority.--The Secretary may only       acquire any land or interest in land located within the       boundary of the National Historic Site by--        (1) donation;        (2) purchase with donated funds; or        (3) exchange.        (d) Administration.--        (1) In general.--The Secretary shall administer the       National Historic Site in accordance with--        (A) this Act; and        (B) the laws generally applicable to units of the National       Park System.        (2) Management plan.--        (A) In general.--Not later than 3 years after the date on       which funds are first made available to the Secretary to       prepare a general management plan for the National Historic       Site, the Secretary shall prepare a general management plan       for the National Historic Site in accordance with section       100502 of title 54, United States Code.        (B) Submission.--On completion of the general management       plan under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall submit to       the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate       and the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of       Representatives the general management plan prepared under       that subparagraph.        (e) Cooperative Agreements.--The Secretary shall enter into       cooperative agreements with the Blackwell School Alliance and       other local, regional, State, academic, and nonprofit       partners for interpretive and educational programming,       technical assistance, and rehabilitation relating to the       National Historic Site.        (f) Written Consent of Owner.--No private property or non-      Federal public property shall be included within the       boundaries of the National Historic Site or managed as part       of the National Historic Site without the written consent of       the owner of the property.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure that is before us under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2490, the Blackwell School  National Historic Site Act. This legislation, if the House will recall,  was sponsored primarily by Representative Tony Gonzales from Texas.   S. 2490 is a companion to that legislation from the Senate, from  Senator Cornyn, and this legislation directs the Secretary of the  Interior to establish the Blackwell School National Historic Site to  preserve, protect, and interpret the role of the Blackwell School as an  academic and cultural cornerstone in Marfa, Texas.   The Blackwell School was the sole public education institution for  Mexican-American children in Marfa from 1909 until 1965, when local  schools were finally integrated.  [[Page H7937]]    The building is a tangible reminder of a time in American history  where separate but equal remained prevalent in our culture. It is a  symbol of community solidarity, pride, and identity, and it remains to  this day.   Approximately 4,000 students attended the Blackwell School over the  course of more than 50 years. Despite the inherent unfairness of  segregation, the Blackwell School became a meeting place and a source  of pride for the local Mexican-American community in the region.   Today, all that remains of the once-sprawling campus is a three-room  adobe schoolhouse, one of the last such schools remaining in Texas.   Designating the Blackwell School as a national historic site ensures  that the story of the Blackwell School is maintained so that future  Americans can learn from and understand its rich, complex, and  troubling history.   Representative Tony Gonzales should be applauded for his efforts on  this.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me today in supporting the  bill and sending it to President Biden for his signature, and I reserve  the balance of my time.                                time  1800     Madam Speaker, I have no further requests for time on  this legislation. I am prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 820) to establish the New Philadelphia National Historical  Park in the State of Illinois as a unit of the National Park System,  and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the measure under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 820, the New Philadelphia  National Historic Site Act. New Philadelphia was the first town platted  and legally registered by an African American before the Civil War. It  is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, designated as a  National Historic Landmark, and included in the National Park Service's  National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom program.   This bill would further establish the New Philadelphia National  Historic Site in Pike County, Illinois.   Honoring the legacy of New Philadelphia and celebrating the history  of Black Americans is critically important. The protection and  conservation of New Philadelphia ensures that this important history is  preserved so that visitors to the site can have the opportunity to  learn from and understand an important part of Illinois and American  history.   The story of New Philadelphia is our story, and it rightly deserves a  place in our National Park System.   As chair of the Natural Resources Committee, I am committed to  advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion throughout our committee's  work, including by advancing the preservation of forgotten or under- told stories.   I thank my colleague, Representative LaHood, for introducing this  important legislation and championing the bill on behalf of, not only  of his constituents, but the overall interest of the American people.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further requests for time on  my side, and I am prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4358) to amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate  segments of the Little Manatee River as a component of the Wild and  Scenic Rivers System, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4358         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Little Manatee Wild and       Scenic River Act''.       SEC. 2. DESIGNATION FOR STUDY OF WILD AND SCENIC RIVER                     SEGMENTS, LITTLE MANATEE RIVER, FLORIDA.         Section 5(a) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16 U.S.C.       1276(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(__) Little manatee river, florida.--The approximately       50-mile segment beginning at the source in southeastern       Hillsborough County, Florida, downstream to the point at       which the river enters Tampa Bay, including appropriate       tributaries, but shall not include--        ``(A) those portions lying within Manatee County, Florida,       and being more particularly described as Parcel ID 247800059,       Parcel ID 248200008 and Parcel ID 248100000; and        ``(B) South Fork.''.       SEC. 3. STUDY AND REPORT.         Section 5(b) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16 U.S.C.       1276(b)) is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(__) Little manatee river, florida.--Not later than 3       years after the date on which funds are made available to       carry out this paragraph, the Secretary of the Interior       shall--        ``(A) complete the study of the Little Manatee River,       Florida named in subsection (a)(_); and        ``(B) submit to the Committee on Natural Resources of the       House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and       Natural Resources of the Senate a report that describes the       results of the study.''.       SEC. 4. EFFECT ON MANAGEMENT.         This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall not       interfere with the current management of the area of the       Little Manatee River described in section 5(a)(_) of the Wild       and Scenic Rivers Act, nor shall the fact that such area is       listed for study under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16       U.S.C. 1271 et seq.) be used as justification for more       restrictive management until Congress acts on the study       recommendations.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the item under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4358, the Little Manatee  Wild and Scenic River Act, offered by our colleague from Florida,  Representative Buchanan.   The bill will formally designate an approximately 51-mile segment of  the Little Manatee River in Florida as a national scenic river.   Beginning at its source in southeastern Hillsborough County, the  Little Manatee River flows downstream into Tampa Bay.   The river is one of the most pristine blackwater rivers in Southwest  Florida and is designated as an outstanding Florida water.                                time  1815    Like all other wild and scenic rivers throughout the country, this  bill will protect the river for public enjoyment without the fear of  intrusive development.   The bill ensures the river remains available for full a range of  recreational activities, such as canoeing, kayaking, boating, and  fishing.   Designating the Little Manatee River as a Scenic River will ensure  that it continues to be enjoyed by future generations of Floridians and  visitors of all stripes.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from  Alabama, and I yield back the balance of my time.
