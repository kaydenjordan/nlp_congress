 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 1383 and ask  that it be reported by number.    I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes of debate equally  divided.    Mr. President, in February, I met with the President of  the United States along with nine of my colleagues. The objective here  was to find middle ground on a targeted COVID relief package focused on  vaccine distribution and getting Americans back to work and back to  school as quickly as possible. Instead, we have been offered a bloated  and wasteful spending bill, only 10 percent of which actually goes  toward COVID-related needs.   Meanwhile, the COVID-19 crisis has exacerbated America's drug  epidemic with synthetic opioids being the primary driver of the 38- percent annual increase in overdose deaths.   We know illegal narcotics are coming through our southern border at  ports of  [[Page S1243]]  entry. My unobjectionable amendment simply increases funding for  Customs and Border Protection by $300 million for technology to detect  fentanyl and other drugs of lower purity levels.   This funding is more than offset by reducing funding from a provision  granting 600 hours of paid leave to Federal employees--600 hours. That  is 15 weeks of paid leave. So if an employee took every day of this  paid leave in this bloated spending bill starting today, that would be  by June 18. Oh, by the way, we are supposed to all be vaccinated by the  end of May, according to the President.    I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds to respond.    Only in Washington, DC, and in the greater Washington, DC,  area does it make sense to offer paid leave in a $1.9 trillion spending  bill at 5:15 a.m. in the morning to last until after a pandemic is  projected to be over. How wasteful could we be with our constituent  spending?   Vote for my amendment.
