 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the service of Jason Maree of Northern Cambria, Pennsylvania.   Mr. Maree had his Pass in Review for the United States Navy, an  important step in passing basic training and becoming a sailor.   To his family and those who know him well, Jason is a driven and  dedicated person. When he graduated from Northern Cambria High School  this spring, he knew military service was the best avenue for his life.   Coming from a family where his mother is retired from the Army, and  his grandfather served in the Marine Corps, Jason naturally felt a call  to serve after high school.   Prior to serving in the United States Navy, Jason was an active  member of his community and served on the Northern Cambria Volunteer  Recreation Board.   We are thankful, both as a community, and as a Nation, for Jason  Maree and for all those who are serving in our military.   Congratulations on becoming a sailor in the United States Navy,  Jason.                          Congratulating Amy Shields     Madam Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate Amy Shields of the Allegheny Hardwood Utilization Group,  or AHUG, on being named to the Pennsylvania top 100 in agriculture  list.   The hardwood forest products industry represents a major part of  Pennsylvania's economy. Pennsylvania's Allegheny Plateau region alone  produces 80 percent of the cherry hardwood supply of the entire world.   This is a critical ingredient for producing furniture and home goods  for customers at home and abroad. This industry is fortunate to have  their interests represented by Amy Shields, who is the current  Executive Director of AHUG and the voice of the timber industry in  Pennsylvania.   Ms. Shields is a longtime veteran of the timber industry and has been  a tireless advocate for business across 14 counties in Northern  Pennsylvania.   Because of her efforts, loggers, sawmills, and hardwood manufacturers  can continue to provide the highest-quality forest products to the  world.   Congratulations, Amy, on this great accomplishment.            Congratulating the Pennsylvania 4-H Dairy Judging Team     Madam Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate the Pennsylvania 4-H Dairy Judging Team on their top  honors at the 100th National 4-H Dairy Cattle Judging Contest at the  World Dairy Expo.   In October, the Pennsylvania team traveled to Madison, Wisconsin, to  compete in the dairy cattle judging contest. The Pennsylvania team was  made up of four members, with Ellie Curtis of Warren County  representing the Pennsylvania 15th Congressional District.   Their hard work paid off. Ellie Curtis placed fourth overall with the  Ayrshires. As a team, Pennsylvania was first for overall placing for  Jerseys. They ranked second in oral reasons, Brown Swiss and Guernseys,  third for Ayrshires, and fifth for Holsteins.   As a result of their victory, the team has qualified to represent the  United States this summer at the International Dairy Judging Contest in  Glasgow, Scotland.   Congratulations to Ellie and the entire Pennsylvania 4-H Dairy  Judging Team.           Congratulating the Indiana County Conservation District     Madam Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate the Indiana County Conservation District on their 75th  anniversary celebration.   Since 1947, the Indiana County Conservation District, or ICCD, has  been protecting the natural resources of Indiana County and working to  improve  [[Page H8547]]  the quality of life for current and future generations.   The ICCD and its dedicated employees and volunteers use education,  technical assistance, and partnerships with local businesses to work  toward a prosperous sustainable future.   Today, the ICCD implements a wide variety of projects dealing with  agricultural land preservation, environmental education, and wildlife  management. All these efforts have helped to teach the importance of  conservation to residents of all ages in Indiana County.   The ICCD formally celebrated their 75th anniversary on October 7 with  an open house at their headquarters in Indiana, Pennsylvania.   Madam Speaker, please join me in congratulating the Indiana County  Conservation District on 75 years of protecting the environment and  ensuring that Indiana County continues to be a great place to live.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize November as National Career Development Month.   As co-chair of the bipartisan House Career and Technical Education  Caucus, I was proud to introduce the National Career Development Month  resolution last week with my CTE Caucus co-chair and good friend,  Congressman  Jim Langevin.   National Career Development Month raises awareness of future career  opportunities and development programs for all individuals. A highly  skilled workforce is a business's number one asset and provides a  competitive edge.   National Career Development Month also is a time to recognize the  professionals who guide learners to become leaders of tomorrow.   Throughout the month, schools and businesses will have the chance to  showcase different career paths that align with various interests and  skills. These opportunities will better prepare students as they begin  to enter the workforce.   As we continue through National Career Development Month, I encourage  employers, students, and workers of all ages to take advantage of  career development, putting them in the driver's seat of their careers.                            ____________________
