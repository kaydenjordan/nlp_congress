 Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Senator  Lamar Alexander, who is retiring from the United States Senate after 18  years in office. My friend, Senator Alexander, has led a strong career  representing Tennesseeans at the State and Federal levels.   Senator Alexander was Governor of Tennessee from 1979 to 1987. As  Governor, he revamped the economy by cutting regulations to attract new  businesses and jobs and reformed our public education curriculum.   Following two terms as Governor, Senator Alexander was president of  the University of Tennessee and served as Secretary of Education in  President George Herbert Walker Bush's administration. He returned to  elected office in 2002, winning Tennessee's open U.S. Senate seat.   In Congress, Senator Alexander demonstrated strong leadership and  legislated in the best interests of all Tennesseeans. Among his many  achievements are the SUPPORT Act, comprehensive legislation to fight  the opioid epidemic, and, as of late, the Great American Outdoors Act,  which will preserve the Smokies and other national parks for years to  come.   Senator Alexander and I are fond of the same quote from our friend  Alex Haley: ``Find the good and praise it.''   There is a lot of good in Lamar Alexander, and I thank him for his  many years of service.                            ____________________
