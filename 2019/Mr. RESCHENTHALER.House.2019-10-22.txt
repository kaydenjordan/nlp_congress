 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 724, the bipartisan Preventing  Animal Cruelty and Torture Act, or the PACT Act, introduced by  Representative Ted Deutch and Vern Buchanan.   In 2017, Pennsylvania passed Libre's Law, which increased penalties  for animal abuse. I was honored to help push that legislation over the  finish line in the Pennsylvania State Senate. I am proud to once again  help pass legislation that will better protect our Nation's animals.   In 2010, Congress passed the Animal Crush Video Prohibition Act to  address the trade in obscene videos of live animals being crushed,  burned, or subjected to other forms of heinous cruelty. While this was  an important first step, the law only bans the trade in video  depictions of cruelty, not the underlying act of cruelty itself.   The PACT Act addresses this gap by prohibiting the underlying acts of  animal cruelty that occur on Federal property or affect interstate  commerce, regardless of whether a video is produced.   As a former district judge, I served on the frontlines of our  judicial system. I witnessed firsthand the connection between animal  cruelty and violence toward people. In fact, the FBI recently  recognized that addressing animal cruelty is critical to protecting our  communities.   The PACT Act would give Federal law enforcement and prosecutors the  tools they need to combat extreme animal cruelty. This bill would give  the FBI the authority to act against animal cruelty that is discovered  while investigating another interstate crime, such as drug smuggling or  human trafficking.   The PACT Act would not interfere with enforcement of State laws  related to felony animal cruelty provisions. The legislation focuses  solely on extreme acts of animal cruelty and exempts normal agriculture  and hunting practices.   The PACT Act is endorsed by the National Sheriffs' Association, the  Fraternal Order of Police, and the Association of Prosecuting  Attorneys, as well as more than 100 law enforcement agencies.   And in the Senate, the PACT Act is sponsored by my good friend,  Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey, and it passed in both the 114th and  the 115th Congresses by unanimous consent. In the House, it currently  has more than 300 bipartisan cosponsors.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the PACT Act so we can  better protect our Nation's animals from abuse and torture. I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes''  on H.R. 724, the PACT Act, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1123, the Divisional  Realignment for the Eastern District of Arkansas Act of 2019,  introduced by my Republican colleague from Arkansas, Representative  Rick Crawford.   H.R. 1123 reduces the existing divisions in the Eastern District of  Arkansas from five to three, limiting the burden caused by two  courthouse closures. It allows the Eastern District of Arkansas to  better balance its caseload, account for geographical differences, and  align with the judicial work generated by correctional facilities.   H.R. 1123 is supported by the Judicial Conference, the Judicial  Council of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit,  the chief judge of the Eastern District of Arkansas, and all the  members of the Arkansas delegation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Arkansas (Mr. Crawford), my good friend and the sponsor of this  measure.                                time  1700     Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.   I would just like to say that, again, I urge my colleagues to vote  ``yes'' on H.R. 1123, the Divisional Realignment for the Eastern  District of Arkansas Act of 2019.   I yield back the balance of my time.
