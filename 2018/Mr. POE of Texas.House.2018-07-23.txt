 Mr. Speaker, last week I was joined in the House  gallery by five incredible young women. Each of them has their own  story of survival. Each was sexually assaulted while in college. They  call themselves the 12th Woman.   Mr. Speaker, one in five women will be sexually assaulted while in  college in the United States. Sexual assault is a crime that tries to  steal the dignity, self-respect, and humanity of the victim.   Mr. Speaker, the 12th Woman has something to say about that. They  came to Congress and publicly told their heartbreaking stories on the  steps of our Capitol, demanding change not only at their own school,  Texas A&M, but nationwide. These ladies are determined not only to be  survivors, but victors over their assault.   Mr. Speaker, my grandmother taught me that there is no stopping a  bold, tenacious, Texas woman who has made up her mind.   Abbie, Meghan, Sydney, Kirsten, and Nikki have made up their minds  with unwavering resolve that sexual assault on campus will stop.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
