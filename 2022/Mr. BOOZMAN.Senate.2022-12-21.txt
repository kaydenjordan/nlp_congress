 Madam President, I rise today with my friend and       colleague Senator Cotton to honor law enforcement officers and       recognize the service and heroism of Arkansans who vow to serve and       protect by pursuing a career in law enforcement. These individuals       selflessly volunteer for this duty while accepting that the dangers of       the job also continually put them in harm's way.        It takes a special person to take on that responsibility, and that       fact must never be lost on us. Today, I want to recognize several law       enforcement officers who recently made the ultimate sacrifice in the       line of duty.                                     Remembering Detective Paul Newell              Benton County Detective Paul Newell was escorting a convoy of       vehicles delivering materials for Wreaths Across America when he was       tragically killed in a motorcycle crash on Saturday, December 17.        As a 24-year veteran of the Benton County Sheriff's Office, Detective       Newell made a lasting impression on his colleagues, the community, and       everyone who knew him.        Those who served alongside him saw firsthand the impact of his       compassion and kindness on friends and strangers alike. These traits       served him well in more than two decades as a law enforcement officer.       He was happy to engage with community members to foster positive       relationships, participating in events like Shop with a Cop to spread       Christmas cheer to children in need.        He launched his career in law enforcement in 1998 and worked in many       jobs in the Benton County Sheriff's Office, including as patrol deputy,       patrol sergeant, and training sergeant. His commitment to ensuring that       others in the sheriff's office learned from his training and experience       was evident.        Detective Newell was also a motorcycle enthusiast. He rode with the       Harley Owners Group and shared that interest with kids in the community       by letting them sit on his motorcycle at local events.        As a veteran of the U.S. Army, he continued his mission to serve       others into civilian life and faithfully represented what it means to       be a true public servant.        I join all Arkansans as we mourn the death of this hero. Detective       Newell demonstrated what it means to protect and serve every day when       he put on his badge and uniform, and his final act was in honor of       others who served our country.        I ask my colleagues to lift up Detective Newell's family in prayer.       We are forever grateful for his selfless sacrifice.            [[Page S9737]]              I am honored to be here with my colleague from Arkansas, Senator       Cotton, to show our appreciation for fallen, but not forgotten, law       enforcement officials.         Madam President, I also want to recognize the service       and sacrifice of Stuttgart Police Department Sergeant Donald Scoby,       who, as we have heard, was deeply passionate about public service. For       4 years, he protected his community as an officer of the law.        Sergeant Scoby was fatally shot while attempting to apprehend a       suspect who fled a traffic stop last week and laid to rest last Monday.        Even before joining the police force, he demonstrated his willingness       to give back. In fact, helping others and meeting needs bigger than his       own have been a cornerstone of his life.        He served in the U.S. Army and deployed during the Iraq War, in       addition to being part of the peacekeeping group in Bosnia.        He also stepped up to the plate back home, working at the local fire       department, first as a volunteer before joining full time. His       colleagues at the fire department recall his friendly manner and       enthusiasm for helping others.        His positive attitude and determination were apparent to those he       served with or encountered. The Stuttgart mayor called Sergeant Scoby a       fierce advocate for the community, and others close to him fondly       remember his humor and selflessness, describing him as ``the type of       person who would give you the shirt off his back.''        It is clear that he meant a great deal to so many, and his legacy as       a giver and protector will serve to inspire countless others and       comfort his family, friends, and all of those impacted throughout his       life.        Sergeant Scoby's death is a tragic reminder of the risk law       enforcement officers face each day when they put on their uniform and       start their shift, knowing their duty to serve and protect could place       their safety and very lives in jeopardy.        Yet that is exactly the choice they make each day, just as Sergeant       Scoby did only a few short days ago. Tragically, but with valor and       resolve to uphold his oath, he made the ultimate sacrifice.        My thoughts and prayers are with his loved ones, including Amanda,       his wife of 16 years, his children, and colleagues at the Stuttgart       Police Department, as well as the citizens of this very close community       as they mourn the loss of a hero in Sergeant Donald Scoby.                                  Remembering Police Officer Vincent Parks              Madam President, finally, we join together to recognize the service       and sacrifice of Jonesboro Police Officer Vincent Parks.        ``Vinnie,'' as his family and friends called him, was one of those       brave Americans willing to answer the call and play an integral role in       the safety and security of his neighbors, friends, and even strangers.       He was just weeks into his law enforcement career, learning about how       to be a force for good and the responsibilities that come with wearing       a badge.        While continuing his police training at the Central Arkansas Law       Enforcement Training Academy at Camp Robinson in North Little Rock, his       life was tragically cut short. Though he did not survive the medical       episode he experienced, we know he was prepared to sacrifice his own       safety and well-being for the good of others.        We are blessed to have brave men and women like Patrolman Parks, who       are willing to wear the uniform and take the risk.        His death is not in vain, and his community has already demonstrated       an outpouring of support to show how grateful they are for his service.        Honoring his life is also a tribute to his family, whom we know were       the most important thing to him. He surrounded himself with the love of       his mother Jacquelyn, his wife Christina, and his daughter Vivianna--      his little girl whose dancing brought him endless joy and pride.        This son, husband, dad, friend, and colleague is gone too soon, but       he will            [[Page S9738]]            live in the hearts and memories of all those he impacted and who cared       for him.        Our thoughts and prayers remain with the Jonesboro community and       those who served alongside Officer Parks and all those who loved him.        May he rest in peace and may his example inspire and shape future       acts of service and sacrifice.        I yield the floor to Senator Cotton and thank him for his constant       efforts to champion our law enforcement community.
