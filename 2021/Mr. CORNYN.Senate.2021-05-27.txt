 Mr. President, I would like to thank our friend Senator  Cramer for telling us this story about this great American patriot.  Many of us are of that age where we are the children of members of the  ``greatest generation'' who have their own stories to tell. Just  listening to Senator Cramer talk about this great patriot who fought at  the Battle of the Bulge, one of the most horrific battles in World War  II and most consequential battles--that is really where they really  stopped Hitler, finally, toward the end of the war--it reminds me of  people like my dad who flew B-17s out of England during the last part  of the war. Their job was to knock out the Hitler war machine. But  there are so many great stories from that generation. These great World  War II patriots are getting older, and they are leaving us, but  certainly we will always remember them and their contributions. So I  appreciate the Senator from North Dakota sharing that with us.                                   S. 1260    Mr. President, the Senate is moving quickly, I hope, toward a vote on  a far-reaching proposal to confront threats from China. Based on  everything we know about the might and the ambitions of the Chinese  Communist Party, there is a clear and urgent need for us to take  action.   Every year, the U.S. intelligence community issues a threat  assessment report outlining the greatest challenges confronting our  country on the horizon. Topping the latest report, which was released  last month, is China's push for global power. The report outlines  China's efforts to strengthen its military power, diversify its nuclear  arsenal, and fine-tune its cyber espionage skills, which are already  quite considerable.   One major area that cannot be overlooked is China's industrial  policy. Through the CCP's Made in China 2025 initiative, it seeks to  achieve China's dominance in high-tech manufacturing. For everything  from electric cars to advanced robotics, to artificial  [[Page S3846]]  intelligence, to quantum computing, China wants to lead global  production, and they are throwing serious money into the effort to get  there. China is expected to spend $1.4 trillion by 2025, covering  investments in everything from 5G to artificial intelligence.   The 2021 threat assessment report raises alarm bells here too. It  says China will maintain these efforts because ``Chinese leaders see  this strategy as necessary to reduce dependence on foreign  technologies, enable military advances, and sustain economic growth and  thus ensure the CCP's survival.'' I view this as both an alarming  statement but really more as a call to action. If China is making these  kinds of investments to increase its independence and global presence,  we should be investing in our industrial base and our national security  here at home. The most important place to start, I believe, is with  semiconductor manufacturing.   The pandemic is hopefully soon to be in our rearview mirror as more  and more Americans, more and more people get vaccinated. One of the  most important lessons I believe we should have learned is the  vulnerability of our supply chains, everything from personal protective  equipment, most of which is made in China--and in the global race to  get the PPE we needed during the pandemic, China got a head start  because China manufactured it and we did not here at home.   So that opened up my eyes to the vulnerability of that supply chain,  but we can't stop there. We need to look at how heavily we rely on  other countries for semiconductors because nearly 90 percent of the  semiconductors in the world are made in Southeast Asia, with Taiwan  dominating the market. In fact, one company, Taiwan Semiconductor  Manufacturing Company, accounted for more than one-half of total  foundry revenues last year. Companies in Taiwan control 63 percent of  the advanced semiconductor manufacturing in the world.   Now, if you are like me, before I got involved in this issue, I  didn't really know very much about semiconductors, so I asked my staff  to explain to me the significance of this vulnerability. They said:  Well, Senator, think of it this way: Everything with an off and on  switch involves semiconductors.   Well, that helped me quite a bit. Then I asked them to research  something for me. I said: You see those rockets that are raining down  on Israel from Hamas? Some of those interceptors are made by Raytheon,  an American-based defense contractor. Ask them how many semiconductors  are in a single interceptor.   They did the research, and they reported back--750 semiconductors in  a single interceptor.   So these semiconductors or microelectronics are everywhere,  everywhere--in the phones we carry, in the planes that our Air Force,  Navy, and Marines are flying, the fifth-generation stealth fighter, the  F-35. Semiconductors are everywhere. Given China's ambitions, it is  easy to imagine how they might be tempted to interfere with the supply  chain and our dependence on Asian-produced semiconductors. If China  were to block or even invade Taiwan, we would be literally helpless.   Back in 1980, Jimmy Carter gave a speech in which he laid down what  came to be known as the Carter Doctrine. This was 2 years after the  Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. He wanted to send a message to the  world that they should not mess with U.S. access to the oil that came  through the Strait of Hormuz in the Middle East.   So he laid down the Carter doctrine. He said: Anybody who interferes  with our access to the oil that we need to power our armed services and  our economy, that would be an act of war. Well, I don't think it is an  exaggeration to say if another country were to block our access to  semiconductors, it could well rise to the same sort of act of war that  Jimmy Carter warned about in 1980. In other words, semiconductors have  become the new oil in terms of our dependency, and it is a dangerous  dependency we must correct.   This is precisely why the senior Senator from Virginia and I, Senator  Warner, introduced the CHIPS for America Act. It is crucial that we  shore up our dependence on chips manufactured overseas and we shore up  our domestic production.   The vast majority of our colleagues have agreed that this is a  critical task. It was carefully crafted after monthslong bipartisan,  bicameral negotiations. Recently, we had a meeting at the White House,  and President Biden agreed with us that this was a critical imperative.  This is literally a bipartisan, bicameral agreement with the executive  branch and legislative branch that this is something we need to fix.   Last fall, when we took up the National Defense Authorization Act, we  introduced an amendment that authorized what we now hope to be able to  pay for, which is an amendment to the Defense Authorization Act, which  passed 96 to 4. Now we need to fund the program, and there is just one  issue standing in the way.   During committee consideration of the Endless Frontier Act, an  amendment was adopted that would apply controversial Davis-Bacon  language to the underlying CHIPS for America provision signed into law  last year. This provision creates, I believe, an unnecessary  distraction from our focus, which should be on defeating this  vulnerability in the supply chain.   The fact is, current wages of U.S. semiconductor manufacturing  companies don't need Davis-Bacon. They pay much better than the  prevailing wage Davis-Bacon would require. So it is really a nonissue  when it comes to semiconductor manufacturing.   But what is more significant--and I think the reason why some of our  Democratic friends are insisting on this inclusion--is it represents an  expansion over labor policies by applying it to private construction as  opposed to public works. Obviously, this would set a troublesome  precedent.   Leaving this language in the bill, I do believe, has the potential to  weaken the support for the broader legislation. And I hope we can all  agree that the stakes are too high to risk letting that happen.   Last week, I introduced an amendment to strike this unnecessary and  divisive provision and maintain strong bipartisan support for the  underlying CHIPS for America legislation. A partisan provision with  zero impact is hardly a reason to sacrifice the strong bipartisan  support we have seen for the CHIPS Act.   Republicans and Democrats have worked very closely together and, I  think, really in an encouraging and responsible way to bolster domestic  manufacturing of semiconductors and confront one of the biggest looming  threats to our national security and our economic security. Now is not  the time to backpedal on the progress we have made.   I expect the Senate will vote on my amendment later this evening. I  encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this  amendment so we can maintain the strong bipartisan support we have  demonstrated so far for this critical, critical legislation.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I call up my amendment 1858 and ask that  it be reported by number.    Mr. President, last year Senator Warner, the senior  Senator from Virginia, and I introduced the CHIPS for America Act to  help shore up vulnerable supply chains for semiconductors and to reduce  our reliance on other countries for the most critical components of  everything from the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter to the cell phones in our  pockets and everything in between.   The vast majority of our colleagues have agreed that this is a  critical task. It was carefully crafted after monthslong bipartisan,  bicameral negotiations. In fact, this legislation was adopted as an  amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act by a vote of 96 to  4 at the end of last year. But now we need to fund the program we  created, and there is just one issue standing in the way.   During committee consideration of the Endless Frontier Act, an  amendment was adopted that would apply controversial and unprecedented  prevailing wage language to the CHIPS for America Act signed into law  last year. This provision creates a needless hurdle to funding for the  CHIPS provision.   Considering the current wages of U.S. semiconductor manufacturing  companies, there is zero benefit--zero benefit--to workers' wages. So  this is really a nonissue in terms of the compensation that workers in  semiconductor manufacturing facilities will make. What is more, these  Davis-Bacon provisions represent an expansion of special interest labor  policy to private construction projects and set a disturbing precedent.   Leaving this language in the bill is a gratuitous act and could  dramatically weaken support for the broader legislation, and I would  hope we could all agree that the stakes are simply too high to let that  happen. So I have introduced an amendment to strike this unnecessary  and divisive language and maintain strong bipartisan support for this  program. A partisan provision with zero benefit to workers' wages is  hardly a reason to gamble with strong support for the CHIPS Act.   Republicans and Democrats have worked hard together to bolster our  domestic semiconductor manufacturing and to confront one of the most  dangerous, looming threats from China. Now is not the time to sacrifice  the progress we have made. So I would encourage my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to support this amendment so we can maintain the  strong bipartisan support for this critical legislation and send a  message to our adversaries that the United States intends to stay the  world's preeminent economic and military power.
