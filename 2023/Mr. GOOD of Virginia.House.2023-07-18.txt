 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  extraordinary athleticism and achievement of Albemarle County swimmer  Thomas Heilman.   On June 26, the 16-year-old Heilman claimed his spot in the world  swimming championships after earning the silver medal in both the men's  100-meter butterfly and the 200-meter butterfly races.   Heilman broke a longstanding record for his age group when he  finished the 200-meter butterfly just 22 milliseconds behind the winner  of the race, a swimmer 5 years older than him.   By finishing the race in 1 minute, 54 seconds, and 54 milliseconds,  Thomas Heilman broke the 15-16 National Age Group 200-meter butterfly  record which Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps had held for 22  years.   Heilman's coach, Gary Taylor, of Cavalier Aquatics in  Charlottesville, said Thomas is very coachable, has a tremendous work  ethic, strives to be his best self, and is the consummate teammate.   Thomas has certainly made Albemarle County and the rest of Virginia's  Fifth District proud of his accomplishments. I am honored to represent  this extraordinary young man in Congress, and I wish him success in his  already outstanding athletics career.                   Democrats Made the NDAA a Cultural Issue     Mr. Speaker, I thank the Republican leadership  and the House majority for passing what was an outstanding NDAA, our  National Defense Authorization Act, last week, that focuses on the  priorities of force readiness, effectiveness in lethality, and ensuring  that America has the strongest military machine on the planet. It  focuses on Republican priorities that the American people voted us, the  majority, to implement.   The strong NDAA is reversing the policies of the previous majority  and the Biden administration that were so harmful to our military. I am  going to remind everyone that it was the Democrats, the former  majority, that made the NDAA, the defense bill, a cultural issue, an  ideological issue, with their policies. It was the Democrats who put  abortion funding into the military bill. It was Democrats wanting to  pay for transgender surgery and the Democrats who focused on DEI and  CRT ideology in our military. It was the Democrats who said the purpose  of the military was to fight the climate war and put a climate focus on  our military funding. It was the Democrats who were discharging members  of the military for not getting a vaccine they didn't want and didn't  need.   This new NDAA that was passed last week with the Republican majority  and sent on to the Senate simply reverses the harmful policies that  have been hurting recruitment and reducing the effectiveness of our  military. This now goes on to the Senate, and I hope the Senate will  pass this Republican House bill to make our military stronger and make  our Nation safer.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I support the legislation today  that will allow the Department of Education to withhold Federal funding  from schools that house illegal aliens at public school facilities.   This bill focuses on schools, but the issue here is only a symptom of  a much larger problem, a blatant disrespect for the Federal immigration  laws by this President and the Democratic Party at large.   It is no coincidence that cities like New York and Chicago have  announced plans to shelter hundreds of immigrants in school gyms and  college dorms. These sanctuary cities are breaking the law by refusing  to enforce Federal immigration policy.   These cities blatantly defy the law of the land and then beg the  Federal Government for money when they can't handle the consequences  that come with their participation in unchecked illegal immigration.   Americans have been suffering under this pattern of lawlessness for  years, and it is time for it to stop. President Biden has violated his  Article IV, Section 4 constitutional duty to protect the States from  invasion, and now it is our American schoolchildren who are paying the  price.   I think the mother of a kindergartner and a second grader at a New  York school said it best: ``Why would I bring my child to a school  where there [are] grown adult men in their gym? You won't let a  stranger come into the school with no ID, but you will let them live in  your school gym?''   Our schools should not be left vulnerable to the lawless immigration  policies pushed by Democrats. This legislation provides the incentive  for mayors and Governors to protect our children instead of encouraging  Biden's border invasion policies that are harming Americans.   The Biden border crisis impacts every part of our Nation: our  national security, our health security, our education system, our  welfare system, and now, even more so, our children in our public  schools.   When is enough enough? What is the endgame of these Democratic  policies?   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to stand against the Biden  administration's disastrous policies that harm our schoolchildren and  support passage of this bill.
