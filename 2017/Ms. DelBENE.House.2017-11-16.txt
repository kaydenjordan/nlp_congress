 Mr. Speaker, in this Ryan-McConnell tax bill,  Republicans are touting the largest set of corporate tax cuts in our  country's history. They are raving that their corporate cuts will  create jobs, even though we know that trickle-down economics has never  worked and never will.   Instead of bringing Democrats and the public into the process,  Republicans have made the most cynical tradeoffs, only hurting people  who need help the most.   This is wrong. Tax reform should be about coming together and making  choices that reflect our values.   Yet, under this plan, teachers, who buy supplies for their students,  like pens, pencils, and paper, will lose the ability to deduct those  costs from their tax returns, but corporations still can deduct supply  costs.   Firefighters will no longer be able to deduct their State and local  income or sales taxes, but corporations still can.   Homeowners will no longer be able to deduct all of their property  taxes, but corporations still can.   And if workers have to move because their employer is forcing them to  relocate their families or lose their jobs, they will no longer be able  to deduct their moving expenses, but corporations, even those  offshoring jobs, still can.   This bill increases taxes on 36 million working families and rips  away key lifelines that help people struggling with long-term illness,  childcare, and education expenses. It blows a $1.5 trillion hole in the  deficit and burdens our children and grandchildren with debt,  triggering an automatic $25 billion cut to Medicare. This bill gives  massive permanent tax cuts to corporations,  [[Page H9394]]  but working families will have to live with the temporary scraps thrown  at them.   Bottom line: this bill hurts Americans from cradle to retirement, and  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
