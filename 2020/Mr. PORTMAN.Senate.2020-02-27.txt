 Mr. President, I would like to start this morning by  talking about a friend of ours who has chosen to move on and leave the  Senate and spend more time with her wonderful family. I certainly  understand that because the job she has, which is Secretary for the  Majority, is more than a full-time job; it is living, breathing,  sleeping this place, and she does a great job at it.   Her name is Laura Dove. She has been doing this particular job for 7  years. Prior to that, she actually was here on three different  occasions, as I understand it, working for the Senate. She grew up with  it. Her dad was the Parliamentarian here for 36 years.   Laura is a consummate professional. I work with her a lot on  legislation. She helps me to get things through the process here, which  is not always easy, but as significant, she works very closely with her  counterpart on the Democratic side of the aisle and figures out how to  get stuff done, how to keep this place operating so that the world's  greatest deliberative body, as they call the U.S. Senate, can meet its  great potential and expectation.   So, to Laura Dove, we are going to miss you. As much as we understand  why you need some time with your family right now and your great, great  kids, we are going to miss you a lot.
