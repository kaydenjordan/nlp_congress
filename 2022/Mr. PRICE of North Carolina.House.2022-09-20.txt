 Mr. Speaker, I am happy to rise in  support of S. 1098, the Joint Consolidation Loan Separation Act.   I am the author of the House version of this bill and have introduced  it every Congress since the 115th, always with a Republican cosponsor.   I would like to start my remarks today by thanking the Members, past  and present, who have helped bring us to the floor today.   I thank our former colleague Bradley Byrne of Alabama for his  cosponsorship of the first iteration of this bill. I thank  Congresswoman Haley Stevens and other current bipartisan cosponsors;  Senators Mark Warner, Marco Rubio, and John Cornyn, who recently  steered this bill to passage in the Senate; and my colleague from North  Carolina, Senator Richard Burr, who expedited the review of this bill  by his committee.   This bill passed the Senate by unanimous consent on June 15 of this  year.   I also thank my good friend Chairman  Bobby Scott and his staff. They  have vetted this bill and worked over this bill very carefully. He is  an outstanding leader of the committee, and he has been a longstanding  supporter of this bill. He included it, in fact, in various versions of  the Higher Education Act.   I also thank the staff, entrepreneurial staff, who picked up on this  problem from casework years ago and devised a legislative solution.  That would be Kate Roetzer and Nora Blalock of my staff initially,  Janssen White and Elizabeth Adkins more recently, and other personal  and committee staff, House and Senate.   Thanks, too, to the advocates, people affected by this problem, who  have come to our offices and our town meetings and relentlessly  advocated for relief. A number of these advocates are our guests in the  gallery today.   The Joint Consolidation Loan Separation Act, or JCL for short, is  simple in its intent but significant in its impact on thousands of  student loan borrowers who have waited for relief for far too long.   From 1993 to 2006, the U.S. Department of Education issued joint  consolidation loans to married couples where both borrowers agreed at  the time to be jointly liable for repayment. As you might expect, this  proved problematic if that couple ever needed or wanted to separate the  loans.   Congress wisely eliminated this program in 2006 but with one critical  oversight: Congress did not provide a means of severing the existing  loans, even in the event of domestic abuse, economic abuse, or an  unresponsive partner. There was, in other words, no grandfather clause.   As a result, there are borrowers nationwide who remain financially  liable for their absconded or abusive or uncommunicative spouse's  portion of their consolidated debt with no legal options for relief.   The bill before us would allow such borrowers to submit an  application to the Department of Education to split the joint  consolidated loan into two separate Federal direct loans. The joint  loan remainder would be split proportionately based on the percentage  that each borrower originally brought into the loan.   It was an unfortunate mistake not to grandfather in the severing of  these loans with the 2006 cancellation of the program, so this bill is  a long overdue, commonsense correction. Congress does occasionally make  mistakes; in case we hadn't noticed.   Let me just illustrate to you what the solution means for the lives  of borrowers.   I first became aware of this issue in 2014, 8 years ago, through  constituent casework. My constituent consolidated his $25,000 loan with  his ex-wife's $75,000 loan. After their divorce, the Department  continued to collect on the combined loan from both parties, even  though my constituent had paid off his portion of the loan. That is  just one of the many examples that cover the spectrum of unpleasant  situations with this shared debt.   Let's assume that one partner attended community college and the  other an expensive private school, and their loan amounts are vastly  different. When they consolidated their loans, they both agreed to be  jointly liable for repayment. But say the partner who attended private  school became unresponsive and stopped paying into the loan. That left  the partner who attended community college saddled with their total  debt, along with the partner's private school education cost.                                time  1445    We have also heard horror stories of couples who have survived  abusive relationships but continue to remain tied to their partners  through the loan. Former partners have exerted financial abuse by  refusing to copay with their exes. In other instances, individuals are  unable to get in contact with the copartner of their loan and are  similarly left to shoulder the debt all by themselves.   These borrowers have seen their wages garnished and their credit  scores ruined to the point where they cannot assist their own children  in taking care of Federal student loans. This has become a generational  impact.   These loan holders are often in punishing situations with no hope in  sight for action to fix this mistake unless we pass the bill before us  today.   This bill has been thoroughly vetted by the Department of Education,  the House Committee on Education and Labor, and numerous checkpoints in  the Senate. It passed by unanimous consent in the Senate a few short  months ago. We have made accommodations all along the way, including  Republican changes that I did not prefer, for the sake of getting the  bill to the floor in both Chambers. With tomorrow's vote, it will go  directly to the President's desk.   This is a bipartisan, bicameral piece of legislation. I believe it is  the end product of a fair process that has withstood the rigors of  legislative scrutiny. As far as legislative impact goes, this one is  simple but profound in its impact on borrowers.   The Joint Consolidation Loan Separation Act presents a rare  opportunity for Congress to right a wrong, to correct an omission in  its own legislative process. I urge that we do so. The bill offers a  fair and equitable relief to borrowers who have suffered great  hardship, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
