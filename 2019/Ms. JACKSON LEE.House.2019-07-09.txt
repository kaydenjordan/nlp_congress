 Mr. Speaker, I have known the men and women who have  served in the Department of Homeland Security and have dealt with the  border for many, many years. I have respected the work that they have  done. It is tragic, however, that as we continue to serve under this  administration, we now find the Department of Homeland Security in a  major cover-up: the unaccompanied children who have been separated from  their families, the disallowances of Members to visit and do their  oversight work to see the conditions, and the rejection of the  Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General who wrote  a direct memo to the secretary that said there is an urgent crisis that  you must deal with at the border, and for this secretary to go on  national television and deny it.   You can applaud the men and women who work, but you cannot applaud  bad acts. You cannot applaud what is happening in Mexico, which I just  came back from. The migrants who are there are not being taken care of.  They are in desperate need. Some of them will  [[Page H5291]]  not have a place to live, some of them will not have food, and it is  because of the policies of this administration.   The Department of Homeland Security must serve the Nation, it must  not serve one single President. I maintain that we are going to fight  to fix this broken immigration system.                            ____________________
