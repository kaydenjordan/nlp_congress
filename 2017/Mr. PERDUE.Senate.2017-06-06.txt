 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                              The Budget Process     Mr. President, we have 50 workdays in the Senate before  the end of this fiscal year--50 days. That does not include the 5 weeks  we will be gone during the August State work weeks. I rise tonight to  talk about what happens September 30. September is the end of the  fiscal year. That means we have to have the Federal Government funded  for fiscal year 2018, which starts October 1 of this year.   Like most years--as a matter of fact, like every year since 1980--the  Federal Government will probably not be funded by the end of this  fiscal year in the manner it was supposed to be, according to the law  that was done in 1974, the Budget Act of 1974. In the last 43 years,  the Federal Government has only been funded four times, according to  that bill. We have used 178 continuing resolutions, and therefore  ongoing omnibuses and so forth, where six people get in a room,  basically decide how we are going to spend $1 trillion.   This is the only enterprise I can find anywhere in the world that  funds its operations this way. The problem is, we have a system that is  absolutely totally broken. It is a fraud that is being perpetrated on  the American people. We have been asked, between now and September 30-- this is the way the budget process works. By the way, we should have  started this back in January, but we couldn't do it because we were  working on the fiscal year 2017 budget to do reconciliation so we could  work on healthcare.   Now we are going to, when that gets done, do a budget for 2018. We  will do a reconciliation and hopefully do a tax package behind that,  but wrapped up in all of that, here comes September 30 and 50 workdays  from today to fund the Federal Government. Between now and then, in 50  days, we are asked to do a budget for fiscal year 2018, to do full  authorizations for 16 different entities, committees, and then do  appropriations for 12 committees.   By the way, over the last 43 years, you have to fund 12  appropriations bills to fund the Federal Government. It was 13  appropriations bills up until around 2000. Since then, it has been 12,  but of those 12, the average number of appropriations bills this body  has appropriated each year is 2\1/2\.   Now, by any measure, that is unacceptable, but we are now asked,  between now and September 30, in a very truncated manner, to do the  budget, do all 16 authorizations and all 12 appropriations. Now, I am  not a betting man, but I will go to Vegas and short that idea right  now. There is no way we are going to fund this government according to  that policy--no way. It will not happen. It can't happen. It has not  happened in 43 years that way except four times.   Every single year this process breaks down. Like I said, we have used  178 continuing resolutions. What does a CR do? It ties the hands of our  military leaders, where they can't move money from one bucket to the  other to help accommodate it. So what we have right now is a process  that just has not worked. Yet, because of that, the Federal Government  has exploded in size.   In 2000, the Federal Government spent $2.4 trillion running the  Federal Government. Last year, we spent $3.9 trillion. Those are  constant 2016 dollars. Over the next 10 years, we are going to spend  $53 trillion running the Federal Government. We are going to borrow a  significant part of that--another $10 trillion.   The irony is, the debate we are having between now and September 30  is to fund the government, not on the full $4 trillion we are going to  spend next year running the Federal Government, we are going to have  this debate on only about $1.1 trillion, the discretionary side of the  budget.   If you do the math, in the last 8 years and, oh, by the way, in the  next 10 years, according to the current CBO baseline budget, we borrow  over 30 percent of what we spend as a Federal Government. Well,  discretionary spending over the next 10 years is going to be less than  that. So what that means is, over the last 8 years and over the next 10  years, every dime we have spent on discretionary spending has, by  definition, been borrowed.   There is no other way to look at it. That means that every dime we  have spent for our military, which is about $600 billion today, every  dime we spend on our VA, which is a little less than $200 billion, and  every dime we spend on all other domestic expenditures, including  healthcare, by the way, comes to $1.1 trillion. Every dime of that  today is borrowed money. That means we have to go to China and the rest  of the world to fund all of our discretionary spending.   Now, by anybody's estimate--conservative, liberal, whatever--that is  not acceptable. Here is why it is not acceptable: It cannot be  sustained over a long period of time. Yet we are sitting here with a  budget today that goes for the next 10 years that says we are going to  continue operating business as usual and add another $10 trillion to  this already burdensome debt of $20 trillion.   The debt crisis and the budget problem are interlinked. There is no  way that we can solve the debt crisis unless and until we solve the  budget process. The difficulty comes in trying to align the prospects  within the process itself of getting to a determination.   Right now, the budget process doesn't work for this very reason: The  budget itself is not a law. It is a resolution, which means the  majority party can cram down the throat of the minority its version of  a political budget. That is all it is.   Then you go to an authorization process, and, in the authorization  process today, we have over $310 billion of Federal expenditures that  are not authorized, including the State Department. Last year, we  didn't even do an authorization for our military. Even then, after  passing the appropriations bill in the Armed Services Committee 30 to  0, we could not get that bill on the floor of the Senate. We tried six  times. So it was not authorized or appropriated last year, but it got  wrapped up in an omnibus, and that same thing will more than likely  happen this year.   This can be fixed. It is not that difficult. Several of us have been  working behind the scenes, looking at other best practices around the  world--other countries, companies, and even States. We have looked at  best practices. What we found was that nobody else tries to fund their  government or their enterprise the way we try to fund the Federal  Government. This goes back to article I and article II of our  Constitution.   Article I says that funding the Federal Government is the  responsibility of Congress. Yet we have absconded with that. The 1921  act that created the Office of Management and Budget went well beyond  what I think is called for in the original Constitution. So what we are  looking at today is a legislative underreach and an executive overreach  relative to funding government, out of necessity because of the  dysfunction right here in the Senate relative to how we fund our  government. There is no question that we will not fund this government  without a continuing resolution and/or an omnibus come September 30.   The fix is not that unreasonable. All we need is a politically  neutral platform that brings all expenses into the budget process--all  $4 trillion today. That would include discretionary and mandatory and  that the budget become a law, which means that we have to get  bipartisan support for the budget.   Then, lastly, if we don't get the budget done by a certain date and  we don't fund the government by the end of the fiscal year, then,  severe consequences are borne by the people who have the responsibility  to fund the government, and that is the Senate, the House of  Representatives, and the people in the administration who are  responsible for their part of it.   It is not that complicated. Many other countries do it. Most other  countries do it. In fact, in some countries, if  [[Page S3278]]  they don't fund the government by the end of their fiscal year, their  constitutions actually say that the government gets disbanded and they  have an election. Well, that is not what I am calling for here. I don't  think we have to do anything that severe.   There are colleagues of mine right here in this body, on both sides,  who have contributed--Senators Whitehouse, Enzi, Corker, Lankford,  Tillis, Ernst, Rounds, Sullivan, Daines, and others--and who are  weighing in on this. Governors, who have executive experience running  large financial enterprises at the State level, have come into this  body and bring enormous wealth of experience about how to get this  done.   My argument is that right now, during this period of dysfunctionality  when we see firsthand the reality of not being able to take care of  domestic needs, military needs, or any other discretionary enterprises  that we want to fund because of our own budgeting intransigence, I can  find no other time better than what we have right now to raise the  question on both sides of the aisle. This is not a partisan  conversation. Both sides are guilty, but let's come up with a  politically neutral platform that would allow both sides, during the  budget process, to talk about tax increases, tax expenditures, spending  cuts, all the spending that we have, and all the responsibility we have  in the Federal Government or in the Congress of funding the Federal  Government. Why not?   We have one suggestion that says: Pick a time in the future. Decide  what percentage of your GDP should be covered by debt--no more than  that--and have a limit on that, and then pick a roadmap back from that  point in time to today with guardrails around that. That suggestion  comes from the other side of the aisle, and I applaud that suggestion  and I think it is very workable. I think we can find ways to make all  of this work. This should not be a partisan conversation.   I sit on the Armed Services Committee, and I sat on Foreign Relations  the last 2 years. Both of those committees are really very strong  bipartisan efforts by every Member.   That is what is needed here, and yet the Budget Committee,  ironically, is one of the most partisan committees. The reason it is so  is because of the law itself, because the budget is not a law. It is a  resolution. My contention is that this is the root of this problem. It  is one of the causative factors that cause this debt to be  uncontrollable and to cause a dysfunction in this body from even being  able to attempt to bring that under control.   The solution is not just taxing more. It is not just spending more.  It is not just growing more. The problem is much bigger than that. The  debt problem will never be solved unless and until we solve this  budgeting process.   As we close in on the next 50 days, as we check off every single day,  I want my colleagues in here to be reminded of what we are going to  have to do to fund the government come October 1. Please, let's not get  right up to September 30 with a gun to our head that says: Either do it  this way, spend this money this way, or do not fund the government  tomorrow. That is total irresponsibility, just like I believe this  budget process is a fraud perpetrated by Washington on the people of  America and it is not honest relative to what we have to face up to in  terms of our responsibilities.   We cannot afford to do all that we are doing. That is just pure fact.  The world is no longer going to be able to loan us the money that we  need over the next 10 years--another $10 trillion. There is some $200  trillion of total debt in the world. Only $60 trillion of the $200  trillion is sovereign debt, and we have one-third of that sovereign  debt today. Now, most other countries have curtailed their borrowing.  We are one of the few that continue to just race along this path of  borrowing money at this breakneck pace and adding another $10 trillion.  We could, potentially, have over half of the world's sovereign debt in  the next 10 years. That cannot happen. The world bond risk and the bond  markets will not, potentially, allow that to happen.   So today is the day. As we go through the next 50 days, I believe we  need to look for opportunities on both sides of the aisle to find a  bipartisan way to stop this nonsense and to get to where we can fund  the government in a responsible way each year, not just 1 year, and to  get away from the past 43 years of total failure in terms of funding  the Federal Government, such that when we get to September 30 of each  year, we have already approved the budget and we have the  appropriations lined up and funded for the needs that we have all  agreed here in Congress need to be met.   I can think of no other call on this body higher than this right now  because it puts us at risk of doing the very things that we need to do;  that is, to take care of our domestic needs, to take care of the people  who need the safety net, to take care of these legacy programs of  Social Security and Medicare, and yet defend our country. Because of  this debt, we are limiting the opportunities that we have, and we will  not solve that until we address this budget process.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Paul).
