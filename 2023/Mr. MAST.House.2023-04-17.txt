(2) Trusted telecommunications equipment or service.--The       term ``trusted telecommunications equipment or service''       means any telecommunications equipment or service that is not       a covered telecommunications equipment or service.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1149, Countering Untrusted  Telecommunications Abroad Act.   The Chinese Communist Party, as we all know, weaponizes every tool at  its disposal, whether it is intellectual  [[Page H1734]]  property, a balloon, or a social media app. That is why it is no  surprise that CCP-controlled companies like Huawei pose risks to our  national security and why it is important that we do not allow  ourselves or our allies or partners to be duped by the seemingly low- cost, state-backed telecom companies like Huawei.   It might seem cheap, but the fact is the cost is much higher than  many realize. You pay by allowing the CCP to control all of your  telecommunications data, which, as history has shown, it can and will  use against you. China has made no bones about that.   What does this bill do? It requires, number one, the State Department  to conduct a risk assessment and report to Congress on the presence of  any untrusted telecommunications equipment or vendors like Huawei in  the networks of defense-allied countries.   Number two, it requires the Government Accountability Office to  report on Chinese and Russian telecom suppliers serving U.S. embassies  overseas.   Number three, finally, the bill tasks the State Department with  identifying telecom infrastructure projects that would strengthen U.S.  national security.   Three worthy goals.   The United States has to be a leader on this front. We need to help  our allies and our partners end their dependence on problematic  companies like Huawei that are in the pocket of our adversaries. It  makes no sense whatsoever.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Wild) for  her leadership on this issue and for working together on this important  bill, which deserves our unanimous support, in my opinion.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                 Committee on Financial Services,                                     Washington, DC, March 14, 2023.      Hon. Michael McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul: Thank you for consulting with the       Committee on Financial Services regarding H.R. 1149, the       Countering Untrusted Telecommunications Abroad Act. I agree       that the Committee shall be discharged from further       consideration of the bill so that it may proceed       expeditiously to the House Floor. The Committee takes this       action with the mutual understanding that, by foregoing       consideration of H.R. 1149 at this time, we do not waive any       jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or       similar legislation, and that the Committee will be       appropriately consulted and involved on this or similar       legislation as it moves forward. The Committee also reserves       the right to see appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees to any conference with the Senate involving this or       similar legislation, and we request your support for any such       request.        Finally, as you mentioned in your letter, I ask that a copy       of our exchange of letters on this bill be included in your       Committee's report to accompany the legislation, as well as       in the Congressional Record during floor consideration       thereof.            Sincerely,                                                Patrick McHenry,                                                           Chairman,      Committee on Financial Services.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                     Washington, DC, March 14, 2023.      Hon. Patrick McHenry,      Chairman, Committee on Financial Services,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McHenry: Thank you for consulting with the       Foreign Affairs Committee and agreeing to be discharged from       further consideration of H.R. 1149, Countering Untrusted       Telecommunications Abroad Act, so that the measure may       proceed expeditiously to the House floor. The suspension text       incorporates edits you have requested to portions of the bill       within your committee's jurisdiction.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this measure or similar legislation in the future. I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees from your committee to any House-Senate       conference on this legislation.        I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 1149 into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration. I appreciate       your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward       to continuing to work together as this measure moves through       the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1715     Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, telecommunications and the secure transfer of electronic  data are absolutely critical. I don't think I have met somebody that  disagrees with that in today's world. They are critical to our national  security and to our economic well-being.   We don't want to get on a website that we think is unsecure. We don't  want to reply to a text that we think comes from an untrusted number.   We cannot afford the vulnerability that comes from giving control of  this technology to the Chinese Communist Party or other malign actors.   H.R. 1149 will help us get a handle on those vulnerabilities, forcing  the Department of State to formulate an effective response.   Again, I thank Ms. Wild for introducing this measure. I urge  unanimous support for this bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 1151) to hold the People's Republic of China accountable for the  violation of United States airspace and sovereignty with its high- altitude surveillance balloon, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1151         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Upholding Sovereignty of       Airspace Act'' or the ``USA Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) According to the Department of State, surveillance       balloons owned and operated by the People's Republic of China       (PRC) have entered United States airspace multiple times       since 2017 and have violated the airspace of more than 40       countries across 5 continents.        (2) On February 10, 2023, the Department of Commerce,       Bureau of Industry and Security issued a final rule (88 Fed.       Reg. 9389) that added 6 PRC entities to the Entity List for       supporting the PRC's military modernization efforts related       to aerospace programs, including airships and balloons and       related materials and components, that are used by the       People's Liberation Army for intelligence and reconnaissance.        (3) The PRC's response has been to use misinformation and       propaganda to deflect blame for the illegal surveillance       activities of these balloons.       SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.          It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the presence of the PRC's high altitude surveillance       balloon over United States airspace was an unacceptable       violation of United States sovereignty;        (2) the United States should continue to neutralize foreign       aerial surveillance assets that are in United States airspace       after consideration of civilian aviation safety, safety of       United States civilians and property on the ground, as well       as the intelligence collection risk and opportunity posed by       such intrusions;        (3) the PRC's global balloon surveillance program blatantly       undermines countries' sovereignty and poses a threat to       countries around the world;        (4) the PRC should cease efforts to spread misinformation       and propaganda about its intelligence-collection efforts;        (5) the United States Government should continue to share       information about the PRC's global surveillance efforts with       allies and partners and should work jointly to hold the PRC       accountable for its illegal surveillance actions, including       at multilateral fora;        (6) the United Nations should condemn the PRC's violation,       through its global surveillance balloon program, of the       sovereignty of member states of the United Nations and call       on the PRC to ensure its balloons do not violate sovereign       airspace again;        (7) the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)       should condemn the PRC for this violation of airspace and the       PRC's ICAO commitments; and        (8) as consistent with international law, the United States       should use regulatory and enforcement tools to protect       national security and sovereignty by identifying and       disrupting the PRC's use of surveillance balloons.       SEC. 4. INTERNATIONAL COORDINATION AND PRESSURE.         (a) Diplomatic Strategy.--The Secretary of State, in       consultation with the Director of National Intelligence and       the United States Permanent Representative to the United       Nations, shall develop a diplomatic strategy to inform allies       and partners of the scope of the PRC surveillance program and       build global consensus in order to address the PRC's global       surveillance balloon program, including by--        (1) using the voice of the United States at the       International Civil Aviation Organization to support Taiwan's       participation in the events and meetings of that       Organization;        (2) sharing intelligence, as appropriate about the PRC's       global balloon program and its past violation of the       sovereign airspace of allies and partners;        (3) coordinating with United States allies and partners to       identify and track future PRC surveillance balloons, counter       PRC propaganda and misinformation about its global       surveillance program, and publicly share any future       violations of sovereignty;        (4) using the voice, vote, and influence of the United       States at the United Nations and other international and       regional organizations to spur greater diplomatic pressure on       the PRC to halt its surveillance collection operations that       violate international sovereignty;        (5) raising the challenges posed by the PRC's global       surveillance balloon program at major multilateral forums,       including at the G7 and G20 summits; and        (6) coordinating with allies and partners on the imposition       and implementation of substantially similar sanctions and       export controls to ensure that commodities, software, or       technology from the United States and its allies and partners       are not supporting the PRC's global surveillance efforts.        (b) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State, in       consultation with the Director of National Intelligence and       the United States Permanent Representative to the United       Nations, shall submit to the appropriate congressional       committees a report that outlines the strategy developed       pursuant to subsection (a) and describes in detail the       various steps taken by the United States in line with said       strategy.

(d) Appropriate Congressional Committees.--In this section,       the term ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--        (1) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Permanent       Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of       Representatives; and        (2) the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Select       Committee on Intelligence of the Senate.       SEC. 5. IMPOSITION OF EXPORT CONTROLS.         (a) In General.--The Secretary of Commerce shall evaluate,       for appropriate controls under the Export Administration       Regulations, the export, reexport, and in-country transfer of       the items and technologies subject to United States       jurisdiction related to aerospace programs, including       airships and balloons and related materials and components,       that are used by the People's Liberation Army for       intelligence and reconnaissance, and not later than 180 days       after the enactment of this Act submit a report to the       appropriate congressional committees that includes--        (1) a description of the types of items and technologies       that were evaluated for potential controls with respect to       this section; and        (2) a list of the controls that BIS has implemented or       plans to implement because of its evaluation under this       section.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I have a feeling that while there is going to be  agreement, myself and the comments of my colleague over there might be  slightly different, but I rise in support of H.R. 1151, the Upholding  Sovereignty of Airspace or USA Act.   It is an important piece of legislation because of what has happened  to the United States of America and to Americans.   In early February, I think everybody watched this on the news for  days on end. Our Nation found itself in what we thought was an  impossible situation.   Looking up into the sky, Americans saw a strange object floating  overhead. Some wondered if it was a bird or a plane. Some wondered if  it was a UFO from some distant planet.   It was none of those things. It was a high-tech balloon sent by the  Chinese Communist Party to spy on the United States of America and all  of our people.   It floated slowly across North America in the full width of the  continental United States from Alaska to the South Carolina coast.   In States across the country, Americans saw the balloon, but what was  more concerning was what the balloon saw.   It conducted surveillance, it conducted reconnaissance, and it came  away with intelligence on the United States of America that we did not  want China to have.   Now, while the Biden administration sat on its hands, this balloon,  minute after minute after minute, gained valuable information on some  of our most sensitive military sites.   We now know that the United States had been tracking the balloon  since at least January 28, that being the day that it entered U.S.  airspace, but very likely before that. The administration hasn't  disclosed exactly what date it began tracking the balloon.   Yet, the Biden administration didn't act. They didn't shoot it down,  that is to say, until 7 days later, until it had crossed the entire  breadth of the United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, China is determined to topple the United States of  America. Xi Jinping will stop at nothing to achieve that goal.   We have known this for years, but in February, we saw the proof with  our own eyes. This is not an abstract concern. We can literally watch  it invade the American homeland.   Congress needs to step up and send a clear message to the Chinese  Communist Party. It will not be allowed to violate our sovereignty, to  use American technology for its own military purposes, or to spy on  American citizens.   This shouldn't be an argument anywhere in the United States of  America. This bipartisan legislation is an important step in sending  that message and denying the CCP those abilities.   This bill does three important things. It sanctions Chinese Communist  Party officials who were involved in the spy balloon program.   It requires the Secretary of State to develop a strategy to confront  the People's Republic of China's global surveillance activities.   It requires the Commerce Department to consider export controls for  U.S. technologies that are being used by the People's Liberation Army  for intelligence and reconnaissance purposes.   Under no circumstances should Americans know that the Chinese  Communist Party is spying on them across the breadth of our country and  know that their government is not doing anything to respond to that.   It degrades the trust that Americans have in their government, in  their safety, in their defense institutions, in their intelligence  agencies. That can't be what America knows about its government.   This has been bipartisan legislation. I thank the ranking member of  the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Meeks, for introducing the bill.  [[Page H1737]]    Along with Chairman   Michael McCaul, I encourage my colleagues to  join me in supporting this bill and in curbing the CCP's malign  influence in the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Armed Services,                                     Washington, DC, April 17, 2023.      Hon. Michael T. McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul: It has come to our attention that       H.R. 1151, the ``Upholding Sovereignty of Airspace Act,'' was       substantially modified following its consideration in your       Committee to include language within the jurisdiction of the       House Armed Services Committee.        In the spirit of comity and expeditious consideration of       this legislation, we will not formally consider H.R. 1151. We       do so with the understanding that by waiving consideration of       the bill, the Committee on Armed Services does not waive any       future jurisdictional claims over the subject matters       contained in the bill which fall within the Armed Services       Committee's Rule X jurisdiction or create any precedent for       future accommodation.        Please place a copy of this letter and your response       acknowledging our jurisdictional interests into the       Congressional Record. Thank you for the cooperative spirit in       which you have worked regarding this matter and others       between our respective Committees.            Sincerely,                                                    Mike D. Rogers,      Chairman, House Armed Services Committee.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                     Washington, DC, April 17, 2023.      Hon. Mike Rogers,      Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Rogers: Thank you for agreeing to forgo       pursuing a sequential referral of H.R. 1151, the ``Upholding       Sovereignty of Airspace Act,'' so that the measure may       proceed expeditiously to the House floor. I understand there       are concerns that certain reporting requirements in this text       may be duplicative of preexisting reporting obligations that       the Department of Defense is regularly fulfilling, and am not       averse to those concerns being addressed as the bill moves       forward in the legislative process.        I agree that your forgoing action on this measure does not       in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of your       committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives on       this measure or similar legislation in the future. I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees from your committee to any House-Senate       conference on this legislation.        I will seek to place this letter into the Congressional       Record during floor consideration. I appreciate your       cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward to       continuing to work together as this measure moves through the       legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                     Washington, DC, March 24, 2023.      Hon. Michael McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul: I write regarding H.R. 1151, the       ``Upholding Sovereignty of Airspace Act.'' Provisions of this       bill fall within the Judiciary Committee's Rule X       jurisdiction, and I appreciate that you consulted with us on       those provisions. The Judiciary Committee agrees that it       shall be discharged from further consideration of the bill so       that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor.        The Committee takes this action with the understanding that       forgoing further consideration of this measure does not in       any way alter the Committee's jurisdiction or waive any       future jurisdictional claim over these provisions or their       subject matter. We also reserve the right to seek appointment       of an appropriate number of conferees in the event of a       conference with the Senate involving this measure or similar       legislation.        I ask that you please insert this letter in the       Congressional Record during consideration of H.R. 1151 on the       House floor. I appreciate the cooperative manner in which our       committees have worked on this matter, and I look forward to       working collaboratively in the future on matters of shared       jurisdiction. Thank you for your attention to this matter.            Sincerely,                                                        Jim Jordan,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                     Washington, DC, March 24, 2023.      Hon. Jim Jordan      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Jordan: Thank you for consulting with the       Foreign Affairs Committee and agreeing to be discharged from       further consideration of H.R. 1151, the ``Upholding       Sovereignty of Airspace Act,'' so that the measure may       proceed expeditiously to the House floor.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this measure or similar legislation in the future. I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees from your committee to any House-Senate       conference on this legislation.        I will seek to place our letters on this bill into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration. I appreciate       your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward       to continuing to work together as this measure moves through       the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1151 is an important step in addressing very real  threats posed by the Chinese Communist Party.   I again thank Ranking Member Meeks and Chairman McCaul for this bill  which earned bipartisan support in the Foreign Affairs Committee, and I  believe it deserves our unanimous support.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 240) condemning recent actions taken by the Russian  military to down a United States Air Force drone, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 240         Whereas United States European Command released footage       confirming that 2 Russian Su-27 fighter jets acted       unprofessionally and in a reckless manner when intercepting       and downing a U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drone on March 14, 2023;        Whereas a United States Air Force drone was acting safely       and responsibly in international airspace and in accordance       with international law; and        Whereas the 2 fighter jets released fuel and bumped into       the drone, resulting in the drone crash-landing in the Black       Sea: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) condemns the reckless actions of the Russian military;       and        (2) reaffirms the United States will not be deterred from       operating U.S. drones in international airspace in the Black       Sea region due to Russia's reckless behavior.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 240 to condemn Russia's  blatantly hostile actions last month downing a United States Air Force  drone, downing one of our United States military aircraft.   Think about the seriousness of that.   On March 14, while flying in international airspace over the Black  Sea, a U.S. Air Force Reaper drone was attacked by two Russian fighter  jets. Yes, it was attacked. The two jets flew in front of it, and at  one point, even dumped fuel onto the drone. Eventually, one of the  Russian jets hit the drone's propeller and sent it crashing into the  Black Sea.   Let's talk about what this really was.   Was this an American aircraft?   Yes, it was.   Was this an American aircraft flying in international airspace?   Yes, it was.   Was this an American aircraft flying in international airspace that  was taken down as a result of Russian pilots' purposeful actions?   Yes, it was.   There is no version of the world in which this can be deemed  acceptable. Unless that's in Joe Biden's world, apparently.   Let's compare and contrast the response of the Kremlin to the  response of the White House on this attack.   Vladimir Putin rewarded the two fighter pilots with medals for a job  well done. Think about that.   President Biden ordered altered flight patterns to avoid future  conflicts with Russia.   That is the difference between the two responses.   We are having a lot of conversations about America being violated by  foreign adversaries, the last bill and now this one.   The Kremlin sent a clear message about what took place, that this  type of behavior, they deemed it commendable. They have pinned medals  on the chests of their fighter pilots. They rewarded them.   The White House sent a clear signal that they are going to be bullied  and they are going to be backing away. They responded with weakness and  compromised our intelligence operations by moving us further from what  we wanted to observe, when we were just debating a bill about China  surveying us over our own territory with their balloon.   These are the differences in what is going on in the world right now.   By altering flight patterns and sending drones in the Black Sea  further to the south, the Biden administration has degraded our ability  to collect intelligence on Russian forces in the region. To put it  simply, Putin lashed out, and very unfortunately, Biden backed down,  and now America is less safe.   Vladimir Putin does not get a veto over U.S. operations of military  operations in international airspace or sovereign Ukrainian airspace.  Yet, President Biden seems determined to give him one.   This is just the next domino to fall, in my opinion.   How would the President respond if China took similar action against  our aircraft in the South China Sea or in Taiwan?   President Biden is telegraphing to our adversaries that the U.S. will  back down in the face of the slightest provocation. He is giving  Vladimir Putin the validation that he needs: that he can simply  threaten escalation in order to intimidate others into backing down. He  draws no red lines.   This resolution condemns Russia's attack. It reaffirms that the U.S.  will not be intimidated--something that we have to reaffirm in this  body given what is going on--certainly not when it comes to operating  drones in international airspace.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Williams), the author of this resolution, and a submarine  driver, who colleagues affectionately refer to as ``bubbleheads.''    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time.   In closing, I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Williams) for  introducing this important resolution. I believe that this Chamber has  to stand firmly against Russian aggression. I believe very firmly that  the United States of America has to have big, giant, brass stones. If  our aggressors show us that they have bigger brass stones than what we  do, then we will not be the leader of the free world.   I very much fear what is taking place right now. I will just say it  like that. I very much fear what is taking place and is allowed to take  place in this world.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this resolution, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
