 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the  Record a letter of support for revoking President Trump's threat to  deny 800,000 DREAMers legal status in this country and to support his  executive order affirming DACA for so many young people across this  Nation--4,400 in Ohio, for example--who are following the rules, who  came here as children, who are Americans as apple pie and only want a  chance to succeed in our country like Linda who was brought here from  Palestine when she was 8 years old. She is studying now in our area in  a very difficult STEM program and is working her way through college  through Work-Study in order to make a firm contribution to our Nation  in the future and to the future of whatever family she establishes.   Why should they be denied this opportunity and made to feel so put  upon by the Government of the United States?                                                    August 14, 2017.      President Donald J. Trump,      The White House,      Washington, DC.        Dear President Trump: As immigration law teachers and       scholars, we write to express our position that the executive       branch has legal authority to implement Deferred Action for       Childhood Arrivals (DACA 2012). This letter provides legal       analysis about DACA 2012. In our view, there is no question       that DACA 2012 is a lawful exercise of prosecutorial       discretion. Our conclusions are based on years of experience       in the field and a close study of the U.S. Constitution,       administrative law, immigration statutes, federal regulations       and case law. As the administration determines the future of       DACA 2012, understanding its legal foundation and history is       critical.        DACA 2012 was announced by the President, and implemented       in a memorandum by the Secretary of Homeland Security, on       June 15, 2012. It enables qualifying individuals to request a       temporary reprieve from removal known as ``deferred action.''       Deferred action is one form of prosecutorial discretion in       immigration law and has been used for decades by the       Department of Homeland Security (DHS) (and formerly the       Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)) and over       several administrations.        Whether a requesting individual receives deferred action       under DACA 2012 is at the discretion of DHS. Qualifying       individuals may request DACA 2012 if they came to the United       States before the age of sixteen; are currently in school or       have graduated; have continuously resided in the United       States since June 15, 2007; have not been convicted of a       felony, ``significant misdemeanor,'' or three or more non-      significant misdemeanors; do not otherwise pose a threat to       public safety or national security; and otherwise warrant       protection as a matter of discretion. Individuals who are       granted DACA 2012 receive a two-year period in deferred       action and also gain eligibility to apply for employment       authorization.        The legal authority for DACA 2012 originates from the U.S.       Constitution. Article II, Section Three (the Take Care       Clause) states in part that the President ``shall take Care       that the Laws be faithfully executed.'' Inherent in the       function of the ``Take Care Clause'' is the ability of the       President to target some immigration cases for removal and to       use prosecutorial discretion favorably in others. As       described by the U.S. Supreme  [[Page H6688]]       Court: ``[W]e recognize that an agency's refusal to institute       proceedings shares to some extent the characteristics of the       decision of a prosecutor in the Executive Branch not to       indict--a decision which has long been regarded as the       special province of the Executive Branch, inasmuch as it is       the Executive who is charged by the Constitution to `take       Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.' ''        As early as 1976, former INS General Counsel Sam Bernsen       executed a legal opinion that identified the Take Care Clause       as the primary source for prosecutorial discretion in       immigration matters. He wrote: ``The ultimate source for the       exercise of prosecutorial discretion in the Federal       Government is the power of the President. Under Article II,       Section 1 of the Constitution, the executive power is vested       in the President. Article II, Section 3, states that the       President `shall take care that the laws be faithfully       executed.' ''        The U.S. Supreme Court has also recognized the role of       prosecutorial discretion in the immigration system. In       Arizona v United States, the Court noted that ``[a] principal       feature of the removal system is the broad discretion       exercised by immigration officials . . . Federal officials,       as an initial matter, must decide whether it makes sense to       pursue removal at all . . .''        Congress created the Immigration and Nationality Act (the       Act or INA) in 1952 and it remains the primary statutory       authority for immigration law today. Importantly, Congress       has delegated most discretionary immigration functions to       DHS. Section 103 of the Act provides that ``[t]he Secretary       of Homeland Security shall be charged with the administration       and enforcement of this Act and all other laws relating to       the immigration and naturalization of aliens . . .''        Congress has repeatedly acknowledged that the Executive has       power to grant ``deferred action'' for certain categories of       people such as victims of crimes and human trafficking.       Additionally, previous administrations have announced       deferred action programs to protect qualifying individuals.       For example, under the George W. Bush administration, U.S.       Citizenship and Immigration Services (part of DHS) announced       a deferred action program for students affected by Hurricane       Katrina and later developed a program for the widows of U.S.       citizens. Moreover, Congress also recognized legal authority       for immigration prosecutorial discretion in INA Sec. 242(g),       which bars judicial review of three specific prosecutorial       discretion decisions by the agency: to commence removal       proceedings, to adjudicate cases, and to execute removal       orders.        Another important legal source for deferred action is Title       8 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Section 274a.12(c)(14)       dates to 1981 and is the product of notice and comment       rulemaking. This regulation specifically identifies deferred       action by name and allows individuals granted deferred action       to apply for work authorization upon a showing of ``economic       necessity.'' Over the last two decades, thousands of       individuals have applied for and received work authorization       based on a deferred action grant.        There are also agency guidance documents related to       deferred action issued by DHS (and formerly INS) over the       last four-plus decades. The 1976 legal opinion by former INS       General Counsel Sam Bernsen cites to the Take Care Clause of       the U.S. Constitution, as well as statutory and case law from       as early as 1825 to affirm the exercise of prosecutorial       discretion in immigration. It was around this time when INS       published its first guidance on deferred action in the form       of an ``Operations Instruction.'' This ``Operations       Instruction'' stated ``(ii) Deferred action. In every case       where the district director determines that adverse action       would be unconscionable because of the existence of appealing       humanitarian factors, he shall recommend consideration for       deferred action category.'' Since 1975, deferred action has       been identified in several subsequent guidance documents.       Guidance documents are common in administrative law and are a       recognized form of agency action under the Administrative       Procedure Act.        At tension with the aforementioned body of law is a letter       sent by ten state Attorneys General to the administration       requesting that DACA 2012 be rescinded. This letter refers to       DACA 2012 as ``unlawful'' and does so without citing to the       foundational legal authorities behind deferred action.       Furthermore, the letter conflates deferred action, ``lawful       presence'' and work authorization in ways that are legally       unsound and unclear. Finally, the letter itself shoehorns       arguments into Texas v. United States, a lawsuit that never       included the core of DACA 2012, and instead involved policies       that are at this point in time moot. Moreover, a previous       lawsuit challenging DACA 2012 failed on jurisdictional       grounds and would inevitably inform any future challenge.        While the scope of this letter is to describe the legal       foundation for DACA 2012, it is important to highlight the       history and inevitability of prosecutorial discretion in       immigration enforcement. Prosecutorial discretion exists       because the government has limited resources and lacks the       ability to enforce the law against the entire undocumented       population. Recognizing this resource limitation, Congress       has charged the Secretary of DHS with ``establishing national       immigration enforcement policies and priorities.''       Prosecutorial discretion and policies like DACA 2012 also       have a humanitarian dimension, and such factors have long       driven deferred action decisions. Finally, DACA 2012 has been       an unqualified policy success, allowing over three-quarters       of a million recipients to continue their education, receive       professional licensing, find employment, and pay taxes into       Social Security and other tax coffers.        This letter outlines the legal foundation for DACA 2012 and       confirms that maintaining such a policy falls squarely within       the Executive's discretion. The legal authority for the       Executive Branch to operate DACA 2012 is crystal clear. As       such, choices about its future would constitute a policy and       political decision, not a legal one. As the administration       decides how best to address DACA 2012, we hope that the legal       foundation and history for this policy is addressed wisely       and that decisions on the future of DACA 2012 are made       humanely.        * All institutional affiliations are for identification       purposes only and do not signify institutional endorsement of       this letter.        Thank you for your attention.

So with this unanimous consent request, I stand on behalf  of those 4,400 Ohioans as well as 800,000 young Americans who are  DREAMers and will inject new energy and new possibility into our  country, help to fund programs like Social Security which they are  paying into if they are working, and make their contribution to our  country's future.   It is really an honor to rise on her behalf and ask for Congress to  act immediately to pass legislation to protect these young people whose  economic and cultural contributions will only make our Nation stronger.  They will not displace anyone--any person--who has an application  currently pending before our immigration service, but they will wait in  line like everyone else because they are fair people and they deserve  to be treated fairly by the Government of the United States.    Mr. Chair, I want to thank Ranking Member Lowey for  yielding me time. Thank you to all members of the committee for the  long hours you have dedicated to these bills, certainly our chairman,  Rodney Frelinghuysen. The artificially low allocations you were given  have resulted in a package that I cannot support, but I want to note  your efforts to find compromise where it was possible.   Though the House passed the Energy and Water bill as part of July's  Christmas tree minibus, I am back down here today because the  Republican majority has harmed the Department of Energy's funding for  the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, or, as  they call it, the ATVM. It has been gutted as a pay-for to cover  another shortsighted Republican cut to a Federal Emergency Management  program.   Today's rule allowed this boneheaded Republican action, plotted just  weeks ago before Mother Nature's catastrophic fury hit Texas with  Hurricane Harvey. It doesn't look good to the American people when the  majority cuts programs that are desperately needed. It doesn't serve  America's future if money is pulled from developing engine technologies  to increase fuel economy of cars, expand domestic manufacturing, and  create good-paying American jobs.   Unless you live under a rock, you know these initiatives are both  popular and effective and necessary: 61 percent of Republicans in Ohio  support the requirement of getting to an average of 40 miles per gallon  in new cars by 2025, with 73 percent of the public, overall, supporting  that.   The Department of Energy's Advanced Technology Vehicle program  supported Ford's development of the EcoBoost engine, which is built in  Ohio at Brook Park, in my own district. Advanced Vehicle Research  supported the development of all-electric vehicles, from Nissan's Leaf  in Tennessee to Tesla's Model S in California. It supports America's  competitiveness in a fiercely competitive and tough global marketplace  that is, many times, not on the level.   We should support innovation and collaboration, not eliminate job- creating programs. I will fight to preserve this program in the final  spending package.    Mr. Chair, thus, I encourage all my colleagues to oppose  this sort of backward maneuver and oppose the final bill.   In closing, I would like to say, and to acknowledge publicly, a very  big thank you and congratulations to Taunja Berquam on her upcoming  retirement from Congress. I know she will have a bright future ahead.   After her distinguished and exemplary service with the Army Corps of  Engineers, including in Iraq, she dedicated over a decade of her  brilliant life and mind to the important task of managing the  Appropriation's Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies  Subcommittee accounts during my tenure as ranking member, as well as  for Representative Peter Visclosky before me.    Taunja's high-minded commitment to democratic principles is  unyielding. Our committee is losing a trusted and honorable adviser.  Her expertise and no-nonsense approach served our members, the staff,  and the American people extraordinarily well.   Taunja, you will be missed, and you can leave knowing that you made a  positive difference for America's future in nuclear readiness, in our  energy future security, and in vital Army Corps development from coast  to coast. We thank you.
