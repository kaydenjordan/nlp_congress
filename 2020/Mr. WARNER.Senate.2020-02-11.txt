 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I thank the Democratic leader.   I am here today because I think, as we all know, our elections remain  vulnerable to foreign election interference. Russia attacked our  democracy in 2016, with the goal of undermining confidence in our  system, a system of free and fair elections--literally, the bedrock of  our democracy.   Their cyber attacks and disinformation efforts continue to this day,  and our own FBI Director, Christopher Wray, has reassured or,  potentially, warned us that they will be back in full force this year.  Not only that, but we will have to contend with potential interference  from China, Iran, North Korea, and others who have basically copied the  Russia playbook.   The threat is real, it is ongoing, and we are not doing enough to be  ready. Time and again we hear these same warnings from our intelligence  community leadership, from companies like Facebook, from the special  counsel, and many others. The truth is that the alarm bells are going  off, and we are running out of time to actually do something about it.   Unfortunately, the White House and the U.S. Senate seem to be the  only ones not taking this threat seriously. Since 2016, this body,  which we all have the honor to serve in, has failed to vote on a single  piece of standalone election security legislation. Three times last  year I came to the floor in an attempt to pass bipartisan election  security legislation by unanimous consent, and each time these efforts  were blocked by some of my Republican colleagues--blocked and actually  earned applause from the President on Twitter for their actions.   Well, I am back again today because the security of our elections  cannot wait. In a moment, I will ask unanimous consent to pass my  legislation known as the FIRE Act. This bill would simply say to all  Presidential campaigns going forward that if a foreign power reaches  out to your campaign offering assistance or offering dirt on a  political opponent, the appropriate response is not to say thank you.  The appropriate response is to call the FBI.   I introduced this bipartisan legislation months before the facts came  to light about the President pressuring Ukraine into announcing a  politically motivated investigation into the Bidens.   Now, I am not here to rehash the impeachment trial, but I do want to  note one thing. A number of my Republican colleagues justified their  votes by saying that, while not impeachable, it was wrong for the  President to solicit foreign interference in our elections. I take my  colleagues at their word that they believe foreign interference has no  place in our elections, but if I take you at your word, you have got to  put your money where your mouth is. We are under attack from our  adversaries, who see this new era of cyber warfare and disinformation  as a unique and golden opportunity to undermine American democracy.   We cannot afford to have a system that allows any Presidential  candidate to welcome this kind of interference with open arms. If we  can't trust the President of the United States and his campaign to do  the right thing and report foreign interference, then we need to  require it by law.                      Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2242    Mr. President, as in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that the Rules Committee be discharged from further consideration of S.  2242, the FIRE Act; that the Senate proceed to its immediate  consideration; that the bill be considered read a third time and  passed; and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague's comments about  [[Page S976]]  State and local election security, which I support.   I see two members of the Senate Intelligence Committee on the floor,  and I am extraordinarily proud of the bipartisan, unanimous work that  we have done to point out what happened in 2016 and to lay out with a  great deal of specificity what we need to do as a nation to protect  ourselves in 2020.   This legislation I am proposing today is really kind of the simplest,  lowest hanging fruit. I think we all say that we don't want foreigners  interfering in our elections. All this legislation says is if a foreign  government or foreign agents interfere to try to help or hurt any  Presidential candidate, we ought to make sure there is no ambiguity  that the appropriate response is not to say thank you but the  appropriate response is to call the FBI.   That is the message we have heard from Director Wray. That is the  message we have heard from the intelligence community. If we can't  agree on that, gracious, where are we?   And, candidly, in other times we might not have needed this kind of  legislation. It seems so patently obvious.   I am disappointed with the objection. We will keep trying.   With that, I yield the floor to my colleague from Oregon.
