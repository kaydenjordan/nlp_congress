 Madam Speaker, I rise today to bring my people's voice  into this Chamber. They are going through day 25 of an unnecessary  government shutdown. They are begging their landlords not to evict them  because HUD funding is suspended.   Our neighbors at home who live among the biggest corporate polluters  are wondering, without EPA inspectors on duty, if they are breathing in  more toxins than permitted under the law.   Madam Speaker, when did it become okay to use people as pawns, to  jeopardize the well-being and way of life of our residents back home?   I urge the leadership in the Senate to put people first. Majority  Leader McConnell works for the American people, not the President. We  don't need the President's support.   So, please, Senators, pass the bills you supported before, and let's  get our government up and running again for our families.                            ____________________
