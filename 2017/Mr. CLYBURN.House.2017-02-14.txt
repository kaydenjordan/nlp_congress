 Mr. Speaker, standing before almost entirely White  crowds in North Carolina, Michigan, Virginia, and Ohio, candidate  Donald Trump painted a bleak picture of African-American life in 2016,  full of crime, high poverty, and failing schools. He went on to say,  ``It is a disaster the way African Americans are living,'' and asked,  ``What the hell do you have to lose?''   In just 3 short weeks, Mr. Speaker, President Trump has shown the  world exactly what a disaster looks like. He has put a White  supremacist in the White House as his chief political adviser. He has  given us an Attorney General who spent the last 30-plus years working  against civil and voting rights. He has appointed a shamefully ill- prepared Secretary of Education whose only qualification seems to be  her ability to contribute millions to Republic candidates in what can  only be described as the textbook definition of pay to play.   Candidate Trump promised to be the hero of working people, but  President Trump is doing the exact opposite. His actions tell a lot  more than his tweets. His Cabinet is full of millionaires, many with  ethical challenges and conflicts of interest. He has already raised the  cost of mortgages for many Americans. He is proposing that we abandon  the overtime rule that would ensure bigger paychecks for working  people. He is working to dismantle Wall Street reform and is proposing  a border tax that would give corporations a huge tax break while  costing working men and women more on groceries, clothes, and other  goods.   The policies of the Trump administration are an extension of the  policies that Republics in the House have pushed for years. To  candidate Trump's question what do you have to lose, for starters, your  voice at the ballot box. A free and fair election is the hallmark of  democratic governance, yet the Trump administration and Republics in  Congress continue to threaten this basic pillar of democracy. They have  promulgated blatant falsehoods about voter fraud, sowing fear and  distrust. They have worked and are working across the country to  prevent people of color from voting. They are refusing to investigate  Russian interference in our elections and are currently moving  legislation through the House of Representatives to eliminate the only  Federal agency tasked with helping Americans vote and protecting our  voting machines from hacking.   As President Trump and his spokespeople continue to make demonstrably  false claims about widespread voter fraud and cozying up to the country  that attacked our democracy, House Republics just passed out of  committee H.R. 634, legislation to eliminate the only Federal agency  tasked with certifying the security of our voting machines, the  Election Assistance Commission.   Forty-seven out of fifty States rely on the EAC's voting machine  certification program in some capacity. A recent report by the  Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology concluded, ``Voting  machines are neither secure nor complex. In general, these stripped- down computers utilizing outdated operating systems possess virtually  every conceivable vulnerability that a device can have.''   In my home State of South Carolina, we currently use voting machines  that were rejected by the State of Ohio in 2007 for being ``buggy,  unstable and exploitable.'' And even though machines are not supposed  to be connected to the internet, they are well past their shelf life  and, therefore, more likely to break down, crash, and produce errors.  Replacing these outdated machines with updated ones will cost a  significant amount of money, and the burden is on the States to do so.   Mr. Speaker, if House Republics are serious about election integrity,  they ought to stop working to prevent people of color and start  investing in voting infrastructure.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I am proud to cosponsor H.R. 794, which  will reauthorize the Election Assistance Commission until 2022, provide  payments to the States to upgrade the security of voter registration  databases, and require an assessment of each State's voting systems.   Foreign hackers targeted the voter registration databases in more  than 20 States in 2016. Candidate Trump encouraged hackers to target  his opponent. He won the election and continues to cozy up to Russia.   And now, House Republics are moving to eliminate the EAC, a key force  in combating foreign cybersecurity attacks against our democracy.   ``What do you have to lose?'' candidate Trump asked. Try free and  fair elections, Mr. Speaker.   I urge my Republic colleagues to put country before party and stand  up for American democracy. Stop trying to suppress minority voters.  Support an independent commission to investigate Russian meddling in  our election.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, HBCUs, Historically Black Colleges and  Universities, have been the topic of a great deal of discussions  recently, and I rise, as part of the observance of Black History Month,  to recognize and celebrate one of them, Allen University in Columbia,  South Carolina.   Similar to the many Historically Black Colleges and Universities  across the Nation, Allen University's contributions to my home State of  South Carolina and the Nation are immeasurable. Founded to offer  education and opportunity to formerly enslaved African Americans, HBCUs  have been central institutions in African-American communities for  generations.   In 1870, 5 years after the end of the Civil War, the clergy of the  African Methodist Episcopal Church set out to create an institution to  educate newly freed slaves and train clergy for the AME Church. The  Church purchased land in Cokesbury, South Carolina, and named the new  college Payne Institute in honor of AME Bishop Daniel Payne, a native  of Charleston, South Carolina. Bishop Payne had become the first Black  college president in the United States at Wilberforce University in  1863, which he had helped found.   In 1880, Bishop William Dickerson sought to relocate the college to  Columbia and acquired land on which the campus sits today. The  institution was renamed Allen University after Richard Allen, the  founder and first bishop of the AME Church.   Higher education remained segregated in South Carolina until the  early 1960s. The University of South Carolina, also in my district,  only a mile away from Allen, for example, admitted its first African  American in 1963, 2 years after I graduated college.   Throughout the Jim Crow era, Allen University offered degrees in law,  education, and theology, and at one time also offered elementary and  high school classes.   Several of its buildings are on the National Register of Historic  Places, forming the Allen University Historic District. Arnett Hall,  the oldest building on campus, was constructed in 1891 by the students  themselves. It was named after Benjamin W. Arnett, an early leader of  the AME Church, who served on Allen University's Board of Trustees.   The Chappelle Administration Building, which houses the Chappelle  Auditorium, was designed by John Anderson Lankford, known as the dean  of Black architects, and completed in 1925. It was named after William  David Chappelle, the great-grandfather of comedian Dave Chappelle, and  a graduate of Allen University, who later served as its president.  Chappelle Auditorium is one of five buildings in Columbia designated a  National Historic Landmark.   This historic campus has been central to the Waverly neighborhood and  the African-American community in Columbia. Black artists, such as  Leontyne Price, Langston Hughes, and Brook Benton, all appeared at  Chappelle Auditorium.   In 1947, the Reverend James Hinton, then-president of the NAACP of  South Carolina, held a rally at Chappelle, which was attended by  Reverend Joseph A. DeLaine, an Allen University alumnus. Inspired by  the event, Reverend DeLaine organized families in Summerton, South  Carolina, to petition their school district to provide buses for Black  students who, at the time, were forced to make a daily walk of 9 miles  to school.                                time  1915    This case, Briggs v. Elliott, was the first of the five cases that  became Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas. It is no  exaggeration, Mr. Speaker, to say that Allen University was the  birthplace of the movement that overturned ``separate but equal'' and  brought an end to legal segregation in America. Allen University will  remain central to the struggle for civil rights.   In the early 1960s, Allen University students led demonstrations at  segregated lunch counters and participated in many of the marches in  Columbia during that period. National leaders such as Martin Luther  King, Jr., Roy Wilkins, and Ralph Abernathy visited Allen during these  demonstrations, often staying on campus when they came to town.   Today Allen University is a liberal arts institution still operated  by the AME Church. It has graduated many notable elected officials,  including State Representative William Clyburn and his wife, Beverly  Dozier Clyburn, who retired from the Aiken, South Carolina, City  Council several years ago. Retired State Senator Kay Patterson is also  a graduate. Two of Allen's alumni, former Senator Clementa Pinckney and  Tywanza Sanders, were among the nine who were murdered during the  attack at Emanuel AME Church in 2015.   Several of its historic buildings, like Arnett Hall and Chappelle  Auditorium, have been restored recently with Federal funding from the  HBCU Historic Preservation Program, which this body in its collective  wisdom voted unanimously last year to reauthorize. I plan, along with  my friend Representative Green and other members of the Congressional  Black Caucus, to reintroduce that bill this year. I am hopeful that we  will repeat the unanimity this year and that the Senate will support  our efforts.   Allen University has made an indelible mark on our society over the  past 147 years. I ask all of my colleagues to join me in honoring its  great contributions to this great Nation.
