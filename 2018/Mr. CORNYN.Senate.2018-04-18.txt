The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Arizona (Mr. McCain).    Mr. President, it is with sadness that I come to the  Senate floor to speak about former First Lady Barbara Bush on her  passing yesterday. Of course, she was the wife of our 41st President  and the mother of our 43rd President.   My wife Sandy and I have wonderful memories of Mrs. Bush flying  around the State of Texas with us during my campaign for attorney  general. That the former First Lady of the United States was so willing  to embark on this long day of campaigning speaks to her generosity and  her devotion to causes she believed in. With her, we always felt like  we were flying in first class.   Many kind things have already been said about the First Lady's sharp  wit and her sense of humor, her efforts to improve child literacy, and  her faith and loyalty to family and friends; and all of those are true.  I will not try to top those statements. I will simply say what all of  us are feeling today: sad  [[Page S2242]]  and a little bit emptier as a nation, missing her honor, dignity, and  respectability.
