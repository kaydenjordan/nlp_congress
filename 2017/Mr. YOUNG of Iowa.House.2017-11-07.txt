 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Florida,  and I also thank my colleague from Minnesota, as well, who has a  history on this important issue, the genesis going back to 2007, like  my friend from Minnesota said, with a predecessor of mine, former  Congressman Leonard Boswell, who misses this institution and gave great  service. I know he sends his best.   I thank my colleague, Mr. Banks of Indiana, for making sure that we  are always continuing with oversight of these important programs to  help our veterans.   In 2015, the VA did an OIG report and found out that there were some  failures in the Veterans Crisis Line; there were informational  failures. Sometimes people answering the phone at the VA, who are good  people and want to help our veterans, didn't have all the information  they may need. There was a lack of timely responsiveness at some  points.   The VA Committee here in the House did some oversight and found out  that we needed to make sure that we fixed this. So I introduced a  bipartisan bill with my colleagues that passed unanimously in 2016, the  No Veterans Crisis Line Call Should Go Unanswered Act, to work with the  Veterans Affairs Department to make sure that we knew what they needed  to get the job done, working in partnership across the aisle and with  the VA. The bill passed unanimously. President Obama signed it into  law.   But we know that, with a stroke of a pen, it doesn't just fix things.  You have to have constant oversight and demand transparency and  accountability.   I went down to one of the Veterans Crisis Line centers in Atlanta and  visited with those who ran it and those responders who picked up the  phone every day to talk to our veterans to see how things were going.                                time  1630    Great improvements, great challenges still, but they are making  headway, and it is with a partnership where we can make sure that this  works.   Oversight, transparency, accountability is what this is about, but  most importantly, this is about keeping our promise to our veterans,  those who have donned the uniform to protect our rights, the rights of  our family members, and our loved ones who keep this great Republic  going.   So I want to thank my friend from Florida, my good friend from  Minnesota, and Mr. Banks from Indiana. I am glad to support this  legislation, and I urge others to as well.
