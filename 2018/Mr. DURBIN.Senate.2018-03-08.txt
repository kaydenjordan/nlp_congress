 Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Texas. I  listened carefully to his words about gun safety, and I agree with so  much of what he said. He talked about bringing his bill to the floor. I  think his bill is a good bill. His bill tries to provide more  information into the NICS system. We definitely need to do that. He  also said he was open to amendments on the floor. I am as well. I think  there are other aspects of gun safety that we may even find common  ground on as well. But I might remind him that the decision about the  business on the floor of the Senate is in the hands of his side of the  aisle.   It is your decision to decide, through your majority leader, what we  consider on the floor of the Senate. An effort to do this by unanimous  consent is certainly understandable in light of the events of the last  few weeks, but if Senator McConnell were to announce that as soon as we  finish this banking bill, we are going to move to the Fix NICS bill and  have it open to amendment, I think he would find support from both  sides of the aisle to do that. I hope he will, because things are  changing in America, as they should. Gun violence and the terrible  tragedies that occurred in Texas and in Florida and in so many States  have really raised consciousness of this issue.   I am a grandfather and proud to be. I have two 6-year-old twins who  are first graders in Brooklyn, NY. They are the cutest kids in the  world, and I am very objective about that.   About 2 weeks ago, my little granddaughter came home from the first  grade and said to her mom: Mom, they told us at school that if there is  a shooter outside the school, stay away from the windows, and if a  shooter comes in the classroom, get on the floor.   First grade. Is there any sane person in America who thinks that  should be a normal talk in the first grade classroom? Is there any  person, constitutional scholar or not, who believes the Second  Amendment to the Constitution of the United States was designed to  allow this to happen? I can't imagine.   Ninety-seven percent of the American people believe in universal,  comprehensive background checks to keep guns out of the hands of those  who would misuse them, including convicted felons and mentally unstable  people--97 percent. The overwhelming majority of gun owners feel  exactly the same way. So why in God's Name have we not taken that up  since the tragedy in Florida and the tragedy in Texas? There is no  explanation for it other than fear--fear of the National Rifle  Association and the gun lobby. That is the only explanation.   I salute the legislators in the State of Florida who this last week  defied the NRA and defied the gun lobby and passed their own measure  for gun safety. I don't agree with parts of it. Giving cafeteria  workers in schools the right to carry arms around the school--I don't  think that is a wise thing at all. I understand that there is  opposition to that from teachers' organizations and even Republican  leaders in Florida. But they did stand up when it came to questions  about how old you have to be to buy a firearm, a long gun, and other  questions that I think are just common sense.   So I would say to my friend from Texas, the majority whip, what you  said is something I can support. Bring your bill to the floor, open to  amendment. Let us have our day in the Senate where we actually act as  legislators, where people will come to the  [[Page S1535]]  Galleries and not see an empty Chamber but instead will find Members of  the Senate, 100 strong, Democrats and Republicans, at their desks,  debating measures that make a difference in the life of America. That  is why we are sent here.   I had a friend of mine years ago when I served in the House--he was a  Congressman from Muskogee, OK. His name was Mike Synar. He was a dear,  close friend of mine. Mike lost his primary in Oklahoma because he was  fearless. He used to come to the floor when we had votes, and he would  see Members of his own caucus kind of wincing, afraid to vote for  something they knew was right for fear of the political consequences.  He used to get right in their faces. Mike would say: If you don't want  to fight fires, don't be a firefighter. If you don't want to stand here  and debate controversial issues and vote on them, don't run for  Congress.   Mike was right. He was right then, and he is right now.   Let's bring gun safety to the floor of the Senate. Let's open it to  amendments. Let's have a fulsome, bipartisan debate. We understand that  nothing is going to pass without bipartisan support. We should do  everything in our power to exercise the power and the right we are  given as U.S. Senators to fix the problems facing American families.  This is a problem. It is a problem when a first grader in Brooklyn, NY,  has to be warned that if somebody walks into the classroom with a gun,  she is supposed to get down on the floor.                                     DACA    This is the week, of course, of President Trump's deadline on DACA  students--Dreamers--those young people who came to the United States as  infants and toddlers and young people, grew up in this country, pledged  allegiance to that flag just as we did this morning, and believed that  they were part of America until, at some point in their teenage years,  their parents pulled them aside and said: I have to tell you something.  You are not legal here. You are undocumented here. You can be deported  tomorrow, and we would be deported with you.   They continued their lives with the resilience that a lot of young  people show. Some of them did amazing things, even with the knowledge  that they weren't ``legal in America.'' They achieved extraordinary  things in education and in serving their communities. They did it  against great odds because they don't qualify for Federal assistance  for higher education. If you go to college and you are one of these  undocumented Dreamers, you don't get Federal student loans. You don't  get Pell grants. You have to go out and work. You have to save up  enough money to go to school. That is the only way. They did it, and  all they have asked for in return, all they have ever asked for, is a  chance to earn their way into legal status in America. Brought here as  kids, they want a chance to prove to America that they love this  country and they can make it a better country. That is all they have  asked for.    For 17 years, I have come to the floor of this Senate--I know you  have to be patient as a Senator, but this is getting a little crazy-- for 17 years, I have come to the floor of the Senate and asked my  colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, will you give them a chance?  Will you just give them a chance? Let them show you that they can bring  something of value to this country. Let them prove to you that they are  no danger to this country in any way whatsoever and, in fact--just the  opposite--will make us stronger. Give them a chance.   We haven't been able to do it, and President Trump has made it worse.  On September 5, he eliminated the DACA protection program. He said that  as of March 5, which was Monday of this week, they will lose their  protection. The only thing that protects them at this moment is court  decisions, which could change in a week or a month. But if those court  decisions don't come their way, those young people who have lived here  their entire lives, who believe they are Americans and want to be part  of America, will be subject to deportation. That is the reality.   The Senate took up this measure a few weeks ago. We gave to the  President six different bipartisan solutions to this problem--Democrats  and Republicans agreed on six different ways to solve it--and the  President rejected every one. He rejected the bill that came before the  Senate. Only 8 Republicans--only 8 out of the 51 Republicans--would  stand up and vote with Democrats to solve this problem. I wish it were  more. We only needed a few more.   Now we are in a position where this Senate again, like the issue of  gun safety, is not taking up the issue of DACA and the Dreamers. It  isn't as though we are too busy around here, is it, when you look at  this empty Chamber and these empty desks? We could do a lot of things  here if we were determined to use the power and opportunity that have  been given to us by the American voters.   Mr. President, the one pending issue that is before us, I would like  to discuss this morning.   Next week, it will be the 10th anniversary of the collapse of the  company known as Bear Stearns. As we approach that anniversary, it is  remarkable to me that Congress is now debating, 10 years later, an  effort to undo the financial reforms we put in place after what was  tantamount to a recession or depression hit America. That was the worst  financial crisis of our lifetime 10 years ago. Many of us never want to  see it repeated.   I am supportive of meaningful regulatory relief for smaller banks,  community banks, and credit unions, but I cannot support legislation  that rolls back key Wall Street reforms at the request of the same  banks that started the crisis.   We know what happened the last time financial regulations were eased:  an economic collapse that rippled not just through the United States  but around the world. That financial crisis of 10 years ago left our  country spiraling into deep recession. It left almost 9 million  Americans out of work and our unemployment rate above 10 percent.  Families across America lost $19 trillion in household wealth,  retirement, and savings. Hard-fought savings that they put aside for  their kids' education and their retirement evaporated on a daily basis  in the midst of that recession.   In my home State of Illinois, we weren't spared. During the height of  the financial crisis, almost 800,000 people in my State experienced  mortgage delinquencies and 70,000 more went through personal  bankruptcy. I remember going to these meetings where gymnasiums would  be filled with people trying to find some way to save their homes  because the mortgages they had signed up for had blown up in their  faces. This was evident in my hometown of East St. Louis, in the city  of Chicago, in Aurora, and many other communities. Of course, the cost  of this financial crisis fell, as it always does, on the shoulders of  everyday families.   In the wake of those terrible losses and the sacrifices that had to  be made, we in Congress said: We are not going to let this happen  again. We won't let these banks take control again. We won't let greed  overcome common sense when it comes to banking policy.   President Obama signed into law commonsense financial reforms and put  an end to some of the worst, inexcusable practices by banks that  brought our economy to its knees. These new Wall Street reforms were  intended to address the dangerous problem of too big to fail so that  American taxpayers would never again be on the hook for the  consequences of recklessness and greed on Wall Street.   Systemically important banks whose demise would pose serious risk to  our financial system were subjected to higher capital buffers and  increased leverage requirements. In other words, if the Federal  Government was going to put an insurance program in place to guarantee  that it would protect the savers at the bank, we were going to require  the banks to do responsible things--don't put taxpayers on the hook for  your stupidity and your greed.   Banks were required to report their lending data to ensure that  borrowers had the ability to repay the loans they took out and to avoid  abusive mortgage practices. Do you remember what happened? People would  walk into a bank, and they would be lured into a mortgage they could  barely afford to pay, some of them unaware of the fact that there was a  balloon provision in that mortgage where the interest rate in a few  years was going to dramatically increase and make their monthly  [[Page S1536]]  payments financially impossible for them.   Many of them said: Well, if the value of my real estate goes up  dramatically, then I will just refinance the mortgage. It did not go up  dramatically, it went down, and that is when people faced mortgage  foreclosure.   So we said: Let's rewrite the rules. Let's not let the banks lead  people into a financial obligation that is so risky and so dangerous  that we never want to see it again.   The new rules and regulations provided certainty to banks and  consumers. And what happened next? Our economy did very well. With this  new generation of regulation on banks--it didn't stifle economic growth  at all. In part due to these sensible reforms enacted in Dodd-Frank  under the Obama administration, our economy now has an unemployment  rate of 4.1 percent, not 10 percent. Banks are lending, and bank  profits are at record peaks. They are making money hand over fist. In  2016, banks in America made their highest profits ever. This was after  the regulations we enacted--the ones they have been complaining about  ever since.   How about American businesses? They are thriving. Our gross domestic  product grew by 2.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017. In fact,  since the passage of this Wall Street reform, our economy has grown at  twice the rate of other advanced economies, while our stock market  has--until just a few weeks ago--hit record after record. You can't  argue that we are regulating banks so much that it is hurting the  economy when you read these numbers. Nearly all measures in the labor  market have fallen below their prerecession averages. This is the  result of a sensible, forceful response by Congress to illegitimate and  dangerous practices by the banking industry.    We simply cannot afford to return to that thrilling time of  yesteryear when banks were not carefully regulated and carefully  watched so they didn't go overboard. Instead, as we approach the 10th  anniversary of the worst financial crisis since 1929, we should be  working to strengthen our financial system, protect families and  businesses and the hard-earned money they have saved, and continue to  grow our economy.   There is a room just a few steps away from this Senate Chamber on  this floor of the Senate where I have been present twice at a historic  moment.   The first one, with great sadness, was 9/11. I was meeting in that  room as we finally tried to understand what was happening to America  with the attacks on the World Trade Center, the plane crashing in  Pennsylvania, and the plane crashing into the Pentagon, with black  smoke billowing across the Mall. It was that room.   It was that same room where we were called together by the head of  the Federal Reserve, Mr. Bernanke, and the head of the Treasury  Department, Mr. Paulson. There were probably 20 or 30 Members of the  Senate and House in that room when they announced to us that we were  within 24 hours of seeing the economy of the United States start to  collapse. You never forget those moments. They told us that the banking  issues that we have discussed here this morning had led us to the point  where we had to step in as a government to save the banking industry in  America in order to save the economy of America and perhaps the world.   Those are sobering words, and I remember them well. They inspired us.  They drove us to the point where we came up with new financial reform,  serious reform, so that there would never be another repeat of that  terrible day. We are on the floor of the Senate now arguing about  changing those standards of reform.   If we are going into this issue to debate it, there is one part of it  that I want to raise. It is one of the seven amendments that have been  put forward by the Democratic side of the aisle. I think it is  critically important. It deals with an issue that every single Member  of the Senate understands if they have spent 15 minutes back home. It  is the issue of America's student loan crisis.   For many Americans today, there is no bigger drag on their families  than student loan debt. More than 44 million Americans cumulatively owe  more than $1.5 trillion in student loan debt. That is greater than the  total amount of credit card debt in America.   Unlike most of us who could borrow a reasonable amount to finance our  college education, this generation of college graduates starts off with  an average debt of $27,000 on day one after graduation. Many have much,  much more, especially if they were duped by the notorious for-profit  college industry in America.   I hear from young people who have had to forgo home ownership,  starting a family, and buying a car because of student debt. I also  hear from those who have gone back to school and stay in school because  they can't imagine starting to pay back their debt. They dig the hole  deeper every semester.   Too often, this debt involves their parents and grandparents. It was  reported a couple years ago that a grandmother--who was kind and signed  on as a cosigner of her granddaughter's student loan debt--after the  granddaughter defaulted, was being chased by the Federal Government,  which threatened to attach her Social Security benefits so they could  recoup the student loan that her granddaughter signed up for with her  cosignature. That is why we are bringing an amendment to the floor, and  it should be part of this debate on this bill.   If we are going to talk about reform for banks, let's talk about a  reform American families really care about--student loan reform.   One of the things included in this amendment is a borrower bill of  rights. Once a student graduates, their loans go into repayment with  private financial institutions or, in the case of Federal student  loans, servicers contracted by the Department of Education. These  servicers are supposed to help the borrowers navigate the repayment  process by making sure they are on the right repayment plan, processing  payments correctly, and keeping borrowers informed. Well, how are they  doing? Between July 2011 and August 2017, the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau handled almost 51,000 complaints related to private  and Federal student loans. The majority of the complaints, both private  and Federal, addressed difficulties in interacting with lenders or  servicers. This is unacceptable. Lenders and servicers should be making  repayment easier, not more difficult.   To improve Federal and private student loan servicing, our amendment  includes the Student Loan Borrower Bill of Rights. It requires  notifications and protections for borrowers when a loan is sold or  transferred to another company or when the interest rate or other key  terms of the loan change. It establishes a standard for applying  payments so that payments are applied in a way that most benefits the  borrower. It protects borrowers from unreasonable late fees. It  requires servicers to provide borrowers online access to information  about their loans, such as payment history and loan terms, and requires  key information to be disclosed to borrowers by servicers.   The student loan borrowers' bill of rights also prevents servicers  from using predispute mandatory arbitration clauses to prevent  borrowers from holding them accountable in court.   While Federal student loan borrowers often face challenges, the  situation is worse for borrowers who have private student loans, not  government loans. There is now an estimated $165 billion in outstanding  private student loans. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  reported that in 2012 at least 850,000 private student loans, worth $8  billion, were in default.   Private student loans often have uncapped variable interest rates,  which can spike to 20 percent and more, and hefty fees, and these loans  often lack the protections that come with Federal student loans.  Unfortunately, many student borrowers, and even their family members,  don't understand the difference between a Federal loan and a private  loan, and they end up taking out costly private loans when they are  still eligible for Federal loans that are much more reasonable with  lower interest rates.   Almost half of private loan borrowers in 2011 and 2012 did not max  out on their more reasonable Federal loans and ended up taking out  private loans that were worse. That is why I introduced the Know Before  You Owe Private Education Loan Act, included in this amendment,  requiring borrowers to be notified of the difference and their  eligibility.   Finally, the amendment requires private student lenders to offer  student  [[Page S1537]]  loan rehabilitation consistent with Federal student loans. It gives  private student loan borrowers who default a fresh start.   My amendment also addresses the key issue of bankruptcy. Did you know  that if you borrowed money to buy a second home, buy a car, or buy a  boat and then lost your job and couldn't pay off those loans and went  into bankruptcy court saying: I don't have any money left, and I can't  pay off these loans, the court could discharge those loans for your  vacation home, your car, your boat, in bankruptcy, and say: We wipe the  slate clean; you filed for bankruptcy, you qualify, and the slate is  wiped clean. However, if one of your loans is not for a second home, a  car, or a boat but is a student loan, then, the student loan is not  dischargeable from bankruptcy. Originally, this was done in the 1970s  because there were some students exploiting the system--borrowing money  and then declaring bankruptcy after graduation. Then, in 2005 Congress  extended nondischargeability not just to Federal Government loans but  to private loans, which even extended it to those loans that were given  by these notorious for-profit colleges and universities.   So before 2005, private student loans were treated in bankruptcy  proceedings like credit card debt and other types of private unsecured  debt. They could be discharged as part of a bankruptcy plan to help a  student debtor get back on his or her feet. But in 2005, when Congress  passed a sweeping bankruptcy reform bill, a provision was slipped in  that gave private student lenders a uniquely privileged status. Only a  few types of private unsecured debt are nondischargeable in bankruptcy:  child support, back taxes, alimony, criminal fines. Now private student  loans are part of that list.   Since 2005, lenders have been incentivized to push expensive private  student loans on students, many of whom will not be able to repay the  loans. This is an enormous problem.   I cannot explain why private student loans are given special  treatment in the bankruptcy code. Neither can the Chairman of the  Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, who told the Senate recently that he  was ``at a loss'' to explain why we don't allow student debt to be  discharged in bankruptcy. He said that the growing amount of  nondischargeable student debt ``absolutely could hold back growth.''   We need to address this looming student debt crisis. My amendment  would help by restoring dischargeability for private student loans in  bankruptcy.   The amendment also clarifies the undue hardship exception that  Congress wrote into the bankruptcy code. We said: There is one  provision. If you are facing undue hardship, then, perhaps you can  discharge even a student loan.   Almost never does a court find undue hardship. Congress did not  define the term, and most courts have interpreted the term to have such  a high bar that most students don't even try to pursue the exception  because of the difficulty and expense of proving undue hardship in  court.   We tried to address that. This amendment would provide clarity around  undue hardship by identifying situations where there should be a  rebuttable presumption that a student loan debtor has an undue  hardship. We tried to address it in terms of those who clearly are  facing undue hardship and need a helping hand. What are the categories  of those facing bankruptcy who cannot discharge current student loans  who would be able to discharge them under our amendment? It will be  those who have been determined by the Veterans' Administration to have  a service-connected disability. Should we give disabled veterans in  America a helping hand like this? I think so. How about the family  caregiver of elderly or disabled family members or veterans? How about  those receiving Social Security disability whose only income is Social  Security? How about those who spent years at a low income? Do you think  they might be facing an undue hardship and can't pay back a student  loan? I think so, and this amendment would give them the opportunity to  make their case.   There are other provisions, as well, but I see colleagues on the  floor who want to speak as well. I have spoken for a while. I am going  to stand down in just a moment.   If we can take up the issue of making it easier for banks to do  business in America, can we spare a few minutes to debate whether we  can make it easier for student borrowers to survive when the student  debts they face are stopping them from moving forward in their lives?  These are massive debts that stop them from getting married, buying a  home or a car, or starting a family? That is the reality for many  families across America.   I hope my colleagues will join me. A lot of us give some great  speeches about student loans. It would be terrific if we could allow on  the floor of the Senate those speeches and a vote on that critical  issue.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, last week, I met in my office with four  students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, as well as one  recent graduate. They are among the many students and graduates from  Parkland, FL, who have been speaking out across the country, asking for  commonsense gun safety reforms. They are having a real impact. They are  changing the debate over guns in America.   Last week several of the Nation's largest gun retailers, including  Dick's Sporting Goods and Walmart announced that they had listened to  the Parkland students, and heard them. Dick's Sporting Goods announced  it will no longer sell assault rifles or high capacity magazines at any  of its stores. Their CEO also announced that the company would stop  selling firearms to anyone under age 21. Walmart which had already  stopped selling assault rifles, made the same decision to stop selling  guns to people under 21, as did Kroger and L.L. Bean.   Making 21 the minimum age for buying any firearm is an idea that  makes sense. It is already the law that a person must be 21 to buy a  handgun. Why should the law be different for an assault rifle? In fact,  President Trump initially came out in support of the idea of making 21  the age limit for all gun purchases, but then the NRA's lobbyists went  to work on the President with a private lunch and an Oval Office visit.   We will see who the President and Republicans ultimately end up  listening to on commonsense proposals like these: the Parkland students  or the gun sales lobby.   It is incredible to see students and businesses across the country  taking a leadership role, in addressing gun violence. They have decided  it is time to act, and they are acting. We have seen the Stoneman  Douglas students convince companies to make meaningful changes when it  comes to gun sales practices, and they have convinced many more  companies to end their relationships with the NRA. That is a major  development.   Unfortunately, the gun sales lobby has not been a constructive voice  in this debate over the epidemic of gun violence. Their rhetoric has  been increasingly paranoid and hysterical. It is clear that their  priority is to preserve their ability to make gun sales. That is the  gun lobby's agenda, but it doesn't need to be our agenda.   I want to commend the students and businesses that are showing such  leadership in working to make our communities safer. Now the question  is, Will the Republicans who control Congress show any leadership as  well?  [[Page S1575]]    If we let the gun sales lobby control this debate, we will never take  the steps we need to keep our schools and neighborhoods safe from gun  violence. Remember, the NRA doesn't like any proposal that might hurt  gun sales. They don't want to close loopholes in our laws, instead,  they would rather roll back gun laws already on the books. That is not  the agenda America needs.   I stand with the 97 percent of Americans who support universal  background checks for gun sales. I want to close the loopholes in our  laws that make it easy for dangerous people to get their hands on guns.   I also stand with the significant majorities of Americans who want to  take military-style assault Weapons, high-capacity magazines, and bump  stocks off of our streets. These are weapons of war, and they have no  place in our neighborhoods.   We cannot become numb to the shootings that happen in our  communities, our churches, our movie theaters, our concerts, and our  schools. All of us, especially lawmakers, have to step up and take  actions that will reduce the epidemic of gun violence and save lives.   I hope my Republican colleagues will finally step up and help get  this done.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I wish to speak about the ongoing horrific  violence in the nation of Syria, which seems to have hit yet new lows  in terms of barbarity and Russian enabling. The senseless violence--in  service of nothing more than enabling Syrian strongman Bashir al-Assad  to maintain ironfisted rule over a country he has personally driven to  ruin--demands the world's attention.   Quite simply, President Trump, who lambasted President Obama's  approach to Syria, has sat by as the regime continues to use chemical  weapons, relentlessly bomb civilians, ignore the unanimous U.N.  Security Council ceasefire, and allows Iran to build its radical  foothold in Syria. One missile strike is not a long term policy.  President Trump's silence as Russian President Putin not only continues  to meddle in our democracy but also empowers and enables the Syrian  butcher is simply inexplicable and diminishes American leadership.   Let me start with the horror that has unfolded in Eastern Ghouta in  the last few weeks. This area has actually been under siege by Syrian  Government forces since 2013, but last week, Assad's henchmen stepped  up their attacks. For over 2 weeks, Syrian forces supported by Russian  warplanes have relentlessly bombarded Eastern Ghouta in a campaign that  has killed over 1,000 people, wounded almost 5,000, and left 400,000  civilians trapped without food or medicine.   The siege had already led to chronic food and medicine shortages,  devastating the population of Eastern Ghouta and leaving scores  severely malnourished. The bombings have forced people to take shelter  in their basements rather than risk death. Too frightened to venture  outside to face the onslaught of mortar shells, barrel bombs, cluster  bombs, and bunker-busting munitions, the civilian residents of Eastern  Ghouta are being compelled to spend days without food or fresh air,  suffocating in the heavily polluted air.   Despite the U.N. ceasefire, the number of dead climbs every day--from  bombings, from ground assaults, and from hunger. Only yesterday,  Assad's forces killed over 90 civilians and wounded over 300.   The number of casualties has overwhelmed rescuers and hospitals.  Catastrophically, the Assad regime has chosen to re-employ one of its  most heinous tactics and has bombed at least 28 hospitals and clinics.  Doctors Without Borders said 15 of the 20 hospitals it supports have  been destroyed or damaged, reducing access to emergency services just  when they were most needed.   Doctors have run out of resources to treat patients. Doctors are  being forced to make the most difficult choices and sometimes,  tragically, leave critically wounded patients to die. A doctor in  Eastern Ghouta said, ``We have a horrible situation here. We're being  targeted with all kinds of weapons nonstop. We lack everything, water,  food, medical supplies, shelter. This is a disaster. Everyone is  waiting to die.''   I spoke to a deeply respected friend from Chicago the other day who  knows this crisis all too well, Dr. Mohammed Sahloul, who leads the  heroic Syrian American Medical Association. He and his brave colleagues  regularly travel to Syria to help provide medical treatment to victims  of the war. He told me horrific accounts of the latest bombing and  disappointment at the world's seeming inaction amid such heinous  cruelty.   U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres called Eastern Ghouta a  ``hell on Earth.'' United Nation's human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al- Hussein called the onslaught in Eastern Ghouta a ``monstrous campaign  of annihilation.'' He added, ``When you are prepared to kill your own  people so easily, lying is easy too. Claims by the government of Syria  that it is taking every measure to protect its civilian population are  frankly ridiculous.''   Most troublingly, Assad's ruthless regime continues using chemical  weapons to attack its own civilians despite Syria agreeing to eliminate  its chemical weapons in 2013. We are in 2018 now and have seen the  repeated use of chemicals to attack innocent people on the streets of  Syria.   Among his various and numerous atrocities, Bashar al-Assad has made  routine the use of internationally banned chemical weapons. He has  deployed them against his own people nearly 200 times over 7 years. He  has used them against very young children and the elderly, people who  are clearly not fighters on the battlefield. He has targeted civilians  repeatedly with sarin gas, a weapon notably developed by another  abominable regime: the Nazis.   In 2013, Russia worked with a global coalition, including the United  States, to ostensibly destroy Syria's stockpile of chemical weapons,  but the world watched in horror as Assad barbarically unleashed sarin  gas on civilians in the town of Khan Shaykhun again in April 2017.  Maybe you, too, saw the very disturbing reporting a week ago on ``60  Minutes.''   While the United States responded to that incident, Russia has  allowed Assad to conduct many other chemical attacks. In fact, in  Eastern Ghouta, Assad has continued to attack civilians--among them at  least 21 children--with chemical weapons. Just yesterday, doctors there  said that at least 29 patients were showing effects consistent with  exposure to chlorine munitions.   Instead of trying to stop this savage behavior, Russia stands by its  client-state. Russia continues to obfuscate and deny these horrific  attacks, despite much evidence substantiating the use of chemical  weapons.   In fact, Russia has seemingly condoned Assad's cruel use of chemical  weapons on innocent civilians. The United Nations was investigating  Assad's chemical attacks until late last year when Russia repeatedly  blocked continuing the investigation. The U.N. investigation seemed to  be getting too close to the truth for Russia's comfort, so it used its  vote to prevent the facts from being laid bare.   Unfortunately, Russia's negative influence doesn't end there. For 3  days, Russia blocked a ceasefire from taking hold in Eastern Ghouta.  For 3 days, Russia delayed much-needed food, medicine, and emergency  aid to reach the distressed civilian population. For 3 days, the  entirety of the U.N. Security Council, save Russia, agreed an immediate  ceasefire was necessary.   Even though the Security Council finally agreed to a 30-day ceasefire  in Syria, Assad flouted international order as his warplanes continued  to carry out airstrikes targeting civilians in Eastern Ghouta. He also  launched a massive ground assault against Eastern Ghouta.   Hundreds of people have been killed since the ceasefire was supposed  to have begun. The Assad regime has prevented humanitarian relief from  reaching those who are hurt or sick, and no civilians have been able to  leave because of the constant bombardment.   The man who runs the regional command in charge of U.S. troops in  Syria, General Joseph Votel, has said that Russia plays ``the role of  both arsonist and fireman--fueling tensions and then trying to resolve  them in their favor.'' Instead of reasoning with its vassal-  [[Page S1576]]  state and enforcing the ceasefire, Russia egregiously has prevented the  ceasefire from taking hold.   Once again, Russia is abetting Assad's defiance and destruction for  its own perverse purposes. At the very least, it is abdicating its role  as a permanent member of the Security Council.   What can be done about this devastating situation? Regrettably, there  are no easy answers.   But a President who previously argued that ``heinous actions by the  Bashar al-Assad regime are a consequence of the last administration's  weakness and irresolution'' has to demonstrate some resolve. I call on  President Trump to put genuine pressure on Russian President Vladimir  Putin to rein in Assad and end Russian obfuscation in the U.N. Security  Council as the carnage and number of likely war crimes mount.   Any discussion with Putin must also address deeply troubling--and  seemingly ignored--reports that Russian mercenaries controlled by  Yevgeny Prigozhin attacked U.S. Special Operations Forces in Syria,  with approval of the highest levels of the Kremlin. Prigozhin is the  same Russian oligarch who was recently indicted on charges of running a  troll farm targeting American voters.   Donald Trump has also called on ``all civilized nations'' to help end  the ``slaughter and bloodshed in Syria.'' I have to imagine that the  United States is included in his exhortation. Unhappily, he has also  recommended a 30-percent cut in our already minuscule foreign  assistance and diplomacy budget. The United States must do more to meet  the humanitarian needs of Syrians suffering the ravages of a dreadful  war.   Incredibly, at a time when a long-term diplomatic and political  solution will be needed in Syria, this administration has marginalized  our top diplomatic expertise at the Department of State. This is wildly  self-defeating.   We have taken a back seat to Russia and Iran in Syria long enough. We  can see every day the devastating results: more violence and the  further fracturing of a country and a region that have suffered at the  hands of tyrants too long.   Despite the important achievement made by our military in destroying  ISIS in Syria, Syria will remain a monumental security, humanitarian,  and governance challenge for the United States and its allies,  including Israel, for years to come. Russia and Iran are vying for the  spoils of the civil war, with civilians paying the highest price. We  don't want to leave U.S. forces in Syria indefinitely, but doing  nothing to bring a lasting peace to Syria is the worst option.   As such, President Trump, I call on your administration to come up  with a real Syria strategy to bring an end to a war--and the senseless  suffering--that has gone on for too long.                            ____________________
