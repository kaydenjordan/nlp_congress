 Mr. Speaker, today, I cast one of the proudest votes I  will ever cast in this body. I was a ``yea'' on the Respect for  Marriage Act.   When I was elected to this body, I became one of the first two openly  gay Black Members ever to serve in Congress. Growing up closeted, I  never imagined that Congress would pass a bill like this, or I would be  in a position to introduce it with Representative Nadler.   I was too young to remember Congress passing the Defense of Marriage  Act, but I know exactly where I was when the Supreme Court struck it  down in the United States v. Windsor. I had just graduated law school,  and I was studying for the bar exam. At the time, because of moderates  like Justice Kennedy, I still had faith that the Supreme Court was  committed to protecting my basic civil rights as a gay American.   That was a different Supreme Court than the one we have today. The  far-right supermajority on the Supreme Court is on a rampage against  fundamental rights. As members of the LGBTQ+ community prepare to face  the worst assault on our rights in a decade, Congress must do whatever  it takes to protect our humanity.   This bill is a great first step. It ensures that the Federal  Government will not discriminate against same-sex and interracial  couples who have been legally married. But Congress must also pass  other legislation to ensure marriage equality as the law of the land.   Mr. Speaker, I would conclude by simply saying that I am very  grateful to this Congress and to be in this place.                            ____________________
