 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1181, I  call up the bill (H.R. 88) to modify the boundary of the Shiloh  National Military Park located in Tennessee and Mississippi, to  establish Parker's Crossroads Battlefield as an affiliated area of the  National Park System, and for other purposes, with the Senate amendment  thereto, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the bill that is currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this important tax and  oversight legislation. This bill has key timely components, each of  which will help our economy continue moving in the right direction and  provide help to families and communities damaged by disaster.   First, I think it is simply irresponsible to wait until next year to  deliver crucial tax relief for families in 14 States and territories  who are struggling today to recover from this year's devastating  wildfires, hurricanes, flooding, earthquakes, and other severe storms.  California alone, 17,000 structures destroyed; nearly 90 lives lost  throughout the Carolinas; throughout these other States, so many  families waiting to hear from Congress that they will receive relief  now and not next year.   Both parties need to come together to help these communities rebuild,  and rebuild today. This bill allows disaster victims to immediately  access funds from their retirement accounts to begin their home  rebuilding. It ensures losses from these disasters are immediately  deductible and helps small businesses keep their workers on the  payroll, even when their operations have been interrupted by these  severe storms and wildfires.   Together, we can, we will, and we should help these communities  rebuild today.   Secondly, working with the Senate, we have reached common ground on  important retirement savings reforms. The House version of this bill  already passed with many Democrats' votes. These reforms will help  families save more throughout their lives, start saving earlier, while  also helping our small businesses offer retirement plans to their  valued workers.   This bill includes bold redesigns and restructuring of the Internal  Revenue Service, the first bipartisan reforms to that agency in nearly  two decades. Working together, Republicans and Democrats in the House  passed this redesign package 414-0 earlier this year.  [[Page H10470]]  It is time now to send these reforms to the President's desk to ensure  that the IRS is an agency truly focused on quality taxpayer service.   We are also offering bipartisan tax relief from some of ObamaCare's  most damaging, harmful, and egregious taxes. Specifically, this bill  provides relief from the Cadillac tax that punishes companies that  provide good healthcare to their workers, the medical device tax that  has chased thousands of jobs overseas, and relief from the health  insurance tax and the tanning tax. These harmful taxes stifle  innovation, reduce jobs, and increase the cost of families' health  insurance.   This package also makes good progress on two temporary tax provisions  that expired at the beginning of this year. Temporary tax policy is  hardly ever good tax policy. We have an opportunity here to set a new  tone for how we treat these temporary tax extenders moving forward.   Additionally, in this bill, we proactively eliminate any potential  uncertainty for our churches and community groups so nothing distracts  them from their core mission.   We have included a small number of straightforward, time-sensitive  technical corrections to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Technical  corrections, as we know, are normal and traditional with any big piece  of legislation, especially with rewriting the Tax Code. These small  tweaks are important and will ensure our new Tax Code works as  intended, to grow the economy and increase wages for middle-class  families.   I urge all my colleagues to support these measures so we can send  this important legislation to the Senate soon.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I know everyone in Congress is eager  to get back to a full week of Christmas shopping, but I am proud to  yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Rice) who  represents a community devastated by disasters in 2018.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. LaHood), a key member of the Ways and Means  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Wenstrup).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly), the leader of the retirement and savings  portion of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to  the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I recognize, under a Democrat  majority, every American will be taller and smarter and better looking.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Holding), who helped lead legislation dealing with disaster  relief.    Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Paulsen), an outstanding key member of  the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Mast).  [[Page H10475]]         Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Estes).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, today, what we have heard is: our feelings are hurt.  They are really, really hurt. This didn't go through regular order, and  so our feelings are really hurt.   Those who oppose that say: Look, we are trying to help families that  are damaged by our disasters, thousands of them. I imagine those  families who are looking at their homes that are charred and burned,  and families who are living on the second floor of their home because  it has been wiped out, I bet they would like some regular order to  their life. I bet they would like things to go back to normal. I bet  they would like to spend the holidays in that home, not safe and warm  up here in Congress, coming up with excuses on how not to help them.   We are told it is shameless to help those who are victims of  disaster, in Alabama, California, Florida, and Georgia, Hawaii,  Indiana, and North Carolina. It is shameless to help you. We can't be  bothered, is what opponents are saying today. In South Carolina, Texas,  Virginia, Wisconsin, American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, we  are busy, opponents are saying: We have got holidays. We can't help.   I believe we ought to help. Every one of us, Republicans, Democrats,  ought to provide this key disaster tax relief that those families and  communities need.   We are told it is reckless to help families and small businesses save  more earlier in life, but we know we are not a Nation of savers. We  have got to do more to help them. We used to do that in a bipartisan  way. We can do that today.   We are told we never heard of a bill that reins in the IRS, redesigns  them to become a taxpayer first agency and protects our personal data.  Yet, that bill passed this House 414-0 because we had leaders like Lynn  Jenkins from Kansas and  John Lewis from Georgia, who worked together  along with the Senate to do really thoughtful work together. Both  parties gave, and took, and found a good solution. That is in this  bill.   We are told that we ought not delay these ObamaCare taxes, but  Republicans and Democrats, together, have worked to do this in the  past, and President Obama signed them as well.   And then we are finally told that there is an attack on women's  reproductive rights. Here is what it is: in this bill we allow, when  you find out you are pregnant and you want to get a little head start  to start saving for your child's education, like preschool,  kindergarten, elementary school, get a head start on saving for trade  school or for college, we are told that somehow that is an attack on  reproductive rights.   It is a head start just for families that want to save a little more,  get one more year. Because today, you have to actually open an account  in someone else's name and transfer it later. We are just saying, look,  get a head start. If you want to start saving, we are with you. Do your  very best for your child. We think that is important.   At the end of the day, I think we ought to put aside this temper  tantrum and come together to help a lot of families in our country who  need this help.   My guess is, if our Democrat friends get their way and manage to  obstruct, they will take all of these elements right back up at the  beginning of the year. It will be their idea and their credit. I will  give them credit right now for it. I just think we ought to help people  today, and that we ought not break for any holidays until we have  really done the work that these people deserve.   As long as we are talking about people who deserve our appreciation,  I want to thank our chief tax counsel Barbara Angus, who has done just  a remarkable job leading an amazing Tax Policy Subcommittee, and staff  who have done such remarkable work for the American people and for us  here over the past 3 years.   I want to thank the staff director of our Oversight Subcommittee,  Rachel Kaldahl--the whole team--who have done remarkable work in a  bipartisan way, reforming the IRS; Stephanie Parks in the Health  Subcommittee area, on these ACA taxes; and, Machalagh Carr, our general  counsel, who shepherded us to the work today.   The bottom line is I think there are lots of ways we can work  together to help the American people, especially those in need right  now. This has bipartisan work, bipartisan thought. Let's join together  and help the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance of  my time.
