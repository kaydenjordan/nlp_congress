 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to condemn the Azerbaijani  Government's blockade of Lachin Corridor, the only road connecting  Artsakh's Armenian population to the world. Today marks the 52nd day of  the blockade.   My district is home to one of the first Armenian communities in  southern California and was formed by survivors of the Armenian  genocide. Now, in the face of Azerbaijan's aggression, many of my  constituents fear a second genocide.   Last week, I spoke with a constituent who was stuck behind the  blockade and who reported a dire situation: Over 100,000 Armenians have  been denied access to food, fuel, and medicine, and the region has been  left without heat or power this winter. If this continues, I fear a  humanitarian catastrophe.   We must make it clear to Azerbaijan that imposing its will on the  Armenian people by force is unacceptable. I call on the administration  to ensure that aid reaches the people of Artsakh.   Today, my thoughts are with those suffering under these inhumane  conditions, and I reaffirm my commitment to ensuring that Azerbaijan is  held accountable for its aggression against the Armenian people.                            ____________________
