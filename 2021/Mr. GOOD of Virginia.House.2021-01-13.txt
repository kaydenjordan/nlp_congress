 Madam Speaker, I stand today in support of  President Trump and against this sham impeachment proceeding with  literally 1 week--7 days--remaining in his term. This is merely the  culmination of a 4-year effort to overturn the will of the people and  the results for the 2016 election.   This is simply a political action intended to tarnish the legacy of a  highly successful President who led us to an incredible economy, energy  independence, reduction of taxes for millions, regulatory relief for  businesses, renewed peace in the Middle East, and stronger border  security.   This action will only serve to further offend the 75 million people  who voted for President Trump, and further deepen the division within  our Nation as we try to move forward with the peaceful transition of  power.   However, the Democrat majority has determined he is already guilty  and there is no need of a trial; and they, therefore, move forward  quickly with this phony impeachment charge.   Today, I join my Republican colleagues in standing against this  further effort to divide our Nation.
