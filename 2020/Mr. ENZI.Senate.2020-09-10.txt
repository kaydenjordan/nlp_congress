 Mr. President, I rise to submit to the Senate the budget  scorekeeping report for September 2020. This is my third scorekeeping  report since I filed the deemed budget resolution for fiscal year 2021  on May 4, 2020, as required by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019,  BBA19. The report compares current-law levels of spending and revenues  with the amounts agreed to in BBA19. In the Senate, this information is  used to determine whether budgetary points of order lie against pending  legislation. The Republican staff of the Budget Committee and the  Congressional Budget Office prepared this report pursuant to section  308(b) of the Congressional Budget Act. The information included in  this report is current through September 4, 2020.   Since I filed the last scorekeeping report on July 23, 2020, two  measures with significant enforceable budgetary effects have been  enacted. The first measure, the Great American Outdoors Act, P.L. 116- 152, established a National Parks and Public Land Legacy Restoration  Fund to address deferred maintenance on Federal lands and provided $900  million per year in permanent, mandatory funding for the Land and Water  Conservation Fund. CBO estimated this legislation, which passed the  Senate by a vote of 73-25, would increase the deficit by $17.3 billion  over the fiscal year 2021-2030 period. The second measure, the Ryan  Kules and Paul Benne Specially Adaptive Housing Improvement Act of  2019, P.L. 116-154, modified certain veteran housing and education  benefits. CBO estimated that this legislation would increase direct  spending in the near term but would ultimately be offset over the  fiscal year 2020-2030 window.   Budget Committee Republican staff prepared Tables A-G.   Table A provides the amount by which each Senate authorizing  committee exceeds or falls below its allocations for budget authority  and outlays under the fiscal year 2020 and fiscal year 2021 deemed  budget resolutions. This information is used for enforcing committee  allocations pursuant to section 302 of the CBA. Compliance remains  substantively unchanged since my last report, with the exception of the  Energy and Natural Resources and Veterans' Affairs Committees. The  enactment of the Great American Outdoors Act has caused significant  violations of ENR's allocations provided in the fiscal year 2021 deemed  budget. Enactment of P.L. 116-154 caused violations in the fiscal year  2020 and fiscal year 2021 windows for the Veterans' Affairs Committee,  which were then mitigated by deficit reduction in the out-years.   Tables B-G, which track spending related to the appropriations  process, remain unchanged from my last report.   In addition to the tables provided by Budget Committee Republican  staff, I am submitting CBO tables which I will use to enforce budget  totals approved by Congress.   Because legislation can still be enacted that would have an effect on  fiscal year 2020, CBO provided spending and revenue reports for both  fiscal year 2020 and fiscal year 2021. This information is used to  enforce aggregate spending levels in budget resolutions under CBA  section 311. CBO's estimates show that current levels of spending for  fiscal year 2020 exceed amounts in last year's budget resolution by  $68.6 billion in budget authority and $55.1 billion in outlays 2020-- Tables 1-2. Revenues are $114.8 billion below the revenue floor.  Additionally, Social Security outlays are at the levels assumed for  2020, while Social Security revenues are $16 million above the levels  assumed in budget.   For fiscal year 2021, the current law levels are $1,177.1 billion and  $667.5 billion in budget authority and outlays, respectively, below  allowable levels--2021, Tables 1-2. This spending room will be spent  down as regular appropriations bills are enacted for fiscal year 2021.  Revenues and Social Security levels are at the levels assumed by the  fiscal year 2021 deemed budget for this budget year. Over the fiscal  year 2021-2025 and 2021-2030 period, revenues are $5 million and $28  million, respectively, greater than revenue levels assumed in the  deemed budget resolution.   CBO's report also provides information needed to enforce the Senate  Pay-As-You-Go--PAYGO--rule--2021, Table 3. This rule is enforced under  section 4106 of the 2018 budget resolution. The Senate PAYGO scorecard  currently shows enacted deficit increases in every enforceable window.  The largest debit on the scorecard is $17.3 billion over the fiscal  year 2020-2030 period.   This submission also includes a table tracking the Senate's budget  enforcement activity on the floor since the enforcement filing on May  4, 2020. No points of order have been raised since my July report.   An years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years.   I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables be printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:   TABLE A.--SENATE AUTHORIZING COMMITTEES--Enacted Direct Spending Above                    (+) or Below (-) Budget Resolutions                         [In millions of dollars] ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                   2021-                                    2020      2021    2021-2025    2030 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Agriculture, Nutrition, and  Forestry     Budget Authority...........    10,430         0          0         0     Outlays....................    10,430         0          0         0 Armed Services     Budget Authority...........        32         0          0         0     Outlays....................        35         0          0         0 Banking, Housing, and Urban  Affairs     Budget Authority...........       169         0          4        21     Outlays....................       169         0          4        21 Commerce, Science, and  Transportation     Budget Authority...........         7         0          0         0     Outlays....................         7         0          0         0 Energy and Natural Resources     Budget Authority...........         0     2,820     14,420    19,410     Outlays....................         0       310      5,870    17,280 Environment and Public Works     Budget Authority...........     8,058         0          0         0     Outlays....................       415         0          0         0 Finance     Budget Authority...........    50,913         0          0         0     Outlays....................    49,452         0          0         0 Foreign Relations     Budget Authority...........         2         0          0         0     Outlays....................        37         0          0         0 Homeland Security and  Governmental Affairs     Budget Authority...........         0         0          0         0     Outlays....................         0         0          0         0 Judiciary     Budget Authority...........        12         0          0         0  [[Page S5544]]        Outlays....................        12         0          0         0 Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions     Budget Authority...........      -720         0          0         0     Outlays....................      -997         0          0         0 Rules and Administration     Budget Authority...........         0         0          0         0     Outlays....................         0         0          0         0 Intelligence     Budget Authority...........         0         0          0         0     Outlays....................         0         0          0         0 Veterans' Affairs     Budget Authority...........         1        11        -94        -1     Outlays....................         0        11        -94        -1 Indian Affairs     Budget Authority...........         0         0          0         0     Outlays....................         0         0          0         0 Small Business     Budget Authority...........         0         0          0         0     Outlays....................         0         0          0         0                                 ----------------------------------------     Total         Budget Authority.......    68,904     2,831     14,330    19,430         Outlays................    59,561       321      5,780   17,300 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ This table is current through September 4, 2020.

Therefore, the amounts shown in this report do not include   $646 million in estimated prior outlays. b For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the Senate, the aggregate spending   and revenue levels for 2021 published in the Congressional Record on May 4, 2020, by the Chairman of the   Senate Committee on the Budget pursuant to section 205 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 (P.L. 116-37) do   not include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts.
