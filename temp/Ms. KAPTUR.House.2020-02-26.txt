 Madam Speaker, I rise in commemoration of the life of  Boris Nemtsov who was tragically assassinated by Vladimir Putin's  Russian regime 5 years ago this week in Moscow. Boris served as deputy  prime minister and was a prominent voice for political freedom in  Russia itself.   Cities across the world have commemorated Boris' sacrifice, including  here in Washington, D.C., which named the square outside the Russian  Embassy Boris Nemtsov Plaza. Just recently, Czech authorities in Prague  have joined in solidarity.   In the years since Boris' assassination, Russia's efforts to  dismantle democratic institutions across the globe have increased,  including here in the United States where they are continuing to  interfere in the elections of this year.   We must stand together against Russia's aggression and malign  behavior. Sanctions are a commonsense step.   Today, I call upon the Trump administration to broaden stronger,  targeted sanctions on Russia. To keep backpedaling, as the Trump  administration has done, on an enemy of liberty is not acceptable.                            ____________________
