 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  bipartisan supply chain provisions included in the House-passed America  COMPETES Act.   Every day, we are hearing from our constituents about inflation and  rising prices, and one critical factor contributing to these issues is  continued disruptions in the domestic supply chain.   The America COMPETES supply chain subtitle establishes an office of  manufacturing security and resilience within the Department of Commerce  to monitor, identify, map, and mitigate supply chain vulnerabilities.   It also authorizes billions in grants and loans to support the  manufacturing of critical goods, equipment, and cutting-edge  technologies that are essential to our national and economic security.   The investments included in the bipartisan America COMPETES supply  chain subtitle will allow us to preempt future shocks to our supply  chain, and we must be proactive in strengthening our manufacturing  capacity to secure our future.   I hope that this critical subtitle remains in the bill and is  retained in any final package the conference process yields.                            ____________________
