 Madam Speaker, if Roe v. Wade is overturned, it would  pose the greatest threat to reproductive freedom we have seen in half a  century.   But let's be very clear: although many States are passing radical  laws banning abortion, contraception, and criminalizing healthcare,  right now Roe is still the law of the land, abortion is healthcare, and  abortion is still legal.   Abortion is an integral part of reproductive healthcare and should be  safe, legal, and accessible to all. Right now, clinics and funds are  able to support people in accessing abortion healthcare with compassion  and care.   One organization in my district, the Delaware County Women's Center,  serves more than 1,600 patients annually. I thank the staff at the  Women's Center, especially Lizbeth and Jen, for their commitment to  accessible reproductive health services.   If a rightwing extremist court overturns Roe, we will not go back. A  strong majority of Americans are stepping up to support the freedom of  every person, regardless of where they live or how much money they  have, to make their own decisions about their health, their bodies, and  their futures.                            ____________________
