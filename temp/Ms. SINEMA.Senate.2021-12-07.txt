 Mr. President, I was necessarily absent, but had I been  present I would have voted yes on rollcall No. 478, on the Motion to  Invoke Cloture on Executive Calendar No. 567, Jessica Rosenworcel, to  be a Member of the Federal Communications Commission.                            ____________________
