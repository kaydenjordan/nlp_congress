 Madam President, we are at a critical  time in our Nation's history. I think we can all sense the opportunity  that is before us. Through the challenges of COVID and the death of  George Floyd and its aftermath, we can affect real, lasting change.   Perhaps the most famous line in Dr. King's letter from Birmingham  jail is ``Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.'' Let  me say that one more time. ``Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice  everywhere.'' More than at any time I can remember, people of all ages  and races are standing up together for the idea that Lady Justice must  be blind.   Although COVID has delayed this now-annual reading of Dr. King's  letter, it has truly never been more important than it is right now.   I want to thank all of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle for  reading today and Senator Jones for putting this together again.   Every time we hear them, the words of Dr. King teach us something  new. I hope the Nation hears these words with an open mind and an open  heart and we all come together unified for a bigger purpose.   Senator Jones, let me close by saying that the letter from the  Birmingham jail was a letter written to the clergy of the time. As  Senator Hawley was speaking about the importance of standing up for our  religious liberties, the one thing he said at the end was that we  should stand up now for all the issues facing our Nation--the economic  issues, the racial issues.   I thought it important and appropriate that following that speech,  you have the reading of the letter from the Birmingham jail to the  leaders, the religious leaders, to become involved and engaged in this  current struggle. That is how change comes to America. Thank you for  leading this process.
