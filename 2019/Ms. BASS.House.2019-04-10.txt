 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on the floor of the House of  Representatives to formally recognize and honor the legacy of Ermias  Asghedom, known to his community and the neighborhoods of south Los  Angeles and beyond as Nipsey Hussle.   As noted in the record I will be submitting shortly, Nipsey Hussle  used the platform he created with his music to lift our community as he  climbed.   In his business ventures, his investments, his philanthropy, his  community engagement, every step of the way, he had a sole purpose of  bettering the community he came from.   A humble visionary, he saw the overlooked and welcomed the dismissed.  He reminded our community that the power we hold is the power of where  we come from and that awareness of that power can never be taken from  us.   He will be remembered by south Los Angeles as a protector, an  inspirator, a father, a brother, and an unabashed son of south Los  Angeles.   For all he was given, he gave back. And for that legacy, south Los  Angeles has been changed forever.   Mr. Speaker, I will now be submitting this record honoring his  legacy.                            ____________________
