 Madam Speaker, in honor of National Foster Care Month, I  would like to address a vital issue in today's foster care system: the  need for more foster care parents. I would also like to recognize a few  foster care organizations in Nebraska's Second Congressional District.  These organizations embrace children in the foster care system and are  committed to helping youth find permanent homes through foster parents,  so that they, too, can experience love, stability, and the freedom to  reach their full potential, regardless of their circumstances.   Lutheran Family Services of Nebraska has been an advocate in the  child foster care system for more than 125 years. This year, their  mission is to secure 100 foster families who can offer a mature and  stable environment.   Boys Town Nebraska, where I was fortunate to speak this last weekend  at their high school graduation, directly serves about 30,000 children  every year and believes that foster parents are the heart of high- quality foster care by offering children protection, permanency, and  comfort.   The Child Saving Institute values the overall well-being of children  by offering free, trauma-informed training to individuals and couples  who want to serve as foster parents.   And the Nebraska Children's Home Society not only strives to find  permanent homes for children, but they also address the need to foster  teenagers.   All four of these organizations provide care and assistance to the  abused and neglected and encourages the need for foster parents for  children of all ages.   Each year, hundreds of Nebraska youth are removed from their homes  due to unfortunate circumstances. Many of them fear where they will end  up or if they will ever find their forever home.   My wife, Angie, and I adopted two children, Austin and Jessica, from  the foster care system when they were just 8 and 9 years old. Even  though we already had two sons, we knew that there were not enough  homes for older children and siblings. Austin and Jessica are blessings  to our family. Even though foster parenting was challenging, choosing  to adopt them was one of the best and most rewarding decisions Angie,  my wife, and I have ever made.   Even though foster children are hurting, they are just looking for  someone to be committed to them and help them succeed. It is time to  realize that everyone can play a part in enhancing the lives of  children and youth in foster care and that these children just want  someone to care for them. It is the hope that one day, through  opportunity and lessons, these children will grow up and provide safety  for their own children, benefiting future generations.   The idea of children being placed with stable and devoted families is  not a partisan issue. I am very appreciative to my colleagues from both  sides of the aisle, and I am thankful to serve as a co-chair for the  Foster Care Caucus. I will continue to be an advocate for foster  children and encourage the need for foster parents. We must remember  that every child, no matter the age, is worthy of love and deserves a  family.                            ____________________
