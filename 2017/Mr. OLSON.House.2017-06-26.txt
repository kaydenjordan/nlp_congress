 Mr. Speaker, in the summer of 2008, at the home of Ricky  and Victoria Collins, I met the most inspirational woman in Texas  history: First Lady Laura Bush. Five years later, I learned there was  one more woman who is more inspirational: Michelle Collins, the  daughter of Ricky and Victoria.   In 2013, Michelle learned that she had acute childhood leukemia. Her  dreams of being a professional dancer were fading. She endured 2 years  of brutal chemotherapy, 44 straight days in the hospital after her  diagnosis, 18 spinal taps, and fever after fever with her depleted  immune system.   Michelle won her battle for life with family, faith, and art. As part  of the children's art project at MDA Cancer Center, she designed  Christmas ornaments that sold like ``hotcakes.''   Recovered, she graduated last month from St. Agnes Academy in  Houston, Texas. In 2 months, she will enroll at the University of Texas  at Austin.   Look out world, Michelle Collins is dancing again on center stage.                            ____________________
