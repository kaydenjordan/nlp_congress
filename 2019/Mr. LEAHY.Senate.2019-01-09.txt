 Mr. President, I just note parenthetically that virtually  every Republican and every Democrat in this body has voted for the  bills that would open the government. Every single Democrat in this  body is willing--if the Republican leader would bring  [[Page S81]]  those bills back up--to vote for them, and the government would open.  So I hope the Republican leader will allow the government to open.  There are a lot of people who need to go back to work, and I will speak  about this later today. It is going to be 10, 15 below zero in my home  State at one point this week, making it more urgent that we reopen the  government. We also have government contractors who would like to get  back to work.                          Catholic Clergy Misconduct    Now let me speak about a different matter. I am going to speak as an  individual more than as a Senator. My wife Marcelle and I, as  Catholics, have shared the concern of many, whether Catholics or not,  about the continued revelation of often gross misconduct on the part of  some in the clergy and in the hierarchy of our church. We have seen  this throughout the United States, including in our own State of  Vermont.   I have rarely--rarely--spoken about religious issues in my capacity  as a Senator, because I feel one's religion is private and certainly  not political. However, I have spoken out about my concern and my  dismay with what we have heard, and Marcelle shares those concerns with  me.   I mention this because this past Sunday at mass at Holy Trinity  Parish in the District of Columbia, we heard a sermon preached by  Father Benjamin Hawley, a member of the Jesuits. When he finished his  sermon, I will freely admit I wanted to stand up and applaud him. He  spoke about what the church is finally doing in facing up to this, but  then he spoke about how he was reacting and how one hopes we might  react, what the reaction should be from the Pope straight down to every  member of the clergy and every member of the laity. Except for some  sermons preached by Marcelle's brother, Father Claude Pomerleau, I do  not remember being so touched or affected by a sermon.   I had not met Father Hawley before, but after mass, I spoke with him,  and I asked him if I could have his permission to put his sermon into  the Congressional Record. He agreed.   I ask unanimous consent that the homily by Father Benjamin Hawley,  S.J., of January 6, 2019, be printed in the Record at this time.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                    Homily for the Feast of the Epiphany         Today we celebrate the Feast of the Epiphany, the       appearance of Jesus the Messiah to the world.        In classical Greek the word ``epiphany'' can refer to the       appearance of dawn, as Isaiah, writing 500 years before       Jesus' birth, does in our first reading: ``See, darkness       covers the earth, and thick clouds cover the peoples; but       upon you the Lord shines, and over you appears his glory . .       . Raise your eyes and look about . . .''        This appearance can intimate--Jesus' touching your heart or       mine with peace in time of difficulty. Or the appearance can       be cosmic--the Prince of Peace revealed to Herod and to the       magi--and to our world today.        Is it possible to see Jesus' latest epiphany in three       recent events?        First, about 280 American bishops are in retreat just       outside Chicago--no lay staff, no other priests. Guiding       their retreat is Raniero Cantalamessa, a Capuchin priest, who       is the Preacher to the Papal Household. I have heard him       speak, and he is excellent.        Second, a hard-hitting eight-page letter from the Pope is       guiding their prayer.        Francis asks them to reflect on ``the steps you are taking       to combat the culture of abuse and to deal with the crisis of       credibility'' (page 1).        ``The church's credibility has been seriously undercut and       diminished by these sins and crimes, but even more by the       efforts made to deny or conceal them . . . (T)he mentality       that would cover things up, far from helping to resolve       conflicts, enabled them to fester and cause even greater hurt       to the network of relationships that today we are called to       heal and restore'' (p2).        ``Loss of credibility calls for a specific approach, since       it cannot be regained by issuing stern decrees or by simply       creating new committees or improving flow charts, as if we       were in charge of a department of human resources'' (p3).        Then, the Pope then takes them to task on infighting:        ``The loss of credibility also raises painful questions       about the way we relate to one another . . . (p3) This       requires not only a new approach to management, but also a       change in our mind-set, our way of prayer, our handling of       power and money, our exercise of authority and our way of       relating to one another and to the world around us . . .       (pp3-4).        Without (a) clear and decisive focus, everything we do       risks being tainted by self-referentiality, self-preservation       and defensiveness, and thus doomed from the start'' (p4).        ``Let us try to break the vicious cycle of recrimination,       undercutting and discrediting, by avoiding gossip and slander       in the pursuit of a path of prayerful and contrite acceptance       of our limitations and sins, and the promotion of dialogue,       discussion and discernment . . .'' (pp5-6).        Finally, third, the presidents of bishops conferences       worldwide will meet in Rome in late February in a meeting       organized by four church officials:        Blase Cupich, Cardinal-Archbishop of Chicago;        Oswald Cracias, Cardinal-Archbishop of Mumbai, India, and       member of the Pope's council of cardinals;        Charles Scicluna, Archbishop of Malta and head of       investigating abuses in the Vatican's Congregation for the       Doctrine of Faith; and        Jesuit Father Hans Zollner, president of the Center for the       Protection of Minors at the Gregorian University, the Jesuit       university in Rome.        The pope's letter seems to me right on target in tone and       content. A retreat for discernment is very Ignatian, and the       Vatican meeting will ensure worldwide applicability.        So, can you and I believe that Jesus' epiphany is the       motive force behind the bishops' retreat, the pope's letter       and February bishops meeting?        We are called by Jesus himself to be hopeful. But we are       also called to be thoughtful, discerning good and evil around       us. I find myself seesawing between hope and doubt, between       hope and fear, between hope and no-hope, as I reflect on the       good and evil. I want to have hope, but I have to admit that       having hope is hard, sometimes nearly impossible.        It is true that Jesus grew up and became the Messiah. But       Herod's murdering a generation of children went unpunished,       as far as I know, and the historical record on mass murderers       or mass abusers isn't promising.        I am grateful for what the bishops and Francis are now       doing. But I keep asking myself why it takes so much external       pressure to get them to do the right, decent thing that seems       so obvious and not even that hard.        Some days I feel like Candide, returning from his hero's       journey to cultivate his own garden. In my garden I can be       hopeful. But I can't live a solitary life. And when I re-      engage, I become discouraged when I find the bishops'       response so slow and so begrudging.        But then I wonder about how God's justice and mercy might       be made real in the next life, especially for bishops,       cardinals and popes, but for us too. I imagine Purgatory not       as a place of hellfire and smoke, but rather as a place where       kindly but determined angels would sit, like referees in       black and white stripped outfits, each one in comfortable       room in front of a large flat-screen TV, each with a recently       arrived soul.        In a gentle way the angel-referee would guide the deceased       not through an instant replay but a slow replay of their       lives, stopping the action and asking each bishop, cardinal       and pope--and each one of us--to reconsider individual events       in their lives, and asking questions like, What were you       thinking? How did that work out--for you and for everyone       else? If you had to do it again, how might you choose?        There would be no scoreboard, because God would want       everyone to win, and no time clock. Everyone would have time       and all eternity--with the angel-referee's prompting--to       rethink what they had said and done.        And some would have a very painful time of it, because       angels are messengers of God's justice. Their job is to       reveal justice to the minds of souls as yet living in       darkness. And the angel-referees would make the final call.        With that much time and such wise, persistent guides, most       would probably make it to die podium for their trophy. Angels       might have to guide a few of the obdurate to long-term       parking, but such souls would have had a chance and in the       end would have put themselves there.        In the meantime you and I are on the seesaw.        Jesus began his life in his mother's lap in the stable, as       the great artists have shown us, but surrounded by the blood       and death of children and the corruption of the Jewish king.        Jesus ended his life in his mother's lap, as Michaelangelo       shows us in the Pieta, still surrounded by the blood, death       and the corruption of civic and religious leaders.        My question to myself is always, Does it really have to be       this hard? And the answer seems to be, No, it doesn't have to       be. But, Yes, it is going to be this hard as long as people,       especially people in positions of power, make self-serving       choices. The blood, death and corruption are constants in       human life. And yet he is the Prince of Peace and the source       of our hope.        On this great Feast we can come to realize that, if you and       I have to live on the seesaw, then at least we can remain       anchored to hope there, because Jesus, the source of our       hope, accompanied by his Blessed Mother, has the power to       anchor us there in love.        So, in our Eucharist today let's share divine love and hope       with one another in communion and leave here, imbued with new       hope to share with our world, so the world too can find hope       and peace.     I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    It is now day 19 of the Trump shutdown, 19 days that the  Federal Government of the oldest democracy and the world's only  superpower has been functioning on only half of its cylinders.   I have spoken multiple times about the devastating impact this  reckless and unnecessary shutdown is having on the Federal workforce at  domestic departments and agencies--departments like Homeland Security,  Agriculture, Transportation, Justice, Interior, and Commerce, agencies  like Customs and Border Patrol, the Drug Enforcement Agency, and the  National Park Service.   These departments and agencies have furloughed and stopped paying  hundreds of thousands of employees who, as a result, are idle and no  longer able to do the jobs that millions and millions of Americans  depend on. Hundreds of thousands more are working without pay until the  shutdown ends.   The President, a billionaire who has never had to worry about not  being able to pay the rent, says he can relate. If he actually believes  that, he is alone.   Programs are on hold, and contracts are being cancelled, for which  the Federal Government is liable for penalties. Government shutdowns  don't save money; they cost billions of dollars and have lasting  consequences. And who pays? American taxpayers.   This is a disgrace, and it is made even more so by the fact that it  is entirely avoidable were it not for the intransigence, indifference,  and obsession of one person, President Donald Trump.   An obsession not with border security--we are all for that, and there  is more than a billion dollars in prior appropriations for border  security waiting to be spent. In fact, we have offered another $1.3  billion for fiscal year 2019. The White House never says anything about  that.   No, the President's myopic obsession--repeated on national television  last night--is with building a 30-foot-high wall--mostly on desolate  land that the government will have to seize from private owners--along  our southern border. The price tag to U.S. taxpayers would be at least  $18 billion and likely more, a price tag that at campaign rally after  campaign rally he promised Mexico would pay.   There are multiple reasons why that is a terrible idea, why it won't  stop illegal migration, why it won't stop illicit drugs, and why it  would be a colossal waste of taxpayer dollars, which I have discussed  before and will again.   Today I want to speak briefly about the impact the Trump shutdown is  having not on the Federal Government's domestic programs and workforce,  but its impact on U.S. national security and global leadership.   It is worth asking: What made the United States the world's  superpower and a global leader in the first place?   Of course, one reason is our superior Armed Forces. That, I suspect,  is the answer President Trump would give, but he would be only partly  correct.   Even more important are the ideals enshrined in our Constitution and  Bill of Rights, our democratic institutions and coequal branches of  government, our diverse citizenry, and our regional and global  alliances and partnerships. Without these, our men and women in uniform  would have precious little to defend.   Today, the global supremacy and influence of the United States are  being challenged like no time since the Cold War with the former Soviet  Union. Why? One need look no further than 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.   Since his first days in office, President Trump has disparaged  longstanding friends and allies. He has withdrawn from international  agreements negotiated by past Republican and Democratic  administrations, announced plans to withdraw from a key nuclear  nonproliferation treaty, and proposed drastic cuts to the operations  and programs of the State Department and the U.S. Agency for  International Development, which implement foreign policy.   Now the State Department, like other Federal departments and  agencies, is swept up in the Trump shutdown.   Our choices are obvious: We can engage with the world by affirming  our commitment to our ideals, by continuing to strengthen our  democratic institutions, by empowering our diplomats and by expanding  our global alliances and partnerships.   Or we can withdraw, even to the point of shutting down the Federal  Government, cede the global stage to others whose interests are often  adverse to our own, and become the captives of simplistic campaign  slogans, xenophobic antimigrant hysteria, and a manufactured national  security emergency.   The President said the country needed a ``good'' shutdown. He said  that: a ``good'' shutdown. There is no such thing.   He said he would be ``proud'' to take the ``mantle of blame'' for  shutting down the government. Then the next day he blamed Democrats,  rejecting out of hand our proposal to pass the six appropriations bills  that already received overwhelming bipartisan support in the  Republican-controlled Senate.   Most of those bills have nothing to do with border security, but the  President is obstinately holding hostage thousands of Federal programs  funded in those bills, including the paychecks for the people who  implement them, which harms all Americans.   With a stroke of a pen, the President could reopen the government and  continue negotiations on border security; yet he refuses, and instead  he flippantly said the shutdown could last ``months'' or even  ``years.''   What has this reckless abuse of executive power meant for our  standing in the world? What has it meant for our diplomats at the State  Department and in our embassies overseas whose job is to protect our  global interests, to maintain our alliances and partnerships, to assist  the millions of Americans working, studying and serving overseas, and  to protect our security?   As of yesterday, 34 percent--more than one-third--of U.S. direct-hire  State Department employees in Washington and at our embassies around  the world have been furloughed. That is nearly 10,000 employees at the  State Department alone who are unable to do their jobs. Others are  working without pay.   If the shutdown continues, more paychecks will be withheld, the  number of furloughed employees will increase, and there will be a  parallel shutting down of diplomacy, of programs, of contracts, and of  our ability to engage with both allies and adversaries.   The effects are far reaching.   The Bureau of Diplomatic Security will run short of funds, forcing  the State Department to deplete resources used to keep other programs  operating order to protect our diplomats and facilities overseas or  eventually relying on unpaid contractors to do the job.   Roughly 85 percent of the employees of the State Department's Office  of Inspector General have already been furloughed. Oversight of waste,  fraud, and abuse has virtually ground to a halt.   Vietnam, a country of nearly 100 million people bordering China, is  becoming a key security partner in the Pacific region; yet thanks to  the Trump shutdown, key employees at our embassy and USAID mission in  Hanoi  [[Page S90]]  were furloughed. The American flag is flying, and the lights are on,  but that is about it.   This is illustrative of what is happening in every region of the  world, and it does not take a lot of imagination to predict the  consequences of a longer shutdown.   For example, the State Department and U.S. Embassies regularly use  their social media accounts to update Americans overseas of important  developments that potentially threaten their safety. This was the case  during the recent tsunami in Indonesia. How will the State Department  respond to the next natural disaster when its social media accounts-- tools that are relied on increasingly in today's world--have fallen  silent?   What about the loss of U.S. influence on the world stage? With most  official travel suspended, how do we ensure that our priorities are  protected at the next trade, arms control, or international health  summit?   What do you suppose the leaders of China, Russia, Iran, Syria and  North Korea--not to mention allies like Great Britain, Canada, and  Japan--think about this?   If I were President Putin, or President Xi Jinping, or Ayatollah  Khamenei, I would be celebrating. What could be better than U.S.  Embassies operating on life support and U.S. diplomats sidelined, while  the U.S. Government is shut down over building a wall across the  southwest desert?   Does President Trump think the rest of the world will sit idly by,  waiting until the U.S. Government reopens? The opposite will happen.  They will take full advantage in ways that will not be short lived.   While massive humanitarian crises imperil the lives of millions of  people in Yemen, Syria, Burma, Venezuela, and Central Africa, the White  House is embracing a diminishing role for the United States.   While Russia meddles in our elections and expands its influence in  the Middle East, while China buys the allegiance of countries in  Africa, Asia, and our own hemisphere by investing billions in ports,  energy and transportation projects, the State Department is shutting  down programs and sending its people home.   It is not just the State Department. USAID, the Peace Corps, the  Millennium Challenge Corporation, they are all furloughing personnel  and cancelling new activities.   With the exception of the U.S. military, if this drags on, the United  States will be a superpower in name only. An exaggeration? Don't bet on  it.   While our diplomats are furloughed, rather than use the funds  Congress already provided for border security that remain unspent, the  President has threatened to ignore the legislative process, declare a  national emergency where none exists, and order the Pentagon to pay for  the wall that he swore Mexico would pay for.   Such a flagrant, unwarranted misuse of authority and circumvention of  the democratic process would be immediately challenged by Congress and  in the courts.   Regardless of the outcome, what would it say about our commitment to  democracy around the world? How would it be perceived outside this  country, particularly by autocrats in Syria, Saudi Arabia, the  Philippines, Brazil, Egypt, Russia, Hungary, Poland, or China?   It would be welcomed as a green light for declaring a state of  emergency and wielding unchecked executive power--without regard for  the legislature or judiciary--as a pretext to do virtually anything.  Shut down the independent press. Arrest judges and opposition political  leaders. Use the army to police the streets. Close the borders. All in  the name of a manufactured national emergency.   This is already happening. In Guatemala, which purports to be a  democracy, President Morales is openly defying rulings by  constitutional court magistrates who are courageously defending the  institutions of justice that are under assault, and the police are  ignoring orders of the attorney general.   In Egypt, President al Sisi has locked up tens of thousands of  political opponents and other dissidents. In Turkey, President Erdogan  has done the same. President Trump has praised both leaders.   In Brazil, President Bolsonaro, a former military officer, has vowed  to open up the Amazon to mining, logging, and agribusiness. He wants to  give the police a free hand to use lethal force with impunity. He is  gearing up to crack down on civil liberties. The White House has  applauded.   No one disputes that the United States has experienced national  emergencies, when we faced a potentially existential threat. Pearl  Harbor and the 9/11 attacks are obvious examples. The Cuban missile  crisis could have been.   A future deadly disease pandemic that infects thousands of Americans  and rapidly spreads out of control might qualify.   The President talks as if the sky is falling in Texas, but any  rational person recognizes that the situation on our southwest border  is not remotely a national emergency. To call Central American families  fleeing poverty and violence a threat to the security of the world's  wealthiest, most powerful country is an embarrassment, especially when  the Border Patrol's own data shows the number of migrants apprehended  at the southern border has plummeted over the past 10 years.   The White House, grasping for arguments to justify the President's  broken campaign promise that Mexico would pay for his wall, has played  fast and loose with the facts in a desperate attempt to incite fear  among the American people.   The President and Vice President have shamelessly trumpeted all kinds  of wildly inaccurate and grossly misleading statistics about migrants,  terrorists, asylum applicants, unaccompanied children, and illegal  drugs that are contradicted by their own agencies.   The White House says thousands of migrant terrorists have been  apprehended, falsely suggesting they were stopped at the Mexican  border. Almost none of them were.   We face a far greater threat from al Qaeda and ISIS using social  media to inspire extremists already in the U.S. or Canada to commit  terrorist acts. The last thing anyone would do who is genuinely  concerned about terrorism is to shut down the government and withhold  funding from the very agencies whose job it is to track down and arrest  those people.   The real threat to our national security is shutting down the  government, furloughing 10,000 State Department employees, telling our  embassies to cancel programs and our diplomats to stay home.   While we come to grips with practical ways of strengthening our  borders so we can more humanely and efficiently process migrants who  request asylum, which we must do, we must also stay focused on the real  threats to our national security.   We need our embassies at full strength. We need our diplomats in the  room with their European, Russian, Chinese, South Korean, Central  American, Middle Eastern, and African counterparts.   We need to strengthen NATO and our other alliances, so we can rely on  our allies and partners to support us in responding to real national  emergencies.   We need to expand our cyber security, nonproliferation, international  broadcasting and other public diplomacy and internet freedom programs,  military education and training, maritime security, law enforcement,  and other international assistance programs. Instead, because of the  President's obsession with the wall, these and other State Department  programs are stuck in neutral, and the people who implement them are at  home.   We need to act like a superpower at the United Nations, in NATO, and  in the many other regional organizations where decisions are made that  directly affect our interests and our security.   None of this is possible during a government shutdown, a shutdown  that with each passing day erodes our democracy, weakens our global  leadership, and threatens our security.   We all know this. The American people know this. The world knows  this. The President needs to reopen the government and start acting  like the defender of the Constitution and of our national security that  the country needs.   I again urge the Republican leader to let us vote on the bipartisan,  six-bill minibus, and when it passes, he and the entire Republican  Caucus should urge the President to sign it.   That is our job, as an independent, coequal branch of government: to  vote,  [[Page S91]]  to appropriate the funds so the Federal Government can work for the  American people. It is not our job to sit on the sidelines while the  wheels of government grind to a halt because the President is  recklessly holding it hostage.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
