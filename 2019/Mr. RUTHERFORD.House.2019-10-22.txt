 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the  secretive and un-American impeachment investigation taking place right  now in the House of Representatives.   Behind closed doors, our President is being tried, tried by my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle using an undemocratic process  that wouldn't hold up in any American court of law.   Democrats talk about Russian collusion while using Soviet-style  investigative techniques against President Trump, denying him due  process.   In fact, one of my Democratic colleagues from New York recently said:  ``The President says he is innocent, so all we are saying is prove  it.''   Really? Mr. Speaker, I spent 41 years in law enforcement, and I know  a little something about due process, and that sure isn't it.   What is taking place before us is an insult to fairness, a mockery of  justice, and a political witch hunt designed to reverse the will of the  American voter. There were over 62 million people who voted for this  President.    The Speaker hasn't even formally held a vote on whether or not this  is an impeachment inquiry. If this is an impeachment inquiry like the  Speaker says, come to the floor and hold a vote.   Some have called this process fair because Republican Members of  certain committees--only certain committees--are allowed to be in the  room during depositions and interviews. However, they are not even  allowed to call witnesses or openly discuss the smears that have been  selectively leaked by the Democrats.   But this is not about us. It is not about the Members of this  Congress. It is about transparency for the American public. The  American people deserve to know what is going on.   Let's recap the last 3 years of searching for a smoking gun that just  did not exist.   First, Democrats claimed that President Trump colluded with Russians  to influence the 2016 election. That was the message played every  single night on television--collusion, collusion, collusion.   Then, Democrats supported Robert Mueller and told him to go find that  collusion, which, of course, he didn't.   So they dragged Robert Mueller into a congressional hearing room, and  this time, they had no problem being open and transparent before the  cameras.   But when that failed, I thought the dog and pony show was going to be  over. I had to hope that my colleagues on the other side would get this  legislative body back to work for the American public, but, no, here we  go again. We have a whistleblower with secondary information, which the  only way they could do that was to change the rule in secret--secret  depositions in the underbelly of Congress, targeted leaks, and rampant  speculation.   Mr. Speaker, this is the House of Representatives, not the KGB. It is  about time my friends on the other side of the aisle started acting  like it. If you actually believe the President has committed an  impeachable offense, why hide the truth from the public?   If you don't like this President, you will have an opportunity to  vote against him in November 2020. Until then, let's stop wasting the  taxpayers' hard-earned money on frivolous, expensive investigations to  nowhere and come together to solve America's problems.                            ____________________
