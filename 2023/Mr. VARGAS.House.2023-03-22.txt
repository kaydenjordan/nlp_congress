 Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of Fred T. Macedo.  Fred was born in Carlsbad, California, on May 14, 1944, and attended  Carlsbad High School where he helped to win his school's first football  CIF championship.   In 1965, Fred joined the Laborers' International Union of North  America, LIUNA, Local 89. Fred enjoyed a 37-year-career at LIUNA,  building numerous high-profile projects that had lasting impact on the  San Diego region. His legacy can be seen today through his work on the  Coronado Bay Bridge, Units 2 and 3 of the San Onofre Power Plant, the  San Elijo Water Reclamation Plant, and the Point Loma Water Filtration  Plant.   After retiring from LIUNA, Fred continued his service as president of  the Advisory Council, where he was active in community service  activities.   He has helped to provide a space for retiring members to give back to  their union and the broader community. Fred will be remembered for his  contributions to the County of San Diego where he was a friend and  mentor to many. His family and community are  [[Page H1319]]  forever grateful for the contributions he has made in our region.   San Diego lost a giant when we lost Fred T. Macedo.                            ____________________
