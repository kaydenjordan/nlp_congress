 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to co-lead H.R. 8844 with my  colleagues, Congressman Evans, Congresswoman Newman, and Congresswoman  Kim.   I also thank Chairwoman Velazquez and Ranking Member Luetkemeyer for  their support on this bill.   It is good to see Republicans and Democrats working in a bipartisan  fashion on the Small Business Committee. When we can come to an  agreement, the American people benefit.   H.R. 8844 would reauthorize the State Trade Expansion Program for 4  fiscal years. STEP provides financial awards to States to assist small  businesses with export development.   To demonstrate the importance of this program, I would like to  highlight an example of a business that has benefited from the STEP  program in my district.   Paraclipse Systems, LLC, based in Columbus, Nebraska, manufacturers-- of all things--nonintrusive fly--as in the insect--control products  that you can install in your home.   With a $10,000 investment, Paraclipse was able to expand its sales  and create 14 jobs.   STEP leverages Federal resources to ensure small businesses across  the country can compete in the global marketplace.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be a co-lead of this legislation, and I  urge my colleagues to support the bill.
