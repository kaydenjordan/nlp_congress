 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this imperfect bill.  [[Page H2702]]    Mr. Speaker, look, I would have much rather voted for a clean debt  limit increase as we did three times under the previous President. I do  believe it is profoundly wrong that Republicans chose to hold our  economy hostage, using the American people as leverage to demand  concessions, and it was unnecessary.   We are in a divided House. They have all the leverage they need to  negotiate this through the regular appropriations process.   Our values sometimes overlap, but they don't here when they want to  protect the wealthiest tax cheats and we just want everyone to pay  their fair share.   Look, President Biden and his negotiating team worked skillfully and  successfully to prevent a majority of the draconian tax cuts. This bill  could have been so much worse, but it would be a catastrophe if we  didn't pass it.   Mr. Speaker, I will vote ``yes,'' and I continue to urge my  colleagues to permanently abolish the debt ceiling, which could cause a  real disaster someday soon if we don't get rid of it.
