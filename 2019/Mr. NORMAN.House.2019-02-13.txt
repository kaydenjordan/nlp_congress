 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to raise my voice for those who  have no voice.   You know, while we may have disagreements in this Chamber, I never  thought I would have to come to this floor for this reason, to denounce  the killing of children after they have been born. But I am here today  because one of our Nation's governors has endorsed infanticide in all  but name.   Even though the media may be distracted by the Governor's latest  scandal, I refuse to allow this atrocity to be ignored. It is wrong,  plain and simple.   I wish to live in a nation where we respect the sanctity of all human  life; where condemning the murder of a child is not for debate, but a  matter of course. Until then, I will not stand by silently. I will  continue to call out those who attempt to corrupt our values, whether  through State laws allowing abortion on demand or Governors commending  abortion.   These actions do not represent the values of the American people.  They represent the views of a small but powerful group of ideologues  with no respect for the sanctity of life or the rights of the  voiceless.   I find it bizarre that the party of birthright citizenship will not  endorse the birthright to life.
