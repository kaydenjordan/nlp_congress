 Mr. Speaker, the American people are fed up with spam  robocalls.   Today, we are bringing to bear the full weight of the Federal  Government to go after those calls. We have an obligation to do what is  right for the people.   The TRACED Act utilizes all known weapons in the arsenal, from  cooperation, to investigation, including enforcement.   I am especially proud that the TRACED Act includes my bill, the Spam  Calls Tax Force Act, which will bring together agencies, the private  sector, and consumer advocates to shut down spam robocalls. All hands  on deck is necessary here.   I thank Chairman Pallone and Ranking Member Walden for their  leadership, and I also thank my partners on the Spam Calls Task Force:  the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves), the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright), and the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Soto).   I am filled with optimism that the work of the people goes on:  Members of both parties coming together, setting differences aside to  work on commonsense solutions to real problems.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the TRACED Act.
