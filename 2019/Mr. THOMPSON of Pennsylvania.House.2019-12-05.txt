 Mr. Speaker, recently, I had the  pleasure of traveling back to Pennsylvania's 15th Congressional  District to celebrate the careers of three dedicated public servants in  Centre County.   Last month, Centre County Treasurer Richard Fornicola and Centre  County Controller Chuck Witmer served their last day at the Centre  County Courthouse and began their much-deserved retirements.   Rich Fornicola began his term as Centre County treasurer in January  2000 and has worked diligently over the past two decades overseeing  every penny that was received and disbursed by Centre County, including  hunting permits and fishing licenses, as well as overseeing bids for  county contracts.   Chuck Witmer has spent 15 years in public service in Centre County,  having worked as the deputy controller for just under 4 years before  being elected to serve as county controller. Over the years, Chuck has  exhibited fantastic leadership that includes overseeing the county  ledger, seeing the budget is adhered to, completing the county audit,  and more.   This week, Prothonotary and Clerk of Courts Debra Immel will be  serving her last day at the courthouse as well. Debra began her career  in Centre County in 1976 as a department clerk and quickly rose through  the ranks of deputy prothonotary and acting prothonotary. In 1999,  Debra was elected to her current position and has served in county  government ever since.   Mr. Speaker, together, these individuals have given more than 90  years of service to Centre County, and they have worked hard to make  Centre County a better place to live. I would like to congratulate Rich  and Chuck and Debra on their retirements and wish them all the best in  their new life chapter.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the repeal of prohibition. On this day in 1933, the 21st  Amendment was ratified, ending the prohibition of alcohol.   Today, throughout Pennsylvania, breweries, wineries, and distilleries  have become one of the Commonwealth's fastest growing industries, and  quite frankly, agri-businesses. Pennsylvania is home to more than 300  wineries, which produce more than 1.6 million gallons of wine each  year. This equates to roughly $1.4 billion in economic impact.   Recently, Woody Lodge Winery, a disabled veteran and female-owned  business from Cambria County, racked up six awards at the Atlantic  Seaboard Wine Association competition, including two best-in-category  awards.   The craft beer industry is also booming. Each year, craft brewers  pump nearly $6 billion into Pennsylvania's economy and are responsible  for more than 100,000 jobs and generate $2.2 billion in wages. For the  past three years, Pennsylvania has been the number one producer of  craft beer in the Nation.   As we look back on 13 long years of prohibition in this country,  let's raise a glass to how far we have come in the 86 years since.                            ____________________
