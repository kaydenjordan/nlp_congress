 Madam President, I think it is important for us at this  moment to reflect on a little Senate history. This goes back to the  year 1991, 27 years ago. It was a chapter in the history of the Senate  and the Senate Judiciary Committee that many people who lived through  it either as observers or participants will never forget. It refers to  the hearings for the approval of the nomination of Clarence Thomas to  the Supreme Court.   Let me read to you a summary of what occurred.  [[Page S6199]]    After Anita Hill alleged that Judge Clarence Thomas had sexually  harassed her, the full Senate on October 8, 1991, agreed by unanimous  consent to delay a vote on Thomas' nomination to the Supreme Court  until October 15.   Let me underline that. The full Senate agreed by unanimous consent to  delay the vote after the allegations surfaced.   Three days later, beginning on October 11, the Senate Judiciary  Committee held public hearings over the course of 3 days, enabling  Clarence Thomas, Anita Hill, and other witnesses to testify in an  opening setting. Two days after the hearings ended, on October 15, the  Senate then voted on Thomas' nomination.   However, we have learned subsequently that this process was rushed to  a point where information came out after the hearings that, in fact,  several other women had made similar allegations.   Having said that, according to press reports from 1991, Anita Hill  faxed her four-page statement, making the allegations to the Judiciary  Committee on September 23, 1991. Then the Senate Judiciary Committee  chairman, Joe Biden, in turn, passed that information on to the White  House and the FBI.   On the same day that this letter was faxed to the Senate Judiciary  Committee, on September 23, 1991, White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray  ordered the FBI to investigate Anita Hill's allegations. The FBI spent  2 days investigating the allegations, including conducting interviews  with Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas, and completed its report on  September 25, 1991.   I recount that history because it is remarkable in light of what we  have witnessed with the allegations of Dr. Ford. First, the Senate, by  unanimous consent--Democrats and Republicans--once that allegation  surfaced by Anita Hill, voted to delay the vote on Thomas's nomination.  Secondly, when the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, Joe Biden,  turned over the allegation, on the very day it was received at the  White House, the White House Counsel, C. Boyden Gray, ordered an  investigation by the FBI.   Apparently, at that moment in history, Democrats and Republicans in  the Senate and on the Judiciary Committee and in the White House at  least wanted to maintain an open mind as to whether there was truth to  the allegations and ordered an FBI investigation.   Contrast that with what we are going through here. Contrast that with  the fact that many, including the majority leader, who just spoke, have  already presumed that any allegations by Dr. Ford should not be taken  seriously and, as he said over and over again, that Judge Kavanaugh  deserves the benefit of the doubt in this circumstance--or more.   That is a departure from where we were 27 years ago when a credible  allegation appeared and both sides stepped back and said: Investigate  it. Call them both before the Judiciary Committee. Let's hear their  testimony before we make a decision.   In many cases since Dr. Ford's allegations have come forward,  Republicans have prejudged this and dismissed it as political.   Let me say a word about my friend and the ranking Democrat in the  Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein. Senator Feinstein  faced a choice that none of us would want to deal with. I think she did  it responsibly. She received, through a Member of Congress, a letter  making the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh, but it was clear in  that letter that the woman making the allegations did not want her  identity disclosed. The woman claimed to have been victimized by Brett  Kavanaugh, and she did not want her name made public. What was Senator  Feinstein to do at that point--ignore her request, make it public to  the embarrassment of her and her family?   Senator Feinstein did not believe that is what she should have done,  and she didn't. She continued to work with Dr. Ford. She reached out to  her personally. She discussed the matter with her attorney. When I hear  statements on the floor from the Senate majority leader that suggest  there was a leaking to the press, I don't know where he is pointing his  finger, but he shouldn't point it at Senator Feinstein. She is an  honorable person, and she is a person who is sensitive to the reality  of a victim and the fact that some of them are afraid to step forward  and tell their story publicly. I think that is what occurred here.   The time came when the story did leak to some credible--or maybe not  credible; I don't know, I couldn't characterize them--but some  publication known as the Intercept. It started to make the rounds. At  that point, things started changing. It changed for the committee.  Senate Judiciary Democrats met last week, talked it over, and said that  we believe we should refer what we have, redacted, to the Federal  Bureau of Investigations. We did. Then it was sent to the White House.   We did that unanimously. Then, of course, the decision was made over  the weekend by Dr. Ford that she was willing to go public. I don't  think that was an easy decision for her. Clearly, it wasn't, because  for weeks she made it clear to Senator Feinstein and others that she  didn't want her identity disclosed. It is understandable. Look at the  attacks she has faced already and what she is likely to face in the  future. It is a reality of sexual harassment and sexual assault that  victims are reluctant to speak for fear of what will happen to them and  their family as a result of it.   Now we have the situation where we do not have an investigation of  Dr. Ford's allegations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. This  morning, the Senate Judiciary Democrats are making a plea to the  President, as well as to the Republicans, to initiate the very FBI  investigation that is necessary, certainly of Brett Kavanaugh's  comments, as well as Dr. Ford's comments about this episode. I think,  at a minimum, that should be done.   What has been said by the majority leader this morning, and I quote  him: ``So little order and so little sensitivity''--I think Senator  Feinstein from the start showed sensitivity to the reality of the  victims of sexual assault. I applaud her for that. I think it was a  humane approach, a sensible and rational approach on her part to work  with Dr. Ford to the point where she was willing to speak publicly  about it. Sensitivity, you know, goes in both directions, both to the  Kavanaugh family, as well as to the Ford family in this circumstance.   In terms of order, it is difficult to judge when a person is willing  to make a decision. Obviously, after 6 weeks, Dr. Ford made the  decision that she would go public. That was not a timetable established  by Senator Feinstein for anyone else. It was one she had to come to  grips with in her own mind from her personal point of view and her  family's point of view.   It is ironic that just a few weeks ago we had a hearing before the  Senate Judiciary Committee on this issue. I hope my Republican  colleagues will think about that hearing and some of the things that  were said. I hope they will treat Dr. Ford's allegations with the  seriousness and dignity that survivors of sexual assault deserve.   Chairman Chuck Grassley, who is my friend, made a statement during  that committee hearing on June 13. It was a hearing about the sexual  harassment perpetrated by a Federal judge, Alex Kozinski. Chuck  Grassley was addressing victims who spoke out against Judge Kozinski's  harassment. This is what he said:         Speaking out against powerful federal judges in a system       that doesn't always protect victims takes tremendous courage.       But because of your bravery--    Referring to these witnesses--       we can hopefully begin to make real, significant changes to       these power imbalances that allow harassment to thrive.    I think I have a dual responsibility in serving on the Senate  Judiciary Committee: a responsibility to fairness when it comes to the  allegations made by Dr. Ford and responsibility, when it comes to  fairness, to Brett Kavanaugh in this circumstance as well. That means  that I am not allowed, in my own mind, to prejudge this and to say  automatically that Dr. Ford is right or automatically Judge Kavanaugh  is right.   What I need, what the American people need, are the facts. We should  harken back to what occurred before with President Bush and C. Boyden  Gray, his counsel, when they ordered an investigation by the FBI. That  should occur now. If we are going to have a hearing on Monday, we  should walk into that hearing after an investigation, which at least  involves Brett  [[Page S6200]]  Kavanaugh being interviewed and at least involves Dr. Ford being  interviewed and at least involves Mark Judge, the person who has been  identified as an eyewitness to this occurrence being interviewed as  well. There could be other relevant witnesses. I will leave it up to  the FBI and their investigation to come to that conclusion.   Let's get the facts before the American people. Let's understand the  seriousness of this responsibility. A lifetime appointment to the  highest Court in the land is what is at stake here, as well as attacks  on the credibility of an alleged sexual assault victim and others who  are watching this carefully in light of their own life experiences.   I hope we meet that responsibility, but we will never meet it if  Senators continue to come to the floor and prejudge the facts before  any investigation, before any testimony by either of these individuals.  If we are truly going to meet our responsibility to advise and consent  under the Constitution, it is time for us to step back, put our  Democratic and Republican clothes at the door, and stand together in  judgment of an important issue that affects the future of this country  and future of the Supreme Court.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I am pleased that the Defense  appropriations bill will soon pass the Senate and be sent to the  President's desk. This is a massive spending bill--$675 billion--and it  has been 10 years since one was enacted on schedule. Passing  appropriations bills on time is about being good stewards of the  taxpayer's money.   When appropriations bills are not signed into law on schedule,  government programs are put on autopilot, known as a continuing  resolution, or CR. CRs create financial headaches, including  inefficiency, waste, and unnecessary additional spending. Last year,  the Navy estimated that due to CRs, it has wasted $4 billion since  2011--$4 billion. That is enough money to buy 18 F-35s or two new  destroyers or 3,000 Harpoon anti-ship missiles. Thanks to good work on  both sides of the aisle, we are looking at real savings in every part  of the Pentagon just by getting our work done on time.   I am proud of many things in this Defense appropriations bill,  including how this bill prioritizes research by including $94.9 billion  for defense R&D, a record level for the Defense Department. GPS, the  internet, and satellites are all examples of how Federal innovation  research dollars have changed the world. On a bipartisan basis, we are  building on previous year's investments, and I am confident that we  will see similar breakthroughs.   In addition, for the fifth year in a row, this bill increases defense  medical  [[Page S6207]]  research funding by 5 percent real growth for a total of $2.4 billion  in defense medical research for fiscal year 2019. Defense medical  research is making breakthroughs in a wide range of fields, from trauma  medicine to breast cancer treatments. We have all heard of the quick- clotting tools that paramedics use around the country to stop bleeding  in gunshot victims; that was a defense medical research breakthrough.   Just this past year, researchers discovered a treatment to speed  healing of combat-infected wounds and regrow the skin around them more  effectively. Others proved that a particular medical assessment tool  can accurately assess potentially suicidal behavior. I encourage  everyone to go to the Army's medical research website and read the list  yourself--a long list--of worthwhile uses of these funds.   The defense bill is paired with the Labor, Health and Human Services,  and Education bill this year, which includes another $2 billion funding  increase for medical research at the National Institutes of Health.  This will be the fourth year in a row that Congress has provided the  NIH with at least a 5-percent budget increase. Every NIH institute and  center will see their budgets increase, but there are also noteworthy  increases for Alzheimer's disease and cancer research.   I wish we could have given the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention a bigger increase, but I am pleased with what we were able  to accomplish here, including the continued investment--with an  additional $5 million in fiscal year 2019--for the Open Textbooks Pilot  to help save college students money on textbook costs.   I am, however, disappointed that this bill does not include the  bipartisan Durbin-Grassley-King amendment, which would have helped  ensure that pharmaceutical companies disclose the cost of their drugs  television advertising. Our amendment passed the Senate unanimously. It  is supported by President Trump, HHS Secretary Azar, the AARP, the  American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, 76  percent of Americans, and many others. House Republicans--apparently  more indebted to Big Pharma than their constituents--prevented this  commonsense proposal from being included in the final bill, but I will  not stop fighting.   In conclusion, the outcome of much of this bill shows what we can  accomplish when Democrats and Republicans work together. I want to  thank my partner and chairman, Senator Shelby, as well as the ranking  member, Senator Leahy.   But our work is only half done. There remain seven other  appropriations bills that remain in limbo, dealing with foreign aid,  agriculture, and even border security. The Senate will have to make an  important choice very soon: either we work together to wrap up the  appropriations process or we head back to Washington gridlock and  wasteful stalemates.   I urge the Republican leader to look at what we have accomplished in  these bills, working together, and use that as a model for finishing  our work in the coming weeks.
