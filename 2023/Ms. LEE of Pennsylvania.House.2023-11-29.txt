 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the  grandmas and grandpas and moms and dads and neighbors and beloved  community members who spent their entire lives paying into Medicare out  of their own paychecks on the sacred promise that they could retire  with health and dignity only to have that promise betrayed by today's  Republican Party.   I stand here on behalf of our aging parents and sons and daughters  fighting mental illness, loved ones who are cancer patients and stroke  survivors, workers injured on the job, orphaned children, and siblings  with disabilities, whose access to food, shelter, medicine,  [[Page H5951]]  and dignified retirement depends on Social Security that Republicans  are hellbent on tearing away.                                time  1300    In Pennsylvania alone, 2.8 million folks depend on Medicare--227,727  in Allegheny County--and 2.9 million depend on Social Security--nearly  150,000 in my district alone. Every one of them deserves to retire in  dignity with access to healthcare. Every one of them deserves a  Congress where every Member has the decency to honor that sacred  promise not to leave our families behind at the hardest moments of  their lives.   The reality is that just about every American agrees, no matter where  we come from, how we vote, or what our skin color is--we all deserve  those things.   The Republican Party, bought out by greedy CEOs, billionaires, and  lobbyists, have always been terrified of that reality. They are so  terrified that instead of facing it they have chosen to lie, scapegoat,  and defraud even the folks who elected them, assuming we are too  foolish to see what is going on.   Let me break it down. First, Republicans passed tax handouts for  their filthy rich donors promising a trickle-down miracle that never  has and will never happen from Reaganomics to the Trump tax scam.   When their tax scam causes the economy to slow and deficits to grow,  they refuse to correct their mistake. Instead, they blame immigrants,  poor folks, Black folks, and Brown folks.   Next, Republicans pretend to panic and call for devastating cuts to  Social Security and Medicare that would force Americans to work longer  for less and tear away their hard-earned retirement and end Medicare as  we know it--reducing spending.   They call for more handouts for their billionaire donors and  corporate polluters. They hope that you will settle for tearing away  your neighbors' lifelines to protect your own right to retire in  dignity, forcing us to the brink of catastrophic shutdown or debt  ceiling crisis until we clean up their mess.   They repeat the cycle hoping enough of us will forgive and forget  their scheme to tear away Medicare and Social Security and believe  their lie that they were only after food assistance, healthcare, or  housing for poor folks--not your earned benefits. The truth is that  they always were and always will be after it all.    Mr. Speaker, as I speak, Republicans on the  Budget Committee are holding a hearing to establish a death panel  commission to gut earned benefits where their chairman called his  party's fight to tear Social Security our generation's world war.   At a time when the majority of Pennsylvanians say they struggle to  afford healthcare and half are delaying getting the medical care they  need because they can't afford it, we as Democrats have an obligation  to fight to not only protect Social Security and Medicare but expand  them.   If we preserve the retirement age, increase benefits to keep up with  inflation, expand Medicare to include vision, dental, and hearing, and  hold Big Pharma price gougers accountable and pass Medicare for All,  that is how we fulfill our sacred promise and move our country and our  economy forward.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so  we can bring up legislation that reaffirms the House of  Representatives' commitment to protecting and strengthening Social  Security and Medicare.
