 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 774, I call  up the bill (H.R. 5376) to provide for reconciliation pursuant to title  II of S. Con. Res. 14, and ask for its immediate consideration in the  House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material into the Record on H.R. 5376.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, the bill before us today marks a triumph for our  Nation. After months of negotiations within our Caucus and our  committees, with our colleagues in the Senate, and with the White  House, I am proud to present the most consequential legislation for  American families since the New Deal.   The Build Back Better Act makes historic investments over 10 years to  overhaul and reimagine entire sectors of our economy and society so  that everyone, not just those at the top, will benefit from a growing  economy.   This bill delivers the most transformative investment in children and  caregiving in generations, the largest effort to combat climate change  in American history, the biggest expansion of affordable health  coverage in a decade, the most significant effort to bring down costs  and strengthen the middle class in generations, investments and key  reforms to make our tax system more equitable, and more.   To be clear, if we were only making the largest investment in  childcare in the history of the Nation, saving most American families  more than half of their spending on childcare, that would be a major  victory for the American people.   If we were only guaranteeing universal preschool for all 3- and 4- year-olds, the first expansion of basic public education in our country  in 100 years, that would be a major victory for the American people.  [[Page H6577]]    If we were only making our Nation's largest investment ever to combat  the climate crisis, that would be a major victory for the American  people.   If we were only capping out-of-pocket prescription drug costs under  Medicare at $2,000, saving more than a million seniors an average of  $1,200 a year, that would be a major victory for the American people.   If we were only expanding the Affordable Care Act so that those who  have been locked out of Medicaid can get good coverage and then  requiring all insurance companies to provide insulin for no more than  $35 a month, that would be a major victory for the American people.   If we were only making the single largest and most comprehensive  investment in affordable housing in U.S. history, that would be a major  victory for the American people.   If we were only providing one of the largest middle-class tax cuts in  our Nation's history, that would be a major victory for the American  people.   But in this bill, the Build Back Better Act, we don't just do one of  these. We do all of them. Each of these investments on its own will  make an extraordinary impact on the lives of American families.  Together, they will be transformative.   Here is the kicker. Because our tax system has been so unjust, so  tilted to benefit the well-off and the well-connected, we can pay for  all this by simply making our tax code more fair.   It is a hell of a deal. It is why Nobel Prize-winning economists and  other experts backed this paid-for and progrowth agenda, citing how it  will make our tax system more equitable, ease longer term inflationary  pressures, and help American families build a much stronger future.   That is what governing should be about. It is not a game. We aren't  elected to make a scene. We are elected to make a difference and to  make the lives of the people we serve better.   Enacting this legislation will be a momentous achievement for  Congress. More importantly, it will change lives. It will save lives.  It will deliver on the promise of the American Dream for generations to  come.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, it must be easy to be a Republican in  Congress these days because you can make things up. You can throw out  numbers without any fear of being contradicted. But we will have,  probably by the end of the day, a CBO score from the Congressional  Budget Office which will undercut virtually every argument that the  gentleman from Missouri made.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Scott), who is the distinguished chairman of the Education and Labor  Committee and also a member of the Budget Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Aguilar), who is the vice chair of the Democratic  Caucus.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Jeffries), who is the Democratic Caucus chairman and a  distinguished member of the Budget Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, virtually every Republican who comes to the microphone  today will say that this is an inflationary bill. We know that. They  have said that time after time after time.   Unfortunately, the experts disagree with them. Seventeen Nobel  economists have written a letter stating that they believe this, over  the long term, will ease inflationary pressures.   Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, who is as much of an  inflation hawk as there is in this country, I think, said just last  week, ``I'm for Build Back Better. I'm for it because of what it'll do  for the environment. I'm for it because of what it'll do for the  society.  [[Page H6579]]    ``I don't think it's going to have a meaningful impact on inflation.  It spends less money over 10 years than we spent just last year. Its  spending is largely offset by tax increases. And it includes measures  that will actually increase supply.''   This is from the former Secretary of the Treasury, Larry Summers.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Kildee), who is a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   That is another thing we are going to hear continuously throughout  the day, and that is that these are socialist programs; just as we  heard last week that building infrastructure in this country was a  socialist activity. And now childcare is socialist. Public education is  socialist. Caring for our seniors is socialist. Dealing with climate  change is socialist.   I would like to get a definition from my Republican colleagues about  what socialism is because the American people see this very  differently; and virtually every poll on this piece of legislation has  shown overwhelming support for each the elements that we are proposing.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a distinguished member of the Budget  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Morelle), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. Craig), a distinguished member of the Agriculture  Committee.  [[Page H6584]]         Madam Speaker, I am happy to yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Chu), a distinguished member of the  Budget Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Doggett), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Waters), the distinguished chair of the Financial  Services Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. Jayapal), a distinguished member of the Budget  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  New York (Ms. Velazquez), the distinguished chair of the Small Business  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from New York.  [[Page H6586]]         Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  New Mexico (Ms. Leger Fernandez), a distinguished member of the  Education and Labor Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), a distinguished member of the Budget  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Ms. Wexton), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), a distinguished member of the  Appropriations Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Green), a distinguished member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Mrs. Beatty), a distinguished member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining on both sides?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Ryan), a distinguished member of the Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, we have gone back and forth on this bill for months now,  and my Republican friends have said, oh, they haven't had a chance to  read the bill. The Budget Committee reported out the consolidated bill  on September 25. There have been 180 hours of debate on this bill  before today; so if they can't read the bill in 2 months, they have  another problem.   But at the end of the day, it is clear this has not been a fair  debate. On one side you have House Republicans. On the other you have  myself and my Democratic colleagues, 17 Nobel-winning economists,  former Treasury Secretaries, Jack Lew and Larry Summers, scores of  other economists and experts, and most importantly, the overwhelming  majority of the American people.   This hasn't been an honest debate either. Democrats have a plan to  serve the American people. Republicans have an agenda to stop  Democrats, period. And my friend from Ohio just had another description  of GOP. I don't think it should be GOP at all; I think it should be  NOP, the not our problem party. If it is healthcare, it is not our  problem. Dealing with climate change, it is not our problem. Dealing  with education, not our problem. Dealing with seniors, not our problem.  Dealing with childcare, not our problem. Affording college, not our  problem. Dealing with medical costs, not our problem.   Democrats see important challenges facing the American people, and we  are finally dealing with them. It is time to close the curtain on the  Republican charade and do our jobs.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' and send to the Senate the most  transformative legislation for America and American families in a  century.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
