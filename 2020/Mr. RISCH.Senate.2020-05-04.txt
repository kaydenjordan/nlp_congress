The       highest level of classified information that could be       disclosed by a proposed sale or by testing of the end item is       up to and including SECRET. Loss or compromise of classified       information  [[Page S2212]]       associated with AGM-114R could lead to development of       countermeasures or exploitation of system vulnerabilities by       those obtaining the information.        e. The Hellfire M36E9 Captive Air Training Missiles (CATM)       is a flight-training missile that consists of a functional       guidance section coupled to an inert missile bus. The M36E9       CATM does not have a functional rocket motor or warhead, and       cannot be launched. It functions like a tactical missile       (without launch capability) during captive carry on the       aircraft, making it suitable for training the aircrew in       simulated Hellfire missile target acquisition and lock. The       highest level of classified information that could be       disclosed by a proposed sale or by testing of the end item is       SECRET.        f. The aircraft has an Embedded Global Positioning System/      Inertial Navigation System (EGI) plus MultiMode Receiver       (MMR), and two EGIs which use internal accelerometers, rate       gyro measurements, and external sensor measurements to       estimate the aircraft state, provides aircraft flight and       position data to aircraft systems. The EGI is a velocity-      aided, strap down, ring laser gyro based inertial unit. The       EGI unit houses a GPS receiver. Integrated within the EGI is       an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for processing functions.       Each EGI also houses an MMR to provide for reception of       ground based NAVAID signals for instrument aided flight.        g. The AAR-57 Common Missile Warning System (CMWS) detects       energy emitted by threat missiles in-flight, evaluates       potential false alarm emitters in the environment, declares       validity of threat and selects appropriate countermeasures.       The CMWS consists of an Electronic Control Unit (ECU),       Electro-Optic Missile Sensors (EOMSs), and Sequencer and       Improved Countermeasures Dispenser (ICMD). The ECU hardware       is classified CONFIDENTIAL; releasable technical manuals for       operation and maintenance are classified SECRET.        h. The AN/APR-39 Radar Signal Detecting Set is a system       that provides warnings of radar-directed air defense threats       and allows appropriate countermeasures.
