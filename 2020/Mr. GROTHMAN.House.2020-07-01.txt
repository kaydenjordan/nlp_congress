 Mr. Speaker, we have heard several speeches this  morning about the COVID epidemic.   Like a lot of Americans, every day, I like to get up and see whether  we are moving in the right direction or not. I was sad to see this  morning--I checked the Worldometer's website because a lot of my  constituents tell me that is the one to check, and I was sad to see  that, this morning, when they gave the number of deaths yesterday, on  Tuesday, they list 764 Americans who had passed away.   However, the Worldometer website kind of goes up and down by the day.  It is always very low on Sunday and Saturday. It gets higher on  Wednesday and Thursday.   However, I did notice that the 764 deaths yesterday, on Tuesday, was  the lowest on a Tuesday since March 23.   Mondays are always very low. We had 366 deaths on Monday. That was  also the lowest since March.   Mr. Speaker, I hope that we continue to have the progress as we work  the number of people who die of this horrible disease down every day,  but I have a feeling that a lot of Americans are being misled. So I am  just pointing out the way these statistics are going.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   This amendment, which mirrors bipartisan bill H.R. 380 is  straightforward. It requires the Federal decision makers at the  Department of the Interior to consider the threat of invasive species  when installing fishways.   We all know that over time, the number of dams in this country have  decreased. As the number of dams has decreased, a benefit is a lot of  times fish are able to swim upstream, spawn more, and improve the  overall health of our rivers.   However, there are times where there are some fish that are not so  good, and that is when we have invasive species. I have a big problem  with that on the most significant river in the State of Wisconsin, the  Wisconsin River. There is a dam there, and they were talking about  putting up a fishway, which, on the face of it, sounds nice.   The problem is, below the dam we have Asian carp; they are large  fish, not native to Wisconsin. It would be devastating to the local  fish. If they were ever able to work their way over the dam, they would  not only pollute the Wisconsin River, but the lakes which feed into the  Wisconsin River all over northern Wisconsin could also be polluted. And  it is even possible that because there are areas that are kind of  dicey, they could even work their way into the Great Lakes and all the  way up the Saint Lawrence River.   I appreciate the fact that we have considered this amendment. I hope  it is adopted as part of the en bloc.
