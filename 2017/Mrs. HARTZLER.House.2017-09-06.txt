 Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division B (before the short title), insert       the following:        Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may       be used to carry out subsection (p) of section 12 of the       Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C.       1760).    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 500, the gentlewoman  from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Missouri.                                time  1915     Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to return local  control to the National School Lunch Program. For far too long,  Washington has imposed burdensome and unnecessary mandates on our local  schools. These misguided regulations have created a bureaucratic  nightmare and mountains of paperwork for local school lunch  administrators who truly want to spend their time focused on providing  healthy meals for our children.   My amendment is simple. It stops a federally mandated formula called  the Paid Lunch Equity program that requires all schools to raise their  school lunch prices to an arbitrary level set here in Washington. This  amendment does not address the actual nutritional content of lunches,  although I believe that is a policy area that should be addressed. This  amendment only stops regulations setting local school lunch prices.   Local officials know their communities best, and they should  ultimately be responsible for setting school lunch prices in their  cafeterias. Many schools are forced to raise their school lunch prices  each year just to meet the Federal mandate. This pushes families  struggling to make ends meet off the school lunch program and leads to  more hungry students and higher costs for hardworking families.   It is time to get Washington out of the local school lunch pricing  business and return more control to our local schools. I ask my  colleagues to join me today in supporting this commonsense amendment to  return more control to local schools. Again, I ask my colleagues'  support.   Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Alabama (Mr. Aderholt).    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the chairman's support.   In closing, I would urge all my colleagues to support this  commonsense measure to restore local control of our school lunch  pricing. This exact language was passed in the House version of the  Child Nutrition Reauthorization Act last year, but that bill has not  passed, and we need to address this right now.   Mr. Chairman, I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler).   The amendment was agreed to.              Amendment No. 17 Offered by Mr. Carter of Georgia    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 17  printed in part B of House Report 115-295.
