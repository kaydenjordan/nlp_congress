 Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, the USS  Fitzgerald collided with a container ship off the coast of Japan. Seven  of our brave servicemembers were killed in the collision.   I ask my colleagues to join me in a moment of silence to honor the  brave sailors who gave the ultimate sacrifice for our country.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, 5-minute voting will  continue.   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the resolution.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.                                Recorded Vote
