 Mr. President, I am proud to have a chance to speak in  support of your fellow Coloradan, Neil Gorsuch, President Trump's  nominee to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.   Clearly, we all understand this is an important decision and an  important institution. The Supreme Court is the only Court specified in  the Constitution and often the final arbiter of how the Constitution  and the law is to be applied. In the history of the Court, in the  history of the country, only 112 individuals have had the honor to  serve on the Supreme Court. As we debate the qualifications and  qualities of the person who has been nominated, and I hope to see  confirmed as the 113th person to serve as an Associate Justice or a  Justice on the Court, it is really vital we understand that we have a  nominee who has a deep understanding and appreciation of the role of  the Court and the role the Court plays in our democracy.   Judge Gorsuch embodies these principles through a lifetime of  service, and he has really prepared himself in many unique ways for  this moment. He graduated from Columbia University, where he was  elected to Phi Beta Kappa and earned his law degree from Harvard Law  School. After law school, Judge Gorsuch served as a Supreme Court clerk  to two different Justices, Justice Byron White and Justice Anthony  Kennedy. It has been pointed out that if Judge Gorsuch is confirmed to  serve on the Court, he will be the first person ever to serve with  someone for whom he clerked, and hopefully he and Justice Kennedy will  have an opportunity to serve together.   After clerking on the Court, he went on to a successful career in  private law  [[Page S555]]  practice, spending 10 years litigating a broad range of complex trials  and appeals.   In 2004, just in case his Harvard law degree wasn't enough, as a  Marshall scholar, he received a doctorate in philosophy from Oxford  University.   At every point in his preparation, it has been understood he was at  the top of that preparatory activity. He has served his country in the  Justice Department, working as the Principal Deputy Associate Attorney  General. In 2006, 10 years ago, President George W. Bush nominated him  to serve on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. At the time of his  nomination, the American Bar Association gave him a unanimous ``well  qualified'' rating, the highest rating. The Senate then confirmed his  nomination unanimously by a voice vote.   Today I believe the Senate has 11 Democrats serving with us who were  part of that unanimous process. In his decade on the Tenth U.S. Circuit  Court of Appeals bench, Judge Gorsuch has demonstrated a steadfast  commitment to upholding the rule of law and interpreting the  Constitution as its authors intended.   I am confident he will continue to adhere to the Constitution, apply  the rule of law, and not legislate from the bench. I think he  understands, as Justice Scalia did, that the job of a Justice of the  Supreme Court is not to decide what the law should be or what the  Constitution, in their opinion, should say but decide what the law is  and what the Constitution does say.   His keen intellect and devotion to law are very well understood and  appreciated throughout the legal profession. He has the integrity, the  professional qualifications, and the judicial temperament to serve on  the Nation's highest Court.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  an editorial from earlier this week.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                   [From the Denver Post, Jan. 26, 2017]       Trump Would Do Well to Consider Neil Gorsuch for Supreme Court                          (By the Editorial Board)         Then-U.S. Sen. Ken Salazar, right, introduces Neil Gorsuch       at his nomination hearing to the U.S. Court of Appeals for       the 10th Circuit on June 21, 2006. Gorsuch is being       considered as a possibly replacement for the late U.S.       Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia.        President Donald Trump is on the verge of making his most       enduring appointment to date and we are encouraged by one of       the names on his list to replace former Supreme Court Justice       Antonin Scalia.        Neil Gorsuch is a federal judge in Denver with Western       roots and a reputation for being a brilliant legal mind and       talented writer. Those who have followed Gorsuch's career say       that from his bench in the U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals       he has applied the law fairly and consistently, even issuing       provocative challenges to the Supreme Court to consider his       rulings.        Liberals who dreamed of a less-conservative Merrick Garland       on the court will undoubtedly gasp at a suggestion that       Gorsuch would be a good addition to a court that has been       shorthanded for more than a year.        Gorsuch is most widely known for ruling in the Hobby Lobby       contraception case before it reached the Supreme Court in       2014. His controversial decision was upheld in a 5-4 vote.       Gorsuch wrote in the case that those with ``sincerely held       religious beliefs'' should not be forced to participate in       something ``their religion teaches them to be gravely       wrong.''        We disagreed with that ruling, saying the Supreme Court       wrongly applied constitutional protections of religious       freedom to a corporation that remained owned by a small group       of like-minded individuals.        We argued that even closely held corporations--primarily       functioning as money-making entities and not religious       institutions--shouldn't be able to opt out of the Affordable       Care Act mandate that insurance cover contraception by citing       First Amendment protections intended for individuals and       churches.        But in considering Gorsuch's body of work and reputation--      and yes, we like his ties to Colorado as well--we hope Trump       gives him the nod.        We are not afraid of a judge who strictly interprets the       Constitution based solely on the language and intent of our       nation's founders, as long as he is willing to be consistent       even when those rulings conflict with his own beliefs.        As Denver Attorney Jason Dunn, who considers himself a       longtime fan of Gorsuch, explains, his views stem ``from a       belief in a separation of powers and in a judicial modesty       that it is not in the role of the courts to make law. Justice       Scalia would put it: If you like every one of your rulings,       you're probably doing it wrong.''        A justice who does his best to interpret the Constitution       or statute and apply the law of the land without prejudice       could go fair to restore faith in the highest court of the       land. That faith has wavered under the manufactured and false       rhetoric from critics that the high court has become a       corrupt body stacked with liberals. And while Democrats will       surely be tempted to criticize the nomination of anyone Trump       appoints, they'd be wise to take the high road and look at       qualifications and legal consistency rather than political       leanings.        Gorsuch, at 49, will have years to whittle away at that       damaging lack of trust. A July 2016 Gallup Poll found that 52       percent of Americans disapproved of the way the Supreme Court       handled its job. The finding is striking, considering the       same poll in 2000 found only 29 percent of Americans       disapproved.        We could do far worse than a thoughtful graduate from       Columbia, Harvard and Oxford universities, who clerked for       two Supreme Court justices and calls Denver home.     I wish to share a little of that editorial where the  Denver Post says:         We are not afraid of a judge who strictly interprets the       Constitution based solely on the language and intent of our       nation's founders, as long as he is willing to be consistent       even when those rulings conflict with his own beliefs.        As Denver Attorney Jason Dunn, who considers himself a       longtime fan of Gorsuch, explains, his views stem ``from a       belief in a separation of powers and in a judicial modesty       that it is not in the role of the courts to make law. Justice       Scalia would put it: If you like every one of your rulings,       you're probably doing it wrong.''    That is similar to what you and I heard Judge Gorsuch say last night;  that a good judge doesn't rule based on what a judge likes to have  happen but what the law and the Constitution insists does happen.   Going back and continuing just one more paragraph from that Denver  Post editorial:         A Justice who does his best to interpret the Constitution       or statute and apply the law of the land without prejudice       could go far to restore the faith in the highest court of the       land. That faith has wavered under the manufactured and false       rhetoric from critics that the high court has become a       corrupt body stacked with liberals. And while Democrats will       surely be tempted to criticize the nomination of anyone Trump       appoints, they'd be wise to take the high road and look at       qualifications and legal consistency rather than political       leanings.    That is in the middle of that editorial that is now in the Record.   The Supreme Court is one of the most important legacies this  President is likely to leave. I think he made a very well-considered  and right choice in selecting Judge Gorsuch to begin shaping the long- term view of the Court. I look forward to hearing more from the judge  as this confirmation process moves forward and to seeing him confirmed  as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.
