 Mr. President, in a few minutes, we will be voting on  the President's nomination of John Ryder, of Memphis, to be a member of  the Board of the Tennessee Valley Authority.   To those of us in the seven State region that the TVA serves, it is a  very important institution. Its job is to provide large amounts of  reliable, low-cost electricity, which is the basis for how we live and  how we work. It has a lot to do with our ability to attract jobs. Its  job is to provide that energy in a clean way so we can see our  mountains and so we meet the emissions standards in our metropolitan  areas that allow us to attract and grow more jobs.   The TVA is fulfilling its mission very well. It is heading toward a  position in which it will be about 40-percent nuclear in its production  of electricity, about 20 percent in natural gas, and about 20 percent  in coal or a little less than that. It will have pollution control  equipment on all of its coal plants. Most of the rest is hydroelectric  power, and a little bit is renewable. In short, it has one of the  cleanest portfolios in the country, and it is continuing to do that and  is producing a lot of low-cost, reliable electricity.   We are very fortunate to be in a region in which, as we look down the  road 5, 10, or 15 years, we will be able to say to people who are  thinking of moving themselves to Tennessee or moving their businesses  to Tennessee or growing them there that they will be able to get a lot  of reliable, low-cost electricity--all that they need. In addition to  that, they will be able to see the Smoky Mountains because the air is a  lot cleaner now that they have such a clean portfolio.   So John Ryder's appointment is a very important appointment, and he  is a well-qualified man for that position. He is one of Tennessee's  best known lawyers and has been for a long time. Since the late 1980s,  he has been listed as one of Tennessee's best lawyers. He is well  respected by everyone who knows him.   Senator Corker and I recommended him to President Trump, and we know  him well. Senator Blackburn, who is Senator Corker's successor, has a  high regard for John Ryder. All of us appreciate his willingness to  serve, and we look forward to the voice vote we are going to have in a  few minutes that will place him on TVA's Board. The Board has just  selected a new chief executive officer. TVA is the largest public  utility in the United States, perhaps in the world. It is an important  assignment, and it is one I am delighted to recommend him for.   There is one other thing, but I will not dwell on this because I  spoke on this Monday night. Unfortunately, Mr. Ryder has been on the  Senate's calendar for 9 months. He was nominated by President Trump a  year ago. The problem has not been with Mr. Ryder because, as I said,  President Trump nominated him after he was thoroughly vetted by the  FBI. The Senate's Environment and Public Works Committee considered  him, had a hearing, and reported him unanimously to the floor. Yet, for  9 months, he waited there.   One reason is, the Democrats have consistently obstructed the ability  of Senator McConnell and the Republican majority to help President  Trump form his government. The Democrats have required 128 times that  Senator McConnell, the majority leader, file cloture motions to cut off  debate to advance a nomination like Mr. Ryder's.   Now, this is not a Cabinet position. This is not a lifetime judge.  This is the part-time Board of an important institution. He is one of  1,200 Presidential nominees that any President has who is subject to  confirmation by advice and consent. It is the kind of nomination by  which, if a committee unanimously reports it to the Senate, we will  normally approve it by voice vote. Yet, on this vote, Senator McConnell  was forced to file cloture a week ago. Then we had to wait an  intervening day. Only then could we come to this vote.   This is not the way the Senate is supposed to work, and this  obstruction has to stop. Senator Blunt and Senator Lankford have  introduced a resolution, which has been reported to the Senate by the  rules committee, that would cause us to adopt a rule very much like the  one we adopted in 2013, when I worked with a large number of Democrats  and Republicans for the sole purpose of making it easier for President  Obama--and his successors--to promptly confirm the men and women whom  he chose to form a government.   It received 78 votes. What we did at that time was simply say: You  still keep the cloture motion, and you still wait an intervening day if  you need it, but we reduce the postcloture time--not for Supreme Court  Justices, not for circuit judges--simply for sub-Cabinet members and  for district judges. We would reduce sub-Cabinet members to 8 hours and  district judges to 2 hours.   On Monday night, I invited my Democratic friends to work with me in  2019 the way I worked with them in 2013. In a bipartisan way, let's  make sure the Senate can do what it has historically done--to have  promptly considered and voted up or down, with 51 votes, the nominees  of any President of the United States for the 1,200 positions that form  the government.   There have been some conversations. I hope Senator Blunt and Senator  Lankford will continue to have those conversations with the Democratic  Members, but there are nine Democratic Senators, by my count, who are  seeking to be the next President of the United States. I hope they can  look 20 months down the road and realize that  [[Page S1569]]  just one Republican Senator could do to them, if one of them were to  become President, what the Democrats have done to President Trump. It  would be very difficult for the next Democratic President, if there  were to be one, to form a government. We don't want that to happen.  That diminishes the advice and consent role of the Senate. It fills up  the government with appointees who are acting and whom we don't know,  and they are not really accountable to us. That is not the way this  place is supposed to work.   So I renew my invitation to my Democratic friends to work with me the  way a number of us worked with them in 2011, in 2012, and in 2013.  Let's change the rules in the right way. Let's basically adopt  virtually the same rule we adopted in 2013 and allow this President and  any President to get prompt consideration and up-or-down votes of their  nominees.   I congratulate Mr. Ryder on his confirmation. I am grateful for his  willingness to serve, and I am sorry he had to wait so long for the  opportunity. The people of Tennessee and the seven State region will be  much better off for his service within this important institution.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the confirmation of John  Ryder, as a member of the Board of Directors of the Tennessee Valley  Authority, occur at this time.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, President Trump has been in Vietnam  this week, meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un. I applaud  the President for his efforts to improve the U.S. relationship with  North Korea.   There is not a more difficult relationship anywhere in the world at  this time than that relationship. But I am glad he chose not to seek a  deal just for the sake of a deal.   As he returns from his summit with the North Korean leader and turns  his attention back home, I want to make a respectful suggestion, and  that is this: that President Trump ask his lawyers to take a second  look at existing funding authorities that the President has to consider  construction of the 234 miles of border wall that do not require a  formal declaration of a national emergency.   I support what the President wants to do on border security, but I do  not support the way he has been advised to do it. It is unnecessary and  unwise to turn a border crisis into a constitutional crisis about  separation of powers when the President already has congressional  funding authority to build the 234 miles of border wall that he  requested in his January 6 letter to the Senate.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record  following my remarks the text of the President's January 6 letter to  the Senate Appropriations Committee.   Mr. President, there has never been an instance in which a President  of the United States has asked for funding, Congress has refused it,  and the President has then used the National Emergency Act to justify  spending the money anyway.   If President Trump can build a wall when Congress has refused to  provide the funding, then the next President can declare a national  emergency and tear the wall down or declare climate change an emergency  and stop oil exports and offshore drilling. There is no limit to the  imagination of what the next leftwing President could do to harm our  country with this precedent.   After an American revolution against a King, our Founders chose not  to create a Chief Executive who could tax the people and spend their  money any way he chose. The Constitution gave that responsibility  exclusively to a Congress elected by the people, and every one of us  U.S. Senators has taken an oath to support that Constitution.   Separation of powers is a crucial constitutional imperative that goes  to the very heart of our freedom.   I don't know how the late Justice Antonin Scalia would have decided a  case on this matter, but I do know what he said about separation of  powers, and this was what Justice Scalia said:         Every tin horn dictator in the world today . . . has a Bill       of Rights. That's not what makes us free. . . . What has made       us free is our Constitution. . . . The word ``constitution''       . . . means structure. That's why . . . the framers debated       not the Bill of Rights . . . but rather the structure of the       federal government. The genius of the American constitutional       system is the dispersal of power. Once power is centralized       in one person, or one part [of our government], a Bill of       Rights is just words on paper.    That was Justice Scalia.   The President can avoid this dangerous precedent completely. He can  use the congressional funding authority he already has to build the 234  miles of wall that he asked Congress to approve in the January 6 letter  that I submitted for the Record.   Here is how this would work. On January 6 of this year--last month-- in his letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee, the President  requested $5.7 billion to build 234 miles of new physical barrier on  the southern border.   Then, on February 14, a couple of weeks ago, Congress passed the  Homeland Security appropriations bill, which provided $1.375 billion to  build 55 miles that the President had asked for.   On February 15, the day he signed the Homeland Security  appropriations bill, President Trump announced that he would use two  additional sources of funds that had already been approved by Congress,  which could be used to fund the border wall.   The first was $601 million from the Treasury Forfeiture Fund. The  second was up to $2.5 billion from the Department of Defense accounts  to support counterdrug activities and to block drug-smuggling corridors  across international boundaries.   The President is authorized to do this because of a provision in law  that allows him to transfer up to $4 billion among the accounts of the  Department of Defense. That is $4 billion in a Department of Defense  budget of about $600 billion.   These three sources of funding that I just mentioned add up to about  $4.5 billion or $1.2 billion less than the $5.7 billion that the  President requested in his January 6 letter.   So where does he get the rest of the money? He can get it by  transferring $3.7 billion instead of $2.5 billion from the Department  of Defense accounts to support counterdrug activities. Then the  President would be able to build the 234 miles of wall he requested on  January 6, and he would not need to declare a national emergency.   To be specific, this means the President would use $1.375 billion  from the Homeland Security appropriations bill plus $601 million from  the Treasury Forfeiture Fund plus $3.7 billion from the Department of  Defense accounts to support counterdrug activities, which would add up  to equal his full $5.7 billion request to build 234 miles of border  wall.   If my analysis is incorrect, I hope that the President's lawyers will  tell me.   Using funds already approved by Congress avoids the constitutional  crisis of separation of powers. Using funds already approved by  Congress avoids establishing a dangerous precedent, which could be  misused by subsequent Presidents. Using funds already approved by  Congress avoids taking money from military construction projects  specifically approved by Congress for such activities as military  [[Page S1570]]  barracks and hospitals. And using funds already approved by Congress  avoids months or years of litigation, which could make it unlikely that  the full 234 miles are ever built.   It may be a couple of weeks before the Senate votes on a resolution  regarding the national emergency declaration, so we don't know yet  exactly what we will be voting on. There is time for the President's  lawyers to take another look and determine whether we can both build  the 234 miles of border wall that the President has asked for and avoid  this dangerous precedent. Then the Senate could both support the  President's border request and be faithful to our oath to support a  Constitution that creates separation of powers as a crucial check on  Executive power that goes to the very heart of our freedom.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:            Executive Office of the President, Office of Management             and Budget,                                   Washington, DC, January 6, 2019.      Hon. Richard Shelby,      Chairman, Committee on Appropriations,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: The President continues to stress the       need to pass legislation that will both reopen the Federal       Government and address the security and humanitarian crisis       at our Nation's Southwest border. The Administration has       previously transmitted budget proposals that would support       his ongoing commitment to dramatically reduce the entry of       illegal immigrants, criminals, and drugs; keep out       terrorists, public safety threats, and those otherwise       inadmissible under U.S. law; and ensure that those who do       enter without legal permission can be promptly and safely       returned home.        Appropriations bills for fiscal year (FY) 2019 that have       already been considered by the current and previous       Congresses are inadequate to fully address these critical       issues. Any agreement for the current year should satisfy the       following priorities:        --Border Wall, Customs and Border Protection (CBP): The       President requests $5.7 billion for construction of a steel       barrier for the Southwest border. Central to any strategy to       achieve operational control along the southern border is       physical infrastructure to provide requisite impedance and       denial. In short, a physical barrier--wall--creates an       enduring capability that helps field personnel stop, slow       down and/or contain illegal entries. In concert with the U.S.       Army Corps of Engineers, CBP has increased its capacity to       execute these funds. The Administration's full request would       fund construction of a total of approximately 234 miles of       new physical barrier and fully fund the top 10 priorities in       CBP's Border Security Improvement Plan. This would require an       increase of $4.1 billion over the FY 2019 funding level in       the Senate version of the bill.        --Immigration Judge Teams--Executive Office for Immigration       Review (EOIR): The President requests at least $563 million       for 75 additional Immigration Judges and support staff to       reduce the backlog of pending immigration cases. The       Administration appreciates that the Senate's FY 2019 bill       provides this level of funding, and looks forward to working       with the Congress on further increases in this area to       facilitate an expansion of in-country processing of asylum       claims.        --Law Enforcement Personnel, Border Patrol Agent Hiring,       CBP: The President requests $211 million to hire 750       additional Border Patrol Agents in support of his promise to       keep our borders safe and secure. While the Senate's FY 2019       bill supports some Border Patrol Agent hiring, fulfilling       this request requires an increase of $100 million over the FY       2019 funding level in the Senate version of the bill.        --Law Enforcement Personnel, Immigration and Customs       Enforcement (ICE): The President requests $571 million for       2,000 additional law enforcement personnel, as well as       support staff, who enforce our U.S. immigration laws and help       address gang violence, smuggling and trafficking, and the       spread of drugs in our communities. This would require an       increase of $571 million over the FY 2019 funding level in       the Senate version of the bill.        --Detention Beds, ICE: The President requests $4.2 billion       to support 52,000 detention beds. Given that in recent       months, the number of people attempting to cross the border       illegally has risen to 2,000 per day, providing additional       resources for detention and transportation is essential. This       would require an increase of $798 million over the FY 2019       funding level in the Senate version of the bill.        --Humanitarian Needs: The President requests an additional       $800 million to address urgent humanitarian needs. This       includes additional funding for enhanced medical support,       transportation, consumable supplies appropriate for the       population, and additional temporary facilities for       processing and short-term custody of this vulnerable       population, which are necessary to ensure the well-being of       those taken into custody.        --Counter-narcotics/weapons Technology: Beyond these       specific budgetary requests, the Administration looks forward       to working with Congress to provide resources in other areas       to address the unprecedented challenges we face along the       Southwest border. Specifically, $675 million would provide       Non-Intrusive Inspection (NII) technology at inbound lanes at       U.S. Southwest Border Land Ports of Entry (LPOE) would allow       CBP to deter and detect more contraband, including narcotics,       weapons, and other materials that pose nuclear and       radiological threats. This would require an increase of $631       million over the FY 2019 funding level in the Senate version       of the bill.        In addition, to address the humanitarian crisis of       unaccompanied alien children (UACs), Democrats have proposed       in-country asylum processing for Central American Minors.       This would require a statutory change, along with       reallocation of State Department funds to establish in-      country processing capacities at Northern Triangle consulates       and embassies. Furthermore, for the new procedure to achieve       the desired humanitarian result, a further corresponding       statutory change would be required to ensure that those who       circumvent the process and come to the United States without       authorization can be promptly returned home. Without the       latter change, in-country processing will not reduce the       unauthorized flow or successfully mitigate the humanitarian       crisis.''        These upfront investments in physical barriers and       technology, as well as legislation to close loopholes in our       immigration system, will reduce illegal immigration, the flow       of illicit drugs entering our country and reduce the long       term costs for border and immigration enforcement activities.        The Administration looks forward to advancing these       critical priorities as part of legislation to reopen the       Government.            Sincerely,                                                 Russell T. Vought,                                                   Acting Director.     I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
