 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 7276, the  Ukraine Invasion War Crimes Deterrence and Accountability Act.   I am a proud cosponsor of this important legislation, and I thank  Chairman Meeks and the committee for working with Ranking Member McCaul  on this critical, bipartisan bill.   Last weekend, the world saw in Bucha what the Ukrainian people have  been telling us since the start of this invasion, that the Russians are  indiscriminately torturing and executing Ukrainian men, women, and  children.   It is important in these periods of conflict that the United States  contribute to collecting, analyzing, and preserving critical evidence  of war crimes and other atrocities.   For two decades Putin has gone unchecked and never paid a diplomatic  or even economic price for his 22 years of mania. He has never faced,  until he met the Ukrainians, true armed resistance. He leveled Grozny,  destroyed historic Aleppo with his coconspirator and partner, Assad,  and he waltzed into Crimea, Mr. Speaker, in 2014 without firing a shot.  The line has been finally drawn in Ukraine.   This House, on a bipartisan basis, has worked to document Assad's  mass murder in Syria. As a result of that work and the work of the  United Nations Mechanism, we have had a recent conviction in Koblenz,  Germany, of a Syrian intelligence official for crimes against humanity.   The U.N. recently approved an independent inquiry into Ukraine. That  is precisely the same step of a decade ago in Syria. Enacting this  legislation will ensure that the United States contributes to this  effort.  [[Page H4215]]    I encourage all my colleagues to support this important bill, and I  thank Mr. Meeks and Mr. McCaul for their leadership.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to call up H.R. 471,  the PAUSE Act, to protect all Americans from Biden's border crisis.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the remarkable  achievement of Petit Jean Meats, marking 100 years of business in  central Arkansas.   Petit Jean Meats was established in 1922 by the late Felix Schlosser,  searching for a better opportunity after escaping an inflation-ravaged  Germany.   He found that opportunity in Morrilton, Arkansas, and opened a small  retail market, which has now expanded into a 48,000-square foot  processing plant.   The story of Petit Jean Meats is truly inspirational, and today, it  is still owned by that same family.   Current owner David Ruff says: ``We still do things the old-fashioned  way, which gives our meats that old-fashioned flavor.''   I commend Petit Jean Meats for this outstanding achievement, and I  wish them continued success.                            ____________________
