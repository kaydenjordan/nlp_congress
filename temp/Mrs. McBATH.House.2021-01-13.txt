 Madam Speaker, I rise with a heavy heart for what our  Nation has endured.   All those who have incited an attack on these Halls of freedom must  never forget that, in every generation, Americans of all colors and  creeds have laid down their lives in the struggles against tyranny, the  fight against fascism, and the defense against those who would betray  the values upon which this Nation was founded.   It is our duty to shoulder that defense of our democracy here today.  The President's actions have laid bare his contempt for our  Constitution, and he must be removed.
