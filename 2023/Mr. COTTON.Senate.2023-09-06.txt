 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to honor Keith Stokes, a dear  friend, a beloved Arkansan, and a trusted aide.   On August 18, Keith tragically passed away from a heart attack at age  59. He is in our prayers, along with the entire Stokes family,  especially his wife Julie and his children Chip and Abbey.   Keith wasn't only a colleague, though; he was a close family friend.  The Cottons lived just up the road from the Stokeses in Yell County.  Julie and my mother worked together in middle school for years. Keith  was a pillar of the Dardanelle community, from the  [[Page S4216]]  school board to the hospital board, to mentoring young athletes, to  cooking meals for teachers, charities, and even the Sand Lizard  football press box, my father included.   A year into my term in the Senate, I heard that Keith was looking for  a new job. I jumped at the opportunity to hire him as an agricultural  adviser. I knew how much Keith cared about Arkansas farmers, foresters,  and ranchers. It was one of the best decisions I made as a Senator.   Keith understood the Arkansans who lace up their boots in the morning  and work with their hands, who aren't afraid to get dirty to get the  job done--the men and women who shower at the end of the day, not at  the beginning of it. He understood them because he was one of them. He  lived on a farm. He worked in the pork and forestry industry for years,  and he cultivated an encyclopedic knowledge of everything, from the  crops in the fields to the beetles in the forest, to animals in the  hunting season. He knew everything about Arkansas, from the soil to the  people.   Keith could go into a town and within hours learn what was worrying  the farmers at the feed store and exciting the cattlemen at the sale  barn.   He had a way of making everyone he met feel important. Even if he was  just getting a quick breakfast in a diner, he made sure to say  something nice to the waitress and make the person behind the counter  laugh. Keith knew kindness cost nothing, but its value is priceless.   He was often the smartest man in the room, even if he didn't admit it  and usually tried to conceal it. He never bragged or drew attention  from others. He was always eager to listen and give credit.   Ronald Reagan had a famous small plaque on his desk in the Oval  Office that read:         There is no limit to what a man can do or where he can go       if he doesn't mind who gets the credit.    Few live by that creed. Keith embodied it.   Keith was a trusted adviser and a steady hand during difficult times.  At 59, he was a bit older than most congressional aides, but his extra  years of experience were on full display when it was needed most. He  navigated the high-stress situations with poise, humor, and calmness.   When a tornado devastated the town of Wynne this spring, Keith was  among the first people on the ground. He remained in constant  communication with the mayor and other State and local officials.  Anytime someone had a question about whom to contact or what was going  on or what the locals needed, we knew that we could just ask Keith.   He was great at his job. But that wasn't the most important thing  about Keith or the people who worked with him. To work with Keith was  like being adopted into the Stokes family. Some aides got a second  father while others got a fifth grandparent.   Keith's coworkers would often get a text message in the morning from  Keith just checking in, saying hello. If you didn't reply, you could be  sure that he would follow up quickly, and the same thing if you were  traveling overseas.   Each year, my aides crossed the State to have a Christmas party, and  each year Keith would insist on barbecuing for the whole office, and  each year he would cook too much and end up feeding much of the rest of  the building too.    During COVID, one of Keith's coworkers had to cancel a planned  wedding shower. As he drove across the State, he stopped for what he  thought was an impromptu visit, only to find Keith organized a surprise  wedding shower.   And for every parent in our office, Keith would get their kids' sizes  and begin a one-man recruitment campaign to make them fans of the  University of Arkansas. Many Razorback onesies, hats, and shirts made  their way through our offices.   When one coworker lost her father and mentioned that she would miss  talking to him on the phone each day, Keith began to call her every  day, even on weekends. He only missed one call in 3 years. And when she  was stuck in an ice storm without water and couldn't drive her car,  Keith drove over 2 hours at night in the bad weather to deliver water  and a smile.   When another coworker tragically lost a child, Keith was there in  that time of loss to provide comfort and prayers.   When asked to describe Keith, his coworkers used words like  ``humble,'' ``honest,'' ``loving,'' ``caring,'' ``professional,''  ``God-fearing,'' and ``gentleman.'' One put it well when she said:         They don't make them like Keith any more.    There is a reason that, when Senate staffers came to Arkansas to  visit, they fought over who would get to ride in the car with Keith.   While his coworkers knew Keith as a beloved friend and colleague,  most Arkansans knew Keith as the guy who raised Tusk. For those who  don't know--and you all should; let's be honest--Tusk is the live  mascot of the University of Arkansas. Other universities have easy,  safe, cuddly mascots to raise, like the Oregon Beavers or the Georgia  Bulldogs or the Minnesota Gophers--not Arkansas and not Keith. We have  a razorback, a 300-pound wild boar with giant tusks and a well-deserved  reputation for a bad attitude.   For that reason, the University of Arkansas had long settled for a,  frankly, embarrassing little pig as a live mascot, which traveled to  games on a small trailer with little fanfare. But about 25 years ago,  some former University of Arkansas football players decided to get a  real live razorback mascot. They turned to Keith, who had experience  working hogs. They also asked for his help designing a large and  impressive trailer so the new mascot could travel in style.   Keith took on the challenge with his usual enthusiasm, determination,  and positive attitude. Ever since, Keith and his family have raised  Tusk I through Tusk V, and I doubt any animals have ever been better  treated or trained.   Keith devoted thousands of hours of his time to domesticate the Tusks  so they could travel and safely interact with fans. Keith would have  Tusk follow him around everywhere on the farm and even raised a baby  razorback in his home to acclimate it to human company.   Keith was such a good handler that young fans could safely feed  grapes to these giant boars. Risk takers could put an apple in their  teeth, and Tusk would gently take it from their mouth--at risk, though,  of getting some slobber on them.   Keith and Tusk became celebrities in our State. Arkansans from every  walk of life enjoyed seeing Keith's truck and giant trailer with the  Razorback logo and Tusk riding in the back.   The Stokes family saw it as their responsibility to the State to take  care of Arkansas' prized mascot. Keith selflessly gave his time to  Razorback fans, patiently answering their questions about Tusk, letting  them play with Tusk, even handing out Tusk autographs.   If Keith heard you hadn't attended a Razorback game, well, he got you  tickets. If he heard your kid had outgrown the last Razorback shirt he  sent, a replacement would soon be on the way.   He showed the same kindness and generosity to strangers. When he  heard that a young fan with Down syndrome was also a fan of Tusk, Keith  went out of his way to be sure that he got to pet and feed Tusk.   One former Arkansas football player said ``Keith Stokes was Tusk''  and that Keith gave as much to the Razorbacks as any player or coach.   But as much as Keith loved his friends, our State, and the Arkansas  Razorbacks, he loved his family most of all. Keith and Julie were  inseparable and brightened each other's lives for 39 wonderful years of  marriage. He was always so proud of his son Chip and his daughter  Abbey. He joyfully welcomed his daughter-in-law Lori and son-in-law  Tanner to the Stokes family. He walked Abbey down the aisle just this  summer. And, of course, he adored his grandchildren Colt and Caroline,  who called him George. He loved them all dearly, and they all loved  him.   Keith was a truly extraordinary man. It is hard to believe that he  had time to do all the things he did. Few people who lead full and long  lives do as much good and spread as much joy as Keith Stokes did in his  too-short 59 years with us.   I do have to say that Keith wasn't always right. One of his common  jokes was that only six people would show up  [[Page S4217]]  for his funeral, and they would all be the pallbearers. Well, I was  there, and, boy, was he wrong. It wasn't just six or a dozen or  hundreds. More than 1,200 people came to mourn Keith's loss and pay  their respects to his family.   And Keith departed the funeral as he would have wanted. Instead of a  traditional hearse, Keith's bright ``Arkansas red'' casket rested in  the bed of the truck he used to transport Tusk. Attendees were  encouraged to wear red and, in accordance with his wishes, the Arkansas  fight song took him to his final resting place. Keith's final act was,  once again, to add a small smile to his friends' and family's faces,  even in the depths of their sadness.   I was blessed to know Keith, and I know he is looking down from  Heaven right now, blushing from all the attention. But he deserves it,  and his family and friends down here deeply miss him.   I yield the floor.
