 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S.  3444, which renames the VA community-based outpatient clinic in Lake  Charles, Louisiana, after First Lieutenant Douglas Fournet.   Mr. Speaker, I was proud to sponsor the House version of this bill.   Douglas Fournet is an American hero deserving of the highest tribute.  He joined the Army in 1966 and was deployed to Vietnam. There, Fournet  served as rifle platoon leader of the 2nd Platoon, Company Bravo.   In the A Shau Valley of Vietnam, the platoon came under sniper fire.  With an enemy mine in the way of the platoon's advance, Fournet ordered  his men to take cover. He then ran uphill to the mine and attempted to  disarm it with a knife. Before he could succeed, the mine was  detonated.   Douglas Fournet was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor in 1970.  He is the sole recipient from southwest Louisiana.   Douglas Fournet gave his last full measure of devotion in service to  his country and in defense of his platoon.   Our freedoms are paid for by the blood of patriots like First  Lieutenant Fournet. Renaming of the Lake Charles VA clinic is a small  tribute to his courage and forever enshrines the legacy among southwest  Louisiana veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join with me and honor the life,  legacy, and gallantry of First Lieutenant Douglas Fournet. I urge  favorable passage.
