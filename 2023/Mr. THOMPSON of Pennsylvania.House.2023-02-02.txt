 Mr. Speaker, today is a big day in the  15th Congressional District of Pennsylvania. Specifically, in  Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, our most famous resident had his day in the  sun, literally.   To quote Bill Murray: ``It's Groundhog Day, again.''   Early this morning, Punxsutawney Phil, our weather expert groundhog,  saw his shadow. For those of you who know the old German legend, this  means we are in for 6 more weeks of winter.   Punxsy Phil has been forecasting the weather since the 1800s. Records  going back to 1886 show that Phil has forecasted a longer winter 107  times and an early spring just 20 times.   Crowds gathered on Gobbler's Knob before sunrise today for the 137th  celebration.   Phil has proven himself a devoted prognosticator year after year and  is a true icon in the world of weather forecasting.   For these reasons and many more, Phil was inducted into the 2023  Meteorologists Hall of Fame by the Weather Discovery Center.   So don't pack up your winter gear just yet. Phil says we have 6 more  weeks. Happy Groundhog Day.                            ____________________
