 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New York  for yielding.   Madam Speaker, the 116th Congress has the largest number of women  serving in this body's history: 101 women serving in the House and 26  women in the Senate. This historic class of women represents the broad  and diverse America that we live in.   We are all public servants. We all came here to serve our country and  our communities. I frequently disagree with colleagues, but policy  differences are no excuse for personal attacks, and we know that some  of the harshest personal attacks are often reserved for women of color.  Furthermore, telling a woman, ``I am sorry you heard it that way,'' is  a cliche as old as time to belittle and dismiss women after attacking  them.   We have got to do better. We are role models for our children. I am  standing here not just for my two daughters but for my two sons. We  have got to do better.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment to  increase funding for the Airborne Hazard and Burn Pit Center of  Excellence.   Burn pits have been called the Agent Orange of our generation. Too  many of our veterans have been exposed to harmful chemicals from burn  pits, which we know lead to increased risk of lung and respiratory  diseases. We have seen this firsthand in my district due to the  illnesses related to working on the burn pits on the pile in an area of  the 9/11 terrorist attacks. We must do more.   The center located in New Jersey is doing critical research into the  long-term health effects from burn pits, research our veterans and  healthcare providers need.  [[Page H3803]]    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this package.
