 Madam President, I rise today to congratulate and honor  the retirement of one of my senior staff members and friend who has  served in my home State of Idaho for the last 13 years as the regional  director of my Lewiston office, Michael ``Mike'' L. Hanna.   Following his retirement from the timber industry, Mike came to my  staff after my first election to the U.S. Senate in May of 2009. I knew  right away that he was a perfect fit for the regional director position  in my Lewiston office. As a result, my chief of staff and I hired him  immediately following his interview.   Mike was born in Boise, ID, and was raised there and in the Emmett  Valley, where his parents' families worked as farmers and sawmill  workers. Growing up in a farming and timber family eventually led him  to the University of Idaho, where he graduated with a bachelor of  science degree in forest management in 1976.   Upon graduating from U of I, Mike began his 33-year career in the  timber industry as a forester with the Idaho Department of Lands. After  12 years with the State of Idaho, he transitioned to the private  sector, where he worked for Empire Lumber Company, Weyerhaeuser, and  Three River Timber.   Given his expertise and vast knowledge of the timber industry, Mike  was frequently called upon to participate in and lead collaborative  groups and natural resource associations and organizations. To name but  a few, he was a founding member of the Clearwater Basin Collaborative,  president of the Intermountain Logging Conference board of directors,  president of the Resource Organization on Timber Supply, or ROOTS,  president of the Clearwater Resource Coalition, and the chairman of the  Forestry Committee of the Intermountain Forestry Association. He was  also recognized by the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation for his U.S.  Forest Service stewardship contract work.   With his deep roots in Idaho and the timber industry, he was the  perfect representative to the natural resource communities of the  Clearwater Region, stationed out of my Lewiston office. During his 13  years of service as my regional director, he advised and guided my  office through many complicated issues, like the Idaho roadless rule  implementation, the salmon and steelhead management plans, Columbia  River Treaty, Good Neighbor Authority, tribal relations, and too many  other issues to name.   Mike and his wife Nancy have been married for 45 years and have made  their home in Orofino, ID for 44 years, where they are an integral part  of the fabric of the community. They have two children, Lindsay and  Adam, and five grandchildren.   It is always difficult to lose a trusted staff member of Mike's  character, experience, and knowledge, and I wish him and Nancy nothing  but the best in their retirement and look forward to our continued  friendship in the years ahead.   Congratulations and thank you for your outstanding service to my  staff and the citizens of Idaho.                            ____________________     Madam President, Martin Luther King, Jr., dreamed  of a world of peace and equality, and honoring his legacy is a central  priority of the Idaho Falls African American Alliance, or AAA. Today, I  recognize the accomplishments of the Idaho Falls AAA and highlight  their 15th Annual Martin Luther King, Jr., Banquet.   The Idaho Falls AAA was formed in 2006, when a few members of the  community became aware of a local African-American high school student  in need of funds to travel to a regional debate competition. One of  these individuals was the current Idaho Falls AAA president, David  Snell. Growing up, his mother told him, ``You should never be a part of  a community that does not feel your presence. It is your personal  responsibility to make sure your community is better because you were a  part of it.'' The group worked together to raise $300 and sponsored the  trip for the talented debater.   This experience sparked a movement as the group realized they could  make a difference in the community and help other kids in need. AAA  members also recognized an opportunity to promote diversity in the  community, expand awareness of the contributions of African Americans  and other minorities, and begin to build a sense of understanding  between cultures and ethnicities.   Martin Luther King, Jr., influenced their mission, and they soon  organized an annual MLK Banquet to provide the community an opportunity  to learn from prominent African-American leaders. Over the past 15  years, guests have included Dr. Walter Massey, past president of  Morehouse College; Pete Miller, former Undersecretary of Energy;  Freeman Hrabowski, voted one of TIME magazine's 100 Most Influential  People of 2012; and Idaho State Senator Cherie Buckner-Webb.   This year's AAA banquet will feature keynote speaker USAF Capt.  Daniel ``Fuzz'' Walker, the first African-American pilot qualified to  fly the F-22 stealth fighter plane, and grandson of one of the original  Tuskegee Airmen.   Ms. Michelle Amos, system engineer for NASA's Perseverance, the 2020  Mars rover, will also deliver remarks over Zoom. Ms. Amos won an All- Star Award at NASA's Women of Color Government and Defense Technology  Awards Conference, is the former chairperson of NASA's Black Employee  Strategy Team, and is currently a public affairs spokesperson for the  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.   The organization has faced some challenges but has also received  generous support from the Idaho Falls community. Many local businesses  provide donations and services making the MLK Banquet possible each  year. The proceeds from the annual event are used to support their  mission to ``further the educational, economic, cultural and  development growth of the Idaho Falls African American Community.''   The Idaho Falls AAA serves to bring people together in times that can  feel divisive. I commend the AAA and its membership for its work to  help make Idaho Falls a better community.                            ____________________
