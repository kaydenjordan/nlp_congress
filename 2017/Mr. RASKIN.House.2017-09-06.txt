 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R.  3440, the DREAM Act, to protect Fatima, whose young brothers-- exceptional soccer talents in Montgomery County, Maryland--were  deported over a great public protest just last month.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous  consent request cannot be entertained.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota  (Mr. Nolan) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.
