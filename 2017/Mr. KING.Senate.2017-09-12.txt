 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 100th  anniversary of Bridgton Hospital. Over the past 100 years, Bridgton  Hospital in Bridgton, ME, has consistently provided high quality,  personal patient care for local communities in western Maine.  Nationally recognized for its excellent performance, I am pleased to  honor this hospital for its century of service and commitment to our  State.   Bridgton Hospital was originally founded in 1917 after Bridgton  resident Clara Fogg left a bequest for the creation of the facility.  Since then, Bridgton Hospital has grown tremendously due to the  diligent efforts and commitment by community leaders. In 1999, Bridgton  Hospital became a subsidiary of Central Maine Medical Center, making it  a crucial part of the integrated regional healthcare system. During  this past decade, Bridgton Hospital has taken a number of steps to  expand its services, facilities, and operations, giving patients access  to high quality care close to home that they once had to travel miles  to receive.   The exceptional team of physicians, professional clinicians, nurses,  staff, and volunteers who work together to make Bridgton Hospital truly  unique have garnered a number of awards for its care. In 2016 alone, it  was one of 21 hospitals to be awarded ``Top Rural Hospital'' in the  country. Bridgton Hospital was also selected as one of the top 20  hospitals in the categories of overall performance and quality outcomes  out of 1,400 small and rural hospitals in the U.S. The hospital was the  only hospital in Maine to achieve top performance in all categories,  including overall, quality outcomes, services scores, and financial  results, as awarded by Maine Health Access Foundation. In past years,  Bridgton Hospital has also been named one of the Best Places to Work in  Maine. Additionally in 2016, Bridgton Hospital CEO David Frum was  recognized as a ``Top 50 Critical Access CEOs to Know'' by Becker's  Hospital Review magazine. Frum was recognized for his leadership and  commitment to excellence.   In January 2017, I had the privilege to personally visit Bridgton  Hospital and speak with their healthcare experts and providers. This  hospital stands as a shining example of how strong leadership and  compassion for the community results in a successful organization.  Bridgton Hospital has played an instrumental role in ensuring safe and  quality healthcare in Maine. I wish to join the entire Bridgton  community in congratulating Bridgton Hospital on their centennial  achievement and thank them for their immeasurable service to the State  of Maine.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and thank Col.  Kelley Kash for his exceptional service to our Nation while serving in  the U.S. Air Force, as well as his leadership as the CEO of Maine  Veterans' Homes, MVH, a post he has held since 2007.  [[Page S5212]]    Colonel Kash grew up in a military family. His father was a career  Army officer and flew helicopters in Vietnam. While not a native of  Maine, Colonel Kash first moved to the State of Maine to attend Colby  College in Waterville, where he graduated in 1981 with a bachelor of  arts in classics. He then went on to earn his master of science in  hospital and health services administration from Ohio State University,  before earning a commission in the U.S. Air Force in 1984. As deputy  commander of an air transportable hospital, he provided medical support  to deployed U.S. forces in support of Operation Provide Comfort, as  well as medical care to over 5,000 indigent Haitian patients. In his  final assignment, he served as commander of the 18th Medical Group, the  largest U.S. Air Force medical unit in the Pacific.   Upon his retirement from Active Duty in 2007, the veterans community  of Maine was fortunate to gain a profound leader when Colonel Kash was  hired as the CEO of Maine Veterans' Home. During his tenure as CEO, he  directed a successful national effort that inspired Federal legislation  to correct serious underfunding problems with the new VA program for  severely disabled veterans receiving care in State veterans homes.   While his efforts and achievements both in the Air Force and with MVH  are notable, a few highlights that illustrate his leadership are MVH  Scarborough became the first nursing home in Maine to achieve the rare  Gold Excellence in Quality Award by the American Health Care  Association and one of only 31 awarded nationally since 1997. Not only  have all six facilities in Maine been recognized for providing quality  customer services, but they have also achieved the elite Silver  Achievement in Quality Award. Four MVH facilities are currently at the  highest five-star overall rating by the Center of Medicare and Medicaid  Services for survey results, staffing, and quality indicators.   Colonel Kash has prepared Maine Veterans' Home for long-term success  by completing a strategic master plan for all MVH campuses with the  goal of better delivering resident-directed care in ``home''  environments using small-house model design principles. His plan  includes over $200 million worth of funding spanning over the next 15  years. His plan is already underway with modernizations projects  occurring at various MVH locations in Maine, including a state-of-the- art therapy and rehab addition at Bangor, a multipurpose room addition  at Machias, and decentralized dining projects at Scarborough, Bangor,  and South Paris. Colonel Kash's leadership has led Maine Veterans'  Homes to remarkable transformations and major success in providing  better care for Maine's veterans. On behalf of veterans communities  across the State of Maine, I want to thank Colonel Kash for his  commitment to providing excellent care and access to services for our  veterans.                            ____________________
