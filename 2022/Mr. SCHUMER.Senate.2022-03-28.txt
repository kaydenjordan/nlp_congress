 Madam President, this morning, President Biden released  his budget for fiscal year 2023.   When you compare the President's agenda with the nasty Republican  proposals, like the one from the Senator from Florida, it is clear that  the contrast between the two parties is stark and glaring. One budget  is for the ultrarich, and the other budget is for the middle class and  those working to get there.   President Biden's vision for America is refreshingly bold,  responsible, and taps into our Nation's greatest strength--the American  people themselves. It is a good, strong budget that will help build on  the historic growth of the past year.   For starters, the President's budget zeros in on fighting inflation.  It calls, for instance, on increasing domestic manufacturing and  relieving supply chain bottlenecks, especially at our ports.   It increases help for American families to afford childcare, pre-K,  and provides more funding to help schools with the academic and mental  health resources to help students thrive.   It builds on the President's promise to expand healthcare and  supports efforts to lower prescription drug costs. Lowering  prescription drug costs is one of the highest priorities of Senate  Democrats, and we are eager and ready to work with the administration  on this front.   After years of Trump budgets that didn't even mention the word  ``climate,'' President Biden's plan would boost investments in clean  energy, lower the costs of energy for low-income Americans, and speed  up our transition to clean cars made right here in America, which will  create thousands and thousands of good-paying new jobs.   Critically, the President's budget will grow our country while making  sure the richest Americans pay their  [[Page S1793]]  fair share. Most Americans think it is unacceptable for those at the  top to pay less in taxes than teachers and firefighters. God bless the  rich--I have nothing against them--but I applaud the President's  proposal for making sure the ultrarich chip in to growing our country.   Finally, I commend the President for releasing a budget that honors  our Nation's promise to Ukraine while keeping Americans around the  world safe from harm.   Now compare the President's budget, President Biden's budget, to the  bewildering vision laid out by Senate Republicans in recent weeks.   While Democrats want to lower costs for American families,  Republicans are openly calling on raising taxes on most Americans.   Yesterday, the junior Senator from Florida went on FOX News Sunday to  deny this part of his plan, only for the anchor--the FOX anchor--to  remind everyone watching: ``No, it's in the plan.''   While Democrats want to strengthen Medicare and make healthcare more  affordable, Republicans have resurrected calls to repeal healthcare and  even possibly put Medicare on the chopping block. And lest anyone  forget, a few months ago, the junior Senator from Florida, in another  example, openly said inflation was a ``gold mine''--a gold mine--for  the Republican Party, a gold mine. People are hurt; it is a gold mine  for the Republican Party.   Just how callous, how retrograde, how backward is the Republican  vision for America? raising taxes on working people? cheerleading  inflation? stoking divisions and even putting things like Medicare at  risk while pushing tax breaks for the ultrarich? If that is their pitch  to the American people, God help Republicans.   In the meantime, I thank President Biden for releasing a strong,  optimistic, and responsible plan that will build on the historic  recovery our Nation has seen in the past year.   Senate Democrats will work with the administration to put these  proposals into concrete legislation in the weeks and months to come.                                  H.R. 4521    Madam President, now on the competition bill, it is an important day  here on the Senate floor. In a few hours, we will hold a vote on final  passage for the bipartisan jobs and competitiveness legislation many of  us have worked on for over a year.   For the information of all, today's action will come in two steps. We  will first vote on cloture on the substitute amendment, which contains  the text of the Senate-passed United States Innovation and Competition  Act. Then we will proceed to final passage. Both votes are set at a 60- vote threshold, and I am confident that we will wrap up this important  work by the end of the day.   As I have said since the beginning of this process, the actions we  are taking on the Senate floor will enable us to enter a conference  committee with the House, which we need in order to finalize our  competitiveness bill. I believe we can see a conference committee  initiated by the end of this work period.   If enacted, I believe this legislation will be one of the most  important accomplishments of the 117th Congress. This bill, for all its  provisions, is really about two big things: creating more American jobs  and lowering costs for American families.   It will help lowering costs by making it easier to produce critical  technologies here at home, like semiconductors. It will create more  jobs by bringing manufacturing back from overseas.   And just as importantly, this legislation will fuel another  generation of American innovation. Whichever nation is the first to  master the technologies of tomorrow will reshape the world in its  image. America cannot afford to come in second place when it comes to  technologies like 5G, AI, quantum computing, semiconductors,  bioengineering, and so much more.   This bill is a necessary step toward securing the bright future of  American ingenuity, which has always helped us lead the way.   I want to thank my colleagues from both sides of the aisle for  everything they have done to help us each this moment. It has been a  long, hard road, but almost every Member of this Chamber has had a hand  in putting this bill together. It was a blend of various proposals  across various committees, and it was a product of a healthy amendment  process both in committee and on the floor.   We are, hopefully, just a few hours away from reaching the next  important step in the process, putting us on a glidepath to initiating  a conference committee with the House.                                 Coronavirus    Madam President, on COVID, over the past few weeks, our country has  made major strides in the fight against COVID. Cases, deaths, and  hospitalizations are coming down and staying down. Schools and  communities are opening up and staying open.   But in order to preserve this progress, Congress must now act to make  sure that our communities, our healthcare workers, and our families  have the resources they need to keep our country open. Sadly, public  funding for COVID relief is in critical danger of actually running out.   That is why right now I am working with my Republican colleagues to  reach a bipartisan agreement on another COVID-19 package. The White  House has been unambiguous in saying they need more funding with all  due haste, so that is what we are working to secure ASAP.   A new bipartisan bill will pay for all the tools we know work best  against new variants: It will ensure we have enough vaccines; enough  testing; enough therapeutics, which do amazing things if you get them  in time; and support our schools to stay open in a safe way. We also  need to do more to boost global vaccination efforts and support  cutting-edge research into new vaccines.   We already know what to do in order to keep life going as normally as  possible should another variant threaten to unravel our progress. Now  we simply need to secure the funding to make sure we can keep schools  open and our communities as safe as possible. If you don't go for the  funding and a new variant hits and it gets bad, shame on you. Everyone  should be for this.   Over the next few days, we will keep negotiating with our Republican  colleagues in good faith. While we are not there yet, talks have been  encouraging, and I hope we can reach an agreement very soon.                            ____________________     Madam President, I understand that there are two bills  at the desk due for a second reading en bloc.    In order to place the bills on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceeding en bloc.    Thank you.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, in a few minutes, the Senate is going to  take a final vote on the major bipartisan jobs and competitive  legislation.   As we all know, it has been a long road to reach this point. I want  to thank my Democratic and Republican colleagues for working in good  faith on the bill. Nearly every Member of this Chamber has had a hand  in shaping this legislation.   There are three important reasons for passing the bill. It will  create more American jobs. It will lower costs for American families.  It will help ignite another generation of American scientific research  and innovation.   After we pass this bill, we will be one step closer to initiating a  conference committee so we can resolve the House and Senate bills. I am  hopeful we will be able to reach a conference committee before the end  of this work period.   I thank all my colleagues for their good work on this bill and ask  for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I have one request for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of the  Majority and Minority Leaders.   Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committees are authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:                          COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY    The Committee on the Judiciary is authorized to meet during the  session of the Senate on Monday, March 28, 2022, at 3 p.m., to conduct  an executive business meeting.    Madam President, in a few moments I will file a  discharge petition to move forward on the nomination of Lisa DeNell  Cook to serve on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.   Not very long ago, a nominee like Ms. Cook would have sailed toward  final confirmation. She serves on the advisory board of the Federal  Reserve Bank of Chicago. She is a professor of economics at Michigan  State and has served on the White House Council of Economic Advisers.  She would also be the first Black woman to sit on the Federal Reserve  Board of Governors.   Sadly, every single Republican in the committee voted in lockstep  against Ms. Cook--that was in the Banking Committee--providing no good  explanation for obstructing this qualified and historic nominee.   Nonetheless, the step I am taking now will make sure Ms. Cook's  nomination will move forward, setting up a vote as soon as tomorrow.                            ____________________     Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 672.

There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:35 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, March 29, 2022, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
