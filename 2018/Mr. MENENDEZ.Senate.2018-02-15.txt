 Madam President, I come to the floor today, fully aware  that time is running out for America's Dreamers. Their fates rest in  our hands. Their futures hang in the balance of our votes, and what Dr.  King called ``the fierce urgency of now'' is officially upon us.   If we fail to take action today, the dreams of 800,000 young people  protected under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program,  known as DACA, and thousands of others like them will turn to  nightmares. It is truly a terrifying prospect that Dreamers face--the  prospect that at any moment after they fall out of status, they could  be snatched up by President Trump's deportation forces, torn away from  their families, and sent away to countries they consider foreign lands.  Well, I refuse to be complicit in that nightmare.   I refuse to be complicit in the deportation of innocent children. I  refuse to be complicit in the deportation of 800,000 DACA recipients  and the 22,000 Dreamers living, studying, and working in my home State  of New Jersey. It is only out of compassion for them and commitment to  them that I am prepared to vote for the bipartisan deal reached last  night, the Rounds-King version.   Let me be very clear. This is not the deal I would have drafted. It  is far from the deal I would want, but I know for a fact that it is the  only deal with a shot at becoming law. It is the only deal with any  hope of earning 60 votes, a simple majority in the House, and maybe the  forced signature of Donald Trump's pen. Therefore, it is the only deal  with any hope of protecting more than a million Dreamers across America  from the President's mass deportation agenda.   To my fellow Democrats, to my friends and fellow leaders in the  Hispanic community, to those in the immigration advocacy community, and  to the millions of Americans in New Jersey and across the Nation who  stood by Dreamers throughout this ordeal, I will not sugarcoat things.  This deal is not the fairness that we would want. It is not as fiscally  responsible as it should be. To be honest, if my Republican colleagues  truly wanted to protect America's Dreamers in good faith, they would  have done so months ago. Instead, they refused to address this crisis  for months.   Republicans chose to treat Dreamers like bargaining chips, pawns that  could be used to advance far-right restrictions on lawful, family- sponsored immigration to the United States and to deliver President  Trump a big, fat $25 billion kiss in the form of border wall funding.  The only thing more preposterous than asking Mexico to pay for a border  wall is asking the American people to pay $25 billion for a border  wall. That is $25 billion that could be going to repairing the walls of  our crumbling public schools, outdated airports, and aging highway  tunnels. That is $25 billion Americans will have to pay for Donald  Trump's broken promise that Mexico would foot the bill.   In case you couldn't tell by now, I am not the biggest fan of this  deal. It is a bitter pill to swallow. So when I hear my Republican  colleagues say that this legislation isn't tough enough, I encourage  them to take a closer look. Look at the hard choices that I--and the  community that I come from and others in this country--have to make to  support this deal, as the most senior Hispanic-American in the  Congress, as the son of immigrants whose thirst for freedom brought  them to these shores, as the senior Senator from New Jersey, one of the  most ethnically and racially diverse States in America.   Many of the concessions Democrats agreed to were supposed to have  died in the proposal that we and the Gang of 6 brought to the President  weeks ago--only to have him reject it under the advice of the  ethnocentric voices in his ear. For example, legal, permanent residents  will no longer be able to sponsor their adult children to join them in  this country, and that is not the only hard choice we had to make in  order to protect Dreamers from deportation. While we grant them the  opportunity to earn a 12-year pathway to citizenship, we pay a dear  price by limiting the right to sponsor the parents they love so dearly,  although other U.S.-citizen families will be able to do so.   I take solace in the possibility that someday in the future,  hopefully, in the not too distant future, Congress will return to our  American values and stand proudly for the principles of family  reunification--the family unit as the core of American society,  communities, and our country--that have guided U.S. immigration  policies for the last century. It is the very family reunification that  ultimately allowed Donald Trump's grandfather to come to the United  States and have his progeny come from there and ultimately rise to be  the President of the United States.   I am going to fight for the parents of Dreamers and the comprehensive  immigration reform we need when that day comes, but for the moment, I  am under no illusions. The cold, hard reality is that in 2 weeks the  dreams of hundreds of thousands of innocent children and promising  young people will be extinguished, and that is why we must act.    To my friends in the immigration advocacy community, as well as my  Democratic colleagues, I remind you that legislating is the art of the  possible. We are in the minority in both Chambers of Congress. The  opposing party occupies the White House. We may not enjoy this  reality--I certainly don't--but it is a reality nonetheless. And in  this reality, we do not have the power to make anything happen unless  we get support from some of our colleagues on the other side of the  aisle. We have the power to try and stop terrible things from  happening, but we can make things happen only if we have others join us  in common cause.   So I ask my fellow Democrats to please hold the line for the hundreds  of thousands of innocent children and bright, young people who belong  in this country and need our votes to stay in this country. We have to  remember that compromise is the oil that keeps the wheels of Congress  running, and, without it, Dreamers who have become integral to  communities across the Nation may very well be forcibly removed. We  know they belong here with us, strengthening the diverse threads that  bind us together as one people.   To my Republican colleagues, I ask you to remember the tough  concessions we have had to make so that Dreamers have a chance to earn  citizenship in a country they love and the only country they know.   I again close by quoting the always relevant and forever wise Dr.  King, who said:         We are now faced with the fact that tomorrow is today. We       are confronted with the fierce urgency of now. In this       unfolding conundrum of life and history there is such a thing       as being too late.    My friends, the fierce urgency of now looms over us today. The fate  of our Dreamers grows more uncertain with each passing second. I, for  one, refuse to let their dreams die here on the Senate floor.   Let's pass the Rounds-King amendment and pass it fast. There is no  time for further delay. If we want Dreamers  [[Page S1141]]  to have a tomorrow here in this country, then we must act today.   With that, I yield the floor.
