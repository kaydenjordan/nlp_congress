 Mr. Speaker, in Scott Berg's biography on  Woodrow Wilson, it says that, in World War I, we had one officer for  ever 30 enlisted men.   President Eisenhower once said we had too many officers when we had  one officer for every nine enlisted. Now we have one officer for every  4\1/2\ to 5 enlisted. We are almost overrun with retired admirals and  generals. This is very expensive.   President Trump wants to greatly expand the numbers in our Armed  Forces. If we do, what we need is more enlisted men and women, not more  officers.   I started in the Army as enlisted and left as a captain, but we  simply can't afford as many officers as we have today. We now have  475,000 retired officers drawing military pensions and 1,500,000  enlisted retirees. These two million military retirees, and those near  retirement, should be demanding more fiscal conservatism by the  Pentagon, or, in the very near future, we will not be able to pay our  military pensions with money that will buy very much.                            ____________________
