 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the House passage  of my bill, the Desert Sage Youth Wellness Center Access Improvement  Act, which is now on its way to the President's desk. This much-needed  legislation will bring a paved access road to the Desert Sage Youth  Wellness Center in Hemet.   The Desert Sage Youth Wellness Center is the only operational Indian  Health Service youth treatment center in the entire State. It is the  only place in California where Native youth can receive culturally  relevant mental health care and substance use disorder treatment.   Yet, to get to the center, patients and staff have to traverse a dirt  road that often cracks in the heat and washes out in the rain and  hinders deliveries and services.   As a physician, I know how crucial culturally based care is to the  health and well-being of our communities. That is why I advocated for  the construction of Desert Sage since day one, and why I secured  funding for its completion in 2016, and why now, I am working to  deliver safe, reliable access to this facility.   Madam Speaker, I urge President Biden to sign this into law  immediately to help pave a road worthy of the dignity of the people at  Desert Sage Youth Wellness Center.                            ____________________
