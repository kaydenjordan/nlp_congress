 Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of the Jewish  Community Services of South Florida and the second generation of Miami- Dade Holocaust Survivors. Together, these two organizations will join  forces to hold a Cafe Europa, a function that honors Holocaust  survivors and their families. The name ``Cafe Europa'' is derived from  a small lounge in Stockholm. Here, survivors from liberated  concentration camps would search for family and friends after the war,  share stories and experiences, and begin to rebuild their lives.   Today, the practice remains strong in its commitment to bring  survivors together, where they can share insight and thoughts on topics  surrounding our world today.   Cafe Europa also allows us to honor these individuals and gain vital  knowledge about this dark period in history.   This event this year will be held at the Aventura Turnberry Jewish  Center on Sunday, December 3, at 11:30. My constituents David and Irene  Mermelstein, Herbie Karliner, Joe Sacks, Alex Gross, David Schaeter,  and Wendy Rothfield will attend this important event. Holocaust  survivors will share stories, grieve over loved ones lost, and recommit  that these horrendous days of our history that they survived will never  again be repeated.   Mr. Speaker, we must cherish the time that we have left with these  brave souls, to listen and to learn about their tragic stories, stories  that must be passed along to future generations about this brutal  period of injustice, and ensure that no such tyranny ever happens  again.         Congress Must Act on a Legislative Solution for Our DREAMers     Mr. Speaker, as we quickly approach the month of  December, we are reminded of the very few legislative days left on this  calendar to debate and pass a permanent solution to protect our  Nation's DREAMers from deportation.   I introduced, along with my dear friend, my colleague, Lucille  Roybal-Allard, H.R. 3440, also known as the Dream Act, to allow over  800,000 young immigrants living in our great country to remain here,  the only home that they have truly known.   This bill will allow DREAMers to apply for conditional permanent  residency, and eventually to citizenship. Each day of inaction by our  body to pass the Dream Act or any legislative fix is a loss for our  communities and our country.   Study after study demonstrates the reality that we already know: that  failure to provide a solution for our DREAMers will result in hundreds  of billions of dollars lost in GDP, a truly devastating blow to our  economy.   The business community, faith leaders, colleges and universities,  advocacy groups, all have joined a large bipartisan coalition standing  behind these young immigrants, and that is because they recognize the  positive contributions of these individuals, contributions that should  not be imperiled by their legal status.   But they are looking at us, Mr. Speaker. They are looking at  Congress. It is up to us. It is up to you and me and our colleagues on  both sides of the aisle to act. It is our responsibility, and we must  not delay action any longer. These individuals who came to this country  as children only want an opportunity to attend school, to work, to  provide for their families.   Mr. Speaker, this Nation, our Nation, was born and continues to be  built and made stronger by immigrants like these DREAMers, willing and  determined not only to realize their dreams, but truly to love, serve,  and protect this land with all of their hearts.   That is precisely why we must act now. This Chamber cannot and should  not stand idly by while these young immigrants, who are already as  American as anyone else in their hearts and their minds, live under  fear and uncertainty in this country, a country that is a beacon of  hope and a land of opportunity to those who seek it.   The lives of hundreds of thousands of bright, talented, and patriotic  young men and women depend on us, on this Congress. It is up to us to  rise to the challenge to legalize the status of these DREAMers so they  can truly make their dreams into a reality.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, December 1 is World AIDS Day, so we  celebrate our many accomplishments in the fight against HIV/AIDS around  the globe.   As Americans, we can look back and be proud that our Nation has been  a transformative force in the global fight against AIDS and a ray of  hope for millions of lives around the world.   Globally, our efforts through programs like PEPFAR are currently  supporting treatments for more than 1 million people and have averted  more than 16 million HIV infections around the world. However, there is  still much work to be done. Currently, more than 36 million people in  the world are living with HIV, and nearly 1,000 girls are infected with  HIV every day.   Mr. Speaker, December 1, World AIDS Day, reminds us to redouble our  efforts on behalf of those suffering from this terrible disease. Now  more than ever, it is essential that we remain committed to creating a  future without HIV/AIDS                            ____________________
