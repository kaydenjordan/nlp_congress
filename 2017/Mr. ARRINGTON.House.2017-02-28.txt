 Madam Chair, the cumulative cost of regulations in our  country is now at the tune of $2 trillion, and it costs us $60 billion  just to enforce those regulations every year. With all due respect,  that is not window dressing. When you take a look at those numbers, it  is clear to see that the bureaucratic state of our Federal Government  is threatening our job creators and killing our economy.   Today, we have an opportunity to reverse course on the stifling  regulations flowing from Washington by passing H.R. 998, the SCRUB Act,  as amended here by my colleague, Congresswoman Martha McSally.   The SCRUB Act will establish a commission to review existing Federal  regulations and identify for Congress which of those place unnecessary  costs on our economy. The amendment offered by the gentlewoman from  Arizona (Ms. McSally) will take the SCRUB Act a step further by  requiring this commission to consider for removal all regulations  dating back to 1996 that did not comply with the law that states that  there must be an accompanying report to Congress. According to the GAO,  that is almost 30 percent of final rules.   All of this is done in a manner consistent with my colleague's  standalone bill, the Require CRA Compliance Act, that I was also proud  to join her in sponsoring.    Madam Chair, in closing, we owe this to the American  people. We owe this to my children and your grandchildren. We owe this  to our local job creators to break the chains of these burdensome  regulations and, once again, unleash the spirit of American innovation  and enterprise that made this country the envy of the world by passing  the SCRUB Act and the McSally amendment.
