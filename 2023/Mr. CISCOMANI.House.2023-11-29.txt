 Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Westerman for yielding.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of this bill in my district which  includes parts of the Tucson sector where we are currently seeing  record levels of illegal crossings of over 15,000 per week.   The administration's efforts to turn our national parks into shelters  not only does not solve the problem or even address it, but it only  further exacerbates and furthers the crisis which is both one of  national security and one of humanitarian consequences, as well.   Migrants are literally dying as they make their journey into the  United States. Turning these national parks into shelters only  encourages migrants to make this dangerous journey.   As an immigrant myself, I can say that this is no way to help  immigrants seeking asylum. The reality is that the asylum system has  been abused.   My State, along with every State in the country, is feeling the  impact of this administration's failures.   I support this bill, as I cannot stand for migrants and asylum  seekers being treated inhumanely and sheltered in national parks while  our local communities bear the burden of this administration's  failures.   Our CBP agents are undermanned, underserved, overwhelmed, and  unsupported. Our security is threatened, and migrants continue to be  abused. This is unacceptable. We are better than this, Mr. Chair, and  this bill begins to address this crisis.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
