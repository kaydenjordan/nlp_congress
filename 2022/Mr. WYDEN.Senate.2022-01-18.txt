 Mr. President, I wish to honor a dedicated and creative  organization serving communities throughout Oregon and the Nation,  celebrating 20 years of allowing senior citizens to stay in their homes  while providing access to affordable care and community. The Village  Movement is founded on the principle of neighborliness and provides  comfort, care, and affordability while maintaining dignity.   This wonderful movement started in 2002 with a group of community- dedicated friends who did not want to leave their community in  retirement. Intent upon staying, the friends launched the Beacon Hill  Village in Massachusetts to provide residents who were 50 and older  practical support and confidence to stay in their homes and live their  lives independently.   This idea soon caught on, with similar villages springing up all over  the country, including in Oregon. There are now 14 villages throughout  Oregon bringing services to senior citizens in the comfort of their own  homes. The Movement supports what is often called ``aging in place'' by  developing a nurturing network of volunteers and access to services and  social opportunities that are both sustainable and community-based.   Every village is member-driven and self-governing, allowing them to  respond to the needs of each community. The Movement has also expanded  to include adults of all ages living with disabilities, preserving the  humanity and dignity that is so important in every stage of life.   I have long viewed aging in place as a bedrock principle for  improving quality of life for seniors and those with disabilities.  Years ago, I started the Independence at Home Program, which helped  primary care providers visit frail seniors in their homes. This helped  them avoid unnecessary and potentially dangerous travel and remain in  their homes longer than they would have otherwise.   I have also been proud to lead legislation as a part of the Build  Back Better agenda that would put home care on a more even playing  field with institutional care. These important efforts can build on one  another, alongside organizations like the Village Movement, to create a  rich tapestry of health and social supports for Americans as they age.   Without a doubt, the Village Movement has set a fine example of how  communities can help support their neighbors. It is an honor to  recognize the Village Movement for its service to the United States-- and Oregon in particular.                            ____________________
