 Mr. Speaker, Friday is the 100th day of Democrat  control of the House; 100 days of disarray.   In the first 3 months, 97 bills have passed the House. In the first  quarter of last session, 132 bills had passed.   There are 97 bills that have passed the House, which is far more than  have cleared committees; that number is only 68. So much for regular  order; so much for hearings; so much for amendments.   They have passed far fewer bipartisan bills, it is no surprise, yet  they continue to take up and pass resolutions that are literally  useless. We have spent 20 percent of our time on nonmeaningful,  nonbinding resolutions.   Instead of working on the items we promised the American people, like  fixing our infrastructure, healthcare, and workforce issues, let me  recap some of the things that have been accomplished here:   The House failed to speak out strongly against anti-Semitism.   Democrats have failed to produce a budget and said they won't. They  can't even agree on budget caps.   They have ignored the humanitarian crisis at the border that  continues to grow.   And they refuse to bring to the floor the Born-Alive Abortion  Survivors Protection Act, which has 198 supporters.                            ____________________
