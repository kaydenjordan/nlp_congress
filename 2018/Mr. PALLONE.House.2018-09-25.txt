 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6378, the Pandemic All-Hazards  Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2018. I want to thank  Chairman Walden and Representatives Eshoo and Brooks, as well as all  the staff, for their hard work on this bill. Together, we have ensured  a robust product that reflects priorities for Members on both sides of  the aisle and the agencies responsible for ensuring our emergency  preparedness.   This is a vitally important public health bill that ensures that we  can prepare for and respond to health security events like  bioterrorism, emerging infectious diseases, and natural disasters. It  will support the development of new treatments and the stockpiling of  medications and supplies that will be deployed to communities  nationwide in the case of an emergency.   As we all know, effectively preparing for and responding to these  events requires extensive coordination between Federal, State, local,  and Tribal governments, as well as private sector organizations across  the country.   This bill reauthorizes or establishes critical programs that will  help us better prepare and respond to any major health emergency.   Let me discuss some of the specifics of how this bill will help us do  that.   It reauthorizes a loan repayment program that would help to  strengthen and grow our public health workforce. This is critically  important, as we are still trying to dig out of a public health funding  hole that began during the Great Recession.   This bill also makes a technical update to the Hospital Preparedness  Program to reflect the use of the term ``coalition'' instead of  ``partnership'' by grantees and other stakeholders. This language  change is not intended to make changes related to the current  cooperative agreement structure, nor does it intend to alter the role  and responsibilities of States, territories, and directly funded  cities, which are awardees of funding under the Hospital Preparedness  Program.   Therefore, it continues to require that the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention, the CDC, provide funding through cooperative  agreements to States, territories, and cities to support healthcare  coalitions in their communities through the Hospital Preparedness  Program.                                time  1515    The bill also amends the Public Health Emergency Preparedness Program  to require public health departments to partner with nursing homes and  hospitals to promote and improve public health preparedness and  response.   It also requires public health departments to work with utility  companies and other critical infrastructure partners to help ensure  that electricity and other critical infrastructure will remain  functioning or return to function as soon as practicable after a public  health emergency.   Both of these requirements are intended to help prevent another  tragedy like the tragic deaths that occurred at a Florida nursing home  last year in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma.   Mr. Speaker, this bill also updates the authorization for the public  health emergency rapid response fund so we can prevent any delay in  HHS' rapid response to public health emergencies in the future.   It also maintains the administration's flexibility to determine the  best placement for the Strategic National Stockpile, or SNS. I have  concerns with moving the SNS from the direction of the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention to the Assistant Secretary for  Preparedness and Response. To date, I have yet to hear a strong  argument in support of this move.   I also believe CDC has the relationships and expertise that make the  most sense for managing and operationalizing the stockpile. The CDC  also has a record of successful stewardship of the SNS. That is why I  supported the increased transparency and reporting included in this  bill.   Wherever the Strategic National Stockpile is placed, it is critical  that we ensure that our current preparedness and response capabilities  are not weakened by its placement.   I also want to highlight two provisions that were included that will  ensure Congress receives the information it needs to respond to the  Trump administration's family separation crisis. The Assistant  Secretary for Preparedness and Response will be required to submit to  the Energy and Commerce Committee a formal strategy on their family  reunification efforts as well as keep the committee informed on the  status of the children still awaiting reunification.   The Trump administration's cruel zero-tolerance policy resulted in a  manmade crisis that has impacted the lives of thousands of parents and  children. While we can't undo the damage done by this policy, these  provisions ensure that Congress has the information it needs to help  reunite each child with their family and make sure this never happens  again.   Furthermore, while these provisions are important, they should not  take the place of an actual oversight hearing on this cruel policy.  This is something committee Democrats have repeatedly requested, and we  will continue to do so.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, overall, I want to say this is a good bill. Our  national preparedness and response capabilities will be better prepared  to respond to public health threats thanks to the passage of the  Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6378, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to again thank all my colleagues on both sides of  the aisle for moving and working on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6378, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1320, the Nuclear  Utilization of Keynote Energy Act. This bill makes commonsense  revisions to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or NRC's licensing  process that can ease the financial pressure on the nuclear industry  without jeopardizing safety or the environment.   Specifically, the bill makes a number of changes to the NRC's budget  process and fee structure, most significantly by limiting the fees  charged to innovate and advance nuclear reactor projects.   An important component of the bill requires NRC to report back to  Congress on the commission's actions to address instances of employees  facing reprisal for raising safety concerns that differ from the  commission's position on a particular licensing action.   A recent internal NRC report identified several troubling cases of  NRC employees, who raised safety issues, being passed over for  promotions or being excluded from work activities by management. This  can't stand, and I am pleased that this bill will take steps toward  addressing this unacceptable situation.   The bill also requires NRC to report to Congress on best practices  for community engagement in regions where a nuclear power plant has  shut down and is going through the decommissioning process. This is  particularly important in my home State of New Jersey where the Oyster  Creek Nuclear Generating Station ceased operations last week.   I appreciate the efforts of the sponsors of this bill,  Representatives Doyle and Kinzinger, to work with Ranking Member Rush  and me to make important changes to their original draft bill that  significantly improved the legislation. I commend Mr. Doyle and Mr.  Kinzinger for their efforts.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Michael F. Doyle), my colleague on  the committee.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  bipartisan initiative, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6511, the Strategic  Petroleum Reserve Reform Act. This bill would set up a pilot program to  facilitate the leasing of unused storage space in the Strategic  Petroleum Reserve, or SPR, while attempting to ensure that the  government and taxpayers benefit from these leases. This is a worthy  cause, and I commend Representatives Barton and Rush for their efforts.   In recent years, Congress has turned to the SPR repeatedly as an  offset for deficits, transportation funding, and other items. In fact,  it has been used far more in recent years for those purposes than for  energy security. And these SPR sales, which will occur over the next  several years, will free up a great deal of physical space in the  reserve. This bill puts that empty space to good use.   The bill is part of our committee's ongoing efforts to modernize the  SPR. Going forward, we need to rethink its whole structure, including  exploring the authorization of regional refined product reserves.   Today, there are two regional supply reserves, both serving the  Northeastern States: The Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve and the  Northeast Gasoline Supply Reserve.   The Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve was created by our committee  in the Energy Act of 2000; and the Northeast Gasoline Supply Reserve  was created by President Obama and Energy Secretary Moniz in the wake  of Hurricane Sandy, using authorities provided to the Secretary in  section 171 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act.   President Trump has proposed eliminating the Northeast Gasoline  Supply Reserve, and I think that is a mistake. I remain committed to  authorizing the existing gasoline reserve in statute, and I am  convinced that regional reserves are a critical component of any SPR  modernization effort.    Madam Speaker, I believe other regions should benefit, or could  benefit greatly, from having a refined product reserve. This is  particularly true for the Southeast, which is extremely supply  constrained. A Southeast regional reserve could provide relief and  flexibility in the event of a natural disaster in the region itself or  in the Gulf States that supply the Southeast region with refined  product.   Now, expanding the number of regional reserves is something that we  must do in the future, but I believe this legislation is a good step  forward on  [[Page H8794]]  the road to SPR modernization, and so I do urge my colleagues to  support this bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2389, which reauthorizes the  West Valley demonstration project.   The Western New York Service Center in West Valley, New York, has a  unique history. The site is owned by New York State, but from 1966 to  1972 it was operated by a private business to reprocess spent nuclear  fuel primarily provided by the Federal Government. Those reprocessing  activities ended  [[Page H8795]]  decades ago, but high-level and transuranic waste continued to be  stored at the site.                                time  1600    While a cost-sharing agreement between New York State and the  Department of Energy has been resolved for the site's remediation, the  ultimate disposal of the waste remains a point of contention. There  have been ongoing disputes and legislative actions spanning from the  1980s through today, with DOE and New York State continuing to disagree  over who should be responsible for paying for waste disposal. This  disagreement has major consequences for how the waste can be disposed  of and who will be responsible for covering the disposal costs.   H.R. 2389 would require a report by the Government Accountability  Office, or GAO, to help clarify the origins of and disposal pathways  for the waste, including cost estimates. The bill also reauthorizes the  West Valley demonstration project at $75 million annually for 7 years,  and this funding level is identical to the amount appropriated in  fiscal year 2018 and will help ensure the cleanup continues on  schedule.   While this bill does not settle the decades-old dispute between New  York and DOE, it takes positive steps towards the site's remediation  and attempts to move the ball forward to ensure that wastes are  disposed of properly.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank Representative Tonko, the ranking  member of the committee's Environment Subcommittee, for his work on  this bill, and commend both him and the bill's sponsor for their  efforts.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I would just ask support from my  colleagues to pass this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        September 25, 2018, on page H8795, the following appeared: Madam  Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to support this legislation.  Madam Speaker, I would just ask support from my colleagues to pass  this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.      The online version has been corrected to read: Madam Speaker, I  ask all my colleagues to support this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I would just ask support from my colleagues to pass  this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    ========================= END NOTE =========================      Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Patient Right to Know  Drug Prices Act and the next bill we will be considering, the Know the  Lowest Price Act. These two bills are the product of bipartisan efforts  in the Energy  [[Page H8797]]  and Commerce Committee to ban so-called gag clauses, which prevent  pharmacists from providing consumers information about cheaper  prescription drug options.   I did want to mention I see that my colleague, Mr. Doggett from  Texas, is here, and the Senate bills being considered today are  companion legislation to a House bill that Congressman Doggett  introduced with 32 colleagues earlier this year.   Specifically, gag clauses are contractual provisions that can limit  pharmacists from informing consumers that their prescriptions may be  purchased for a lower price if paid out of pocket instead of through  their insurance plan. These bills increase consumer transparency and  may help some consumers who get their insurance through the private  market or through Medicare save money.   Madam Speaker, I would like to thank, again, Congressman Doggett and  Mr. Welch, also from our committee, for their long-time leadership on  this issue. I see also that Mr. Sarbanes is here, who has also been  involved in this legislation in a major way.   I am glad to see we are voting on these policies today.   The Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act also includes an important  provision that ensures biologic and biosimilar drug manufacturers are  required to inform the Federal Trade Commission of potentially  anticompetitive agreements that may delay lower cost drugs from  entering the market in the same manner that brand and generic drug  manufacturers do today. This notification will allow the FTC to  challenge any ``pay for delay'' agreements in court   Madam Speaker, the language included in this bill is based on  legislation introduced by Congressmen Sarbanes and Johnson, and I thank  them for their leadership on this important issue.   Now, I must say, Madam Speaker, while I believe both bills are  commonsense measures that we should all support, I also strongly  believe that this cannot and should not be Congress' only effort to  reduce drug prices.   When I am home--and we have been home a lot, as you know, over the  last couple of months--one of the number one issues that people are  concerned about is the high cost of prescription drugs. We need to  address that. I personally believe we should be negotiating the prices  of drugs under Medicare, but there are many other measures, including  encouraging more generics, that could accomplish the goal of trying to  reduce drug prices.   These bills do nothing to address the biggest drivers of high drug  costs in this country, namely, the high list prices set by drug  companies for branded drugs. So we must address overall drug  affordability, which these bills do not, but I continue to urge my  colleagues to work together to find solutions that can actually lower  drug prices in a meaningful way.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Doggett).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Texas.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes).    Madam Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I  yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, let me just say these are commonsense initiatives that  help address the drug pricing issue. As I have said before, we still  need to do a lot more, and we haven't this Congress. But I do agree  that these bills will be helpful in that regard.   Madam Speaker, I urge support for this legislation, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I already spoke in support of both this bill, S. 2553,  and the previous one, S. 2554, so, at this time, I yield such time as  he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I support these two bills, this one and the  previous one. I do think that they are good, bipartisan measures. But I  do want to repeat what Mr. Doggett said, that this Congress and the  next have to do a lot more to deal with the issue of prescription drug  prices. Probably the most effective thing, which I support, is  negotiated prices under Medicare, as well as trying to do more with  generic drugs.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2278, the Responsible Disposal  Reauthorization Act of 2018. H.R. 2278 is bipartisan legislation to  address the safe disposal of uranium mill tailings, a sandy byproduct  of the uranium milling process.   In Grand Junction, Colorado, uranium mill tailings were offered to  the community as fill material before the health risks of the  radioactive material were fully understood. The tailings were  subsequently used in the construction of local homes, roads, sidewalks,  parks, and schools.   The Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act provided for the  cleanup of those tailings in 1978 and created 19 disposal cells for the  radioactive waste. The last of the cells available to accept this  material for disposal, the Cheney cell in Grand Junction, Colorado, is  set to close in September 2023. This bill extends the cell's closure  date to September 2030 or until the cell is filled, whichever day comes  first.   Mr. Speaker, Congress has already extended the closure date of the  disposal cell several times. I support this legislation to keep the  site operational, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I urge my colleagues to support  the legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
