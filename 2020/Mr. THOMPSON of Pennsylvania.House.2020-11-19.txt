 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  November 19, today, as Rural Health Day. Each year, the third Thursday  in November is an opportunity to highlight both the challenges and the  triumphs of rural healthcare.   Nearly 60 million Americans call rural America home. It is a great  place to live, to work, and to raise a family. To ensure the vitality  and the vibrancy of rural America, investments in infrastructure,  technology, and, of course, healthcare are critical.   Americans in every corner of the Nation deserve access to reliable,  quality healthcare, but rural America faces its own unique health  challenges that need to be addressed. Long distances to the nearest  hospital, many uninsured and underinsured residents, and a growing  elderly population, these are just a few obstacles that rural residents  face when it comes to healthcare.   This year, COVID-19 has placed an incredible strain on our healthcare  systems, and rural hospitals have been particularly hit hard.   Telehealth has emerged as a critical tool to better serve rural  communities. The pandemic has underscored the value telehealth adds to  communities across the Nation, particularly in rural America.   This summer, I was pleased to introduce the bipartisan Helping to  Ensure Access to Local TeleHealth Act, or the HEALTH Act. The HEALTH  Act seeks to extend benefits and access to this critical healthcare  medium to more seniors regardless of their geographic location.   As a lifetime resident of rural Pennsylvania and having spent nearly  three decades as a therapist and a licensed nursing home administrator,  I have been amazed how telehealth services make life easier for rural  and underserved communities, particularly older Americans. The HEALTH  Act will cut red tape and provide community health centers and rural  health clinics the ability to offer these vital health services to  their patients on a more permanent basis.   Telehealth services, however, are not possible without reliable  access to high-speed, uninterrupted broadband connectivity with  sufficient bandwidth to be able to handle these platforms.   Now, I have long been an advocate of rural broadband. Investing in  the critical infrastructure needed to deliver this critical resource  for all Americans must be a top priority.   From telehealth to telework, content streaming to online shopping,  tele-education, now, more than ever, we depend on a reliable broadband  and high-speed internet connectivity for our everyday lives. During the  COVID-19 pandemic, the digital divide affecting rural America has never  been more apparent.   In time, the coronavirus will be a thing of the past, but a national  need for reliable broadband connectivity is not going anywhere. By  continuing to encourage investments in broadband, we can strengthen the  rural healthcare system and keep the people who call it home healthy.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate and celebrate a local business in my district. The Galaxy  Federal Credit Union in Franklin, Pennsylvania, is celebrating its 80th  anniversary.   The credit union was founded in 1940 by a dozen employees of Joy  Manufacturing. For four decades, the credit union operated out of the  Joy Manufacturing Factory, serving employees by helping them save and  establish credit.   In 1981, the credit union opened its doors to other local companies  in Venango County. In 2002, it became a community credit union.   The employees of Galaxy Federal Credit Union pride themselves on a  ``people helping people'' approach to business.   Today, Galaxy Federal Credit Union serves nearly 5,000 members,  including 400 youth members.   Madam Speaker, I would like to thank Linda Lusher Antonucci, as well  as the employees, members, and volunteers who serve the residents of  Venango County through the credit union.   Congratulations on 80 years.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished  Republican leader of our Education and Labor Committee for yielding and  for her service.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 8294, the National  Apprenticeship Act of 2020.   Originally passed in 1937, the National Apprenticeship Act  established the registered apprenticeship system that we have come to  know.   For more than 80 years, this system has provided many Americans with  opportunities to learn tangible skills they need for high-wage, high- skill, and in-demand jobs that will lead to fulfilling careers.   Most recently, we have seen interest for apprenticeships surge as  more employees and small businesses are recognizing the critical role  that they play in the development of a skilled workforce.   This law is in desperate need of reforms that will both strengthen  and expand this traditional system while empowering employers and  others to pursue work-based learning innovation.   As co-chair of the bipartisan Career and Technical Education Caucus,  I have always supported, and will continue to support, legislation that  promotes skills-based education for a 21st century economy.   With that being said, we must acknowledge that the registered  apprenticeship system created during the Great Depression will never be  suitable by itself for a modern workforce.   And on this point, this bill ignores the needs of our workers and our  economy now in the 21st century.   The Trump administration has taken tremendous steps to grow the  number of high quality apprenticeships and modernize work-based  learning programs, especially through the Department of Labor's  Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship Programs, or IRAPS.   This program is aimed to help foster continued innovation that  recognizes the dignity of all work and provides another tool for  apprentices to move into meaningful work in our rapidly evolving  economy.   Mr. Speaker, there is room for an all-of-the-above approach that both  improves the registered system while also allowing for future  innovation and other earn-and-learn models.   However, this legislation does not change the current status quo.   For that reason, I must urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.   We must craft a bipartisan bill that encourages employers to innovate  and develop apprenticeship programs that meet the needs of the current  workplace.   Employers are struggling enough with the challenges presented by  COVID-19. The last thing they need is additional red tape and tenuous  requirements.
