 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in honor of those who  lost their lives in the Beirut terrorist attacks.   The men and women of our Armed Forces are true American heroes. They  demonstrate bravery, courage, and an unmatched sense of duty to us all.  They fight each day to preserve our great Nation and defend us from  enemies we can and cannot see.   Our veterans have fought for our independence and liberty countless  times throughout our history. They have fought off tyranny to defend  freedom around the world. They have defended the innocent who cannot  defend themselves. They have worked to preserve peace for all. Because  of them, we are here in this Chamber today. And because of them, our  Star-Spangled Banner waves proudly above.   This is what the valiant men and women were doing in Beirut in 1983.  They were part of an important peacekeeping mission when Lebanon was  facing a violent civil war.   In a single moment, 220 marines, 18 sailors, and 3 soldiers lost  their lives, and 128 Americans were wounded.   Two hundred and forty-one Americans gave their lives that day. This  was the largest number of casualties lost in one day since the Tet  Offensive in the Vietnam war. This event is one of the darkest in our  history.   As a wife, a mother, and a grandmother, I cannot imagine the pain 241  families have endured since that fateful day 36 years ago.   Today, I would like to honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice in  Beirut, for their fearless service and for working toward the more  peaceful world that we all want. They will never be forgotten.
