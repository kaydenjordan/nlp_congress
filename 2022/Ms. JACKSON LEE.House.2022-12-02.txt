 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 8876 The  Jackie Walorski Maternal and Child Home Visiting Reauthorization Act of  2022, which reauthorizes a modification and an increase in funding to  the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program.   Specifically, the Act would set requirements for allocating program  funds, increase the percentage of funds reserved for tribal entities,  establish a publicly available dashboard that reports program outcomes,  and allows for vital home visits.   Congresswoman Jackie Walorski, in whose honor this bill was named,  was a champion for women, children, and families who inspired this  pivotal piece of legislation.   Her dedication and commitment to the health of children, families and  future mothers will live on through the passage of the Jackie Walorski  Maternal and Child Home Visiting Reauthorization Act.   The Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program  supports pregnant people and parents with young children who live in  communities that encounter greater risks and barriers to achieving  positive maternal and child health outcomes.   Home visits help communities and families through development of  strong relationships and trust by meeting regularly and addressing  family needs.   These home visitors encourage early language development and early  learning at home, teach positive parenting skills, help families set  goals for the future, connect families to other services and resources  in their community, and support future mothers by teaching healthy  pregnancy practices.   These tailored programs focus on empowering the wellbeing of families  and children and help reduce crime and domestic violence at home,  improve family economic self-sufficiency and improve maternal and  newborn health.   In the U.S., two-thirds of pregnancy related deaths are preventable  and for every pregnancy-related death, there are 70 pregnancy-related  near-death experiences.   There is a severe gap in care that is contributing to these avoidable  casualties. It's extremely important that we remove barriers in health  care that may be contributing to these deaths.   In comparison to other industrialized nations, the United States has  been trending downward when it comes to maternal health, and the  numbers continue to get worse.   According to the World Health Organization, from 1990 to 2015  maternal mortality rates increased by 16.7 percent in the United  States.   In the rest of the world maternal mortality decreased during that  same period.   In 2020, 861 women died of maternal causes in the U.S. That equates  to 861 women who planned on living full, healthy lives and planned on  being parents to the children they carried for 9 long months.   That's 861 children who must grow up without their parent. That's 861  families that are forever altered. That's a medical system and society  that has failed 861 women.   According to the American Medical Association, Black women are three  to four times more likely to die from pregnancy and childbirth than  white women.   Black women across all socioeconomic statuses and education levels  are more likely to experience maternal mortality than white women.   H.R. 8876, the Jackie Walorski Maternal and Child Home Visiting  Reauthorization Act is a first step to closing these inequitable gaps.   Our dear friend, Congresswoman Walorski, made it her priority in  Congress to fight for American women and children. Her spirit, along  with those of her two dedicated aides who perished with tragically, are  with us here today.   The passage of H.R. 8876 is vital to the wellbeing, health, and  safety of millions of mothers, children, and families across America  who live in communities that endure greater risks and barriers to  achieving positive maternal and child health outcomes.   A timely five-year reauthorization before the end of this year is  needed to minimize service interruption, staff losses, and disruption  of local programs.   I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 8876, the Jackie  Walorski Maternal and Child Home Visiting Reauthorization Act of 2022  to help the millions of Americans who are most in need of this  assistance.                                time  1000
