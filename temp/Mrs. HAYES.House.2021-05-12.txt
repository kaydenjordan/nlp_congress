 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the officers who gave  the ultimate sacrifice and have fallen in the line of duty.   My husband, Detective Milford Hayes, has been on the job for 25  years. I know all too well the risk officers accept when they take this  role. I have lived the anxiety of not knowing if my loved one would  return home from a shift. I have watched my husband put on his dress  blues and attend the funerals of fallen officers and mourn in the weeks  and years after that. Over the past year, I have borne witness to the  difficulty caused by growing mistrust between police departments and  the communities they serve.   In addition to honoring officers this week, we must commit to  rebuilding that trust and to providing them with the necessary funding  they need to safely and equitably protect themselves and our community.   This is not a binary choice. Yes, we have systemic racial and social  injustices that must be addressed. Yes, accountability needs to be  addressed.   But on this day, in these remarks, during National Police Week, I ask  my colleagues to join me in committing to supporting all of the good  officers that are out there, to ensuring officers have clear national  guidelines regarding use of force, to providing access to diversity  training, and to ensuring departments have necessary supports to serve  communities with underlying social challenges.   This will protect both police officers and the communities they serve  from unnecessary violence. This will also attract new officers to the  profession.   I ask that we honor fallen officers by committing to action. We must  provide the necessary guidelines, training, and social services  required to support our communities and to guarantee the safety of law  enforcement.   We must ensure that my husband and every officer makes it home to  their families safely.
