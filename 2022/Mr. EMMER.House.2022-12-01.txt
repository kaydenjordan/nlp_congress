 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Frank  Schiefelbein, Jr.   Frank passed away earlier this week at the age of 89. Frank, or ``Big  Frank,'' as so many of us knew him, is survived by his wife, Frosty.  Over the course of their nearly 70-year marriage, they were blessed  with 9 children, 32 grandchildren, and 31 great-grandchildren, with  number 32 on the way.   Big Frank was a giant in Minnesota agriculture. Following in his  father's footsteps as a farmer, Big Frank grew his herd of Angus cattle  to the largest in Minnesota and one of the largest in the United  States. He was an active member of the Minnesota Cattlemen's  Association.   Today, his sons carry on that legacy, with seven of them working on  the farm and his son Don serving as president of the National Beef  Cattlemen's Association.   After the tragic loss of their third son, Bill, to an 11-year battle  with schizophrenia, Big Frank spent thousands of hours helping those in  need, advocating for legislation to address the mental health crisis  and ensuring better care for those struggling.   Big Frank was known for his big personality. His loss will be felt by  all of us who had the privilege to know him. He was a great man who led  an incredible life.                            ____________________
