 Mr. President, today I rise to thank Algene Sajery, a  senior member of my foreign policy legislative staff, for her  incredible service to the State of Maryland, our country, and by virtue  of her foreign policy and national security legislative achievements,  to the international community. I am incredibly grateful for all that  we have accomplished during her tenure.   Algene has served as my senior foreign policy and national security  advisor since 2012 and concurrently as democratic policy director for  the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations from 2015 through 2018. Over  the years, Algene has served as my lead staff author and/or negotiator  of several landmark national security and foreign policy laws,  including the Global Magnitsky Human Rights and Accountability Act,  P.L. 114-328; the Foreign Aid Transparency and Accountability Act, P.L.  114-191; the African Growth and Opportunity Act and Millennium  Challenge Act Modernization Act, AGOA and MCA Modernization Act, P.L.  115-167; the Global Food Security Act, P.L. 114-195; and the Electrify  Africa Act, P.L. 114-121. These accomplishments demonstrate the wide- ranging policy areas over which Algene has extensive knowledge. Her  ability to leverage her knowledge to help negotiate and advance such  policies into law and her passion for doing so are what set Algene  apart from most others in this highly competitive field.   But Algene's accomplishments do not end with advancing landmark human  rights, transparency, foreign assistance, and international development  legislation. Algene has also worked tirelessly at my direction on  several bills related to human rights in conflict zones, including the  Syrian War Crimes Accountability Act and the Elie Wiesel Genocide and  Atrocities Prevention Act P.L. 115-441. Algene's efforts have helped  cement my legacy in these arenas and as Special Representative for  Anti-Semitism, Racism, Intolerance for the Organization for Security  and Cooperation in Europe--OSCE--Parliamentary Assembly, to help propel  my work to create a world where the promise of ``never again'' in  response to genocide will one day bear truth.   Our work together has transcended several Presidential  administrations. We have observed Executive overstep with regard to war  powers on numerous occasions. We have opened our eyes to the use of  U.S. manufactured weapons to commit war crimes and repress human rights  around the world. In response, Algene and I also developed my signature  arms sales oversight legislation, the Enhancing Human Rights  Protections in Arms Sales Act of 2019, and numerous bills, resolutions,  and amendments on authorization of use of military force, conflict  prevention, peace and reconciliation, and community resiliency  policies.   Algene's successful legislative record is testament not only to her  expertise on foreign policy and national security issues but also to  her keen negotiating skills, ability to work across the aisle, and  incomparable political acumen. But Algene's service on my legislative  staff has gone far and beyond helping me draft and advance legislation.  One of the most striking qualities of Algene's character and, in my  opinion, one of the most noteworthy accomplishments as a part of her  distinct legacy on my team, is her dedication to helping others around  her.   Algene is one of only a handful of women of color working on foreign  policy and national security issues and the first African-American  woman to serve in a leadership position on the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee. Over the years, she has served as a mentor to women of color  at various stages in their careers, offering advice, support, and  guidance. Algene has always made time to support those around her  because she understands the challenges of launching and navigating a  career in foreign policy and national security, and she genuinely wants  to propel others towards similarly successful career paths.   Algene is a highly effective legislative negotiator, strategist,  coalition builder, and a true trailblazer. Her knowledge and expertise  are unparalleled, but her passion, creativity, and tenacity truly are  what have made her an asset to my team and a voice that I will greatly  miss in my office.   It has been an honor working with Algene over the years, and I wish  her nothing but happiness and success as she transitions her career off  Capitol Hill.                            ____________________
