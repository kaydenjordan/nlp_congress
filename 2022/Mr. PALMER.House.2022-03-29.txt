 Madam Speaker, I rise this evening with a heavy but  grateful heart, heavy with the grief that comes from losing a friend  but very grateful for having such a friend and colleague as Don Young.   Congressman Don Young was truly an iconic figure in the history of  the United States House of Representatives. Serving the great State of  Alaska for three-quarters of its existence as a State, Don was  determined to do all that he could for the people he both served and  loved.   One of my favorite memories of Don was at the beginning of my second  term in our organizational meeting, and he was in disagreement with our  Speaker. He said, ``You may be the Speaker, but I am Don Young.''   This House will not be the same. There may be Members who will sit in  his chair, but there will never be another that can take his place.  There was and is only one Don Young. My colleagues and I extend our  deepest sympathy to his family and his wife, Anne. We will all miss  him.
