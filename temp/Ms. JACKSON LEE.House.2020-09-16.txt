 Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Judiciary  and Homeland Committees, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2574, the  ``Equity and Inclusion Enforcement Act of 2019,'' which restores the  power of students and parents to challenge discriminatory policies and  practices in schools and other federally funded programs.   In 2001, the Supreme Court decided in Alexander v. Sandoval to  overturn four decades of statutory protections against discrimination  by stripping victims of discrimination of the right to bring disparate  impact claims under Title VI.   However, this bill ensures that victims of discrimination no longer  have to rely on the Department of Education to take legal action in  order to challenge discriminatory practices in their schools.   Instead, individuals will once again have the ability to address  instances of racial inequities themselves.   The Equity and Inclusion Enforcement Act further protects students by  making positive and substantive changes to Title VI, which prohibits  discrimination based on race, color, or national origin in programs or  activities that receive federal financial assistance.   For example, the bill creates Title VI monitors to ensure that every  school district and institution of higher education has at least one  employee who is specifically responsible for investigating any  complaints of discrimination based on race, color, or national origin.   It also establishes an Assistant Secretary in the Department of  Education to coordinate and promote Title VI enforcement in education.   In 1954, the Supreme Court's landmark decision in Brown v. Board of  Education struck down the ``separate but equal'' premise that had  allowed segregation in our public-school system.   It has been 66 years since that monumental ruling, yet we still have  not been able to fulfill the promise of equity in education for our  children.   Over the past few months, the United States has experienced seismic  shifts in social consciousness regarding racial inequities that have  permeated every aspect of American society.   As the names of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Tamir Rice, Philando  Castile, and so many others, become synonymous with today's civil  rights movement, I believe this bill marks a step forward in the fight  for equal rights.   We cannot achieve true racial equality without addressing the  systematic discrimination in our education system.   For example, in December of 2018, Andrew Johnson, a Black high school  wrestler, in New Jersey was forced to make an impossible choice when a  referee told him to either cut his dreadlocks or forfeit the wrestling  match.   Although Johnson wore a hair covering for the match, as dictated by  wrestling guidelines, the referee rejected the covering and gave the  student 90 seconds to cut off his dreadlocks.   In 2016, a Black teenager was escorted out of his high school  graduation ceremony in Sacramento, California by three deputies after  refusing to remove his kente cloth, a traditional Ghanaian silk and  cotton fabric that symbolizes national cultural identity.   Earlier this year, the Barbers Hill Independent School District in  Texas refused to change its grooming policy that led to the suspension  of two Black students.   Despite public backlash against the policy, which forbids male  students from keeping their hair at ``a length below the top of a t- shirt collar, below the eyebrows, or below the ear lobes'', the school  board voted unanimously to keep the policy in place.   These instances of continued discrimination against minority students  in our public-school system create a learning environment that is far  from equal.   It is imperative to recognize that the existence of these Eurocentric  policies in our educational system have a disparate effect on Black  students, who are either forced to suppress their cultural heritage and  Black identity or forfeit their right to equal educational and  extracurricular opportunities.   While on the surface, such policies do not seem directed at specific  races or ethnicities, in practice, they often discriminate against a  Black person or person of color based on characteristics associated  with them.   It is also well known that Black students are more often over- disciplined at school than their white counterparts.   Between 2015 and 2016, Black children accounted for 15 percent of all  students, yet they made up 31 percent of referrals to law enforcement  and school-based arrests, perpetuating the school-to-prison pipeline.   In Texas, black students in the Houston Independent School District  (HISD) were four times more likely to receive a law enforcement  referral, which includes citations, tickets, court referrals, and  school-related arrests, than their white peers.   According to the Texas Education Agency, HISD is also known for its  stark disparities between black and white students in school  discipline, with black students being seven times more likely to get an  out-of-school suspension.   These instances create a culture of inequality and reinforce barriers  to education for students of color.   Without a private right of action to challenge these patterns and  policies, students of color face countless forms of irreparable harm,  including missing countless hours of instruction, educational  opportunities, and relationship development that promotes pro-social  growth and positive life outcomes.   Madam Speaker, by creating measures that give agency to individuals  to identify, challenge, and change discriminatory practices in their  own communities, we are creating an environment where all kids,  regardless of race, color, or national origin, are given an equal  chance to learn and excel.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to recognize the  opportunity we have here today to rectify some of the inequities in our  schools and, more importantly, positively change the educational  experience for students of color across the country.    Madam Speaker, I really thank the gentlewoman for  her leadership on these issues. Thank you so very much for allowing me  this time. As well, to the chairman of the committee, ranking member,  and to Ms. Finkenauer and the gentleman from Kentucky, let me thank  them for their leadership, and I thank the gentlewoman for the time.   Madam Speaker, let me indicate how important this legislation is.  Twelve Utah childcare students were infected with COVID-19. They  infected another 12; one of them was a parent who had to go to a  hospital.   The Ensuring Children and Child Care Workers Are Safe Act of 2020 is  vital and long overdue. This bill requires the U.S. Department of  Health and Human Services to provide educational materials and  technical assistance to States related to the safe provision of  childcare services during COVID-19.   With this bill, childcare facilities not only receive information on  COVID-19 prevention, but also professional development for providers on  health and safety, as well as guidance on the acquisition and use of  personal protective equipment.   We heard this a lot in my district: No PPE.   It also instructs HHS to recommend additional steps to Congress about  ensuring the safe provision and adequate supply of childcare during  COVID-19, including whether and how to expand the supply of childcare  to meet demand. There is a demand. It is crucial.   In addition, according to The Washington Post, before the coronavirus  pandemic, approximately one-third of all children under age 5 attended  a paid care facility, daycare center, preschool, or prekindergarten. In  2019, there were 15 million-plus children living with a single mother  and approximately 3 million children living with a single father.   This is crucial because, as things open up, children and schools are  all going to be intermingling, and these childcare workers are vital to  what we do and how we provide for these hardworking parents and to  protect these children.   And now we know. It has been disabused that at any point children are  not infectious. That is no longer a fact. It is not a fact. It is not  true. They are infectious and they can transmit COVID-19.   Let me take a moment to speak quickly to H.R. 2574, the Equity and  Inclusion Enforcement Act of 2019.   That bill passed, but it restores the power of students and parents  to challenge discriminatory policies and practices in schools and other  federally funded programs. We know what happened to this young man who  wanted to wrestle. What a humiliating situation when, on the wrestling  floor, in the competition, a coach had to cut his hair off.   I ask my colleagues to support H.R. 7909.   I also rise to support H.R. 3659, Danny's Law, that deals with  bullying,  [[Page H4447]]  and, as well, H.R. 8162, 21st Century Community Learning Centers  Coronavirus Relief Act.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues and ask my colleagues to support  the legislation.   Madam Speaker, as a cosponsor and Founding Chair of the Congressional  Children's Caucus, I rise in strong support of H.R. 7909, the  ``Ensuring Child and Child Care Workers Are Safe Act of 2020,'' which  requires the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to  provide educational materials and technical assistance to states  related to the safe provision of child care services during COVID-19.  Despite their vital role during the pandemic, child care providers have  received insufficient actionable guidance on how to prevent the spread  of COVID-19 while providing high-quality care.   With this bill, child care facilities not only receive information on  COVID-19 prevention but also professional development for providers on  health and safety as well as guidance on the acquisition and use of  personal protective equipment. It also instructs HHS to recommend  additional steps to Congress about ensuring the safe provision and  adequate supply of childcare during COVID-19, including whether and how  to expand the supply of child care to meet demand.   As an increasing number of states open up and more individuals return  to work, parents are relying on child care facilities once again,  making the need for proper guidance to prevent the spread of COVID-19  at child care services more essential than ever. As of this morning,  the United States has over 6,606,859 cases of coronavirus and over  195,961 related deaths. Adequate and updated information is key to  getting control over this disease, and we must ensure that this  guidance is easily and readily accessible to all.   It is no secret that the child care sector provides an immense public  value to our society and our economy. According to the Washington Post,  before the coronavirus pandemic, approximately one-third of all  children under age 5 attended a paid care facility, day-care center,  preschool or prekindergarten.   Child care plays a crucial role in the lives of working parents,  especially in single parent households. In 2019, there were about 15.76  million children living with a single mother and approximately 3.23  million children living with a single father in the United States. We  must never forget that child care is often a lifeline to single,  working parents that allows them to balance both their parenting and  professional responsibilities.   I am proud to be a leader on this critical piece of legislation, and  I urge my colleagues from both parties to join me in voting to pass  H.R. 7909.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her  leadership, and I thank the outstanding cosponsors of this legislation,  my friend Mr. Rose and my colleague from New Jersey, for coming  together around a concept that I have had the disappointment and  sadness to work on for most of my tenure in the United States Congress,  and that is bullying.   I am so saddened that we have to name bills after young people,  precious young people, who have taken their lives.   Bullying--breaking news--destroys our children. It not only destroys  the person that is bullied--many times, unbeknownst to their friends or  their family so that someone could provide them comfort and reaffirm  their dignity and their worth because that is what bullying does, it  says that you are not worth anything--but it also destroys the bully.   So, I am excited about a commission, a roundtable established by the  President to study bullying in elementary and secondary schools in the  United States. Their report will make recommendations for combating  bullying and educating school officials in recognizing it.   I know how hard school officials work. I talk to my superintendents  and teachers all the time. But they miss these things, and that means  the child suffers alone.   This bill is named after Daniel Fitzpatrick, a 13-year-old boy who  died on August 11, 2016. He was a loving and generous kid who embodied  kindness and empathy to all.   He was also the victim of relentless physical, mental, verbal, and  emotional bullying. No child should have to go through that.   I have worked on this for a very long period of time. In 2019, I was  able to pass H.R. 494, the Tiffany Joslyn Juvenile Accountability Block  Grant Reauthorization and Bullying Prevention and Intervention Act.   I think these bills need to be passed immediately by the United  States Senate and, really, go to the President of the United States.   A child is bullied every 7 seconds. Approximately 11 percent of  students simply do not go to school at least 1 day during the school  year because they feel unsafe.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her  kindness.   In the last year alone, an estimated 160,000 students across the  country skipped school because they feared being bullied.   I started out by saying, and let me specifically note, in 2018, 7.1  percent of LGBTQ students were verbally bullied because of their sexual  orientation. Twenty-eight or 30 percent of those students were  physically bullied.   Let me just say this. This is an excellent bill. It brings us all  together. It announces our attempt to respond to Danny's mother, to  attack an epidemic of bullying in our schools.   We don't know where it starts. We don't know where these children  come from. But we have to help them because bullying destroys the lives  of the bully and of the one bullied.   Madam Speaker, as a cosponsor and senior member of the Judiciary and  Homeland Committees, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3659, ``Danny's  Law,'' which requires the President to establish an Anti-Bullying  Roundtable to study bullying in elementary and secondary schools in the  United States.   The 13-member roundtable will consist of relevant stakeholders,  including but not limited to teachers, parents of schoolchildren, and  guidance counselors, who will submit a report to Congress on best  practices concerning bullying upon 270 days of convening.   This report will provide recommendations for combating bullying,  educating school officials on how to recognize bullying, as well as  helping parents to address the early warning signs  [[Page H4452]]  of bullying with their children, so that we can take a well-informed  step forward in the fight against childhood bullying.   This bill is named after Daniel Fitzpatrick, a 13-year-old boy who  died by suicide on August 11, 2016.   Danny was a loving and generous kid who embodied kindness and empathy  to all.   He was also the victim of relentless physical, mental, verbal, and  emotional bullying at school.   Throughout my tenure in Congress, I have been an active advocate for  anti-bullying initiatives.   In January 2019, I was able to achieve broad bipartisan support for  my bill, H.R. 494, the Tiffany Joslyn Juvenile Accountability Block  Grant Reauthorization and Bullying Prevention and Intervention Act,  which was later passed in the House.   Although some people may dismiss bullying as a normal part of growing  up, bullying can be detrimental to a child's education and have  lifelong consequences.   It is an epidemic that plagues our country and too often claims the  lives of our youth.   In Houston, Texas, a child is bullied every seven seconds and  approximately 11 percent of students do not go to school at least one  day during the school year because they feel unsafe.   On a national level, 90 percent of students between the fourth and  eighth grades report being victims of some type of bullying.   In the last year alone, an estimated 160,000 students across the  country skipped school because they fear being bullied by their peers,  and many more attended school in a state of anxiety and depression,  affecting their ability to effectively learn.   Students who are chronically absent between grades 8 and 12 are over  seven times more likely to drop out before graduation and long-term  consequences include poverty as well as diminished mental and physical  health.   Furthermore, students who identify or are perceived as LGBTQ are  often at an increased risk of being bullied.   In 2018, 70.1 percent of LGBTQ students were verbally bullied because  of their sexual orientation while 28.9 percent of LGBTQ students were  physically bullied.   Youth with disabilities and those who are socially isolated are also  considered as vulnerable populations when it comes to being targets for  bullying.   Cyber bullying adds an additional layer of complexity when trying to  build a safe environment for all youth.   In today's world, our children are exposed to technology at a much  younger age, which raises the likelihood of them being subjected to  cyberbullying.   Over 80 percent of teens use a cell phone regularly, making it the  most popular form of technology and a common medium for cyber bullying.   According to the i-SAFE foundation, over 50 percent of adolescents  and teens have been bullied online.   Yet, well over half of young people do not tell their parents when  they are being bullied online.   By passing Danny's Law today, we are taking a tremendous, nonpartisan  step towards eliminating childhood bullying and promoting more  inclusive and tolerant environments for the next generation.   I am proud to be a leader on this important legislation that will  undoubtably improve the educational experiences of the next generation,  and I ask all members from both parties to join me in voting to pass  H.R. 3659.                                time  1200     Madam Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R.  8162, the ``21st Century Community Learning Centers Coronavirus Relief  Act''.   H.R. 8162, expands the allowable uses for subgrants provided under  the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Program for the 2020-2021  school year.   Specifically, the bill allows eligible entities that are awarded  program subgrants for community learning centers to use these subgrants  to: (1) carry out activities that advance student academic achievement  and support student success, regardless of whether such activities are  conducted in person, virtually, during school hours, or when school is  in session; and (2) provide in-person care during the regular school  day and when full-time in-person instruction is not available to  students. (Currently, the program only supports academic enrichment  opportunities for children during non-school hours or periods when  school is not in session.)   Because of the ongoing COVID-19 threat to health, the spring of 2020,  saw the forced closure of all K-12 and post-secondary education  institutions in the Nation.   There is an urgent need to meet the education crisis the Nation is  facing with an adequate response.   Data from the National Center for Education Statistics shows that one  out of every four households in Texas does not have access to broadband  internet, and some 8 million homes do not have a computer or a  smartphone.   Because of this bill, Community Learning Centers will provide  academic enrichment opportunities during school and non-school hours  for children, particularly students who attend high-poverty and low- performing schools.   The program helps students meet state and local student standards in  core academic subjects, such as reading and math; offers students a  broad array of enrichment activities that can complement their regular  academic programs; and offers literacy and other educational services  to the families of participating children.   Technological difficulty is just one of the reasons students could  become disengaged from the virtual learning environment.   Learning Centers are needed because despite being one of the most  developed countries in the world, the United States has one of the  highest rates of childhood poverty globally.   Preliminary data on the Huston Independent School District (HISD)  from the Texas Education Agency shows 23.4 percent of students lost  contact or stopped engaging with learning during the Spring.   This is more than twice statewide average, the total statewide for  unengaged students is nearly 500,000.   One key factor is poverty, children born or raised in poverty face a  number of disadvantages, most evidently in education.   Poverty reduces a child's readiness for school because it leads to  poor physical health and motor skills, diminishes a child's ability to  concentrate and remember information, and reduces attentiveness,  curiosity and motivation.   Children in poverty are also finding the challenge of keeping up with  school work more difficult due to COVID-19.   One of the most severe effects of poverty in the United States is  that poor children enter school with this readiness gap, and it grows  as they get older.   Children feel alienated from society; suffer insecurities because of  their socioeconomic status; fear the consequences of their poverty;  endure feelings of powerlessness; and are angry at society's inability  to aid in their struggles.   Children from lower-income families are more likely than students  from wealthier backgrounds to have lower test scores, and they are at  higher risk of dropping out of school.   Students with low income backgrounds who complete high school are  less likely to attend college than students from higher-income  families.   For some children, the effects of poverty on education present unique  challenges in breaking the cycle of generational poverty and reduce  their chances of leading rewarding, productive lives.   In addition to these challenges' children living in poverty often do  not have access to necessary computer technology, broadband internet  connection to participate in remote learning, or the nutritional  support that provides adequate food, which is essential to learning.   We know that this crisis created by COVID-19 was difficult for the  Nation's approximately 56.6 million students, 3.5 million full- and  part-time public school teachers, and parents.   This bill is necessary as the beginning of the fall school year  continues to pose challenges to educating the nation's children.   To meet the challenges created by COVID-19, the HISD school board  passed a budget amendment earlier this month to spend $31 million on  devices for students. By the end of the year, the district says it  plans to have distributed nearly 125,000 devices and hotspots to  students.   The statute being amended only allows learning centers and related  grants to be funded when schools are in session.   At a time when learning centers are more important to education  because COVID-19 is impacting schools' functioning as the primary  source of full time learning we need to act to support this education  resource.   Children are depending on Congress to make education possible during  COVID-19.   There are: 50.8 million students in public schools, and 5.8 million  students in private schools.   Among the 50.8 million students enrolled in elementary and secondary  public schools: 1.4 million were in prekindergarten; 3.7 million were  in kindergarten; 35.5 million attended elementary through middle school  (K and 8th grade); and 15.3 million attended high school (9 through  12th grade).   Through 2028, enrollment is projected to increase to 51.4 million.   In 2018, 3.3 million students graduated from high school, marking  nearly a 1 percent increase from 2017; 3.7 million were expected to  graduate in 2020; 3.3 million from public high schools; and 0.4 million  from private schools.   The average per-student expenditure in public schools is $13,440.   In 2019, there are approximately 16,800 school districts in the  United States.   13 percent of all public school students were served by the  Individuals with Disabilities Act for the 2015-2016 school year.   Between 2000 and 2016, total public school enrollment increased for  32 states.  [[Page H4455]]    The following saw increases of 15 percent or more: Florida, Delaware,  North Carolina, Idaho, Georgia, Colorado, Arizona, Texas, Utah, and  Nevada.   The following states saw decreases of 10 percent or more: Michigan,  Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont.   In 2018, 7 million or 13.7 percent of public school students received  special education services.   In 2017, 9.6 percent of public school students were learning English  as a second language.   I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 8162.
