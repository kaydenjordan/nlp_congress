 I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum  call be rescinded.    Mr. President, 1 year ago this week, our Nation lost a  giant, a man with a righteous purpose and a remarkable legacy, John  Robert Lewis, who dedicated his life to the cause of justice.   From Troy, AL, to a bridge in Selma, to the Halls of this very  Congress, he put his body on the line for every American's sacred right  to vote.   John Lewis never stopped fighting because he understood that  democracy is a commitment we have to make again and again and again. As  he wrote in the last days of his life:         The vote is the most powerful nonviolent change agent you       have in a democratic society. You must use it because it is       not guaranteed. You can lose it.    John Lewis understood the power and the fragility of our multiracial  democracy, because he did so much to build it in his lifetime. At the  age of 25, he led peaceful protesters on a march through Alabama to  demand their right to vote. As the world witnessed, they were attacked,  gassed, and beaten by police officers.   They were attacked because the right to vote is power, and White  supremacists feared the power of people of color exercising that right.  But out of the pain and outrage over this Bloody Sunday came one of our  country's greatest monuments to freedom, the Voting Rights Act of 1965.   For nearly 50 years, the Voting Rights Act stood as a guardian of our  multiracial democracy. It outlawed literacy tests. It prohibited voting  procedures that would deny or abridge the right to vote on account of  race or color. It gave the U.S. Department of Justice the power to  review any new voting rules in places with a history of voter  suppression and to block rules with discriminatory effects.   Critically, the Voting Rights Act recognized the important role of  the Federal Government in protecting the right to vote. It helped  guarantee communities of color their rightful voice in our democracy.   Over time, the Voting Rights Act was reauthorized four times,  including most recently in 2006, when Representative Lewis and a nearly  unanimous Congress voted to affirm the continued need for its  protections. That's right. Passage of the Voting Rights Act and every  reauthorization of the Act was always on a bipartisan basis.   But in 2013, five conservative Justices of the Supreme Court overrode  the bipartisan consensus of Congress. In spite of the voluminous record  assembled by the Congress and the reality of the country around them,  these five Justices effectively ended preclearance and gutted a key  protection of the Voting Rights Act.   As the late Justice Ginsburg wrote in her dissent, it was ``like  throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting  wet.''   Well, the storm of voter suppression is most certainly pouring over  us now.   In 2020, in the midst of an ongoing global health pandemic, our  Nation held one of the most successful and secure elections in our  history. Voters of color made their voices heard in record numbers and  confirmed again that our democracy is strongest when all eligible  Americans are able to participate.   But instead of celebrating this remarkable achievement, Republican  legislative leaders in statehouses around the country this year have  proposed and passed bill after bill after bill restricting the right to  vote and restricting access to the ballot. They are doing this on the  basis of lies about voter fraud and rooted firmly in the legacy of  White supremacy. They continue to do so as we speak.  [[Page S5004]]    The Supreme Court's most recent anti-democracy decision in the  Brnovich case, which eviscerated a key remaining protection of the  Voting Rights Act, will only embolden these attacks.   But, so far, in this Senate, our Republican colleagues have turned a  blind eye, choosing to be complicit in the outright assault on our  democracy. Senate Republicans have refused to even open a debate on  voting rights legislation. Instead, they prefer to abuse the filibuster  to enable Republican legislative leaders across the country to continue  their assault.   Our democracy is on the line. The unfinished work of John Lewis  remains. We must summon the courage to act. That is why I am committed  to passing the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which will  protect the right to vote for all people. I can think of no more  fitting way to honor the memory of a man who chose our democracy as the  struggle of his lifetime.   When I was first elected California Secretary of State to serve as  the Chief Elections Officer for the State of California, I sought out  the counsel of John Lewis. For more than 45 minutes during our first  meeting, and time and again after that, John guided me with his wisdom,  taught me by his example, and inspired me through his courage. He was  always gracious with his time, warm with his spirit, and true in his  conviction. And he reminded me, as he reminded so many of us, that our  struggle is a struggle of a lifetime.   As he said, we cannot be afraid to make some noise and get into good  trouble, necessary trouble, along the way. In fact, given the  circumstances, it is exactly what we need to do today. As a bipartisan  Senate, if we can, or as the elected Democratic majority, if we must,  it is imperative that we pass legislation to preserve our democracy.   We must carry the torch that John Lewis carried for us for so long  and build for all Americans a democracy that is as free, as fair, as  accessible, and as inclusive as we can possibly make it. And we must  remain hopeful in this pursuit.   You see, despite the scars that he bore and the hatred that he faced  down, John Lewis was fundamentally a hopeful man, a man who never  abandoned the youthful spirit that carried him across that bridge in  Selma, and he always looked to the next generation for leadership, for  energy, and for inspiration to carry the cause forward.   It is now on us to take up his work. There is no better way for us to  honor the legacy of John Lewis.   I yield the floor.
