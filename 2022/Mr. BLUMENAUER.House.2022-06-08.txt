 Madam Speaker, it has been heart-wrenching hearing  the stories on the floor today.   America is not unique with gun violence. What is unique is that  America has accepted the slaughter. Unlike Britain, Canada, Australia,  New Zealand, and Norway, after horrific events they acted decisively to  reduce gun violence, and it worked.   We have stood by while the carnage continues to our shame. America  should not be the only rich country that cannot protect our children.   After events in Oregon, I met with victims of gun violence, and they  developed a package that looks a lot like what we are voting on today.   It is no longer acceptable for gun violence enablers to hide behind  thoughts and prayers. If other countries can protect their families,  then so can we.   Madam Speaker, pass this package.
