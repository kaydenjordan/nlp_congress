Mr. President, ``More deaths in 2020 than in any year in  over a decade.'' That is what the Chicago Sun-Times headline read last  week. But this wasn't a story about the coronavirus. It was an article  about suicide. There were more suicides by Black residents of Cook  County, IL, in 2020 than over the past 10 years. All told, 437 of our  neighbors in Cook County took their lives.   At the same time, more than 600 Cook County residents died from  opioid overdoses between January and June 2020 alone--double the number  from a year earlier.   While the human suffering of COVID-19 has captured our attention, as  it should, two other deadly epidemics in America still rage on: opioids  and the mental health crises.   Even before the virus took its toll, we had been in the midst of the  worst drug overdose crisis in our Nation's history, and we are  witnessing skyrocketing rates of suicide. But COVID-19 has deepened  these epidemics, which sadly feed on isolation and despair.   With the convergence of coronavirus emergencies, we are failing those  most vulnerable to addiction and mental health challenges. And like the  coronavirus, mental health challenges and addiction can occur with any  one of us in any family, in any neighborhood.   Earlier this month, the New York Times profiled three American  mothers on the brink of chaos and crisis. The story chronicled the  relentless stress and burdens of working mothers over 11 months of this  panic--struggling to balance remote learning duties for their kids,  keeping their families safe and healthy, keeping food on the table,  paying the bills, and knowing that every morning they have to get up  and do it all over again that day and the next day, with no end in  sight.   One of the mothers described the struggle this way. She said:   [[Page S803]]              We are holding together with the same tape that we have       been using since March. The tape is barely working, but we       are still here.    She speaks for millions of mothers. Experts and advocates warn that  COVID-19 has created a perfect storm for a surge in mental health and  addiction. Isolation, fear, grief, financial hardship all come together  and can feel overwhelming.   At the same time, the pandemic has made it more difficult for many to  connect with lifesaving care and social services. Peer recovery  meetings have moved to Zoom; routine human connections have been lost;  and treatment access restricted. It is trauma on the brain and body,  and it fuels the alarming spikes in addiction, overdose, and suicide.   Last week, I spoke with advocates from the Illinois Society of  Addiction Medicine and a group called Live4Lali, a community  organization focusing on recovery and harm reduction. These community  leaders provide lifesaving care through recovery programs, street  medicine, handing out fentanyl test strips, and distributing the  overdose reversal drug naloxone.   The statistics they shared with me on Chicago-area opioid overdose  deaths during this pandemic are devastating. In the last year, opioid  deaths have soared: 23 percent in Lake County, 37 percent in DuPage  County, and a staggering 64 percent in McHenry County.   Every morning, we look at the posting on CNN of the deaths in America  from the coronavirus. Heartbreaking. Over a half a million people dead.  But we are not posting the increase in deaths from opioids during the  same periods of time.   Addiction is an equal opportunity killer. But like COVID, the opioid  epidemic strikes communities of color with a disproportionate ferocity.  In Chicago, Black residents are dying from overdoses at seven times the  rate of White residents.   Let me tell you about one person who sought help from Live4Lali, a  woman named Tonya, who recently moved to Lake County. When the pandemic  hit, the recovery meetings for her substance abuse disorder shifted to  Zoom, and the weight of the challenge left Tonya to struggle. She knew  her recovery was in danger.   For days, she called for treatment programs, but no beds were  available. Desperate, she called 9-1-1 emergency care at a hospital.  Tonya was evaluated and sent home. Feeling hopeless and ashamed, she  decided to take all of the pills in her mother's bottle of blood  thinner medication. She was taken unconscious back to the hospital and  pronounced dead.   Too many like Tonya are being left alone in their darkest hours. And  it is not just in the Chicagoland area. According to the CDC, emergency  room visits for suicides and overdoses spiked nationally once the  pandemic gripped our Nation. By May, the country had experienced its  largest 1-month spike in overdose deaths.   A new survey conducted by the CDC also found that one in four young  adults had considered suicide in the past month--one in four. This  should set off alarm bells in every direction.   There is no vaccine against despair and addiction, but there are  programs and treatments and strategies. We must give communities and  healthcare providers the support they need now more than ever.   The American Rescue Plan proposed by President Biden provides those  resources. The House is expected to vote on the President's plan this  week. The Senate has to show the same sense of commitment and urgency.   The American Rescue Plan includes nearly $4 billion in addiction and  mental health treatments for healthcare providers. It has $7.6 billion  for Community Health Centers to address behavioral health disparities.   It includes a plan that I crafted with Senator Rubio to increase the  availability of healthcare, including behavioral health treatment, by  providing scholarship and loan repayment awards to build the pipeline  of health professionals who agree to serve in needy areas.   Special efforts were made to recruit more people of color into these  healing professions, which can help tackle disparities. The President's  Rescue Plan also expands health insurance coverage through the  Affordable Care Act and Medicaid. This money will save lives.   America has arrived at the heartbreaking milestone: half a million  COVID deaths. As we work to expand vaccinations and end COVID-19, we  cannot ignore the lethal epidemics of addiction and suicide, which are  soaring in the cold shadows of this pandemic.   Every day we wait, more people, in every ZIP code in America,  struggle. More families grieve. More lives are lost. We need to get  help to the people who need it now   Mr. President, you and I are veterans of Congress. We have been doing  this for a few years. Some things happen that give you hope. A year  ago, we passed the CARES Act. It was nothing short of amazing, but we  did it at a moment of real fear. We just saw this pandemic starting to  rise. We saw businesses starting to close. We moved quickly,  decisively, with the biggest spending bill in the history of the United  States, more than $2 trillion for the CARES Act. And it passed this  Senate, in this hopelessly politically divided America, by a vote of 96  to 0--the CARES Act.   Well, it took us a while to come back with a reprise or an answer to  what happened after it passed. The pandemic raged through America. The  economy floundered. Millions were unemployed. And in December, just a  few short weeks ago, we passed the second bill, the December relief  bill, $900 billion, a sizable investment. And we characterized it as an  emergency response, a special response, a temporary fix to go into the  system and pay for unemployment benefits and many other things--$900  billion, a substantial sum of money. And it passed here with 92  affirmative votes: 96 on the first, 92 on the second. Still, amazing  rollcalls in a politically divided Chamber like the U.S. Senate.   Then came the new President. I won't put in all the other chapters  that occurred that seemed like an endless novel, but it was serious.  But this President came in--President Biden came in and faced the  reality of what we have in America today. Last night, he did it as  well. He and the First Lady, as well as Vice President Harris and the  First Gentleman, stood in silent prayer for the half million Americans  we have lost. Not ignoring the problem but facing the problem,  President Biden said: Come together, America, unite, and let's, with  common purpose, address this pandemic and the problems it has created.   It is a much different approach in his Presidency. To me, it is  honest. It is refreshing. It is hopeful. But he has turned to this  Congress and asked this Congress to pass the American Rescue Plan. It  is a measure that costs $1.9 trillion. It is huge. It has to be.  Considering what we face in America, we need nothing less. Maybe we  will not need to spend every penny. I hope we don't. But we better be  prepared to pay for it if we are--money for more vaccine and  distribution of that vaccine; money for cash payments to families who  need a helping hand; money for unemployment benefits that are supposed  to run out in just 2 short weeks, on March 14; money for rental  assistance for people who are facing eviction; money for schools so  that they can prepare the classrooms for teachers and students to  return safely. The list goes on, and it is an important and valuable  list and, as I mentioned, money for mental health treatment and  addiction treatment that is still a very real challenge in America  today.   The difference is this. In the CARES Act, with 96 to 0, and in the  December bill, which we passed with 92 affirmative votes, those were  under the Trump administration, and there was a strong bipartisan  support of that legislation, as you can tell from the numbers. The  rollcalls tell the story.   Now comes President Biden, asking for another rescue package for  America, which is still languishing, fighting this pandemic. We don't  hear the same calls for bipartisanship or at least we don't hear the  same responses to the calls for bipartisanship. Why? What is different?  The only thing different is we have a different President.   When it was a Republican President named Trump, Democrats, like  myself and virtually all others, stood by and said: Let's do it  together. We can disagree on everything under the Sun, but when it  comes to this pandemic and what it is doing to America, we are  [[Page S804]]  going to stand together, both political parties. But when President  Biden makes the same proposal, we don't hear the chorus of support from  across the aisle that we once did. That is disheartening to me.   The problem is real. Sure, there are ways any legislator could  perhaps write the bill better, but let's get that done, and let's  respond, as the President has called, with the resources America needs  to get back on its feet. That is where we are today.   The House is going to pass their measure this week. And in the next  couple of weeks, the Senate will get its chance. It is time for us to  stand up and do something. The American people didn't send us here to  squabble or to find reasons for differences but rather to come together  in a bipartisan way and solve the problems facing this country.   The President believes, and I share that belief, that a united  America with the resources can conquer this challenge as it has so many  in the past. We can do that, but we need to do it by coming together.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, ``Remember this day forever.'' That is  what Donald Trump said on January 6, in a tweet to his supporters after  they had attacked the U.S. Capitol.   I certainly will never forget what happened that day. I will remember  the Vice President being removed from the Chair and whisked off the  floor of the Senate by the Secret Service. I will remember the law  enforcement officers, holding automatic weapons, standing guard in the  well of the Senate while the mob spread through the Capitol building.   The entire country and the world will remember the now infamous  images of a murderous mob rushing the barricades, attacking police  officers, breaking into this building, and rampaging through these  hallowed halls.   We will remember the incredible acts of heroism by Officer Eugene  Goodman and others, to protect and defend those who work in this  building. And we will remember the lives lost, including Officer Brian  Sicknick, and the 140 police officers who were injured in this attack.   On February 3, Officer Sicknick's ashes rested in honor in the  Rotunda of this Capitol. He died defending this building and this  democracy. I have thought about Officer Sicknick and his family often  in the past few weeks.   During the week of February 8, Senators served as jurors in the  second impeachment trial of Donald Trump. Former President Trump was  impeached on January 13 by the House of Representatives in a bipartisan  vote, 10 Republicans joining with Democrats to impeach.   The Senate had a constitutional obligation to conduct a trial on this  Article of Impeachment. We also had an obligation to make clear for the  record and for history what happened on January 6 and the days leading  up to it.   What did the record show over the course of this trial?   First, it showed Donald Trump's big lie: his claim that the only way  he could lose an election was if it were stolen. When he lost the 2020  election in a landslide to Joe Biden, Donald Trump refused to accept  the will of the American people. He tried to challenge the election in  the courts, losing over 60 times. He tried to bully State officials  into overturning their States' election results.   And when that failed, he invited his followers to come to Washington,  DC, on January 6, the day when Congress would assemble to certify the  States' electoral votes. He invited them to come to DC to interrupt  that process and, in his words, ``stop the steal.''   Donald Trump knew what his extremist followers were capable of. Over  the summer, when armed extremists stormed and occupied State capitols,  demanding an end to COVID-19 safety restrictions, he had cheered them  on.   On January 6, he whipped his followers into a frenzy. ``We have to  fight like hell,'' he told the crowd he had invited and assembled. ``If  you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country  anymore.'' Then he told his followers--angry, inflamed, many of them  armed--to go to the Capitol where the Vice President and Congress were  certifying the votes.   Donald Trump was not shocked what happened that day. He was excited.  We now know that he ignored pleas from Members of Congress in the  Capitol--members of his own party--who begged him to calm the mob and  stop the attack.   To this day, Donald Trump has not showed one ounce of remorse or  regret. He later described his speech on January 6 as ``totally  appropriate.''   For 5 days, the House Managers meticulously laid out an overwhelming  case for conviction. The managers had the facts, the law, the  Constitution, and a mountain of evidence on their side. The former  President's defense team did not have much to work with. They only  spent a couple of hours making their case and spent much of that  [[Page S808]]  time showing cartoonish videos on repeat. The House Managers  effectively rebutted all of the former President's defenses. The  managers' case was clear, and it was compelling.   That is why I voted to convict Donald Trump for inciting an  insurrection against our government.   I regret that more of my Republican colleagues did not join me in  voting to convict and disqualify Donald Trump from holding future  office. I wish the Senate had sent an unequivocal message that it is  unacceptable for Presidents to incite violence in order to stop the  peaceful transition of power. But that said, history will show that  this was the most bipartisan impeachment vote against a President in  American history.   And it should not be lost that a majority of Senators--including  seven Senators from the President's own party--voted to convict him.  Donald Trump is no longer President of the United States, but the  poison he has injected into our national bloodstream remains, and it is  still toxic.   As Americans reflect on the horrific, deadly events of January 6 and  Donald Trump's role in inciting them, I hope we will remember that  democracy and our Constitution do not defend themselves. They must be  protected, preserved, and defended by ``We the People.''   On January 6, that greatest tradition of American democracy, the  peaceful transition of power that had taken place in every Presidential  transition since George Washington's, was broken. Our democracy, our  Constitution, and this Capitol building were attacked on January 6,  2021. Brave Americans were wounded and killed defending them. And  thanks to that bravery, our democracy endures.   We must learn our lessons from this. We will remember January 6,  2021, forever. And we must not repeat it.    Mr. President, today, I would like to recognize the life  of an exceptional woman: Karen Lewis. Most remember Karen as the fiery  president of the Chicago Teachers Union who led the 2012 strike. Karen  always fought for what she believed. She devoted her career to  education and people. Her commitment to her beloved teachers was her  North Star.   Most will remember that Karen was no stranger to challenge. She  attended Mount Holyoke College before transferring to Dartmouth College  as a member of the first coeducational class in the institution's  history. She had the courage to try her hand at medical school before  finding her calling in teaching. As a new member in her teachers union,  Karen did not hesitate to stand up when she thought something could be  done better and ran for union offices as a member of the Caucus of Rank  and File Educators, CORE.   However, this was only one side of Karen Lewis. In many ways she was  a true renaissance woman. In Karen's love of opera, her musical skill  playing both flute and piano, her love of languages, her conversion to  Judaism, and her passion for professional tennis, you could see the  many facets of her life.   But, above all else, I will remember Karen as a friend to both  Loretta and me.   In 2014, she was diagnosed with gioblastoma, a cancerous brain tumor.  I remembered her diagnosis when many months later my colleague, Senator  John McCain, faced the same challenge. I asked Karen who seemed to be  weathering her personal storm if she would speak with John and she, of  course, agreed. I do not know if the conversation took place, but I  thought that these two heroes of much different wars could become  unusual allies in  [[Page S809]]  the common struggle each of us will face.   The word ``legendary'' is overused, but when it comes to Karen Lewis,  it falls short of describing an amazing life journey. I am reminded of  a quote from Confucius that roughly translates to: ``If your plan is  for one year, plant rice; if your plan is for ten years, plant trees;  if your plan is for one hundred years, educate children.'' I am  thankful for Karen's 100-year plan. Let us honor her memory by  continuing her work to educate the children of America.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
