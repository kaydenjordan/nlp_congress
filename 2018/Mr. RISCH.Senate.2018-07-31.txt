 Mr. President, today I wish to honor a great  Idahoan, John M. Richards. John recently passed away, leaving a  tremendous legacy for the timber industry and as a strong supporter of  economic development and a champion for those in need.   John and his identical twin brother, Tom, were co-owners of Idaho  Forest Industries, IFI, which had its headquarters in Coeur d'Alene and  provided more than 450 jobs. It is said to be one of the largest forest  products industries to make northern Idaho their home throughout the  second half of the last century. The brothers were committed to forest  stewardship, but in the early 1990s, timber industries faced falling  prices, public challenges against timber harvesting, and less  availability of local and Federal timber. IFI survived because of the  ingenuity of the two brothers. They began testing the ability to long- haul timber from other regions of the country and Canada, as far away  as Quebec.   Even in the hard times, IFI kept all of its employees on the payroll.  Some have called IFI the ``best employer in the area.''   When John and his brother decided to retire about the year 2000, IFI  was sold to Stimson Lumber Co. of Oregon. John and Tom thought Stimson  would run their company in much the same way they had run it and would  keep most of their workers.   John was raised in Kootenai County, ID, and cut his teeth working in  his dad's lumber mill.   Even though he was the co-owner of IFI, John worked for 29 years at  Potlatch Corp., another lumber company in northern Idaho. He became  chairman and CEO and then retired from there in 1999. John, who went to  Stanford University, where he earned a degree in economics and an MBA  from Harvard Business School, was committed to the welfare of others.  He was known to give jobs to anyone who wanted to work and to let the  employees work in teams to consider how to best accomplish the work in  their areas. When some say people are our best asset, John believed it.  He was a caring employer, and his workers respected him for it.   In 2014, John and Tom were inducted into the Idaho Hall of Fame in a  family-only ceremony. The brothers were not known for wanting any kind  of publicity or public recognition for their commitment to good  business practices or for how they supported the community. John just  did what he thought was the right thing to do: build an honest and  beneficial business, make jobs available, give back to the community,  and assist others--and so no boasting about it.   John was also a family man. He was married to Joy Elaine (Hanson) for  34 years. As a father, John's children say he was always there for  them.   John was a great Idahoan, an exemplary businessman, a caring,  charitable member of the community, and a timber man of excellence. He  will be sorely missed by his family, his friends, ``coworkers,'' and by  many throughout northern Idaho.                            ____________________
