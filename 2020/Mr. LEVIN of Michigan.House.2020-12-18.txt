 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the memory of  my young constituent, Taylor DeRosa.   Taylor made her mark as a student activist at Royal Oak High School.  She was beginning her college career at Grand Valley State University  when her life was taken so tragically several days ago.   I met Taylor when I was running for Congress in 2018 and she was  launching a Students Demand Action chapter. Taylor immediately struck  me as a huge flash of sunshine in an unjust world. Her commitment to  justice was frank and undeniable. You knew the world would change at  least a little because Taylor was present, fighting for sensible gun  reform, fighting for everyone to see and cherish Black lives, and  fighting to empower women and girls.   Taylor made me feel that every minute we invest in our young people  is time well-spent. I feel that now, even as we struggle to cope with  her loss, because she inspired me and so many folks young and old all  around her.   My heart goes out to Taylor's devoted mother, Cara, and all who knew  and loved her in this time of heartbreak and mourning.                            ____________________
