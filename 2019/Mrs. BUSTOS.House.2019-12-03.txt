 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3, the  Lower Drug Costs Now Act.   Too many hardworking families and seniors in Illinois can't afford  the rising costs of prescription drugs. We must rein in these  outrageous prices. That is why I am proud to cosponsor this bill.   When I walk the supermarket aisles and I talk with folks back home,  who also write me notes and send them to my office, the stories about  the high cost of drugs are absolutely shocking. Let me share a couple  of them with you.   In Stronghurst, one woman's medication spiked from $23 to $98, more  than a 300 percent increase, for no apparent reason.   In Andalusia, another person's insulin jumped from $365 to $538 every  single month, more than $2,100 increase over the year.   And several counties away, in Pekin, Illinois, a senior saw his  insulin skyrocket from $333 to $830 per month, a 250 percent increase-- again, no explanation.   We must do more to make prescription drug prices more affordable and  lift this unfair burden on families. This bill would do just that. I  ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this bill.                            ____________________
