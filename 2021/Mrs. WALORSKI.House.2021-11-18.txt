 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, as our Nation faces crisis on every front, Democrats are  focused on grabbing more control over Americans' lives. Their Big  Government agenda empowers bureaucrats to take away our constitutional  liberties.   You don't get the vaccine, you get fired.   You try to manufacture something in America, you get taxed.   You want to know what is being taught in your child's school, you are  labeled a domestic terrorist.   This is America today, folks. Parents around the country are sounding  alarms about what is being taught in public schools. If you think  parents are engaged now, wait till you see what happens when they find  out their only option for the daycare is a government-appointed  provider. Faith-based daycares disappear with this bill.   This really is breaking news for anybody watching. Your faith-based  daycare is eliminated with this bill. Parents, listen up. This isn't a  Republican or Democrat or Independent thing, this is an American thing.  This is dangerous. It is happening, and a ``yes'' vote brings this in.  Please vote ``no''.
