 Mr. Chair, during a long vote series today, I  unintentionally voted aye on the Flores Amendment to H.R. 4863 United  States Export Finance Agency Act, on rollcall number 618. Had I been  able to correct my vote at that time, I would have voted ``nay.''                    Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mr. McAdams
