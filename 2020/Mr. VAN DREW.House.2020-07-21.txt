 Madam Speaker, I would like to recognize Gail's Salad  Company in Ocean City, south Jersey.   Gail's Salad was founded by Tim Janicki, Ben Haberman, David Joslin,  and Sean Collins, four young men with a lot of energy.   Although the economy is struggling, and people have never been  further apart and polarized in many ways, it is phenomenal to see the  entrepreneurial spirit that south Jersey has and that they have, and  that that entrepreneurial spirit is still alive and well, even during  the most difficult of times.   I enjoyed some of their delicious food this past weekend. I was proud  to join Tim, Ben, Dave, and Sean for their grand opening. Their  assortment of salads was a fantastic addition to a healthy diet. They  have fresh ingredients, and they have their own handcrafted salad  dressings.   Madam Speaker, I wish them and Gail's Salad success for the future.  Most of all, they are a tremendous example to all of us that if we  persist and we work, we will still thrive, not only survive but thrive  and do well.   They are truly a model for all of us, and may God bless them.                            ____________________
