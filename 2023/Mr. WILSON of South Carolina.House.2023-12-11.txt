 Mr. Speaker, over 110 times since Biden  appeasement in Afghanistan, I have warned the global war on terrorism  is not over as terrorists plan to attack American families with Biden  open borders.   The threat is clear with a shocking number of trained, well-financed  mass murderers who are invading America--reaching 169 persons this  year. Ukraine was invaded, then Israel, now America--invaded.   House Republicans addressed the issue earlier this year with the  Secure the Border Act, which was blocked by Senate Democrats. It  promotes restarting wall construction, advancing technology, adding  Border Patrol, transparency on illegals, ending catch and release, and  reversing executive authorities.   Each congressional office has a rally point in the event of an  attack, and I urge all families to plan a rally point. Communications  may be disrupted, and every family member should know where to go for  safety before roads are closed.  [[Page H6804]]    In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected  America for 20 years. It is sadly clear there will be more 9/11s across  America imminent as the FBI has finally, last week, revealed.                            ____________________
