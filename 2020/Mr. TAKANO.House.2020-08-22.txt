 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a visionary who  believed in education for the masses, Salvatore ``Sal'' Rotella. He  dedicated his life to a uniquely American form of education--America's  community colleges.   He led the Riverside Community College District from 1991 to 2007  while I was a trustee.   Sal oversaw the expansion of RCCD into a system of three separately  accredited colleges while facing severe fiscal constraints.   He healed a divided faculty and continually challenged the board of  trustees to do the right thing.   One of Sal's signature achievements was Passport to College which  helped students believe that college was an attainable dream for them.   But Sal was more than just a leader. He was an exceptional family man  and a mentor to me and so many others. He had a way of getting people  to take their lives seriously, as if they really mattered.   Now that he is gone, I take comfort in knowing that his life's  example will live on through others who have learned from him.                            ____________________
