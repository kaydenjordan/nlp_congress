 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Clarence  Hollowell from Jacksonville Beach, Florida, for his service to our  country and to our Jacksonville community.   Mr. Hollowell is a veteran of the United States Army, who now spends  his weekdays serving his community as a U.S. postal worker and his  weekends at local cemeteries cleaning the headstones of our fallen  veterans. From start to finish, each headstone takes about 2 to 3 weeks  to clean and, incredibly, Mr. Hollowell has cleaned over 600 of them.  He does so selflessly, purchasing his own materials, and meticulously  scrubbing each headstone with a toothbrush until the stone glistens  white.   In his own words, Mr. Hollowell says that ``Everybody's got to have a  project, and I think if you can help the community, even better.''   On behalf of the Fourth District of Florida, I thank Mr. Hollowell  for his service and his inspiration to his community.                            ____________________
