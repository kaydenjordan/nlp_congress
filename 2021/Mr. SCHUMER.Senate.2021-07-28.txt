 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Now, Mr. President, with respect to infrastructure,  Senators continue to make good progress on both tracks of legislation.  Members should be prepared to vote again on cloture on the motion to  proceed to the bipartisan infrastructure bill as early as tonight.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, yesterday, the Senate  Appropriations Chairman, Senator Leahy, announced a bipartisan  agreement to provide $2.1 billion in emergency supplemental funding to  support the Capitol Police, reimburse our National Guard, and make sure  all the critical functions of the Capitol Complex are properly funded.   The toll of January 6 and the impact of COVID had meant that funding  for the Capitol Police, the Capitol Complex, and even for our National  Guard was running low.  [[Page S5117]]    Capitol Police have been forced to cancel critical training and  health services and have had to hold off on buying new, potentially  lifesaving gear, like helmets and body armor and respirators.   Thankfully, the bipartisan agreement between the chair and ranking  member of the Appropriations Committee will replenish these critical  funds and support the hard-working men and women who keep this  building, Senators, staff, media, and Capitol employees safe.   I was pleased to hear the Republican leader support this supplemental  appropriations bill this morning, and I look forward to working with  our Republican colleagues to swiftly passing this legislation through  the Senate.   And I must give accolades to the Rules Committee, led by Senators  Klobuchar and Blunt. Their hearings and focus on this issue--the safety  of the Capitol--has helped pave the way for the agreement, and we thank  them for their continued diligence.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now, one final matter, by the end of  today, the Senate will confirm two nominees on the NLRB, the National  Labor Relations Board: Gwynne Wilcox and David Prouty. Both are  champions for working Americans.   Ms. Wilcox, who hails from my home State of New York--I am proud to  say--has spent her career representing workers and unions seeking to  exercise their rights to organize. She is one of the Nation's leading  experts on labor law, and if confirmed, she would make history as the  first African-American woman to ever serve on the NLRB.   Like Ms. Wilcox, David Prouty has also spent a lifetime defending the  rights of organized labor across the country, recently serving as the  general counsel of the SEIU, one the Nation's largest unions.   Over the course of American history, the labor movement has been the  single most powerful force in lifting Americans out of poverty and into  the middle class. It was by coming to this country and joining a union  that my grandfather entered the middle class and passed on even more  opportunity to his children and then to me and my brother and sister.   So it is no mistake that as labor union participation has declined  over the past few decades, wages have stalled as well, and folks are  finding it harder and harder to stay in the middle class.   If we are going to strengthen the backbone of the middle class, we  need to reinvigorate the labor movement and protect the rights of  workers everywhere to organize and bargain collectively for their  wages. Appointing these two labor champions to the NLRB is a great way  to start.   And, to the American people, the confirmation today of these two NLRB  labor champions is a direct result of having a Democratic majority in  the Senate versus having a Republican majority.   Under Leader McConnell and Republicans, the NLRB, which is typically  divided between two parties, had only Republican appointees for the  first time in its 85-year history. None of them had any experience in  labor policy. They are almost atavistically against working people and  helped management--the big bosses--to prevent people from organizing  and making it harder to stay organized if you were. It was awful, and  it is one of the reasons that middle-class incomes have not accelerated  in the last 2 decades.   In fact, the Republicans were so intent on not having the NLRB defend  the rights of working people that under Leader McConnell a Democratic  seat on the NLRB was held vacant for nearly 3 years. If the American  people want to know which side each party is on, just look at the NLRB:  Democrats appointing pro-labor people who fight for higher salaries,  higher pensions, higher health benefits; Republicans making sure the  NLRB doesn't function and allowing the big bosses to take a dominant  role in negotiations with their workers.   Even during the years when President Trump was in the White House and  Republicans had a majority on the NLRB, Leader McConnell blocked  Democrats from appointing a minority member to the Board. They didn't  want a minority member on the Board even though they would have the  majority, the Republicans. It is not a stretch to say if Democrats had  not taken the majority in January, these important posts to the NLRB  might never have been filled.   So, look, Senate Democrats are working with the Biden Administration  to make sure the National Labor Relations Board does what it is  intended to do: stand up for working Americans; make sure they have a  much better chance of getting better wages, better benefits, better  pensions. I look forward to confirming these two outstanding nominees  later today.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to the motion to  reconsider the vote by which the cloture vote failed on the motion to  proceed to H.R. 3684.    Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which  the cloture failed on the motion to proceed to H.R. 3684.    Mr. President, I want to commend the group of Senators  who worked with President Biden to reach an agreement on a bipartisan  infrastructure bill. The Senate has just come together and, in a strong  bipartisan fashion, voted to begin the legislative process here on the  Senate floor.   For the past few months, I have laid out a two-track strategy on  infrastructure: a bipartisan bill, focused on traditional, brick-and- mortar infrastructure projects, and a budget reconciliation bill, where  Democrats plan to make historic investments in American jobs, American  families, and efforts to fight climate change.   In order to start work on a reconciliation bill, the Senate must pass  a budget resolution first. As I have said repeatedly, our goal was to  pass both bills in this session--hopefully, in July.   My goal remains to pass both the bipartisan infrastructure bill and a  budget resolution during this work period--both.   It might take some long nights. It might eat into our weekends. But  we are going to get the job done, and we are on track.   Again, the vote tonight means we are on track to reach our two-track  goal before the Senate adjourns for the August recess                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10:30 a.m.,  Thursday, July 29; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of  morning business, the Senate resume consideration of the motion to  proceed to H.R. 3684, with all time during adjournment of the Senate  counting postcloture on the motion to proceed.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:16 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, July 29, 2021, at 10:30 a.m.                            ____________________
