 Mr. Speaker, we are days away from defaulting on our  debt for the first time in our Nation's history. Extreme MAGA  Republicans have needlessly manufactured an economic crisis and refuse  to release their grip on the American people.   Why do I say the American people? Because the cuts that they want are  going to cut 7 million jobs, deprive millions access to Medicare, and  slash critical funding for education and food for children. For what?  For the shameless protection of tax cuts that they put in their bill  that have added $3 trillion to the debt that they now want to cover off  of the backs of the American people.   Shameless. They are shameless.   This flagrant disregard for the lives of everyday Americans and the  economic stability of our country demonstrates the House GOP's corrupt  and misguided priorities. Do not deprive our elders and children to  meet the demands and the insatiable greed of your constituents, the  rich American people.                            ____________________
