 Madam Speaker, I appreciate the two gentlemen  from Texas, and I appreciate the kind words so far on this bill.   This is something, Madam Speaker, that we can definitely rise in  support of, and I appreciate the kind words that have been spoken so  far.   I rise in support my legislation, H.R. 1952, the Intercountry  Adoption Information Act. This legislation is a critical step forward  in ensuring American families have access to the information they need  to pursue adoptions from a foreign country.   American families hoping to adopt internationally face many obstacles  on the road to being united with their adoptive children. Too often,  these challenges require parents to navigate confusing and complicated  foreign adoption practices.   I have witnessed firsthand how families in my home State of Georgia  have struggled to navigate shifting adoption policies and changing  international standards.   In 2012, Pam and Mark Romano, a family in northwest Georgia, traveled  to Russia in hopes of adopting a young boy named Bogdon. This was not a  quick decision, but one that required months and months of thoughtful  prayer and family discussion.   While overseas, the Romanos discovered that Bogdon had a brother,  Yura. Although the boys were living separately, the family immediately  felt a calling to welcome both boys into their home, and they began the  process of adopting Yura as well.    The Romanos were in the midst of the adoption process when Russia  instituted a ban on adoptions to the United States, tragically halting  the Romanos from bringing both Bogdon and Yura home to Georgia.   The Romanos were, of course, left completely devastated. They had  worked for months to be reunited with their sons, but they lacked  concrete information about the intercountry adoption process and what  was happening in Russia as well as diplomatically.   Since that time, Pam Romano has refused to give up on welcoming Yura  and Bogdon into her family. Her boys' room is still furnished and ready  for their arrival, and she won't stop fighting until her sons are home.   Pam and her family have been tireless advocates for their sons but  also for families across the country who are facing similar threats.  They have also taken up their cause.   Today, American families like the Romanos are still in need of the  most accurate and up-to-date information as they labor to bring their  adoptive children into loving homes. Changing foreign practices can  leave the adoptive parents heartbroken and desperately seeking answers  as they pursue intercountry adoption.   The Intercountry Adoption Information Act takes steps to shrink this  information gap by ensuring families pursuing intercountry adoptions  are equipped with a more thorough outlook on the status of intercountry  adoptions in specific countries and on the State Department's actions  to resume adoptions that currently remain stalled.   Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Engel and Ranking Member McCaul of  the Foreign Affairs Committee for moving this critical bill forward. I  also thank my cosponsors, Representatives Langevin, Fitzpatrick,  Lamborn, Lynch, Smith, and others for their steadfast commitment to  advocating on behalf of these loving families and innocent children in  need of homes.   Most importantly, I would like to recognize my constituents, Pam and  Mark Romano, and the entire Romano family for their advocacy not only  for their own sons but for children all across the world who are  waiting to be welcomed home.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the many American  families who would greatly benefit from a consistent, reliable source  of information as they seek to welcome some of the world's most  vulnerable children into loving homes and support the Intercountry  Adoption Information Act.   This is something we have done before. This is something that brings  us together, and the families who are brought together by this make a  lasting impact in the world in which we live.    Mr. Speaker, thus far, I have released  several transcripts of interviews from the Judiciary Committee's  investigation into the apparent wrongdoing at the FBI and Justice  Department. Today, I am releasing a final collection of those  transcripts.   The American people deserve transparency. They deserve to know what  transpired at the highest levels of the FBI at the origin of the probe  of President Trump's campaign.   Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the link  www.dougcollins.house.gov/transparency so the American people can  review the transcripts of these interviews.   Out of an abundance of caution, these transcripts have a limited  number of narrowly tailored redactions relating only to confidential  sources and methods, nonpublic information about ongoing  investigations, and nonmaterial personal information.   I have worked to release as many transcripts as possible because the  American people deserve the truth.                            ____________________
