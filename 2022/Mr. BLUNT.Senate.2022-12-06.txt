 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I want to thank my good friend Senator  McConnell for his comments this morning, and I have reserved some time  this afternoon for what would be my official farewell address in the  Senate.   But as it relates to our leader, Mr. McConnell, he and I were whips-- when I was a whip in the House, he was a whip in the Senate. We met  every week. We have had a long and close relationship. I am grateful  for his advice, his friendship, and his comments today. Thank you.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, when I gave my first speech on the Senate  floor 12 years ago or when I cast my first vote in the House 26 years  ago, I had really no way to anticipate the challenges and opportunities  that were ahead of us.   I come to the floor today grateful for my colleagues on both sides of  the aisle and on both sides of the Capitol. When we agree and when we  don't, we are bound by the Constitution to seek a more perfect Union.   Of course, I am most grateful to Missourians, who have given me the  chance to work with them as a county official, as the Missouri  Secretary of State, and in both the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate.   Missouri is where the country comes together--the North meets the  South, the East meets the West. No State has more States at its borders  than us and only one with as many States as we have. We have been the  population center of America for the last five decades in kind of  moving down Interstate 44 as the population has moved west and south.  We sit in the middle of the biggest piece of contiguous agricultural  farmland in the world, and it is the only one that has its own built-in  transportation system--the Mississippi River Valley.   St. Louis is sometimes described as the westernmost eastern city, and  Kansas City, really, may be more like Denver and Omaha than it is St.  Louis. Springfield, where I live, kind of looks to the west and the  south to Tulsa and to Fayetteville. The bootheel of our State is the  Delta South in every way--the economy, the topography. What happens  there is reflective of other places more than it is the rest of our  State.   I was in northern Missouri quite a bit this summer, and while in  northern Missouri--those two counties that border Iowa--one of the  people with me one day when I was the secretary of state said: When we  are up here, I always feel like we are on top of the world.   I never go to northern Missouri now unless I feel like I am on top of  the world.   Of course, every Senator thinks their State is unique, and it is. A  couple of years ago, I spent a few minutes each day trying to figure  out and, for about a period of 6 months, wondering how the other 99  Members got here. With a couple of exceptions, I was able to figure it  out.   (Laughter.)   I have some question in my mind about a couple of our friends, but as  I looked at it, I figured out somebody has unique people skills, and  other people have extraordinary political skills. Maybe it is the  ability to quickly understand complicated things or the ability to  explain complicated things so that other people can understand them.  Most of the time, however, we just have an incredible amount of wasted  talent. If you could take the collective talent of the 100 U.S.  Senators and make the most of it, there is absolutely no telling what  might happen.   Now, part of that is because the Senate isn't expected to work  efficiently. We don't have many rules, and what does get done usually  gets done by either unanimous consent or total exhaustion. Those are  our two stopping points. Our Federal Government was designed by people  who didn't trust government and didn't want too much of it. They made  it hard to get things done. They opted for inefficiency, and that  inefficiency is really mind-boggling to people who are more familiar  with the parliamentary system, where, if it doesn't get done and it  isn't efficient, it fails. We certainly aren't built that way.   We have clearly found new levels of inefficiency in the past decade-- one big bill at the end of the year to fund the government plus  whatever the four leaders of the House and Senate can agree to add to  it. Once again, we are at that year-ending process to cobble together  some kind of result. Now, the only thing worse than the way we do it  would be not doing it. The only thing worse than the way we do it is  just to decide not to get our work done and see what happens. So we  are, once again, down to the next 4 weeks to get our work done or, even  better, the next 3 weeks. It wouldn't be bad if we got it done in the  next 2 weeks, but we are following the pattern here, in my view, we  have followed for too long.   You know, I have seen the standard process of regular order work. In  my first decade in the Congress, it never worked perfectly, but it came  pretty close to the standard that had been set for two centuries. There  is good reason for how a bill becomes a law whether you first saw it on  a filmstrip, like I probably did, or on ``Schoolhouse Rock!'' like my  kids did. You know how it is supposed to work: Members of a committee  and staff who know the most about an issue hold hearings; they mark up  a bill; the bill is to be debated and amended on the floor of both the  House and the Senate before it goes to the President to be signed or  vetoed. For 225 years, the topics of what to fund and how to pay for it  have dominated the congressional debate, and we, frankly, need to get  back to that, where people see what is going on and Members feel bought  in to what is going on.    But then and now, during that whole time, whether regular order was  working or not, the rules of the Senate really required finding someone  on the other side to work with. There have never been more than 56  popularly elected Republican Senators and only a handful of times have  there been 60 or more Democrats. Finding someone on the other side to  work with produces the most lasting results.   A couple of Congresses ago, there were 52 on my side and 48 on the  other side. My staff decided it would be interesting--they came to me  one day and said: We just thought it would be interesting to check and  see how many of the 48 Democrats you figured out how to be the  principal sponsor of a bill with. The answer was 44. I thought that was  a pretty good number.   My point then and now is you don't have to agree on everything to  work together; you just have to agree on one thing. And if you find  that one thing you agree on and, frankly, particularly if you are  successful, both the Members working together and their staffs think:  Well, gee, we could do that again.   In healthcare research, Senator Murray and I, along with Chairman  Cole on the House side and, eventually, the ranking member, then- Chairman DeLauro, worked together to significantly change NIH research.  [[Page S6981]]    Senator Klobuchar and I have done lots of things together. We have  worked on the travel economy, which is a big part of our economy. We  have worked to rewrite the workplace harassment standards for the  Senate. We have worked on adoption issues.   Senator Brown and I passed a bill of advanced manufacturing. We had  known each other for years. Once we figured out we could pass one bill  together, we passed five. It has the good effect.   Senator Stabenow and I have worked so hard on Certified Community  Behavioral Health Centers. We have worked on this for well over a  decade now, and we have made, I think, incredible progress. Neither of  us would have gotten that done by ourselves.   Senators Capito and Shaheen and Portman and Manchin all worked with  me and our committee on opioid and dependency issues. We were making  real progress. I think the pandemic set that progress back, but it  shouldn't stop us from moving forward.   Senator Coons founded with me the Law Enforcement Caucus. We worked,  every time it came up, to expand it and the Victims of Child Abuse Act  and the volunteer community efforts.   There are other retiring Members I want to mention whom I have worked  with as well: Senator Leahy and Senator Shelby, both on the  Appropriations Committee and the Rules Committee. You know, on the  Appropriations Committee, I got to see the last of Senator Inouye and  Senator Cochran still at their best and Barbara Mikulski--people who  didn't have to have a perfect result to have a result--and it was  wonderful to get to watch them work.   Senator Inhofe was, obviously, totally focused on what it takes to  defend the country. He was here for his remarks, his farewell speech,  the other day and pointed out that he found somebody he didn't agree  with on hardly anything--Barbara Boxer--and they came up with public  works bill after public works bill.   Senator Burr, who is leaving, has been my chairman on the  Intelligence Committee and has been so capable and so knowledgeable on  that committee. He has been really, incredibly, helpful to me.   Senator Portman and I have been at the leadership table in both the  House and the Senate. I have been in more meetings with Rob Portman  than I have ever been with anybody I have ever served on a committee  with, and it has been great.   Pat Toomey, of course, brings incredible understanding of finance  issues and the economy.   My longest relationships, of course, are with my House colleagues.  Senator Thune, Senator Moran, and I all came to the House at the same  time along with Senator Stabenow. Senator Moran and Senator Boozman and  I all came to the Senate together from the House.   Senator Cardin, Senator Graham, Senator Cassidy, Senator Blackburn,  Senator Brown, Senator Wicker, and others have been part of my work  life for a long, long time. Together, we have faced big challenges. You  know, after 9/11, we saw a new terrorist threat. I was in the middle of  that discussion of the continuity of government when I had the sudden  realization that our government could dramatically change, and we had  not thought about what might happen if it did change.   Dick Gephardt--my fellow Missourian and who was the Democratic leader  at the time--and I came up with this structure for post-9/11  compensation for victims, which worked. Unfortunately, it has worked  following now with a number of tragedies, but it was something I was  able to be there for as we put it together.   You know, at that time, President Bush said:         [W]e bring our enemies to justice, or bring justice to our       enemies.    Four Presidents have now followed that standard.   For me, the legislative highlights would, of course, include what  happens at the NIH, where I have been able to be part of increasing by  50 percent, over 8 years, with Senator Murray and others, the  commitment we made to healthcare research.   I mentioned Senator Stabenow earlier, but as for the mental health  efforts, the changing that I think we have all seen here in just the  last few years in how we talk about that issue and how we understand we  need to respond to that issue is something I am particularly proud of.   Now, maybe a bill with Senator Heinrich, the Recovering America's  Wildlife Act, which every conservation group in America is supportive  of--maybe we can add that to the list of things I am going to consider  a great accomplishment before we leave here, and it has to go in that  big bill I talked about earlier that we put together here at the end.   I have had an incredible opportunity to be responsible for two  inaugurations. It is one of the most important things we do. That  particular event, not me being responsible for it, 100 million people  watched live. Tens of millions of people around the world watched all  or part of it after that. It is so important we get it right.   In 2017, I decided our theme would be the peaceful transition of  power. I remember at both inaugurations I quoted--the only thing I  repeated, I think, at those two inaugurations was President Reagan who  said in 1981: What we do here today is commonplace and miraculous-- commonplace because we have done it every 4 years since 1789,  miraculous because we have done it every 4 years since 1789.   In 2021, I said, well, this time, let's talk about our need to have a  more perfect Union.   The Founders didn't promise a perfect Union. They were, in that  place, pretty reasonable in their anticipation of what we could do and  what we could be, but they did promise a more perfect Union. And that  is the effort we continue to be a part of.   To get all of that done, so many other people have to make it  possible. All of us appreciate every one of our families. I think we  all appreciate each other's families because, better than anybody else,  we know what families mean and how important it is that your family is  part of this.   My mom and dad were dairy farmers. They never suggested there were  any limits to what a person could do in America. There was no sense  that you couldn't do everything you wanted to do.   I am most grateful to Abby, my wife. I wouldn't be in the Senate and  wouldn't have stayed as long in the House as I did if Abby hadn't been  willing to work so much, so hard to make it easier for me to do what I  love to do. We are full partners, and I am grateful for that.   All of my children and even their children, we are too often being  asked to defend what I did or what I believed or, more often, what  people assumed I believed that they got to be a part of history too.  Charlie Blunt was flying on Air Force One with President Bush on his  second birthday. Who gets to do that?   I will admit, though, however, no one in my family ever said, I wish  you would quit. But when I did announce, did decide I was going to  leave 2 years ago, I notice that no one said ``Are you sure?'' except  Abby, who did say ``Are you sure?''   I have often said if you can only have one skill, that one skill  should be hiring. And what a great staff that skill and good luck have  produced for me.   My incredible chief of staff, Stacy McBride, has been responsible for  so much of what we have gotten done. My deputy chief for the State,  Derek Coats, led a great team that did so much for our State and in  helping people deal with the Federal Government. My deputy chief of  staff here, Richard Eddings, is, along with me, completing 26 years in  the Congress and 26 years of working together. He managed the details  for the whip's office in the House and the details for our office in  the Senate.   The Rules Committee staff takes responsibility to help manage the  daily infrastructure of the Senate. No issue is too small or too big.  Everything from security decisions for the Presidential inauguration to  a recent call to ask whether we could release someone's pet owl in the  Russell courtyard so that the owl would have a home and we would all  appreciate it. Senator Klobuchar and I quickly decided it probably  wouldn't be good for the Russell courtyard or the owl, so that owl was  not released.   The Republican Policy Committee staff deals with every vote on the  floor, every nomination, every issue. There is  [[Page S6982]]  a paper out there explaining all of those things, every bill that has  been filed, every amendment, even to the dreaded vote-arama that staff  was getting an amendment ready so voters know what they see.   Let me end this farewell with two things: One is another thank-you to  Missouri voters.   In my view, the need to find a solution to a problem really took  place and took shape in the Greene County courthouse. I have been in  all 115 of our counties since I announced I wasn't going to run again.  There have been some question in my house as to the judgment of that  schedule, but we are through that now, so it is done. In a lot of those  courthouses, I was visiting with county officials and said: In my view,  there is nowhere in America you are more likely to get a solution to a  governmental problem than a county courthouse filled with local elected  officials who want to do everything they can possibly do for you to  feel like you left with everything done that could possibly be done.   And then, going to be the first Republican secretary of state elected  in Missouri in 52 years when I won that office in 1984, I never thought  my leading argument was: Why don't you vote for the first Republican  ever. I thought it was: If you vote for me, I will do this job, and you  will be pleased that you did give me a chance to do it. So I am  grateful to them and grateful for the experience.   There is a story that Senator Klobuchar has told more often than I  have. When I became the chief deputy whip, on my way to becoming the  whip of the House, the first month of my second term in the Congress, I  moved from the Cannon Building to the Capitol Building. And I looked on  the top of the bookcase in my office, my new office in the Congress,  and there was this bust of a person up there.   And I said to my staff: Let's find out who that is. So they come back  a couple of weeks later, and they have got these newspaper articles  from the 1930s and 1960s, and they say: Well, nobody knows who that is.   It is obvious when you get that bust down and look at it that it is a  cleric. So it was the unknown cleric, and it has been with me ever  since in one of my offices here.   The point of the unknown cleric, this is a bust that was put in the  Capitol probably no earlier than 1830, and by 1930, nobody had any idea  who it was.   I had lots of meetings with new freshman members in the House when I  was a whip and a number of meetings with people who just happened to be  around and would listen to this. I said: The point of this is somebody  is famous enough that they made a bust, put it in the Capitol, and then  forgot who they are. The point is: What we do here is more important  than who we are. Thanks for letting me do part of it with you.   I yield the floor.   (Applause.)    Madam President, I rise today to recognize my good  friend, Mark Gordon, who will be retiring from his position as the  president of the Missouri Broadcasters Association next year after  almost a decade of distinguished service. Mark has been a broadcaster  for over 40 years. He started his career as a copywriter and an  announcer before moving on to being a newscaster and then switching to  the advertising sales side of the business. Before agreeing to helm the  MBA, Mark spent 10 years running television stations in Springfield,  MS, my home town, which is where we first met each other.   Mark moved to Springfield to work for KY3 in 1997, shortly after I  came to Congress. In a lot of ways, our professional careers have been  intertwined ever since. He has been a tireless advocate for local  Missouri communities and Missouri broadcast stations and has been a  trusted voice on their behalf for as long as I have known him. Whether  we were working together on spectrum issues, satellite television  reauthorizations, or public service campaigns, Mark has always been a  person I could rely on. And between seeing him back home in Missouri at  one of his members' stations or on one of his numerous visits here to  Washington, DC, I have always appreciated his advice and how he always  worked on behalf of the communities we both serve.   I remember the meeting in my office almost 10 years ago where Mark  and his predecessor, Don Hicks, let me know that Mark would be taking  over the reins of the MBA. Don Hicks had served as the head of the  Missouri Broadcasters for decades and left large shoes to fill. I can  honestly say that Mark not only filled those shoes but also has left  his own legacy on our home State and a high bar for whoever succeeds  him.   Mark's proud legacy also lives on through his son Mike, who has made  significant contributions in his own right to Springfield's  broadcasting industry.   I wish Mark, his wife Lucy, their children Jaime and Mike, and their  entire family nothing but success in this next chapter of his life.  Forty years is a long time, and he has seen, and been part of, so much  change in his industry. I am proud to have been able to call him my  friend for the last 25 years, and I know that whatever he decides to do  next he will continue to be a tremendous asset to his community and our  State.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Jeremy Pinson,  a military fellow from my office, be granted floor privileges for the  remainder of the Congress.
