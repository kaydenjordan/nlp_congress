 Mr. Speaker, what we are discussing is one of the most  important documents that will ever be produced and given, potentially,  to Congress for the American people in  [[Page H2726]]  our modern history: a question of whether or not this administration  was involved with the Russian Government, our number one foreign enemy,  in influencing the outcome of our Presidential election, something  tantamount to treason.   The report needs to be made public because the American people have a  right to know. The American people, as Ronald Reagan, to paraphrase,  said: I paid for this microphone, the American people paid for this  report, they paid for the special counsel, they deserve to see the  fruits of his work and whether or not, as Richard Nixon said, their  President is a crook, they need to know that.   Unfortunately, as I sit here listening to this discussion, I feel  like I am thrown back into a time in the 1970s--I think it was 1977,  somewhere around there--in Kinshasa, Zaire, not in the Washington, D.C.  capitol. It is the Muhammad Ali-George Foreman fight, and the other  side, the Republicans, are playing the role of Muhammad Ali. Not the  ``float like a butterfly, sting like a bee'' Muhammad Ali, but the  rope-a-dope, sit back, take the punches, let them swing, let them hit  you, because they know that eventually they will wear themselves out  and they know the outcome, because the fix is in.   There is a reason why the Attorney General was picked by this  President, and we will soon find out. But we need to pass this  resolution and show the American people that Congress is on the side of  transparency and are releasing this report and letting the American  public, who paid for this report, know the results of it and know what  needs to happen to protect our democracy and the rule of law.
