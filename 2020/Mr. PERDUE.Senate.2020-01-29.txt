 Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   I send a question to the desk for both the counsel to the President  and the House managers on behalf of Senator Cruz and me.    The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question, on behalf of Senators Cruz and  Perdue, reads as follows:         You refused to answer the question on political bias. Are       the House Managers refusing  [[Page S669]]       to tell the Senate whether or not the so-called whistleblower       had an actual conflict of interest? There are 7 billion       people on planet earth; almost all had no involvement in       Biden's quid pro quo. Are the House Managers unwilling to say       whether the so-called whistleblower was a FACT WITNESS who       directly participated in (and could face criminal or civil       liability for) Joe Biden's demanding Ukraine fire the       prosecutor who was investigating Burisma? And why did you       refuse to transmit to the Senate the Inspector General's       transcript?    It is addressed to both sides. I think, perhaps, the House managers  should go first.   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. With respect to the ICIG, the President and his  allies have tried to shift the focus to the inspector general of the  intelligence community--a highly respected veteran of the Justice  Department--in his handling of the whistleblower's complaint. There was  an effort to insinuate wrongdoing on the part of the whistleblower, and  there has been an effort to insinuate wrongdoing on behalf of the  inspector general.   The briefings that we had with the ICIG related to the unusual and  problematic handling of this particular whistleblower's complaint  within the executive branch, which diverts sharply from any prior  whistleblower's complaint by anyone within the intelligence community.  The Intelligence Committee is continuing its ongoing oversight to  determine why and how this complaint was initially concealed from the  committee in violation of the law.   ICIG Michael Atkinson continues to serve admirably and independently  as he is supposed to do.   Like the Senate Intelligence Committee, the House Intelligence  Committee does not release the transcripts of its engagements with  inspectors general on sensitive matters because doing so risks  undercutting an important mechanism for the committee to conduct  oversight. The transcripts remain properly classified, in conformity  with IC requirements, to protect sensitive information. The ICIG made  every effort to protect the whistleblower's identity and briefed us  with the expectation that it would not be made public, and we are  trying to honor that expectation.   With respect to allegations of bias on the part of the whistleblower,  let me just refer you to the conclusion of the inspector general's,  which is, after examining the whistleblower, the whistleblower's  background, any potential allegations of any bias, the whistleblower  drew two conclusions: The whistleblower was credible. Meaning, given  whatever issue--perceived or real--the inspector general found that  whistleblower to be credible. The inspector general also found that the  whistleblower's complaint was urgent and that it needed to be provided  to Congress. The inspector general further found that it was withheld  from Congress in violation of the law, in violation of the statute. For  that, he is being attacked.   Now, counsel for the President rely on an opinion of the Office of  Legal Counsel as its justification for violating the Whistleblower  Protection Act and not transmitting the complaint to Congress.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and Members of the  Senate.   Page 5 of the inspector general's report states: ``Although the  inspector general's preliminary review identified some indicia of an  arguable political bias on the part of the Complainant--'' now, that is  in the actual statement. He goes on to say ``--[involving] a rival  political candidate, such evidence does not change his view about the  credible nature of the concern,'' or what appears to be credible; but  to argue that it does not include an issue of political bias, the  inspector general himself says that that is, in fact--at least he said  the preliminary reviews indicate some political bias.   Now, there have been reports in the media that the individual may  have worked for Joe Biden when he was Vice President, that he may have  had some area under his watch involving Ukraine.   I also thought it was interesting that Manager Schiff just talked  about the importance of how they control the process as it relates to a  whistleblower's reports because of the sensitive nature of those. Do we  not think that the sensitive nature of information shared by the  President's most senior advisers should not be subject to the same type  of protections? Of course, it has to be.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from West Virginia.
