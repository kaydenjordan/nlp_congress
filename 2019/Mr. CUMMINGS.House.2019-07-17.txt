 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on  Oversight and Reform, I call up the report (H. Rept. 116-125) to  accompany the resolution recommending that the  [[Page H5942]]  House of Representatives find William P. Barr, Attorney General of the  United States, and Wilbur L. Ross, Jr., Secretary of Commerce, in  contempt of Congress for refusal to comply with subpoenas duly issued  by the Committee on Oversight and Reform.   The Clerk read the title of the report.    Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on  Oversight and Reform, I call up the resolution (H. Res. 497)  recommending that the House of Representatives find William P. Barr,  Attorney General of the United States, and Wilbur L. Ross, Jr.,  Secretary of Commerce, in contempt of Congress for refusal to comply  with subpoenas duly issued by the Committee on Oversight and Reform,  and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and to insert extraneous material.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes.   Madam Speaker, I support this bipartisan resolution to hold Attorney  General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt of  Congress because it is necessary to preserve the integrity of this body  and of the Census.   The Constitution mandates that we conduct a Census every 10 years,  and that the Census count every person. A full, fair, and accurate  account is critical to ensuring that we properly allocate Federal  funding and congressional apportionment.   I do not take this decision lightly. Holding any Cabinet Secretary in  criminal contempt of Congress is a serious and somber matter, one that  I have done everything in my power to avoid. But in the case of the  Attorney General and the Secretary, Secretary Ross, they blatantly  obstructed our ability to do congressional oversight into the real  reason Secretary Ross was trying, for the first time in 70 years--in 70  years--to add a citizen question to the 2020 Census.   Secretary Ross testified under oath that he added a citizenship  question solely--I want you to concentrate on that word, ``solely''--to  help the Justice Department enforce the Voting Rights Act. But we now  know that claim was nothing but a pretext.   And do not take my word for that, Madam Speaker. The Supreme Court  said that.   Our committee's investigation uncovered evidence that Secretary Ross  launched a secret campaign to add the citizenship question within days  of assuming his post.   We learned that Secretary Ross ignored warnings from experts inside  and outside the Census Bureau, including the Bureau's chief scientist,  that adding a citizenship question will be costly and harm the accuracy  of the Census.   In other words, they were saying: If you do this, you are not going  to have an accurate Census.   Our investigation also revealed that Secretary Ross spoke with  Attorney General Sessions, Steve Bannon, and Kris Kobach. Contrary to  his testimony to Congress, the Commerce Department conjured up the  voting rights rationale to hide these interactions.   This entire Congress should be insulted by this.   Committee Democrats first asked for documents from the Department of  Commerce and the Department of Justice when we were in the minority in  April and May of 2018. Both departments ignored us.   When I became chairman, I renewed these requests on behalf of the  committee. Since then, the administration has engaged in a purposeful  effort to obstruct--and I do not use that word lightly--our  investigation. The Departments have refused to provide key unredacted  documents that we need to understand the truth, the whole truth, and  nothing but the truth, about why they really made this decision.   Instead, what did they do? They produced thousands of pages that were  largely nonresponsive, heavily redacted, or publicly already available.                                time  1415    When they let us interview witnesses, what did they do? They ordered  the witnesses not to answer more than 500 of our questions. Secretary  Ross even refused my request to meet to try to work this out.   Like I said, I do not come to this floor lightly. This is not an easy  decision. But there comes a time when the Congress must be for the  Congress.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   As a result, on April 2, more than 3 months ago, after a bipartisan  vote, the committee subpoenaed these key documents, including a secret  memo that the Department of Commerce wrote about the citizenship  question and gave to the Department of Justice.   The Departments have admitted to us that this memo does exist, but  they refuse to produce this document and many others.   I must say, to give credit where credit is due, that my good friend  and colleague on the other side, Mr. Meadows,  [[Page H5943]]  worked tirelessly to try to help us get the things that we needed. I  appreciate that, trying to work in a bipartisan way.   Going on from there, last month, in light of this obstruction, the  Committee on Oversight and Reform passed a resolution to hold Attorney  General Barr and Secretary Ross in contempt of Congress. The vote was  also bipartisan. However, many of our Republican colleagues apparently  support the Trump administration's refusal to comply with duly  authorized congressional subpoenas.   Let me say to my colleagues that we need to be clear that we, as a  body, have a constitutional duty to be a check on the executive branch.  That is our job. Every 2 years, we swear to uphold the Constitution of  the United States of America. That is what we are supposed to do.   Some of my colleagues claim that we were interfering with the Supreme  Court's decision on this issue. That argument never did make any sense  to me since we launched our investigation in 2018, more than 10 months  before the Supreme Court took up the case.   Even if you accept that misguided argument, the Supreme Court case is  now over. That argument is gone.   The President announced last week that he would no longer pursue  adding a citizenship question to the Census. However, in that same  speech, the President admitted that he wanted citizenship data to  implement partisan gerrymandering.   The President's statements directly contradict Secretary Ross' sworn  testimony that the only reason, the sole reason, the Trump  administration wanted this data was to help the Justice Department  enforce the Voting Rights Act.   The Departments of Justice and Commerce have been engaged in a  campaign to subvert our laws and the process Congress put in place to  maintain the integrity of the Census.   I would say to all of our Members: Let's be very careful about what  we do with regard to the Census. It has a tremendous impact for 10  years on how more than $660 billion in Federal funds are appropriated,  over and over again--apportionment, redistricting, and making sure that  every American gets their fair share back of their taxpayer dollars;  that is, the money of the hardworking people who raised the money for  our taxes.   The resolution before us today is about protecting our democracy. It  is about protecting the integrity of this body. It is bigger than the  Census. It is about protecting the integrity of the Congress of the  United States of America.   We need to understand how and why the Trump administration tried to  add a question based on a pretext so that we can consider reforms to  ensure that this never happens again.   There are those who will ask the question: Why, with the Supreme  Court having decided what they have decided, do you want the documents?  We want the documents because we want to make sure that we do not, in  the future, spend a year or a year and a half chasing something that is  not accurate--in the words of the Supreme Court, a pretext--delaying  our process of getting an accurate account, which is exactly what the  Constitution says we must do.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support our  resolution to hold Attorney General Barr and Secretary Ross in contempt  of the Congress of the United States of America.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let me be very clear: This is not theater. I wish it was theater. It  is not theater.   This is about us making sure that we protect the integrity of the  Census and of this Congress.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman  from Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), a member of our committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let me be clear. First of all, I thank the gentleman for quoting me  so much. I am tremendously honored. I think the quotes that he used  just reiterate what I said when I began about how seriously I take this  matter. I wouldn't be here if I did not consider this to be very  serious.   The other thing I would say is that we have made tremendous efforts,  and the gentleman knows it because he has helped, working with me to  try to get the documents and the things that we need. We have not been  able to get them.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Gomez).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Raskin), the chairman of our Subcommittee on Civil Rights  and Civil Liberties.    I yield the gentleman from Maryland an additional 1  minute.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I just want to make it clear, Madam Speaker, as I listened to the  comments of our very distinguished minority leader, the fact is that  what we are doing today is trying again to protect the integrity of  this House and to protect the integrity of the Census and make sure  that we get the records that we need to do our job, and I would hope  that he would join us in making sure that happens. Because it is not  just about us; it is about people who will come and fill these seats  when we are dancing with the angels.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly), the  very distinguished gentleman who leads our Government Operations  Subcommittee excellently.                                time  1500     Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Virginia.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I want to just remind our distinguished ranking  member, when he talks about quoting from the courts, we might want to  look at what the Supreme Court said about the language that Secretary  Ross used in our committee, because it is the same language used in the  Supreme Court case.   What the Supreme Court said was that that was ``contrived,'' and that  is a quote, and incongruent with what the record reveals. In other  words, he was saying it was not accurate. He may have come to testify  before us, but it wasn't accurate.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman  from the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett), a member of our committee.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is  left?    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, some of my colleagues have argued that holding  Secretary Ross and Attorney General Barr in contempt of Congress is  premature. That is simply not true. If anything, it is long overdue.   The Department of Commerce and the Department of Justice have failed  to comply with congressional requests for more than a year. The  Oversight and Reform Committee Democrats first asked for documents from  the Department of Commerce in April of 2018 and from the Department of  Justice May of 2018. Those requests were ignored.   When I became chairman, I renewed those requests. In response, the  administration produced thousands of pages. But most of the documents  were either heavily redacted, already public, or nonresponsive to the  committee's request. So the committee narrowed its request and issued  bipartisan subpoenas to compel production of that narrow group of  documents. That was in April, more than 3 months ago.   I even asked Secretary Ross to meet with me personally. He refused.   And, last month, the committee passed the bipartisan resolution  before us to hold Secretary Ross and Attorney General Barr in contempt  of Congress. Still neither department has provided the documents that  we have asked for.   So I have come to the floor to urge our Members to vote in favor of  this. I do not, again, bring this lightly. This is not theater. This is  about doing our job. This is about protecting the integrity of not only  our census, but of our Congress.   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to vote for this resolution, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
