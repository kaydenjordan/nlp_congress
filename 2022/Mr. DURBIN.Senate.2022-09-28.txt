 Madam President, it has been a little more than 7 months  since Russia launched its illegal invasion of Ukraine, and the  destruction that has followed is unbelievable. We have all had a chance  to bear witness to the brutal reality of Russia's invasion as Ukrainian  forces have recaptured territories like the city of Izyum.   Soon after the city was liberated, Ukrainian forces discovered mass  graves filled with hundreds of bodies, including children. Some of the  bodies had their hands tied behind their backs and their skulls  crushed, and many showed signs of torture. The images that have emerged  from Izyum prove what we have suspected for some time: The mountain of  evidence of Russian war crimes is sky high.   These photos illustrate what the Ukrainians are finding in recaptured  territory. They are sending out people to redig mass graves to find out  just what happened to members of their family and neighbors and their  friends.   The same thing is illustrated by this photo as well. In the shadow of  this beautiful church, they are finding mass graves left behind by the  Russians.   Today, I had the honor of presiding over a hearing of the Senate  Committee on the Judiciary, focusing on the role we must play in the  United States in holding Putin and his thugs accountable for these  heinous war crimes. The message was clear: Our Nation must continue the  legacy we began with the Nuremburg trials by ensuring that Russian war  criminals are brought to justice. And a critical step in doing that is  to make sure that the perpetrators of these atrocities find no safe  haven anywhere in the world, let alone in the United States.   That is why I have introduced the Justice for Victims of War Crimes  Act with the ranking Republican Member, Senator Grassley. It closes a  shameful loophole in American law that has allowed war criminals to  escape justice. Our legislation updates the War Crimes Act so foreign  war criminals who try to flee to America can be prosecuted, even years  after their crimes were committed. It is only a starting point, but I  hope we can build on it to finally enact the law in this country  prohibiting crimes against humanity. This is an opportunity to send a  clear signal to war criminals, like those in Russia today who  systemically attack civilians, that America is going to hold you  accountable for your crimes.                                 Immigration    Madam President, on a related topic, at our brightest moments,  America has not only held war criminals and tyrants accountable; we  have also provided refuge to their victims. Many of us in Congress can  attest to that fact.   In fact, it is exactly how my family arrived in this country. Back in  1911, my grandmother left Lithuania in search of freedom. She boarded a  ship carrying two things in her arms: a bag with her Catholic prayer  book, published a year before the Czars outlawed its printing in  Lithuania, and her 2-year-old daughter, my mother, Ona.   The moment my grandmother stepped foot on American soil, her life  changed. From that moment on, she  [[Page S5127]]  and my mother were protected by an incredible shield: the U.S.  Constitution, along with the rights and protections it guarantees.   But for Lithuanians, securing those same rights has not been so easy.  The country struggled under Soviet occupation for nearly 50 years. Even  after the Lithuanian people proclaimed their independence in 1990,  their liberty wasn't guaranteed. In January 1991, 9 months after  Lithuania held its first free elections, Soviet tanks rolled into  Vilnius in a ruthless, last-ditch effort to crush the country's new  democracy. Thirteen Lithuanian martyrs were killed that day.   I would like to think it was the sacrifice of those 13 Lithuanians,  and millions who also suffered under communism, that inspired the  current Governor of Florida to establish a new holiday earlier this  year. It was entitled Victims of Communism Day. In his own words,  Governor DeSantis created this holiday with the goal of ``honoring the  people that have fallen victim to communist regimes.'' In announcing  this holiday, he asserted that ``Florida will stand for truth and  remain as a beachhead for freedom.''   That is an admirable aspiration, but, sadly, it is one that the  Governor of Florida has failed to live up to because, when it comes to  standing up to ruthless dictators of our time, like Venezuela's Nicolas  Maduro, Governor DeSantis and his allies are nowhere to be found.  Instead of offering safe harbor to victims of Maduro's regime, these  very same Governors have chosen to abandon and abuse their families.   This is no way to honor the victims of communism and political  repression. It is a cowardly failure of leadership that violates our  Nation's basic values.   When news first broke that Governors Abbott of Texas and DeSantis of  Florida were using refugee families fleeing desperate conditions in  Venezuela as political pawns, I couldn't help but wonder: What if it  were my own family?   The families fleeing Venezuela are seeking refuge from the same  menace that the victims of communists faced decades ago: political  persecution and state-sanctioned violence. Under Nicolas Maduro,  Venezuela has been a failed criminal state awash in human misery. It is  so dangerous that the State Department warns Americans to avoid  traveling to that country, and the people of Venezuela suffer every day  under rampant corruption, human rights violations, hunger, and criminal  mismanagement. I saw it for myself when I visited Venezuela a few years  ago, just before Maduro's latest sham election.   Since then, things have grown worse. Hospitals are devoid of basic  medical supplies, kids and parents are too hungry to go to school or  work, and Maduro's barbaric regime is being propped up by some of the  most repressive powers of the world, like Russia and Cuba.   A recent United Nations report found that Maduro and his cronies have  been systemically repressing Venezuelans and gruesomely torturing their  political opponents. These horrors have driven nearly 7 million  Venezuelans to leave that country in desperation and fear. To put that  in perspective, that is more than the number of Syrian refugees and  nearly equal to the number of Ukrainian refugees fleeing active war in  those countries.   Despite what some Republicans have claimed, families fleeing  Venezuela are not ``illegals'' or ``invaders.'' They are victims of the  same ruthless tactics that once defined the Soviet Union. Instead of  helping these families, Governor DeSantis and Governor Abbott declare  holidays and have chosen to exploit their fear and confusion.   I met with a few of the families who were unwittingly placed on  migrant buses to Chicago by Governor Abbott of Texas a few weeks ago.  One of the people I met was named Carlos. He and his wife and two  little girls were sitting at a table, and we were able to talk to them  for about a half hour and ask questions.   Carlos was a hard worker in Venezuela, but the country's political  and economic crisis was so severe that his job couldn't keep food on  the table. His family was on the brink of starvation.   So on May 15, Carlos and his wife, along with those two beautiful  little girls, decided to literally flee for their lives. They embarked  on a 5-month journey, much of it on foot, to the Texas-Mexico border.  It was a nightmare of violence, theft, and exploitation. Carlos told me  that, at one point, he thought he would die, while spending 9 nights in  a Panamanian jungle. By the time they were rescued by a local military  force, all of their money was gone, their cell phones had been stolen,  and they were penniless.   But they pressed on and eventually made it to America. They filed  their claim for asylum. We are honored that they were brought to  Chicago, though the circumstances were not good.   To me, Carlos is living proof that we have more work to do in ridding  the world of violent repression and totalitarianism. These evils didn't  suddenly disappear with the fall of the Soviet Union.   I actually share the Florida Governor's belief that America has the  responsibility to stand in contrast to dictators like Maduro and Putin  by actually defending truth and freedom. But that responsibility is far  bigger than declaring a holiday, because it is one thing to speak out  against the evils of communism or voice opposition to Maduro, but talk  is cheap. The real test for our values begins when the victims of  tyrants like Maduro arrive at our doorstep in search of freedom. I am  sad to say that Governor Ron DeSantis and Greg Abbott have literally  failed that test. To add insult to injury, these Governors not only  refused to help these families fleeing Venezuela; they wasted  taxpayers' dollars on a political stunt that only made the problem  worse and made us, as a nation, look weak and, to some of the world,  look cruel.   Here is the reality. The most powerful way to stand up against  dictators like Maduro is by honoring America's legacy as a beacon of  freedom. That means coming to the aid of families like Carlos's-- families who are applying for asylum the right way and seeking a fair  shot in America, like our own families once did.   In fact, we need workers. We have 11 million unfilled jobs in this  Nation and 5 million unemployed Americans. Let's put young, able-bodied  people like Carlos to work in jobs that Americans don't want. Let's get  them on the books and give them their fair shot so they can finally  enjoy the security and safety for their families that was denied to  them in their home countries. They will contribute to a better America.   Time and again, immigrants have shown us that they rise to the  occasion, work harder than most, and achieve things unimaginable. They  can do it again, and they will. Let's prove that America was and is  better than the cold, iron fist of authoritarianism.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, in reserving the right to object, I  worried this morning that the Senator from Arkansas was going to offer  this unanimous consent request on the floor of the Senate this  afternoon. I was a little bit surprised. I wasn't aware of this bill.  We have been members of the same committee, the Judiciary Committee,  for 21 months, and the Senator from Arkansas has not raised the bill  during that period of time. But it is his right to come to the floor  today and ask that it be considered. I would like to tell you why I am  going to object to this.   If you serve in Congress for any period of time, you become a student  of the terrible drug problems of America. I recall a period of time in  the House of Representatives when we had crack cocaine appear in the  United States for the first time. It scared us because it was cheap; it  was deadly; addictive; and for the women who were pregnant who had  taken it, it did harm to the babies they were carrying. So we decided  to make sure that we were going to do the right thing in our War on  Drugs.   What we said was--listen closely--the penalty for crack cocaine would  be 100 times the penalty for the use of ordinary cocaine--100 times.  The penalty for using cocaine in general was already serious. One  hundred times, we said, for the War on Drugs. I voted for it. I  thought, finally, a message will come from the Congress that, if you  touch crack cocaine, you are going to be in for it. We expected that  fewer people would do it because of the fear of that criminal  sentencing and that the price of crack cocaine would go up because the  demand was limited.   Guess what happened--exactly the opposite, exactly the opposite.   More and more people used crack cocaine, and the price on the street  went down to dirt level. The result was we started filling our prisons  in a way that we had never seen before in the history of the United  States: 500 percent of the prison population of just 20 or 30 years ago  increased in that period of time.   We learned the hard way that getting tough wasn't always the smart  way to deal with drug addiction. We thought about it, and we changed  the law several times. I have been party to changing it. I voted for  the original version, and it failed. We had to do better.   Then something happened that was dramatic--opioids. Out of nowhere  came opioids, and what used to be a problem of drug addiction and death  in the inner cities of America became a problem of drug addiction and  death in the suburbs of America, in the farm towns of America--all over  America. Interestingly enough, America started looking at our drug laws  and our drug addiction and saying: What are we doing wrong here? What  is wrong with this situation?   As a consequence, a lot of attitudes changed. People got away from  the old ``just say no'' routine and started asking serious questions:  How do we deal with drug addiction? How do we stop this addiction? It  is not easy to stop it, but God knows we need to. So we have seen a  transformation with the arrival of opioids.   Now, the Senator from Arkansas is correct. People are lacing these  opioids with fentanyl, and fentanyl is deadly; there is no question  about it. We should take it seriously, and we do. As a matter of fact,  each judge, when imposing a sentence for crimes already involving  fentanyl, is pretty serious about it. I just heard the Senator from  Arkansas describe a situation in which someone in Minnesota got life in  prison for the sale of a fentanyl product. So it is clear that it is  not being ignored, nor should it be.  [[Page S5131]]    Intentionally selling fentanyl is already a crime all over the United  States. Representing that fentanyl is something else is exactly the  kind of aggravated factor a judge takes into account in the sentencing.  I don't believe this bill is a serious effort to deal with the problem  in light of what we know today.   Let's start with the fact that it creates a new Federal death penalty  offense.   Well, I have to tell you that I have watched a lifetime--a political  lifetime--of death penalty cases and have seen the result. I have my  serious doubts that that is the best way for America to go. I think the  gentleman from Arkansas realizes it. I am the lead sponsor, along with  20 others, of the Federal Death Penalty Prohibition Act--to repeal it  once and for all. So I am concerned about any legislation that imposes  the death penalty.   It also creates mandatory minimum sentences that don't allow judges  to consider the individual circumstances in a case.   That is straight out of the failed doctrine of the War on Drugs--a  mandatory minimum. Tie the judge's hands. Put people in jail, and  basically say there will be unlimited amounts of time that they will  spend there. People were getting 20- and 30-year sentences for the sale  of narcotics like crack cocaine, and we soon realized that it didn't  make sense over the long haul. It was 20 years for a single drug sale,  which goes up to mandatory life in prison if a defendant has any prior  felony conviction, no matter if it has zero relationship to drugs or is  based on a defendant's immigration status.   I don't believe that is the right way to go. It wasn't with the War  on Drugs. We learned the hard way. I want to get tough on the drug  sales, and I am sure the Senator from Arkansas feels the same way. We  approach it differently. I have the experience of trying to take the  hard position on this issue and of seeing that it failed when it came  to crack cocaine.   For that reason, I object.    Reserving the right to object.    The Senator from Arkansas' views on immigration are well- known. He has been consistent in opposing immigration, but it is  interesting to me that people like him who oppose immigration always,  at the end, seem to go after the same people: mothers and children.   We saw it with the cages the kids were kept in. We saw it when kids  were forcibly removed from their parents at the border during the Trump  years. We have seen it time and again, and now we see it with the  Governor of Florida and the Governor of Texas putting mothers and  children on buses and busing them hundreds of miles away from where  they were picked up, whether there is any contact there or not. Mothers  and children are always a  [[Page S5132]]  focal point of anti-immigration rhetoric, and, once again, this bill  does that.   I agree completely when it comes to stopping transnational criminal  organizations, but to focus the bill on innocent spouses and children,  including minor children, and make them the target of the bill seems to  me going beyond any reasonable law enforcement.   There is a narrow exception in the bill that allows a spouse or child  to be admitted to the United States if they can somehow convince the  consular officer that they did not know or could not reasonably have  known of their spouse's or parent's membership in a criminal  organization. But there is no exception for battered spouses or  children who are often victims of these organizations themselves. And  the bill gives what appears to be unreviewable discretion to these  consular officers to decide whether an innocent spouse or child has  renounced the organization.   These transnational criminal organizations must be sanctioned and  stopped, but this is not the way to do it, going after mothers and  children.   I want to make a point, since the Senator concluded after my last  statement that I am somehow soft on crime. Can I go through a short  list here of bills that I voted for to get tough on crime?   Let's take a look at this bill, the American Rescue Plan. That  American Rescue Plan passed in the U.S. Senate and provided billions-- billions--of dollars to State and local communities for police and  crime protection--more money for police and crime protection from this  Senate to those communities. I voted for it. The Senator from Arkansas  voted against it.   Then the Congress passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.  In that bill was a $430 million investment in our ports of entry,  helping DHS to screen vehicles for fentanyl. You see, these drugs come  through ports of entry. This idea of a backpack full of drugs being  hiked over the border by someone in the middle of the night, that is  not where the bulk of these drugs come from. They come through the  ports of entry. So we put a $430 million investment to make those ports  of entry even stronger and tougher.   I agree with that completely, helping the Department of Homeland  Security to screen vehicles and stop fentanyl from coming in. I voted  for that. The Senator from Arkansas voted no. Who is soft on crime?   Then we passed the March Omnibus appropriations bill--tens of  millions of dollars in increased funding for hiring police officers and  technology upgrades at the border to detect and seize fentanyl and  other illicit cargo. I voted for that. The Senator from Arkansas voted  against it. Who is soft on crime?   And when we passed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the most  serious bipartisan step Congress has taken to end gun violence in 30  years, I voted for it. The Senator from Arkansas voted against it. Who  is soft on crime?   The American people can see which party is passing legislation and  actually funds law enforcement, addresses crime and violence in a  thoughtful way. And they can see, when the bills come up on the floor,  one party gives the speeches; the other party gets the votes.   I am going to continue to vote to support the police and put an end  to this drug crisis in America in a thoughtful and sensible way.   I object.    Madam President, passing legislation is difficult at any  stage in American history. It is increasingly difficult when it is a  50-50 Senate. You have to work it. You have to be willing to sit down  with someone from the other side of the aisle and find a cosponsor so  that you have a bipartisan bill.   I have seen that work. In fact, I was part of it. It was Senator  Chuck Grassley and I who put together the FIRST STEP Act, which was  part of prison reform--significant prison reform--in this country.   Who signed the FIRST STEP Act? President Donald Trump.   Soft on crime? What we did was work out something that was  bipartisan, sensible, and really makes a difference, and makes certain  that people currently serving in prison will one day be released--most  will--and not return to crime when that happens. I think that was time  well spent, but it took a bipartisan effort.   I could have come to the floor every day of the week and offered my  best idea on how to fight crime, but if you can't pass it on a  bipartisan basis in the Senate, it doesn't work.   It takes a lot of hard work and a lot of patience and compromise to  make a real change in the law. Even if you think you have the best idea  on Earth, you have to work at it.   I yield the floor.    Reserving the right to object.    Mr. President, I took chemistry in high school. I wasn't  very good at it, but I think I got a B, and I was glad to get rid of it  because I didn't understand a lot of it, and that was not where I was  headed in life.   The question which the Senator from Wisconsin puts before us today is  a complicated question. It seems he is--do we have a drug crisis in  America? Yes. Is fentanyl dangerous? Yes. Is fentanyl deadly? Yes. Is  fentanyl on schedule I, the highest possible narcotic rating under our  Criminal Code? Yes.   So what is this discussion about fentanyl? Why are we at this again?   I don't know the Senator from Wisconsin's background in chemistry and  the like, but here is how I understand it and why it is not as simple  as paying tribute to this young man who lost his life to fentanyl. And  I can come up with examples that I have run into as well. It is  heartbreaking what is going on.   There are certain elements that contain fentanyl that have other  chemical structures, not simple fentanyl, which is already a prohibited  narcotic under American law. And these so-called analogs of fentanyl  have many chemical variations. It turns out that some of them are  deadly dangerous, but some of them are not. It turns out that some are  deadly dangerous, and others may have a promise to be the next Narcan  for the researchers.   So we have been struggling, literally, for years with a research  community that says: When it comes to fentanyl analogs, don't sweep  them all into category I. Some of them may be lifesaving, as odd as  that sounds. It could happen. And I have been saying it is a reasonable  argument, but how long is this investigation going to go on? How long  will this research continue?   We are told that it is sincere and real--it has happened under  previous administrations and this administration--and that to sweep all  these chemical analogs of fentanyl into this category would be,  frankly, counterproductive. We may be walking away from something that  is a lifesaver rather than a life-taker.   And it is because of that that we have been temporarily extending the  decision to put fentanyl and its analogs on category I so that this  research can establish whether, in fact, there is a lifesaver, that  there is something positive in a fentanyl analog.   I have just given you the sum total of my understanding of this  issue. As I said, I didn't major in chemistry and barely got through it  in high school, but I think that is where we are.   I don't think there is any disagreement between us that fentanyl is  deadly and dangerous and belongs on that category I.   When it comes to the analogs, they said to me: Durbin, you are a  liberal arts lawyer. Don't act like you are a chemist. Give us the time  to do this right.    Sure. Yes.    There is an element that the Senator from Wisconsin may  not be aware of. When a drug is on schedule I, it is prohibited to do  research on it. That is the reason why we  [[Page S5137]]  are running into problems with cannabis, now legal in my State and  maybe in your State as well.   And I raised the basic question: Are the health claims about cannabis  true or false?   And they said: We cannot research it because it is on the list of  prohibited drugs in the United States.   The problem is, if we put all of these analogs on the list, it is  going to stop the research that we need to finish. It is a catch-22.   What we have tried to do is a temporary extension saying: Give us the  final word. We have got to make a decision.   I do not quarrel with you in any way about the danger of fentanyl,  but the people who do this for a living--and I can't keep up with their  conversations, by and large--have explained to me: We are trying to  find a good use of a fentanyl analog. Don't close the door, slam the  door, by putting it on schedule I because research stops.    Yes, of course.    I would just say that my information is a little  different. I respect the Senator from Wisconsin and his tribute to this  poor young man who lost his life, but we are trying to do the sensible  thing. Fentanyl itself is going to continue to be branded a dangerous  drug, titled in category 1. But Federal analogs and a variation on that  theme is what we are discussing, and for reasons--I am trying to bow to  the experts in science and research--on a temporary basis. Believe me,  if they have got something, we want to see it. If not, we are going to  categorize them as schedule I. So for the reasons I have mentioned, I  am going to object.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object.    Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Iowa is sincere  and accurate as he describes the fentanyl challenge we face in the  United States. He tells the story of losing an Iowan. Sadly, I can tell  a similar story in my home State of Illinois.   We currently have a temporary answer to this situation that extends  until December 31 of this year, and admittedly, it is coming on us, but  it isn't tomorrow. It will be in just a few months.   One of my colleagues on the committee, Senator Cory Booker, has a  particular expertise and interest in this issue, but, unfortunately, he  could not be here at this moment when the Senator from Iowa made his  motion. On his behalf, so he has an opportunity to discuss this with  the Senator from Iowa and perhaps find a path through our differences,  I object.    Mr. President, every year since 1988, we have honored the  achievements of the Latino community in the United States through  Hispanic Heritage Month. My friend and mentor, Senator Paul Simon, was  part of the effort to establish this important time to honor the  contributions of Hispanic and Latino communities throughout American  history, filled with stories of inspiration and courage. Today, I  continue Paul's work by taking the time to honor this rich history and  celebrate the leaders paving the way for a brighter future of this  Nation.   Illinois is home to a large and vibrant Latino community. I have had  the privilege of meeting Latino people from many walks of life, from  Dreamers who grew up here, to newly arrived refugees fleeing tyranny.  While their stories all differ, they share common themes of hope,  resilience, and determination. In their stories, I see my family's  story. My mother and her family escaped oppression to find freedom here  in America. Many families have followed that same journey to provide a  better life in Illinois and across the country. It is not easy to leave  your home to travel to an unfamiliar place. But with their courage,  they brought diverse cultures, sharing music, food, traditions, and  history. The Latino community has made an indelible mark on Illinois  through small businesses, top-performing Hispanic-serving institutions,  and beautiful cultural centers and museums.   Commitment to family is a core tenant of Latino culture and extends  to care for the community at large, where Latino leaders use their  talents to help others. Juan and Maria Pedroza emigrated from Mexico in  1989 to Little Village with their small children. Like the story of  many families across the country, they, too, came to the United States  in search of the American dream, doing whatever it took to ensure a  brighter future for their children. Their children--Juan Manuel Jr.,  Maria Socorro, Gabriela, and Pedro--went on to attend prestigious  colleges and universities, including Harvard, DePauw, Cornell, and the  University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana. Pedro's courage and spirit  of service led him to serve in then-Mayor Rahm Emmanuel's office--the  first Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals--DACA--recipient to serve  in the mayor's office. Pedro recognized the needs of his community and  answered the call to public service so others could grow and succeed.  The Pedrozas' success has not come without great sacrifices, similar to  those that many Latino families have had to make. But through  extraordinary determination and resilience, they go above and beyond  out of love of family and community.   Chicago also is home to a vibrant Puerto Rican community that has  displayed great resilience in the face of serious challenges.  Tragically, more than 900,000 Puerto Ricans have lost power in the  aftermath of Hurricane Fiona. Some areas received more than 30 inches  of rain and, sadly, this devastation is a trend. Latinos in the United  [[Page S5171]]  States are more likely than non-Hispanic Whites to experience heat  waves, powerful hurricanes, sea level rises, and floods. It is  estimated that Hispanic and Latino people are 43 percent more likely to  live in an area expected to be too hot to work a full day outside due  to climate change. And communities are responding. Across the United  States, thousands of people have joined together to help Puerto Rico-- including in Illinois--where the Puerto Rican Agenda is working to  provide immediate relief to those affected by natural disasters. I  support their efforts and President Biden's approval of a major  disaster declaration for Puerto Rico.   Tackling environmental injustice doesn't end there. Earlier this  year, activists and community leaders in southeast Chicago raised  concerns with the development of a metal shredder facility. The Chicago  Health Department and the Environmental Protection Agency conducted a  health impact assessment, finding the metal recycling plant would have  increased air pollution and negatively impacted the mental health of  residents. As a result, the city blocked the development. This story is  not unique to Chicago; Latino communities across the United States have  mobilized to make their voices heard and protect our communities.   We also saw this tenacity during the pandemic. Millions of Hispanic  and Latino people served as frontline workers--treating patients,  feeding communities, and working around the clock to disinfect schools,  stores, and health centers at a grave personal cost. Today, Hispanic or  Latino persons are twice as likely to be hospitalized for COVID-19 and  1.8 times more likely to die from the virus, due to health disparities  and continuous exposure. We must never forget the contributions they  made, which have supported our Nation during one of its most difficult  moments.   Countless Latino leaders have overcome systemic injustices to succeed  and inspire the next generation of leaders. As we celebrate Hispanic  Heritage Month, we recognize the value the Latino community brings to  our country through its work and culture. Resilience and love shine  through in all that the community does and will continue to make us a  stronger country for years to come.                            ____________________
