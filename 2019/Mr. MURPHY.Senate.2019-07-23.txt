 Madam President, I congratulate all of those responsible  for the passage of this long-overdue legislation. I thank my colleagues  on both sides of the aisle who made this happen but first and foremost  all of the advocates all over the country but primarily in and around  the Northeast. There were hundreds upon hundreds of individuals who  rushed to that scene from my State of Connecticut, many of them dealing  with potentially terminal diseases as a result of that action. I am  glad we have stepped up in a bipartisan way and once again done the  right thing.   I am on the floor to continue the conversation about healthcare. I  wish I had as good news as comes with the passage of this legislation,  which is going to extend the guarantee of healthcare to all sorts of  heroes in and around New York. At the very same time, we are dealing  with a potential calamity for millions of other Americans who also have  serious conditions, who are dealing with diagnoses like cancer.   Today, if you have a preexisting condition, you know you are going to  be able to get insured for that preexisting condition. If you are the  parent of a child who has a serious illness, you don't have to worry  about being denied care for your son or daughter because of that  diagnosis. That is because we have the Affordable Care Act.   The Affordable Care Act has been on the books now for going on a  decade. It says: No matter how sick you are, no insurance company can  deny you care. That has made a world of difference for millions upon  millions of Americans who have preexisting conditions.   The potential calamity comes in a court case filed by Republican  Attorneys General, supported by the President and by Republicans in  this Congress, that would try to use the court system to do what the  Congress would not--overturn the entirety of the Affordable Care Act.  Congress wouldn't do that. We debated it. We voted down measures to  repeal the Affordable Care Act. Why? Because Americans all across this  country rose up and said: We want you to fix what continues to be  broken with the healthcare system, not tear down my coverage, not  remove me from the rolls of those who are insured.   All across the country, over 20 million people have insurance just  because of the Affordable Care Act--either because of tax credits we  give people to afford private insurance or the 12 million people who  got Medicaid because of the Affordable Care Act, never mind all the  folks who buy private insurance on their own, who can finally afford it  because we don't discriminate against you if you are poor. People  didn't want that taken away from them, so they rose up all across the  country, and Congress listened. By the skin of our teeth, we voted down  legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act.   Because opponents of the Affordable Care Act--in particular, this  President and Republicans who don't like it--couldn't get the job done  in the people's branch, they are now going to the courts to try to  repeal the Affordable Care Act. Right now weaving its way through the  court system is a case called Texas v. United States. I won't go into  the complicated legal argument. The goal of it, if it is successful, is  to wipe out the entirety of the Affordable Care Act overnight. It has  been successful at the district court level. It was just argued before  the appellate court level, and by the account of witnesses who were  there, the arguments didn't go too well for those of us who think the  Affordable Care Act should stick around.   There is just a simple question right now for my colleagues: Do you  support Texas v. United States? Do you support the lawsuit that would  wipe out the entirety of the Affordable Care Act overnight and replace  it with nothing?   I put Republicans on here because I actually know what the answer is  from the Democratic side of the aisle. Every single Democrat in the  Senate opposes this lawsuit. It is not because every single Democrat  thinks you shouldn't change anything about the healthcare system; it is  because we don't think it is a very good idea to kick 20 million people  off of insurance, jack up rates for people with preexisting conditions,  and have nothing to replace it--nothing. That is what will happen if  Texas v. United States is successful. Petitioners are asking for the  whole act to be thrown out and nothing to replace it. That would be a  humanitarian catastrophe in this country, if 20 million people all of a  sudden woke up and found they didn't have insurance coverage any  longer; if insurers were once again able to charge that family of a  child with a cancer diagnosis two times, three times, four times as  much.   The question for Republicans is, Do you support this lawsuit? I think  we need to get some answers. I think we need to get some answers. Some  of my colleagues are on record saying they hope it fails. More are on  record saying they hope it succeeds. But I don't think this body can  just box its eyes and ears to the reality of what would happen if this  lawsuit succeeds.   We are not riding to the rescue this Congress. Let me just be honest  with you. Given how fractious the debate is here about everything but  in particular about healthcare, there is no way that the Congress and  this dysfunctional White House can reassemble all of the protections in  the Affordable Care Act if the courts wipe them out. That is just not  realistic. We don't debate anything on this floor any longer. We don't  have the muscle to pass minor pieces of legislation like this body used  to do 20 years ago, never mind a reordering and reconstruction of one- sixth of the American economy, which is what the healthcare system  represents.   Republicans need to start making a decision. Do you support this  lawsuit or do you not? If you do support it, you can't just say ``Well,  you know, if everybody loses insurance and rates go through the roof  for people with preexisting conditions, we will figure it out'' without  having a specific plan for how you are going to do that. It is not good  enough to just say ``I hope that lawsuit succeeds. I hope everybody  loses their insurance. And then, the day after, we will come back and  we will see if we can try to find people healthcare.'' That is  irresponsible. That is not satisfactory. It isn't enough for people out  there who are living life in fear that their insurance is about to  vanish.    The problem is, the last time Republicans started thinking about what  they would want to replace the Affordable Care Act with, it was a joke.  It was a joke. The Better Care Reconciliation Act, which was Senate  Republicans' replacement for the Affordable Care Act--CBO found that it  would increase the number of people without insurance by 22 million. It  found that by 2026, an estimated 49 million people would be without  insurance, almost doubling the number who lack insurance today. That is  not better care; that is much, much worse care. So forgive me if I  don't have confidence that my Republican friends who run the Senate  today are going to have a plan to deal with a successful Texas v.  United States court case that keeps insurance for people in my State,  the 111,000 people in Connecticut who get insurance through the private  market with ACA subsidies and the 268,000 people in Connecticut who are  covered in my State under the Medicaid expansion.   It is time for everybody in this body, whether Republican or  Democrat, to step up and say: A, do I support the lawsuit to get rid of  all of the protections in the Affordable Care Act, with nothing to  replace it, and B, do I have a plan for what to do if the lawsuit that  I support is successful?   Chris, from Westbrook, CT, is asking that question of everybody in  this Chamber. Here is what he said:         I am a 30 year old patient living with muscular dystrophy       type 2B. Preexisting conditions can happen to anyone. . . .       Disease does not discriminate. . . . No amount of pre-      planning or prudence can stop you from preventing a genetic       disease, for example. . . . You can be healthy one day, and       have a health crisis the next. Everyone knows someone with a       preexisting condition. It is a lifesaver--having insurance       when you have a preexisting condition means being able to       afford lifesaving medicines and treatments.    Chris is watching carefully to see what the answer to this question  is.  [[Page S5000]]    Jeff in Enfield, CT, told me that in 2012, at the age of 7, his  daughter was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. He said:         By the time we noticed the symptoms and took her to the       doctor, she most likely had only a couple weeks left to live.       She is healthy today thanks to a daily regimen of insulin.       But insulin in the U.S. costs five to ten times what it costs       everywhere else. . . . Without insurance, the expense of       keeping our daughter alive would ruin us. The prospect of my       daughter being un-insurable is terrifying. . . . Without the       ACA's insurance protections, the problem would be epidemic.    The problem of people not being able to afford insulin all across  this country.   Jeff continued:         How can anyone be expected to live under that kind of       strain, especially a young person just starting out in life?    I am asking this question of my colleagues on behalf of my  constituents, but millions of Americans who are sick or have a child  who is sick are sick and tired of Congress playing politics with  healthcare. You may not love everything that is in the Affordable Care  Act. I get it. Republicans didn't vote for it. They didn't support it.  They have been consistent in trying to get rid of it ever since it was  put into law. I understand that. But I have taken my Republican friends  at their word over the last 10 years when they have said: We want to  repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with something better.   Asking the courts to overturn the entirety of the act with no plan to  replace it is an abdication of the promise that has been made. I don't  begrudge people trying to repeal a law they don't like if they think  they can do something better, but Congress didn't repeal the Affordable  Care Act because people didn't want us to do it.   This is an irresponsible and thoughtless mechanism to try to score a  political victory, but it ends up playing with lots of people's lives.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
