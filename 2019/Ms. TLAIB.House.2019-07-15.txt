 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Dorothy  Jones, a long-time resident of Detroit's 48217 community.   I first met Ms. Dorothy Jones in 2008. She was very active in her  local block club. She was passionate about the right to breath clean  air and stood up against corporate polluters like Marathon Petroleum  Refinery. Ms. Jones was never a person to shy away from a challenge,  and she always accepted nothing less than the best for her family,  friends, and her neighborhood.   I am honored to have known Ms. Jones for more than 10 years. She  would take me to task on important issues, which I always welcomed and  for which I was better for it. I am grateful for her engagement on  these issues that affect the quality of life for so many residents in  the 13th Congressional District. It is truly an honor to have known her  and served Ms. Jones. We honor her memory and her surviving family  members.                            ____________________
