 Madam Speaker, Montanans are bombarded with robocalls.  Last year alone, Americans received over 48 billion robocalls. That is  nearly 100,000 robocalls per minute.  [[Page H7300]]    Too many robocalls are deceptive and destructive, from bogus  insurance offers to threats of legal action. Scam artists scheme to  steal hardworking Montanans' private, personal, and financial  information. Sometimes, they go even farther.   A young woman from Bozeman received a call from her little brother's  phone number. She picked up the call, but it wasn't her brother. It was  a scammer using her brother's number. Tragically, her little brother  had died of a drug overdose a few months earlier. She was devastated  and shaken. This is disgusting and should not happen.   Today, we are taking a big step forward. We are empowering consumers.  Phone companies will provide consumers with call authentication tools  and blocking services at no cost. Illegal callers will face more jail  time.   Let's get robocall relief across the finish line for the American  people.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to pass this legislation.
