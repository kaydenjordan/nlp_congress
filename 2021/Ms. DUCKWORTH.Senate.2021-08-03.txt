 Madam President, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam President, last week, our Nation marked the 31st  anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. More than three  decades have passed since President George H. W. Bush signed the ADA  into law and proudly declared ``[L]et the shameful wall of exclusion  finally come tumbling down.''   This past week was a time for celebration and reflection on the  progress we have made over the last 30 years. Yet, when it comes to the  ADA's guarantee of equal access to public transportation for people  with disabilities, many transit and commuter rail systems continue to  fall short.   This amendment is not racist. This amendment does not call any  particular Agency racist. In fact, what this amendment does--the  substitute amendment includes $1.75 billion to expedite accessibility  upgrades at existing legacy rail fixed guideway public transportation  systems. My amendment simply ensures that recipients of these critical  Federal resources fully consider the goals and requirements of the ADA  and develop a plan to maximize accessibility across their systems.   This is common sense and good government. It ensures accountability  that taxpayer dollars are used to fulfill promises made decades ago and  are used wisely, with maximum effectiveness   Thirty years after we committed to a goal of inclusive and equitable  transportation, transit operators should be held accountable for  meaningful accessibility upgrades. It is not enough for grant  recipients to add cosmetic upgrades and pat themselves on the back.  Disabled commuters deserve the accessibility that others take for  granted.   This is not a partisan issue. I call on every Member in this Chamber  to stand with me in supporting equity for people with disabilities and  supporting good stewardship of taxpayer dollars
