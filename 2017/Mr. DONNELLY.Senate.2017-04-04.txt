 Thank you, Mr. President.   For the third time in the last year, I stand on the Senate floor in  support of thousands of retired coal miners and their families across  Indiana and the United States. If Congress doesn't act, many of the  miners will lose their health benefits at the end of this month.   There are a lot of important issues facing us here, but few have such  high stakes. Retirees are receiving letters telling them that their  health insurance will soon run out. This is a promise that was made and  a promise we have to keep. We have less than 30 days.   Let's do the right thing. Let's do the right thing and enact a  permanent solution. I strongly urge my colleagues to take action  immediately and ensure that our retired miners receive the health  benefits that were promised to them by the U.S. Government.   I yield back, Mr. President.
