 Mr. Speaker, let me thank Mr. Veasey for his  leadership. Let also thank the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus,  Mr. Richmond, for his leadership.   Before I start, let me offer my appreciation to law enforcement  officers across America--this is Law Enforcement Appreciation Day--and  join my colleague, Val Demings, particularly acknowledging the sadness  in Orlando today in the loss of two law enforcement officers in the  line of duty.   I rise today for not a personal statement or a statement that has to  do with personality. As the President-elect said of Mr. Sessions, he is  a fine and decent fellow. I have no interest in determining whether  that is true or false. But I do want to hold the President-elect  accountable for the words that he said on election night that he  pledged to the Nation that he would be a President for all Americans.  That pledge, I believe, will ring hollow for tens upon tens of millions  of Americans with the nomination of the Secretary of Education, who is  against public schools, the nomination of the Secretary of Health and  Human Services, who has no plan for health care, and, finally, the  nomination for Attorney General.   Rather than select someone who is championing and protecting, rather  than opposing and undermining the precious right to vote, the  constitutionally guaranteed right of privacy, criminal justice reform,  and the support for reform of the Nation's immigration system, it is  quite the contrary in the nomination of Senator Sessions--a person who  opposed Shelby County v. Holder in terms of the basis of trying to  constructively support voting rights, an individual who is hostile to  comprehensive immigration reform, and certainly someone who has  constantly not sought to fix, but has sought to undermine.   So, for example, as a U.S. attorney, he was the first prosecutor in  the country to bring charges against civil rights activists of voter  fraud. But, Mr. Speaker, listen to this: he didn't just bring charges;  he had 29 counts of voter fraud that resulted in civil rights activists  facing 100 years in prison.   He has repeatedly denied the disproportionate impact of voting  restrictions on minorities and has been a leader in the effort to  undermine the protections of the Voting Rights Act, and he did nothing  to reconstruct the Voting Rights Act and restore section 5 when tens  upon tens of Members of Congress worked diligently to try to fix the  Shelby case.   He criticized Attorney General Eric Holder for challenging State  election laws, claiming they are necessary to fight voter fraud.  Evidence supports that voter fraud is almost nonexistent, with 31  confirmed cases out of more than a billion ballots cast.   Senator Sessions fought to continue practices that harm schools  predominantly attended by African American students. He led the fight  to uphold the State of Alabama's inequitable school funding mechanism  after it had been deemed unconstitutional by the Alabama Circuit Court.   Finally, in the State of Alabama, nearly a quarter of African  American students attend what is called apartheid, or what can be  called apartheid schools, meaning the school's White population is less  than 1 percent.   Now we understand that the Senator has taken credit for desegregation  efforts in the State of Alabama. There is no evidence of his  participation in the desegregation of Alabama schools or any school  desegregation lawsuits filed by then-Attorney General Sessions.                                time  1945    I would say to you as I close, we who are vulnerable look to the  Department of Justice as the solid rock of justice for the Nation.  Whether we are immigrant, whether we are a woman who is trying to fight  against violence, whether we need civil rights, whether we are LGBT,  whether we are those who are seeking religious freedom or freedom of  expression, the Department of Justice is a solid rock of justice for  this Nation.   With that in mind, I believe that this nominee, who now stands with  the criteria evidenced by the record, stands not prepared, not fit to  hold this position of the Attorney General of the United States--a  sacred position of law and justice.   Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the House Committees on the  Judiciary and Homeland Security Committee; Ranking Member of the  Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and  Investigations, and the Congressional Voting Rights Caucus, I rise  today to express my views regarding the President-Elect's nomination of  U.S. Senator Jefferson Beauregard ``Jeff'' Sessions III of Alabama to  be the next Attorney General of the United States.   On Election Night the President-Elect pledged to the nation that he  would be a president to all Americans.   That pledge will ring hollow to tens of millions of Americans in  light of his announced intention to nominate one of the U.S. Senate's  most far-right members, Senator Jeff Sessions (R-AL) to be the next  Attorney General of the United States.   Perhaps nothing would do more to reassure the American people that  the President-Elect is committed to unifying the nation than the  nomination and appointment of a person to be Attorney General who has a  record of championing and protecting, rather than opposing and  undermining, the precious right to vote; the constitutionally  guaranteed right of privacy, criminal justice reform, and support for  reform of the nation's immigration system so that it is fair and  humane.   The nomination of Alabama Senator Sessions as Attorney General does  not inspire the necessary confidence.   As a U.S. Senator from Alabama, the state from which the infamous  Supreme Court decision in Shelby County v. Holder originated, Senator  Sessions has failed to play a constructive role in repairing the damage  to voting rights caused by that decision.   He was one of the leading opponents of the reauthorization of the  Violence Against Women Act.   He is one of the Senate's most hostile opponents of comprehensive  immigration reform and was a principal architect of the draconian and  incendiary immigration policy advocated by the President-Elect during  the campaign.   And his record in support of efforts to bring needed reform to the  nation's criminal justice system is virtually non-existent.   In 1986, ten years before Senator Sessions was elected to the Senate,  he was rejected for a U.S. District Court judgeship in view of  documented incidents that revealed his lack of commitment to civil and  voting rights, and to equal justice.   And his Senate voting record and rhetoric has endeared him to white  nationalist websites and organizations like Breitbart and Stormfront.   As a U.S. attorney, Senator Sessions was the first federal prosecutor  in the country to bring charges against civil rights activists for  voter fraud.   Senator Sessions charged the group with 29 counts of voter fraud,  facing over 100 years in prison.   Senator Sessions has repeatedly denied the disproportionate impact of  voting restrictions on minorities and has been a leader in the effort  to undermine the protections of the Voting Rights Act.   Senator Sessions has spoken out against the Voting Rights Act,  calling it ``a piece of intrusive legislation.''   Senator Sessions criticized Attorney General Eric Holder for  challenging state election laws, claiming they are necessary to fight  voter fraud.   However, evidence supports that voter fraud is almost nonexistent,  with 31 confirmed cases out of more than 1 billion ballots cast.   As Attorney General of the state of Alabama, Senator Sessions fought  to continue practices that harmed schools predominantly attended by  African-American students.   Senator Sessions led the fight to uphold the state of Alabama's  inequitable school funding mechanism after it had been deemed  unconstitutional by the Alabama circuit court.   In the state of Alabama nearly a quarter of African-American students  attend apartheid schools, meaning the school's white population is less  than one percent.   Although Senator Sessions has publically taken credit for  desegregation efforts in the state of Alabama, there is no evidence of  his participation in the desegregation of Alabama schools or any school  desegregation lawsuits filed by then Attorney General Sessions.  [[Page H223]]    I call upon the Senate Judiciary Committee to subject the nomination  to the most comprehensive, searching, and withering examination.   The United States has been blessed to have been served as Attorney  General by such illustrious figures as Robert Jackson, Robert Kennedy,  Herbert Brownell, Ramsey Clark, Nicholas Katzenbach, Eric Holder, and  Edward H. Levi.   The duty of the U.S. Attorney General is to lead the Department of  Justice in protecting and expanding the civil rights of all Americans  and the pursuit of equal justice for all, not to turn back the clock on  hard won rights and liberties.   No senator should vote to confirm the nomination of Jeff Sessions as  U.S. Attorney General if there is the slightest doubt that he possesses  the character, qualities, integrity, and commitment to justice and  equality needed to lead a department, the headquarters building of  which is named for Robert F. Kennedy, one of the nation's greatest and  most indefatigable champions of civil rights and equal justice for all.
