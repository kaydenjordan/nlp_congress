 Mr. President, section 251 of the Balanced Budget  and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, BBEDCA, establishes  statutory limits on discretionary spending and allows for various  adjustments to those limits. In addition, sections 302 and 314(a) of  the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 allow the chairman of the Budget  Committee to establish and make revisions to allocations, aggregates,  and levels consistent with those adjustments.   The Senate will soon consider H.R. 6074, the Coronavirus Preparedness  and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2020. This measure  provides supplemental appropriations to support activities related to  public health and response to the coronavirus that qualify for cap  adjustments under current statute.   This measure includes $7,767 million in budget authority that is  designated as being for emergency purposes pursuant to section  251(b)(2)(A)(i) of BBEDCA. The entirety of this budget authority falls  within the revised nonsecurity category. The Congressional Budget  Office estimates that these appropriations will result in $1,041  million in outlays in fiscal year 2020.   As a result of the emergency designations, I am revising the budget  authority and outlay allocations to the Committee on Appropriations by  increasing revised nonsecurity budget authority by $7,767 million and  outlays by $1,041 million in fiscal year 2020. Further, I am increasing  the budgetary aggregate for fiscal year 2020 by equivalent amounts.   I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables, which provide  details about the adjustment, be printed in the Record.
