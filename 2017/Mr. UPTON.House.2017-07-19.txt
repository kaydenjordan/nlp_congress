Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered      The online version has been corrected to read: The CHAIR.  Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered    ========================= END NOTE =========================     The gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton) and the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Castor) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 2910, the Promoting  Interagency Coordination for Review of Natural Gas Pipelines Act,  introduced by my colleague and friend from Texas (Mr. Flores).   I want to congratulate him for his work on this very important piece  of legislation that, in fact, will streamline the permit process for  the building of energy infrastructure, which will strengthen our  economy, create the jobs that we want, and, in fact, increase our  energy security. Very important.   This bill is going to address the critical need to expand and  modernize the Nation's natural gas pipeline infrastructure by promoting  a more timely and efficient review.   Mr. Chairman, by establishing FERC as the lead agency, this bill is  going to bring greater certainty, accountability, and transparency to  the siting process for interstate natural gas pipelines. Unfortunately,  many important projects have been delayed unnecessarily while waiting  for permits from participating agencies, and when siting a pipeline  project, multiple permits are always required, permits under the Clean  Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Air Act.   So FERC often coordinates with a variety of Federal, State, and local  governments and Indian Tribes to balance a wide range of issues,  including the potential impacts on environmental and wildlife  resources, land use, and, of course, property rights.   This bill is going to improve the permitting process by strengthening  the lead agency role of FERC in further defining the process for  participating in Federal and State agencies, and the intent of these  provisions is to involve stakeholders sooner so that they can be  involved in the setting of the schedule and identify issues of concern  earlier in the process.   Further, the legislation requires that agencies conduct their  respective reviews concurrently and in conjunction with the project- related review conducted by FERC in compliance with NEPA--in compliance  with NEPA.                                time  1430    To be clear, we are not skipping steps, we are just saying that one  part of the process shouldn't hold up the entire project if progress  can be made on other required permits.   So this bill is going to encourage more timely and efficient reviews,  a more robust and reliable energy pipeline system, more affordable  energy prices for every American.   Mr. Chair, I congratulate the gentleman from Texas, who has brought  this bill before us through the committee process.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds.   Mr. Chairman, there is a reason why the parliamentarians ruled that  the amendments on eminent domain are not applicable here: because they  are not germane. Eminent domain is not part of this bill. In fact, the  underlying natural gas act requires that eminent domain proceedings,  ``shall conform as nearly as may be with the practice and procedure in  similar action or proceedings in the courts of the State where the  property is situated.''   This doesn't change that, and that is why those eminent domain  amendments were not made in order.   Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Flores), the sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman  from Texas.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman  from Texas.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman  from Texas.

The National Taxpayers  Union has a letter of support, as well as the National Association of  Manufacturers.                                                 National Electrical                                         Contractors Association,                                        Bethesda, MD, July 18, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan: On behalf of the National Electrical       Contractors Association (NECA), I am writing in strong       support of H.R. 2883, Promoting Cross-Border Energy       Infrastructure Act which would establish a more uniform and       transparent approval process for the construction,       connection, operation, or maintenance of oil or natural gas       pipelines or electric transmission facilities for the import       or export of oil, natural gas, or electricity. NECA also       supports H.R. 2910, Promoting Interagency Coordination for       Review of Natural Gas Pipelines Act, which would help address       the need to modernize the nation's natural gas pipeline       infrastructure by promoting more timely and efficient reviews       by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). NECA       believes these critical pieces of legislation will facilitate       construction projects along the United States' borders and       encourage energy independence.        NECA is the nationally recognized voice of the $130 billion       electrical construction industry that brings power, light,       and communication technology to buildings and communities       across the U.S. NECA's national office and its 119 local       chapters are dedicated to enhancing the industry through       continuing education, labor relations, safety codes,       standards development, and government relations. NECA is       committed to advocating for a comprehensive energy policy       that addresses all available opportunities for energy       exploration and independence.        By establishing a more concrete process for the approval of       construction projects to import oil, natural gas, and       electricity, this legislation would create more jobs in the       construction industry while working towards America's energy       independence. Construction along the U.S. border to import       oil, natural gas, and electricity will greatly enhance our       nation's energy security and promote energy independence. It       is clear Congress plays a critical role in streamlining the       approval process and enacting policies that support approval       and construction of energy infrastructure projects. The       benefits of these projects are clear: job creation, energy       security, energy independence, and economic growth; such       construction is in the national interest. NECA strongly       endorses H.R. 2883 and H.R. 2910 and believes that these       bills will deliver many benefits to our nation.            Sincerely,                                       Marco A. Giamberardino, MPA,      Executive Director, Government Affairs.                                   ____                                         National Taypayers Union,                                      Washington, DC, July 18, 2017.                     National Taxpayers Union Vote Alert         NTU urges all Representatives to vote ``YES'' on the       following bills that would reduce regulatory burdens and       promote economic growth.        H.R. 806, ``Ozone Standards Implementation Act of 2017'':       This legislation would extend the timeframe for compliance       with the 2008 and 2015 ozone standards and put in place       process reforms going forward. The bungled 2008/2015       revisions have created an implementation headache for many       states, now tasked with simultaneously working to enact dual       standards. The costs are high for states and localities--      regardless of whether they achieve attainment. Nonattainment       means lost funds for highways and other essential       infrastructure projects. On the other hand, reaching       attainment could require limits on new construction and       manufacturing production, expensive retrofitting, and       oppressive new rules. Either way, jobs and investment will go       elsewhere without the more feasible, predictable reforms in       H.R. 806.        H.R. 2883, ``Promoting Cross-Border Energy Infrastructure       Act'': This legislation would streamline the archaic cross-      border permitting process for energy facilities that stretch       across the borders we share with Mexico and Canada. The       current Presidential Permit regime is far from clear and can       leave projects in regulatory limbo for years on end. Creating       a consolidated and standardized approval process would       increase the Congressional accountability provided for in       Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution, granting Congress       the authority to ``regulate Commerce with foreign Nations,''       while eliminating costly regulatory hurdles that stand       between consumers and low-cost energy options.        H.R. 2910, ``Promoting Interagency Coordination for Review       of Natural Gas Pipelines Act'': This legislation would       facilitate the timely review of natural gas pipeline       permitting by clearly designating the Federal Energy       Regulatory Commission as the lead agency responsible for       interstate natural gas pipeline site permitting. This, along       with other measures to increase efficiency such as providing       for concurrent reviews and commonsense timetables, would help       avoid duplication and other unnecessary delays. In addition,       H.R. 2910 would increase transparency in the permitting       process through more public disclosure, as well as create new       opportunities for public input.        In general, markets crave certainty in order to anticipate       where resources should be allocated. This is doubly true for       the giant infrastructure and manufacturing projects these       bills address. Planning, personnel, and capital all depend on       a transparent, predictable, consistent regulatory process.       Together, these reforms would result in increased investment       in our energy infrastructure, spurring job-growth in an       essential and lucrative sector of our economy, and enhancing       low-cost energy options for consumers.        Roll call votes on H.R. 806, H.R. 2883, and H.R. 2910 will       be included in our annual Rating of Congress and a ``YES''       vote will be considered the pro-taxpayer position.        If you have any questions, please contact NTU Federal       Affairs Manager.                                   ____                                                National Association                                                of Manufacturers,                                                      July 19, 2017.        Dear Representatives: The National Association of       Manufacturers (NAM), the largest manufacturing association in       the United States representing manufacturers in every       industrial sector and in all 50 states, urges you to support       H.R. 2910, the Promoting Interagency Coordination for Review       of Natural Gas Pipelines Act, introduced by Rep. Bill Flores       (R-TX).        Domestic natural gas has transformed the U.S. economy, made       our companies more competitive, created jobs and put money       back in the pockets of working Americans. Manufacturers use       natural gas as a fuel for direct process uses, such as       drying, melting, process cooling, machine drive and       refrigeration; as a fuel for direct non-process uses in       manufacturing establishments, such as heating, ventilation,       HVAC and lighting; as a fuel for indirect purposes, such as       boilers used to produce electricity and steam; and as a       feedstock in refining, chemicals and primary metals sectors.       Over the next decade, total demand for natural gas is       projected to increase by 40 percent. Domestic manufacturing       is poised to be a key driver of this growth. Consequently,       major investments in new pipeline infrastructure are required       to ensure manufacturers have a steady, reliable stream of       natural gas.        Unfortunately, permitting these infrastructure projects       remains a lengthy process. Permitting should follow a       comprehensive process that ensures timely and predictable       decision-making, but federal and state permitting agencies       can create roadblocks and delays when coordination is       inadequate. Strengthening the Federal Energy Regulatory       Commission's (FERC's) coordination of interagency processes       is critical to the permitting of natural gas infrastructure       and ensuring manufacturers have access to this affordable       resource.        H.R. 2910 would reinforce FERC's role as the lead agency       for siting interstate natural gas pipelines by directing FERC       to identify and invite all agencies considering an aspect of       an application to establish a schedule for concurrent       reviews, and to impose deadlines for final decisions. H.R.       2910 would ensure projects undergo a robust agency review       while completing that review in a timely and predictable       manner.        The NAM's Key Vote Advisory Committee has indicated that       votes on H.R. 2910, including procedural motions, may be       considered for designation as Key Manufacturing Votes in the       115th Congress.        Thank you for your consideration.            Sincerely,                                                  Aric Newhouse,                                              Senior Vice President,                                   Policy and Government Relations.     Mr. Chairman, might I inquire if the gentlewoman has any  further speakers.    Mr. Chairman, might I inquire if the gentlewoman has any  further speakers.    Mr. Chairman, I have no more speakers at this point, so I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Again, this  streamlines the process. There are still no shortcuts that are here. We  require that the agencies work concurrently with each other. At the end  of the day, we know that pipelines are literally the safest way to  transport whatever it is, oil, gas, to the consumers, and at a lower  cost. It is safer and, obviously, helps the most vulnerable with lower  costs.   We have literally millions of miles of pipelines. And I would note  that we passed major, major bipartisan legislation in several  Congresses--it was bipartisan, it was overwhelmingly bipartisan--that  President Obama signed into law increasing the safety standards and  fines for any new pipelines that are built. Those laws, obviously, stay  on the books.   Again, I would urge my colleagues to vote for the bill. I look  forward to the debate on a couple of the amendments.   I yield back the balance of my time.   The CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.   Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment  under the 5-minute rule.   It shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose  of amendment under the 5-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a  substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115-28. That  amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be considered as read.   The text of the amendment in the nature of a substitute is as  follows:                                 H.R. 2910         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(3) Failure to meet deadline.--If a Federal or State       agency, including the Commission, fails to meet a deadline       for a Federal authorization set forth in the schedule       established by the Commission under section 15(c)(1) of the       Natural Gas Act, not later than 5 days after such deadline,       the head of the relevant Federal agency (including, in the       case of a failure by a State agency, the Federal agency       overseeing the delegated authority) shall notify Congress and       the Commission of such failure and set forth a recommended       implementation plan to ensure completion of the action to       which such deadline applied.        (f) Consideration of Applications for Federal       Authorization.--        (1) Issue identification and resolution.--        (A) Identification.--Federal and State agencies that may       consider an aspect of an application for a Federal       authorization shall identify, as early as possible, any       issues of concern that may delay or prevent an agency from       working with the Commission to resolve such issues and       granting such authorization.        (B) Issue resolution.--The Commission may forward any issue       of concern identified under subparagraph (A) to the heads of       the relevant agencies (including, in the case of an issue of       concern that is a failure by a State agency, the Federal       agency overseeing the delegated authority, if applicable) for       resolution.        (2) Remote surveys.--If a Federal or State agency       considering an aspect of an application for a Federal       authorization requires the person applying for such       authorization to submit data, the agency shall consider any       such data gathered by aerial or other remote means that the       person submits. The agency may grant a conditional approval       for the Federal authorization based on data gathered by       aerial or remote means, conditioned on the verification of       such data by subsequent onsite inspection.        (3) Application processing.--The Commission, and Federal       and State agencies, may allow a person applying for a Federal       authorization to fund a third-party contractor to assist in       reviewing the application for such authorization.        (g) Accountability, Transparency, Efficiency.--For an       application for an authorization under section 3 of the       Natural Gas Act or a certificate of public convenience and       necessity under section 7 of such Act that requires multiple       Federal authorizations, the Commission, with input from any       Federal or State agency considering an aspect of the       application, shall track and make available to the public on       the Commission's website information related to the actions       required to complete the Federal authorizations. Such       information shall include the following:        (1) The schedule established by the Commission under       section 15(c)(1) of the Natural Gas Act.        (2) A list of all the actions required by each applicable       agency to complete permitting, reviews, and other actions       necessary to obtain a final decision on the application.        (3) The expected completion date for each such action.        (4) A point of contact at the agency responsible for each       such action.        (5) In the event that an action is still pending as of the       expected date of completion, a brief explanation of the       reasons for the delay.    The CHAIR. No amendment to that amendment in the nature of a  substitute shall be in order except those printed in part A of House  Report 115-235. Each such amendment may be offered only in the order  printed in the report, by a Member designated in the report, shall be  considered as read, shall be debatable for the time specified in the  report equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent,  shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand  for division of the question.                    Amendment No. 1 Offered by Ms. Tsongas    The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in  part A of House Report 115-235.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The CHAIR. The gentleman from Michigan is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I would just note that all current reviews  that we do now for pipeline siting, they all remain in place. None of  it goes away. Those same reviews take place.   The gentlewoman's amendment, in our view, is unnecessary because  nothing in this legislation would limit environmental protections or  affect laws that govern the multiple use of our public lands.   Pipelines, we know, as I said earlier, are the safest, most efficient  way to transport energy supplies. The overwhelming majority of  Americans strongly support modernizing our infrastructure, including  pipelines, to ensure stable, affordable supplies. And I would note, we  have millions of miles of pipelines across the country.   So what is the alternative if you don't have a pipeline?   Well, it is going to be more expensive and, frankly, the accident  record is not perfect either. It includes rail or truck, often at a  higher cost, which then is passed along to those consumers, impacting  the most vulnerable the most.   Infrastructure modernization and job growth go hand in hand with  environmental and natural resource protection. Investing in our  infrastructure is a smart investment for energy security, job growth,  manufacturing, and creating the jobs that we want.   Maintaining and expanding these economywide benefits is dependent on  a transparent and a predictable regulatory approval of infrastructure  projects. That is what the underlying bill does.   This amendment, however, we would view as a step backward. I would  urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I again remind my colleagues to oppose the  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.   The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Tsongas).   The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The CHAIR. The gentleman from Michigan is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I would like to start out by saying that we  are prepared to accept the amendment. I know that all of us here take  pipeline safety very seriously, and certainly since my chairmanship of  the Energy and Commerce Committee, we put safety at the forefront of  our efforts to modernize our pipeline infrastructure. We passed two  major bills that President Obama signed, and I think there may have  been maybe a single Member that opposed that legislation over the  years, but we care a lot about that.   In the last Congress, we passed the PIPES Act and the FAST Act.  Again, major bipartisan initiatives that Mr. Pallone and I worked out  that got to President Obama's desk. Each of these two bills took  important steps to update our laws to protect against emerging physical  attacks as well as cyber attacks, threats to the grid, in our energy  delivery systems, including pipelines.   We know that multiple Federal and State agencies have a role to play  and an opportunity to lead with that expertise. While the Department of  Energy is the lead sector-specific agency for cybersecurity and for the  energy sector, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety  Administration, PHMSA, is responsible for administrating minimum  pipeline safety standards, and the TSA, the Transportation Security  Administration, does monitor threats to our transportation sector. I  think that is where the gentleman from Massachusetts is coming from  with this amendment.    The amendment, I have got to say, appears to be consistent with  current law, while a rigid consultation requirement could end up  resulting in delays if the TSA is not able to consult in a timely  manner, but, again, the language is ``consult.'' I would hope that that  would happen.   The amendment also appears to address pipeline facilities, but it is  not clear whether it includes LNG as an example. Given the overlapping  nature of Federal and State jurisdiction over pipeline safety, we want  to make sure that we are doing it right and that we have got all the  tools in the toolbox to make sure that that happens and we don't wonder  what would have happened without this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentleman's amendment. We are ready to  work with him, but certainly, at this point, ready to accept the  amendment.    I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts.    Mr. Chair, reclaiming my time, it is my understanding, I  believe, that a GAO report has been requested by some of our friends on  both sides of the aisle, and we welcome the completion of that report  and are anxious to see the result.   Mr. Chairman, again, I am prepared to accept the amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.   The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman  from Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch).   The amendment was agreed to.                     Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Beyer    The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in  part A of House Report 115-235.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The CHAIR. The gentleman from Michigan is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, FERC is the lead agency for siting  interstate natural gas pipelines. We all know that. But there are a  number of other Federal and State agencies that also have to issue  associated permits for large-scale projects.                                time  1530    Through the FERC prefile process, sponsors engage with landowners,  local communities, and government agencies to educate stakeholders and  collect the information about the best location for siting that  pipeline.   The underlying bill, H.R. 2910, brings much-needed certainty and  transparency to the process by encouraging the stakeholders to  participate in good faith early in the process. Unfortunately, this  amendment, the way that we read it, would create more uncertainty and  create more opportunities for delays.   The overwhelming majority of Americans strongly support expanding the  infrastructure. Creating the jobs, the pipelines, ensures stable and  affordable supplies. Flexibility, affordable, and reliable energy is  important for American families and businesses to thrive.   I would note, at this point we still don't have a quorum with FERC,  and we want that to change. That will be an issue that goes through the  confirmation process in the Senate, but consumers really only benefit  from domestic energy if we can get it to them.   Investing in infrastructure is a smart investment, so I would urge my  colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Flores) having assumed the chair, Mr. Duncan of Tennessee, Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2910) to  provide for Federal and State agency coordination in the approval of  certain authorizations under the Natural Gas Act, and for other  purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5  legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include  extraneous material on the bill, H.R. 2883.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Michigan?   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution H.R. 2883 and  rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole  House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R.  2883.   The Chair appoints the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Duncan) to  preside over the Committee of the Whole.                                time  1534                        In the Committee of the Whole    Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the  Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill  (H.R. 2883) to establish a more uniform, transparent, and modern  process to authorize the construction, connection, operation, and  maintenance of international border-crossing facilities for the import  and export of oil and natural gas and the transmission of electricity,  with Mr. Duncan of Tennessee in the chair.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the  first time.  [[Page H6011]]    The gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton), and the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Castor), each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 4 minutes.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2883, the  Promoting Cross-Border Energy Infrastructure Act.   This legislation continues the great tradition of bipartisan  legislation coming out of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Our  focus has been and will continue to be building America's  infrastructure, creating jobs, and strengthening our economy.   I want to congratulate my colleagues and sponsors of this bill,  particularly Mr. Mullin and Mr. Gene Green, Republican and Democrat,  for their work on this legislation.   H.R. 2883 would establish coordinated procedures to authorize the  construction, connection, operation, and maintenance of international  border-crossing facilities for the import and export of oil and natural  gas, and the transmission of electricity. That is what the bill does.   The legislation would replace the requirements established under  executive order that persons obtain a Presidential permit before  constructing an oil and gas pipeline or electric transmission facility  that crosses the border between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada.   To date, Congress has not asserted its authority to establish  proceedings for permitting cross-border energy infrastructure. In the  absence of a statutorily directed process, agencies have made decisions  regarding cross-border energy infrastructure within the context of  their interpretation of a series of executive orders dating back to the  1950s.   Recent proposals, most notably the Keystone XL pipeline, have faced  significant and unnecessary delays as a result of political  interference in what should have been a straightforward review. There  is bipartisan agreement that we should have a free flow of energy in  North America.   This bill is going to level the playing field for energy  infrastructure projects located at the international border. The  legislation takes important steps to bring fairness to the process and  provide certainty to countries whom we already have a free trade  agreement with and businesses that want to create jobs in the U.S. It  is going to strengthen our effort to improve and update NAFTA and  enhance our trilateral trading relationships.   It is time Congress exercised its constitutional authority to  regulate commerce with foreign nations and replace the Presidential  permit requirement with a more transparent, efficient, and effective  review process.   Establishing the cross-border permitting process in law would lead to  more objective and timely decisions, which, in turn, is going to create  the jobs, strengthen our Nation's energy security, and support  affordable and reliable energy for all Americans.   Again, I want to thank my colleagues for their efforts on this  important legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
