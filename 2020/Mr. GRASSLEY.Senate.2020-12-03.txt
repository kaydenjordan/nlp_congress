 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute in morning business.    Mr. President, the Tuesday after Thanksgiving has been  known as Giving Tuesday. I suppose this Giving Tuesday is receiving  more attention than usual because of the virus pandemic that we have  been in for the last 12 months. Like many sectors, the nonprofit  industry is hurting because of COVID-19.   As part of the CARES Act passed last March, Congress enacted key  provisions encouraging charitable giving to help support organizations  that are being called upon more than ever to help Americans because of  the virus pandemic. These charitable giving provisions that are in the  CARES Act apply both to individuals who itemize their taxes and those  who do not itemize.   Iowa is blessed to have an extensive network of charitable  organizations that are supported by incredible volunteers who open up  their pocketbooks to support their neighbors in need. This fall,  Senator Ernst and I heard from at least 20 nonprofits in the Cedar  Rapids area about the challenges that they face because of the pandemic  and natural disasters, and also we heard of the successes they have had  this year.   The work that Iowa nonprofits do is inspiring and has tremendous  impact. In this season of Thanksgiving, I speak on behalf of my own  State to thank these organizations, their employees, and volunteers for  the hard work and services that they deliver every day of the year to  Iowans in need.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
