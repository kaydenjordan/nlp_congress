 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with members of the Tennessee  delegation and with the Congressional Black Caucus to honor the victims  of a deadly mass shooting at a Waffle House in Antioch, Tennessee,  early on the morning of Sunday, April 22.   The four young, promising lives that were lost were Joe R. Perez,  DeEbony Groves, Taurean C. Sanderlin, and Akilah DaSilva.   Fortunately, James Shaw, Jr., was also in the restaurant to confront  the shooter and to take away his weapon with his bare hands, probably  saving the lives of 16 other people.   Let us honor all of the victims and our hero, James Shaw, Jr., with a  moment of silence.                            ____________________
