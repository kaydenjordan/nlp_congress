 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the Biden  administration's latest plan to infringe on the privacy of millions of  Americans.   Amid raging inflation and a multitrillion-dollar spending spree,  President Biden and the Democrats now want to spy on American citizens'  financial transactions.   This proposal would require financial institutions to report  information about the outflows and inflows on all accounts with over  $600 to the IRS every year.   Not only would such a massive data collection cause large compliance  costs for our local banks, credit unions, and financial institutions in  Wisconsin and across the country, it would further deepen mistrust in  our financial institutions and community banks.   The IRS experiences 1.4 billion cyberattacks annually and has  experienced multiple data breaches. This leaves Americans' most private  of information vulnerable to attack and fraud.   Privacy is one of the main reasons individuals do not open bank  accounts. Having the government monitor and collect data on personal  financial account transactions will further this distrust with  financial institutions.   Law-abiding Americans deserve the right to privacy over their  personal financial data. Allowing the government to sift through our  financial records is a violation of our basic right to privacy.                            ____________________
