 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment. The BLM  venting and flaring rule, or the BLM methane rule, represents one of  the Obama administration's most egregious abuses of executive power  designed to destroy responsible energy production on Federal land.   BLM exceeded statutory authority by attempting to regulate air  quality; authority that is vested solely with the EPA. Methane  emissions from oil and natural gas have significantly declined in  recent decades without duplicative Federal regulations in a time when  oil and gas production in the U.S. has surged.   It is frustrating that this rule is somehow cloaked under the idea  that it will benefit taxpayers. It won't. It is an onerous rule with no  connection to the reality of the physics and chemistry of energy  production. It will reduce American energy production on Federal land  and, therefore, reduce royalties due to the U.S. Treasury.    This amendment brings accountability to executive rulemaking. I thank  Congressman Pearce and applaud him, as well as Congressmen  [[Page H7176]]  Westerman and Cramer for their similar amendments crippling other Obama  rules.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr.  Pearce) has expired.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, as I said, I rise in opposition to this  amendment, as clearly this amendment would prohibit BLM from regulating  flaring, venting, and leaking of methane from Federal onshore oil and  gas operations.   In 2016, the BLM finalized its rule which updated regulations that  were almost over 30 years old. We have learned a lot about how we have  to be more diligent about capturing energy and making America more  energy secure, because this rule would prevent the waste of an  estimated 65 billion cubic feet of natural gas a year and save  taxpayers $330 million annually.   BLM has a responsibility to the taxpayers, and that means capturing  what is flared off, what is burnt off, which is potential energy. We  have developed technologies in the past 30 years to capture this and  make it work even more effectively for the taxpayers when we lease out  these leases and royalties.   Just for a fact, I share that the Bakken oil field, when it was at  its height, flared more--I am from the Twin Cities--flared more and  brighter than the metropolitan area in St. Paul and Minneapolis. That  is how bright the flare was that the satellites captured at night. That  was burning energy, energy consumption that should have been captured  because we owe it to future generations to get it right when it comes  to our energy production.   Mr. Chairman, the amendment is bad for public health, it shortchanges  the American taxpayers, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it. I don't  think we are going to change each other's minds on this because the  bottom line is, and I have been consistent with this, this belongs in  the Policy Committee. This only would change something for a year. You  would have to come back year after year after year. If there is  something where we can find common ground on, we can find it in the  Policy Committee. We can't find it on an Appropriations Committee where  it expires every year.   I ride the elevator with the gentleman, Mr. Chair, and I am sure he  is going to enlighten me some more.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  2300    The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Pearce).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes  appeared to have it.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Mexico  will be postponed.   The Acting CHAIR. The Chair understands that amendment No. 64 will  not be offered.                   Amendment No. 65 Offered by Mr. McEachin    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 65  printed in House Report 115-297.   Mr. McEACHIN. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division A (before the short title), insert       the following:     limitation on use of funds for developing a new 5-year-offshore-plan         Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may       be used to prepare a five-year offshore oil and gas leasing       program that would schedule any Outer Continental Shelf oil       and gas lease sale before 2022.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. McEachin) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.   Mr. McEACHIN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, my amendment is simple. It would prevent the Department  of the Interior from preparing a new 5-year offshore oil and gas  leasing program that schedules leases before the year 2022.   Mr. Chairman, offshore drilling carries real consequences, from the  industrialization of our coasts to the inescapable risk of another BP  Deepwater Horizon-like disaster. Those risks can not be eliminated.   As Deepwater Horizon made clear, accidents can inflict damage of an  almost unimaginable scale. BP has spent billions of dollars responding  to that disaster.   That figure reflects liabilities that arose from massive and  irreparable damage to our environment, permanent harm to economically  essential industries, and countless other impacts on the Gulf Coast  residents' quality of life. We have to make sure that other regions are  never exposed to those kind of harms. That is why my amendment is  important.   In the event of a drilling accident, thriving coastal economies could  be decimated. Industries that rely upon a healthy marine environment-- everything from the tourist trade to our fisheries--could disappear  overnight.   If a spill were big enough--and we have seen that they can be  enormous--the economic consequences would ripple throughout the  national economy, hurting millions of Americans who live many miles  from the sea. Again, we cannot afford such economic risks.   It is equally foolish to risk the natural beauty, fragile habitats,  and irreplaceable species for the benefit of a few massive oil and gas  companies.   Our coasts are home to some of our most iconic and unique wildlife.  Healthy oceans are critical to traditional ways of life, having  provided subsistence resources for many generations.   Those places, those species, those customs are part of why we live in  the greatest country on Earth. No other place could match the richness  and diversity of the United States of America. We must not endanger the  incredible heritage in a quest for dirty energy, especially the kind of  fuels that can drive catastrophic changes to our climate, with grave  and permanent consequences for our society.   It is important to note that prohibiting the preparation of a new  leasing program does not stop any of the currently scheduled lease  sales until 2022 from happening. My amendment just puts us back on the  regular schedule for writing the next plan.   Prohibiting the preparation of a new leasing program, however, does  ensure that millions of taxpayer dollars are not spent reworking a plan  that was just completed this year.   Restarting a new 5-year leasing process would throw away 2\1/2\ years  and tens of millions of dollars of effort, ignore overwhelming  bipartisan opposition from millions of people up and down our coasts,  and eliminate the protections that President Obama provided for the  fragile Arctic.   Mr. Chairman, the risk of a new 5-year offshore oil and gas leasing  program are simply too high and the consequences are too severe.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.
