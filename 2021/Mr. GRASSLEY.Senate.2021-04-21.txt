 Mr. President, I intend to object to any unanimous  consent request relating to the nomination of Samantha Power to be  director of the United States Agency for International Development  (USAID) (PN 114).   Throughout the 116th Congress, I conducted an investigation that  found that a non-profit organization transferred funds to an entity  known as the Islamic Relief Agency (ISRA). This entity had been  sanctioned by the Treasury Department for helping funnel funds to  terrorists and terrorist organizations including Osama Bin Laden.  During this investigation we came across redacted State Department  emails that imply that, while she was  [[Page S2134]]  Ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power worked through back  channels to trigger a Treasury review of ISRA's sanctioned status in an  effort to have them delisted.   In an effort to have these emails un-redacted and better understand  Ms. Power's involvement in what could be an alarming abuse of power, I  sent a letter to Ms. Power and USAID requesting information on February  18, 2021. Ms. Power responded to my letter on March 23, 2021, the date  of her committee hearing, but failed to answer the questions or provide  the un-redacted versions of these emails. On March 31, 2021, I sent a  second letter to Ms. Power urging her to fully respond to my initial  letter. I have yet to receive a response.   Unfortunately, due to Ms. Power's lack of transparency, I must object  to any consideration of this nomination. I cannot in good conscience  vote for Ms. Power until I have received a full response to the  questions posed in my letter, reviewed the un-redacted versions of  these emails, and confirmed that she did not attempt to utilize her  office to delist ISRA through back channels.                            ____________________
