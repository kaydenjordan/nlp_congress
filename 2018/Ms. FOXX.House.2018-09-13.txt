 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in celebration of Constitution  Day this upcoming week.   On September 17, 231 years ago, 39 patriots signed their names to a  document that changed the course of history. This document chartered a  lasting experiment in democracy and put our Nation on the path to  becoming  [[Page H8178]]  the world's strongest and greatest in the history of the world.   Since 1789, the Constitution has served as our country's legal  foundation. Its wisdom is timeless, and just as George Washington  called the Constitution the guide he would never abandon, we should not  abandon the brilliance of our Founders' intent.   The Constitution establishes the United States of America as a nation  of laws where the government derives its limited powers from ``We the  People,'' the consenting governed. Those words, I believe, Mr. Speaker,  are the most important words outside our Bible.   Thanks to the foresight of the Constitution's Framers and their  understanding of government overreach and human nature, we have an  abiding document that checks the power of the Federal Government and  protects the rights of individual citizens.   What has happened with our government, though, is that it has  expanded in such a manner that it flips the Constitution on its head.  Let's take a look at Articles I through III, which outline the powers  of each branch of government.   In this pocket copy of the Constitution, Article I is eight pages;  but it is, by far, the longest of the articles, detailing the powers of  the Congress.   Article II is only three pages, outlining the powers of the executive  branch.   Article III is only a half page and establishes the limited powers of  the judicial branch.   Now, what has happened is that the relative power of each branch is  completely inverted. The power to write the law and thereby represent  the will of the people has been diminished by both the executive and  judicial branches.   The judicial branch seeks to write the law through its power of  interpretation in setting precedent. The judicial branch has become an  instrument for activists to pass agendas that could not be accomplished  by passing laws in Congress because they lacked the support of the  majority of people in the country.   Rather than serving as the least powerful branch of government that  acts as a check, the judicial branch has taken the power delegated to  Congress and become a much more powerful branch than ever intended.   The executive branch has promulgated rules which have the force of  law and have circumvented the lawmaking process of Article I, thwarting  again the grand design of the Constitution.   These trends must stop and the plan of the Constitution reasserted.  The Constitution is genius in its brevity, in its endurance, and in its  forethought to limit and separate the governing powers established  therein. It is an honor and a sacred duty for me to protect and uphold  the Constitution in representing the people of the Fifth District here  in this Congress.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, the public often has the impression that we in  Congress are not caring people who work together on issues. I want to  say to the American people that in the last few days, you could not  find a group of people more concerned about their fellow Members than  we have here.   We know this hurricane is hitting North Carolina, it is likely to hit  South Carolina and possibly Georgia, and I want people to know how much  I appreciate Members on both sides of the aisle who have come up to me  to ask what impact this is going to have on me, on my district, on the  people of my district, and on North Carolina in general.   It is very heartwarming to have those concerns expressed. People have  said, ``We are praying for you.''   I know that is the case throughout the country, but I want to  particularly say to all of my colleagues--I thanked them all  personally--but to all of my colleagues, those who haven't spoken to me  but have spoken to other Members, thank you very much for your concerns  and prayers. I certainly will pass those along to my constituents, but  I think it is important that people know we care a great deal about  each other and we express that to each other.                            ____________________
