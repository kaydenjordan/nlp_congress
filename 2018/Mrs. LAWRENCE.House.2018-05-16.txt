 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak out against this  terrible farm bill.   Mr. Speaker, we were working together, Democrats and Republicans, to  work on a farm bill. Unfortunately, the Republicans are putting all of  our constituents in danger by making this bill purely a political  agenda.   At the last minute, after working together and reaching consensus,  the Republicans decided to include major devastating cuts to SNAP, or  food stamps, instead of helping rural and urban Americans.   This bill cuts SNAP by $23 billion, which will kick 1 million  households off the program. The bill will also kick 265,000 kids out of  free school meals and reduce benefits for millions of families.   In Michigan 1.3 million people rely on SNAP and it keeps 141,000  children out of poverty. This bill includes so many other programs in  my district.    Mr. Speaker, my district supports urban farmers and  food banks so our farmers and people can thrive. We should not put all  of this in danger.   Mr. Speaker, I call on Republicans today to stop, to remove this  terrible proposal for SNAP with this poisonous bill.
