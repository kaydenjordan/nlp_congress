 Mr. Speaker, this Nation has made far too little  progress in the fight for equal pay in the workplace. In 2021, women  who work full time year round are paid, on average, only 82 cents for  every dollar paid to men. This adds up to over $400,000 in lost wages  over the course of a woman's career.   For women of color, the gender gap is a gender chasm, with Latinas  earning 55 cents, Black women earning 63 cents, and Asian American and  Pacific Islander women earning a mere 52 cents for every dollar paid to  a White man for the same work.   The long overdue Paycheck Fairness Act would bring us closer to  closing these gaps by ensuring equal pay for equal work. Notably, it  would hold employers accountable for discriminatory practices, end pay  secrecy, ease workers' ability to challenge pay discrimination, and  strengthen the available remedies for wronged employees.   I thank Congresswoman DeLauro for her tireless advocacy on this  issue.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter of support from the  National Women's Law Center.                                    National Women's Law Center,                                                     April 14, 2021.      Re Pass the Paycheck Fairness Act (H.R. 7) and vote no on           harmful amendments.         Dear Representative: As the House votes this week on the       Paycheck Fairness Act (H.R. 7), we strongly urge you to pass       the Paycheck Fairness Act without amendments that limit its       scope or undermine its critical protections.        Despite federal and state equal pay laws, gender pay gaps       persist, and earnings lost to these gaps are exacerbating the       financial effects of COVID-19, falling particularly heavily       on women of color and the families who depend on their       income. The Paycheck Fairness Act, which has been passed       three previous times by the House of Representatives, mostly       recently in the 116th Congress, offers a much-needed update       to the Equal Pay Act of 1963 by providing new tools to battle       pervasive pay gaps and to challenge discrimination.        Women are increasingly the primary or co-breadwinner in       their families and cannot afford to be shortchanged. Women       working full-time, year-round are typically paid only 82       cents for every dollar paid to men, adding up to a loss of       more than $400,000 over a lifetime. This wage gap varies by       race and is larger for many women of color: Black women       working full time, year round typically make only 63 cents,       Native American women only 60 cents, and Latinas only 55       cents, for every dollar paid to their white, non-Hispanic       male counterparts. Latinas lose more than $1 million over a       40-year career due to the wage gap. While Asian American and       Pacific Islander (AAPI) women make 85 cents for every dollar       paid to white, non-Hispanic men, many AAPI communities       experience drastically wider pay gaps. Mothers typically make       only 75 cents for every dollar paid to fathers. And even when       controlling for factors, such as education and experience,       pay gaps persist and start early in women's careers and       contribute to a wealth gap that follows them throughout their       lifetimes. Persistent pay discrimination, often cloaked by       employer-imposed pay secrecy policies, is one factor driving       these wage gaps.        These pay gaps can be addressed only if workers have the       legal tools necessary to challenge discrimination and       employers are provided with effective incentives and       technical assistance to comply with the law.        The Paycheck Fairness Act updates and strengthens the Equal       Pay Act of 1963 to ensure that it provides robust protection       against sex-based pay discrimination. Among other provisions,       this comprehensive bill:        ends secrecy around pay by barring retaliation against       workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages, and       requiring employers to report pay data to the EEOC        prohibits employers from relying on salary history in       determining future pay, so that pay discrimination does not       follow women from job to job        closes loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women       less than men for the same work without any important       business justification related to the job        ensures women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-      based pay discrimination that are currently available to       those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity        provides much needed training and technical assistance, as       well as data collection and research        The COVID-19 pandemic and systemic racism have exposed how       the work performed primarily by women, and particularly Black       and brown women, has long been and continues to be       undervalued and underpaid, even as the rest of the country is       newly recognizing the essential nature of this work. We       cannot build back an economy that works for everyone without       ensuring that all women can work with equality, safety, and       dignity, starting with pay equity. Passing the Paycheck       Fairness Act would mark a vitally important step toward       ensuring this becomes reality.        We urge you to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act without       harmful amendments that weaken its critical protections.            Sincerely,      Emily J. Martin,        Vice President for Education & Workplace Justice.      Maya Raghu,        Director of Workplace Equality & Senior Counsel.     Mr. Speaker, I urge my House colleagues to vote for  this package and close the gender wage gap once and for all.
