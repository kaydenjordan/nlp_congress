 Mr. Chief Justice, I have a question for the President's  counsel, and it is cosponsored by Senators Rounds, Wicker, Ernst,  Blackburn, Tillis, Cramer, Cotton, Sullivan, McSally, all members of  the Senate Armed Services Committee.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senators ask the following question of the  counsel for the President:         Mr. Cipollone, as Members of the Senate Armed Committee, we       listened intently when Manager Crow was defending one of       Senator Schumer's amendments to the organizing resolution       last week as he explained how he had firsthand experience       being denied military aid when he needed it during his       service. As you know, David Hale, Under Secretary of State       for Political Affairs, confirmed that the lethal aid provided       to Ukraine last year was future aid. Which would you say had       the greater military impact: President Trump's temporary       pause of 48 days on future aid that will now be delivered to       Ukraine, or President Obama's steadfast refusal to provide       lethal aid to Ukraine for 3 years--more than 1,000 days--      while Ukraine attempted to hold back Russia's invasion and       preserve its sovereignty?    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice. Thank you, Senators for that  question.   I think it was far more serious and far more jeopardy for the  Ukrainians the decision of the Obama administration to not use the  authority that was given by Congress--that many of you all, many  Members of the House of Representatives voted for--giving the U.S.  Government the authority to provide lethal aid to the Ukrainians, and  the Obama administration decided not to provide that aid.   And multiple witnesses who were called in the House by the House  Democrats testified that United States policy toward Ukraine got  stronger under the Trump administration, in part, largely, because of  that lethal aid.   Ambassador Yovanovitch, Ambassador Volker, others also testified that  U.S. policy providing that aid was greater support for Ukraine than was  provided in the Obama administration, particularly the provision of  Javelin anti-tank missiles, which they explained were lethal and would  kill Russian tanks and change the calculus for aggression from the  Russians in the Donbas region in the eastern portion of Ukraine where  that conflict was still ongoing.   In terms of the pause, the temporary pause on aid here, the testimony  in the record--put aside what the House managers have said about their  speculation and they know what it is like to be denied aid--the  testimony in the record is that this temporary pause was not  significant.   And as for Volker, Ambassador Volker testified that the brief pause  on releasing the aid was ``not significant.''   And Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs David Hale  explained that this is ``future assistance, not to keep the Army going  now.''   So, in other words, this isn't money that had to flow every month in  order to fund current purchases or something like that. It was money-- it is 5-year money. Once it is obligated, it is there for 5 years, and  it usually takes quite a bit of time to spend all of it.   So the idea, somehow, that during the couple of months in July,  August, and up until September 11--55 or 48 days, depending upon how  you count it--that this was somehow denying critical assistance to the  Ukrainians on the frontlines right then is simply not true.   And now the House managers have tried to pivot away from that because  they know it is not true. They say: No, it was a signal to the  Russians. It was a signal of lack of support that the Russians would  pick up on. But here again, it is critical, even the Ukrainians didn't  know that the aid had been paused, and part of the reason was they  never brought it up in any conversations with representatives of the  U.S. Government. And as Ambassador Volker testified, representatives of  the U.S. Government didn't bring it up to them because they didn't want  anyone to know; they didn't want to put out any signal that might be  perceived by the Russians or by the Ukrainians as any sign of lack of  support. It was kept internal to the U.S. Government.   They pointed to some emails that someone at the Department of Defense  or Department of State, Laura Cooper, received from unnamed Embassy  staffers suggesting that there was a question about the aid, but her  testimony was that she couldn't even remember what the question really  was, and she didn't want to speculate.   There is not evidence that any decision makers in the Ukraine  Government knew about the pause.   And just the other day, another article came out--I believe it was  from, at the time, the Foreign Minister Danylyuk--explaining that when  the POLITICO article was published on August 28, there was panic in  Kyiv because it was the first time they realized there was any pause on  the aid. So that was not something that was providing any signal either  to the Ukrainians or the Russians because it wasn't known. It was 2  weeks later, after it became public, that the aid was released.   The testimony in the record is that the pause was not significant; it  was future money, not for current purchases; and it was released before  the end of the fiscal year.   They point out that some of it wasn't out the door by the end of the  fiscal year. That happens every year. There is some percentage that  doesn't make it out the door by the end of the year.   Again, it is 5-year money. It is not like it is all going to be spent  in the next 30, 60, 90 days anyway. So the fact that there was a little  fix--Congress passed a fix to allow that $35 million to be spent;  something similar happens for some amount almost every year; and it was  not affecting current purchases--it wasn't jeopardizing anything at the  frontlines. There is no evidence about that in the record. The evidence  is to the contrary.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Maine is recognized.
