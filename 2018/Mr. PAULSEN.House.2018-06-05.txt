 Mr. Speaker, 5.7 million Americans cope with Alzheimer's  every day. Every 65 seconds, another American contracts the disease. It  is the sixth leading cause of death in our country, and two-thirds of  its victim are women.   Alzheimer's is a very progressive disease where dementia symptoms  gradually worsen over a number of years.   We don't yet have a cure for Alzheimer's, but we're helping provide  the resources now to find that cure. The recent budget that we just  passed includes a $414 million increase in funding for research into  Alzheimer's, for a total of $1.8 billion.   I am also proud to be a cosponsor of the BOLD Infrastructure for  Alzheimer's Act, a bipartisan bill which dedicates new resources to the  fight against Alzheimer's, because it is time, Mr. Speaker, we put an  end to a disease that is costing Americans $277 billion every year.                            ____________________
