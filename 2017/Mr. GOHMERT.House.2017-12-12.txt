 Mr. Speaker, I do appreciate the concerns of my friends  here in Congress because this is just incredible.   You know, many of us have read, understood what happened during  Watergate, and we thought surely there have been enough things put in  as checks to prevent an administration from totally co-oping the  Department of Justice. No one President should be able to have an  administration that is powerful enough that it could be a self- sustaining party where all of the powers, whether it is the IRS that  has people in key places that prevent people from guilt giving, for  example, proper tax status to opponents of an administration so that  they stand a better chance of being defeated in running for a second  election.   It happened in the Obama administration. And to the great  embarrassment or what should be embarrassment of the Obama  administration, of the IRS, and of the United States Congress, nothing  was done. It appears crimes were committed. Nothing was done.   We are just aghast.   How could this happen?   Surely the DOJ would jump into the IRS and correct this and stop this  so that the IRS could not be weaponized as a political tool. I mean,  Nixon may have dreamed of that at some point, but we are not aware of  it.   I mean, it is just hard to believe that anybody would anticipate  using the powers of government in such a flagrant form as we are  finding out almost every day now. New allegations, not just--not  allegations; new facts show that corruption and political animus and  anything but justice was being conducted for a number of years in the  Department of Justice.   You know, as an assistant district attorney in east Texas, as a judge  getting to know and hearing so many different Federal agents testify,  most people felt like, gosh, if the FBI comes in, these are the guys in  the white hats. But much of America has seen what can only be styled as  real corruption that has turned those white hats into a stinking brown  for some of the top people.   We heard Christopher Wray, the FBI Director, saying: You know, I  think of the FBI and I think about these thousands of great Federal  agents across the country who care about their country and protecting  people's lives and protecting the law.   Well, yeah, I think about that, too, until my mind comes back here to  Washington, and not just a swamp, but areas that have become a  cesspool. It is unbelievable to think--I mean, I saw ``All the  President's Men'' the other night about Watergate and Deep Throat. And  as I watched, oh, my gosh, you mean somebody in the White House may  have had contact with somebody that may have had funds that could be  used?   I mean, you look at what is coming out in the news every day and it  makes that look like Keystone Cops--nothing compared to the extent that  this administration used the Justice Department.  [[Page H9835]]    And going back to the IRS, what did Rosenstein or all these other  great Justice Department officials do for us in cleaning up the mess at  the IRS?   Nothing, nothing, nothing.   What did Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch do to clean things up?   Well, they just kept dumping more and more dirt in that washing  machine.   Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, then you find that a  reporter sees the husband of someone being investigated in a  clandestine meeting, in an area they thought nobody would notice.   And what do they want to do at the Justice Department?   We find out they want to go after that reporter. They want to go  after that reporter because this reporter actually was reporting some  things that might help get some things cleaned up.   They say: We don't want things cleaned up. We want to keep our little  cesspool tight and friendly, where we know all the players and all the  swamp rats.   We have got to have a massive clean out of what has been happening,  but it is not happening.                                time  1800    Then we find out, gee, there was this investigation regarding Russia  trying to violate the law, pay bribes, pay payoffs, anything they could  do to corner the market on uranium and get United States uranium in  their own control. And, gee, who ends up having their fingerprints on  that? A guy named Rosenstein.   In fact, then you see one of the people involved in the investigation  of corruption and uranium and payoffs, well, there is Rod Rosenstein's  name. Now, he has an assistant sign for him asking the judge to seal  the records so we can't know exactly what all was done by the FBI.   It is kind of like we find out there is someone, the undercover agent  that the FBI was using, that the Justice Department was using, and they  get an agreement, a nondisclosure agreement. I mean, the only reason I  can think of they would want a nondisclosure agreement at the FBI is so  that the informant wouldn't turn around and talk about how dirty they  have been. I mean, why would they get a nondisclosure agreement?   I might expect the guy who was the informant demanding a  nondisclosure agreement from the FBI and from the Justice Department:  You can't talk about what all I did; you can't talk about the things I  did because the people I was working undercover for you on, they might  try to kill me, so I demand a nondisclosure agreement from the Justice  Department, from the FBI, so you won't disclose things that will get me  killed.   But, no, that is not what happened. Under the Obama administration,  Loretta Lynch ``Injustice Department,'' we have a nondisclosure  agreement that the person who risked his life couldn't disclose what  was going on. Sounds like somebody, to me, at the FBI and the Justice  Department had a pretty dirty conscience and they didn't want to be  outed. And at every turn: Oh, well, that was sealed. Oh, well, that is  a nondisclosure agreement. Oh, you can't have access to that.   The FBI and the Justice Department and people that we have been  questioning have really kind of gotten themselves in a position where  they are above the law. They are above Congress. And in this country,  the branch that the Founders thought would have the least control  ever--that was the judiciary; they are small; they don't really have  any power--they are legislating and running the executive branch from  under their robes.   At the same time, you have got the executive branch and the  Department of Justice that has become a new playground for people who  want to write like Kafka, ginning up charges, knocking down doors in  the wee hours of the morning: Oh, were they a threat?   Well, no, not really, but we just need to intimidate them. It is what  we do in the Justice Department nowadays. We are the Department of  intimidation.   I am telling you, Mr. Speaker, there has got to be a material change.  There has got to be. There are too many people currently in the Justice  Department and the top of the FBI--not these fine young agents across  the country who have given everything they had, even though Mueller  removed their ability to have wise counsel because he got rid of the  long-toothed people that had the experience and the wisdom to know how  to bring these agents along. He purged the training materials so FBI  agents could not know how to discern if somebody had been radicalized.   There is just so much, that almost needs to start from scratch; and  we are having to deal with the players like Rosenstein who have been in  that system as they were part of the process while it was corroding  and, really, infecting.   I thank my friends for caring enough about what is going on to stand  up and raise Cain. But, like I said, you know, just when you think,  well, that has got to be the final shoe dropping, then we have this  story that the wife of the demoted DOJ official actually worked for the  firm that put together, was behind, the anti-Trump dossier that we  believe may very likely have been used in order to surveil the Trump  campaign, in order to use the DOJ, working in collusion with not only  Russia, but also the Hillary Clinton campaign, in order to elect a  candidate who had no chance otherwise.   Well, a funny thing happened on the way to using the DOJ and Fusion  GPS and the Russians in order to get Hillary Clinton elected--she  didn't get elected. But that certainly doesn't owe anything to Nellie  Ohr or Bruce Ohr or these people who have been occupying the Department  of Justice as it tainted and turned from, what Christopher Wray says,  an F that stood for ``fidelity'' to, now, an I that stands for  ``infidelity.''   Let's get back to fidelity in the Justice Department. Let's get back  to an incorruptible Justice Department. I am hoping and praying we are  heading that direction, but I am just not seeing it yet.
