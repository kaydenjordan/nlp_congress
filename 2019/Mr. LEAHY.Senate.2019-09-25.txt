 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today the Senate is going to be voting on  the motion to instruct conferees for the National Defense Authorization  Act to backfill the military construction money the President stole  from our troops to pay for his wall--a wall that he gave his word  Mexico would pay for.   This is very, very troublesome. I say this as both dean of the Senate  and as President pro tempore emeritus. In that role, I have arguably  supported and voted for more funding for our military and their  families than any Senator--Republican or Democrat--in this Chamber, but  on this one, I will urge a ``no'' vote.   As Members of the Senate--there are only 100 of us to represent 350  million Americans--we have a profound responsibility to support those  who sacrifice everything for our country. We should not let this be a  partisan issue. As I said, I voted for more funding for our troops than  any Member of this body. From the soldier we have sent across the globe  to the military family left at home, we--all 100 of us--have a  responsibility to these men and women, regardless of our politics and  our ideology. It is that responsibility that has drawn me to the Senate  floor today. I cannot and will not support this motion.   There is $6.1 billion. Let me say that again. There is $6.1 billion-- that is $2.5 billion from the Department of Defense and $3.6 billion  from military construction projects--that President Trump has stolen  from the men and women of our military in fiscal year 2019 alone, just  that one year, to pay for his ineffective, vanity wall--a wall that he  boasted to the press last week was the ``Rolls-Royce'' of walls.   But just like every Rolls-Royce in the middle of the desert, Trump's  wall is nothing more than outrageously expensive and completely  useless. Experts agree that a wall will do nothing to address the  humanitarian crisis along our southern border.   Families fleeing violence in their home countries--fleeing murder,  rape, and other crimes--are openly turning themselves over to Border  Patrol officials. They are not trying to sneak across the border. It is  a lot different than absconding across the border in the middle of the  night.   What has $6.1 billion in stolen funds purchased for the American  taxpayers?   Here is the money that was taken away from our military: Children  continuing to go to a middle school in Kentucky every day that Pentagon  officials have described as ``deficient, inadequate, and undersized''-- we took money from that to pay for the wall. Buildings that do not meet  the military standards for fire safety or management of explosives,  putting American lives at risk--we took money from correcting that to  pay for the wall. And there are numerous cases of infrastructure  problems that are detrimental to our military's readiness and DOD's  national security mission. That is not even mentioning the military  housing with mold issues, inadequate daycare facilities for the  children of military families, and all the 127 military construction  projects President Trump canceled--not delayed but canceled--to pay for  his Rolls-Royce of a wall in the middle of the desert.   The $6.1 billion for a Rolls-Royce in the middle of the desert is an  even heavier burden for our military families to bear. Outrage does not  even begin to describe how I feel about President Trump's actions.   Today, we are being asked to somehow cover up his theft, cover up the  fact that he broke his word about Mexico, and cover up the fact that  this is a vanity project. We are being asked to give our constitutional  blessing to President Trump's contorting the law beyond recognition.   I believe that the Senate is the conscience of the Nation. Contorting  the law to undo congressional funding decisions by fiat is not  following our conscience, and I will not stand for that.   We are being asked to take the first step to approve $3.6 billion in  emergency spending to replace part of what the President stole. Let's  make another thing clear. This spending is on top of the discretionary  caps agreed to by Congress and the President. So we are being asked to  finance this coverup on our children and grandchildren through deficit  spending.   I would say this to the President: I believe you said that Mexico was  going to pay for your wall, not our troops, not their families, and not  future generations of American citizens.   If this were not troubling enough, last week, the press reported in  the Washington Post that the Trump administration does not even intend  to use this funding to replace what they stole. ``The plan is to sell  it as replenishment money for the Defense Department for the $3.6  billion they took this year,'' said one administration official.  ``Then, once they got it from Congress, they would take it again.''   What is the saying? Fool Congress once, shame on you. Fool Congress  twice, well, shame on us. Congress got fooled once. Are we just going  to stand by idly and allow Congress to be fooled again?   I have heard a lot of speeches on this floor, and politicians often  wax poetic about their love of our troops. Yet this body--100 Members  of this Senate, the body that should be the conscience of our Nation-- has done nothing to constrain this President's ability to continue to  steal from those troops. We have done little more than shrug at this  abuse of our constitutional authority. We have just looked away from  the egregious treatment of our troops as a little more than a piggy  bank for the President's political pet project. I don't stand for that.  I am not going to support that. I will not abandon our profound  responsibility to support those who sacrifice everything for our  country.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I have been honored to know and work with  many of the leaders in our military. One of the absolute finest I have  known is General Joseph F. Dunford, Jr., the outgoing Chairman of the  Joint Chiefs of Staff. I have known General Dunford for years,  certainly in his current capacity, but before that as Commandant of the  Marine Corps. As the father of a marine, I looked at Joe Dunford as the  best the Corps could have and what we all want from the men and women  serving and leading the Marine Corps.   General Dunford has had a long and distinguished career of service as  a marine. He was deployed during Operation Iraqi Freedom, earned the  nickname ``Fighting Joe'' while serving under James Mattis, and led the  U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan. He is admired by the men and women  who served under him and is known for his respect and care for  civilians caught up in conflict.   Marcelle and I were honored to travel with him to Vermont in 2017,  where he gave the commencement address at St. Michael's College, 40  years after his own graduation at that same institution. He told the  graduates about to step out into their futures, ``have the moral  courage to do what's right, even when it's tough. Commit to serving  something bigger than yourself.'' Like General Dunford, I am a graduate  of St. Michaels, and Marcelle has an honorary degree from St. Michaels.  Also like General Dunford, I did my graduate work at Georgetown.   I mention his background because he is not a man that would ever brag  about all the things he has done. Rather, he speaks to the values that  he believes America should follow. I listened to him, standing in his  uniform, speaking to these young men and women who were graduating. You  could hear a pin drop in the hall, except for the times when they would  interrupt his speech with standing ovations.   He has led by service his entire career. He thought always of the men  and women under his command. He thought of their families. He thought  of our future and the world we would leave to our grandchildren. His  legacy will be measured by his presence on the battlefield, but perhaps  more so by the capable leadership he has brought that will be felt for  generations to come. That is truly the mark of an exceptional and  visionary leader.   General Dunford and his wife Ellyn are looking forward to their  retirement, but I do hope that academic and public institutions will  call on him for his expertise and his knowledge, but especially his  conscience.   I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Washington Post,  entitled ``Joseph Dunford's steady hand in the turmoil of Trump's  Washington,'' by David Ignatius be printed in the Record, as it so  eloquently captures the general's legacy and service to our Nation.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                 [From the Washington Post, Sept. 12, 2019]     Joseph Dunford's Steady Hand in the Turmoil of Trump's Washington                            (By David Ignatius)         Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint       Chiefs of Staff who will retire this month, is that rare       senior official in Donald Trump's Washington whose career and       reputation don't seem to have been tarnished by his dealings       with the president.        The explanation is simple: The low-key, Boston-Irish Marine       maintained the distance and discipline of a professional       military officer. He didn't try to be Trump's friend or       confidant, and he stayed away from palace intrigue. The White       House treated him with respect, and his fellow commanders       came to regard him with something approaching awe: ``We'd all       like to be Joe Dunford,'' says one four-star general.        In the ceaseless turmoil of the Trump administration,       Dunford has been a steady hand who helped insulate national       security policy from disruption and political pressure. His       Pentagon colleagues say he will be keenly missed--several       described him as the best chairman in recent decades--and       they are hoping Gen. Mark Milley, his successor, can sustain       the independence and cool judgment that defined Dunford's       tenure.        Dunford doesn't like talking about his relationship with       the White House. The closest he has come was probably a       Pentagon news briefing last month: ``I've worked very hard to       remain apolitical and not make political judgments. . . . I       work very hard to provide military advice . . . and make sure       that our  [[Page S5701]]       men and women in uniform have the wherewithal to do their       job.''        ``Joe Dunford is a man for all seasons,'' says Jim Mattis,       the former defense secretary and a fellow Marine. ``Joe has a       quiet mind, not easily distracted; he quantifies things, but       he brings in the nonquantifiable. Still waters run deep in       him. You simply can't shake his faith in his fundamental       values.''        Mattis cites two combat anecdotes to explain Dunford's       unflappable style. In March 2003, on the eve of the invasion       of Iraq, Mattis told Dunford that because of a last-minute       change of plans, his regiment had to move out in five hours,       rather than at dawn the next morning. ``He just took it in       stride,'' says Mattis.        A few days later, Dunford's unit had fought its way to the       Tigris River, with the loss of some Marines, and was ready to       seize a strategic bridge. Mattis told him he had to fall back       until conditions were safer for the assault. Dunford obeyed       that painful retreat order without hesitation, Mattis says.        Dunford was born for the job. The son of a Marine who       fought at Chosin Reservoir during the Korean War, he grew up       in Quincy, Mass., a working-class suburb of Boston.       Colleagues say he retained those grounded values throughout a       rapidly rising career.        Gen. Frank McKenzie, head of the Central Command and       another fellow Marine, remembers that Dunford faced a       delicate problem as a young lieutenant colonel on the staff       of the Marine commandant. He had to manage a popular but       misplaced protocol officer. He promptly removed the officer,       to the consternation of some politically powerful friends.        Dunford's dream was probably to become Marine commandant       himself, and after he was appointed to that position in 2014,       friends say he assumed it was his last military post. When       President Barack Obama nominated him chairman in 2015, ``he       took the job with a Catholic sense of guilt'' to do his duty,       says one friend.        On Dunford's desk as chairman, he placed the admonition of       a venerated predecessor, Gen. Omar Bradley, who cautioned his       staff that they didn't have the ``luxury'' of focusing on       just one theater but needed to think globally. Dunford has       prodded the different services and combatant commands to do       just that--move toward integrated global strategy, rather       than separate fiefdoms.        Dunford built a powerful joint staff to coordinate policy,       directed by strong officers such as McKenzie and Adm. Michael       Gilday, the new chief of naval operations. The joint staff's       importance grew as the interagency process of the National       Security Council decayed. Some grouse that the joint staff is       now too powerful, but it helped fill a dangerous vacuum.        In dealing with Trump, Dunford's friends say his model was       Gen. George C. Marshall, the celebrated wartime chief of       staff to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Marshall didn't try       to be FDR's pal, or laugh at his jokes, or join his social       gatherings. Marshall simply did his job.        One four-star general recalls that Trump would sometimes       ask Dunford whether he liked a particular policy option.       ``I'm not in love with any of them,'' Dunford would answer.       ``My job is to give you choices.''        It's Dunford's legacy that in a time of national tumult and       division, the military seems to have remained steady as a       rock.
