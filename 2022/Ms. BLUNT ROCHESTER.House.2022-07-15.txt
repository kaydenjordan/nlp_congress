 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Ensuring  Women's Right to Reproductive Freedom Act. In the wake of the  overturning of Roe v. Wade, this legislation is necessary to ensure  that those in States that have restricted abortion care can travel  across State lines to seek the care they need and not be criminalized  for doing so.   I am proud that women in my home State of Delaware still have access  to abortion care and that we can serve as a safe haven for those from  other States.   But the reality for far too many people across the country is that  they live in States where access to reproductive care has been so  severely restricted that it is unavailable. While the bills we are  voting on today are necessary, we must also confront the realities of  what overturning Roe means.   Now, my middle name is Blunt, so let me be clear about who is going  to be hit the hardest: poor women, young women, women in rural areas,  and women of color, people who may not have the ability to travel  hundreds of miles to get the care they need.   Madam Speaker, I was 10 years old when the landmark case of Roe was  decided. Half a century later, I am standing on the floor of the House  of Representatives, standing in the gap for doctors and healthcare  providers, so that they don't have to consult with a lawyer before they  decide to give good care to their patients, standing for those who  stood before us and fought for us to have this right for reproductive  rights in the first place. I am standing for our young people so that  our daughters and granddaughters don't need a health passport to travel  from State to State or need to worry about being criminalized for  seeking care.   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members of the House to support both the  Ensuring Women's Right to Reproductive Freedom Act and the Women's  Health Protection Act. The bottom line: There is no room for  politicians in our wombs.
