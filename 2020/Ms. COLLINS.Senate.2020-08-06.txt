 Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from  Michigan, Senator Peters, in introducing legislation to expand Medicare  beneficiaries' access to Medical Nutrition Therapy, or MNT, which is a  cost-effective component of treatment for obesity, diabetes,  hypertension, dyslipidemia, and other chronic conditions. At a time  when we are seeing many diet-related chronic conditions contribute to  poor COVID-19 outcomes, increasing access to MNT should be part of the  strategy to improve disease management and prevention for America's  seniors. Our legislation, the Medical Nutrition Therapy Act of 2020,  would make two important changes to support patients, improve health  outcomes, and reduce unnecessary healthcare costs.   First, it would expand Medicare Part B coverage of outpatient medical  nutrition therapy services to a number of currently uncovered diseases  or conditions--including prediabetes, obesity, high blood pressure,  high cholesterol, malnutrition, eating disorders, cancer, celiac  disease, and HIV/AIDS. Currently, Medicare Part B only covers  outpatient MNT for diabetes, renal disease, and post-kidney transplant.  Second, the bill would allow more types of providers--including nurse  practitioners, physician assistants, clinical nurse specialists, and  psychologists--to refer patients to MNT. This is especially critical  for a rural State like Maine, where a NP or PA may be one's trusted  primary care provider.   MNT counseling is provided by registered dietitian nutritionists,  RDNs, as part of a collaborative healthcare team. It is evidenced-based  and proven to positively impact weight, blood pressure, blood lipids,  and blood sugar control, and nutritional counseling by RDNs is even  recommended by the National Lipid Association to promote long-term  adherence to an individualized, heart-healthy diet. Through MNT,  individuals benefit from in-depth individualized nutrition assessments  and trusted followup visits for the repeated reinforcement necessary to  aid with behavior and lifestyle changes.   Seniors deserve improved access to this cost-effective medical  treatment, but many older adults are missing out under the current  Medicare policy. Marcy Kyle, a RDN from Rockport, ME, shared numerous  stories of patients being denied access to medically necessary MNT that  illustrate why this legislation is needed. In one story, a patient with  prediabetes was referred by his primary care physician for MNT at age  64. At that time, his private insurance covered the service and he  booked the first available appointment the following week. But this  patient turned 65 that week and transitioned onto Medicare. You can  imagine his surprise upon arriving for his appointment that MNT would  not be covered. While the outpatient facility changed its process after  this case in order to prevent similar situations, it demonstrates how  the current restrictions are detrimental for older adults at a critical  juncture in their health journey.   Another example from Maine was a patient with a new diagnosis of  celiac disease complicated by severe weight loss. His private insurance  covered MNT as celiac disease is a very controllable disease with  proper nutrition. But when transitioning from private insurance to  Medicare, this patient lost his opportunity for MNT. We know that early  treatment with MNT can prevent future and more serious health  complications and chronic conditions in older adults, and conditions  such as prediabetes and celiac disease should be covered.   The health and financial crisis brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic  makes access to MNT even more important. Seniors with diet-related  conditions are suffering more than any other population in terms of the  worst health outcomes, including death. Data from the Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services, CMS, in June confirmed elevated risk for  seniors with underlying health conditions. Among those hospitalized  with COVID-19, 79 percent of patients had hypertension, 60 percent had  hyperlipidemia, 50 percent of patients either presented with chronic  kidney disease or diabetes. Tragically, of those hospitalized, 28  percent were never able to leave the hospital because they passed away.   In addition to the significant health impacts, the economic impact of  chronic diseases is staggering. According to the U.S. Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention, 90 percent of the $3.5 trillion the  United States spends annually on health care goes to the treatment of  people with chronic diseases and mental health conditions. Preventing  chronic diseases, or managing symptoms when prevention is not possible,  is one way to reduce these costs. This is particularly important for  the Medicare Program as more than two-thirds of seniors on Medicare  live with multiple chronic conditions. As one registered dietition  nutritionist in Maine told me, ``We all know a dollar spent on  prevention saves many health care dollars in the long run and is the  right thing to do for our seniors at a time when they have limited  budgets.''   The Medical Nutrition Therapy Act of 2020 is supported by more than  30 national organizations, including the Academy of Nutrition and  Dietetics, the American Diabetes Association, the Endocrine Society,  the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, and the National  Kidney Foundation.   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation to improve  access to cost-effective medical treatment for Medicare patients with  chronic diseases.                                  ______                                         By Ms. SMITH:   S. 4466.
