 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I want to thank the gentleman from Florida, not just for yielding the  time, but for his friendship over these 10 years that I have had the  honor of serving here.   Mr. Speaker, he may not remember because he is just the kind of man  that he is, but when I was assigned to the Rules Committee back in  2011, there were four Democrats on the Rules Committee and four  freshman Republicans on Rules Committee. And Mr. Hastings came over to  the four of us who were sitting on the Republican side of the aisle,  introduced himself, and offered his advice and his counsel. He told us  we were in for quite a treat, being on the Rules Committee, and he, of  course, was absolutely right about that.   I have made a lot of bad decisions in Congress, and I have made a lot  of good decisions in Congress. Accepting Mr. Hastings' hand of  friendship early on in this tenure and having been the beneficiary of  his mentorship over these 10 years in Congress has been one of the best  decisions that I have made. I am grateful to him for doing that.   Mr. Speaker, we have six bills wrapped up in this rule today. I have  the 30 minutes that the gentleman from Florida yielded me. That gives  me 5 minutes to talk about racial justice, 5 minutes to talk about  adding a new State to the Union, 5 minutes to talk about reassigning a  half a trillion dollars in healthcare spending from one pot to another,  and on and on.   We are not going to be able to have that conversation today, and I  understand that, because this is our first day back in the month of  June. This is the first voting day the United States Congress has had  in the month of June. So, we have a lot of things to do.   By separating these bills up into different rules, the Members all  know that means having to come back down here for another round of  votes. So I don't fault the Rules Committee, as I sometimes might, for  stuffing so many things into this provision.   But I will say, Mr. Speaker, that I am surprised that we are back, in  all the crises and concerns that the gentleman from Florida reflected  on, for our first voting day in June. The bills we have before us are  bills that, if they moved through committee at all, moved through with  absolutely no Republican amendments accepted, and then the Rules  Committee made absolutely no Republican amendments even available for  consideration here on the floor.   The crises the gentleman from Florida recognized are real. The  solutions to those crises are generally found in partnership and  consensus, and we find none of that in the underlying rule today.   For that reason, I am going to ask my colleagues to defeat the rule.  It is not a reflection on the merits of the underlying issues. The  merits of the issues are real. But the opportunity to solve those  issues comes with passing legislation, not just in the House, but also  through the Senate, having the President's signature put on that, or  overriding a veto here in the House.   We don't have the process that allows us to build that consensus  before us today. It is a shame because I know how hard all of my  colleagues have been working remotely on legislation over these past  weeks. I would have expected partnership and consensus bills to be the  order of business today, instead of the take-it-or-leave-it bills we  have before us.   Mr. Speaker, I mentioned that there are six bills before us. That  half-a-trillion-dollar healthcare bill I mentioned is actually a  compilation of 24 separate bills that have all been rolled together  into one.   We are not going to put these bills on the President's desk. We are  not going to have these bills considered in the Senate. We will most  certainly pass these bills out of the House today. All of us who ran  seeking solutions, as opposed to seeking statements, are going to be  disappointed by this process.   Mr. Speaker, my friend from Florida talked about things that were  worthy of this institution. I recognize the efforts that have gone into  crafting this legislation. From the Delegate from the District of  Columbia, Eleanor Holmes Norton, and the work she has done on D.C.  statehood over the years, to the leadership of Karen Bass and the  Congressional Black Caucus on putting together a criminal justice  police reform bill, the effort that has gone into here is unquestioned.  It has been done with all the best of intentions.   It is the partnership that has been lacking, and it is my great  hope--because I know what we do today is not going to be the end of any  of these processes; it is only going to be the beginning. We cannot  reach the President's desk and a signature and the law of the land that  we all seek by ignoring one another. We can only do it by engaging one  another.   I do believe that this process is not worthy of the institution  because, by definition, it leaves out hundreds of Members and millions  of Americans who want to participate in this.   I am encouraged, as we talked through this in the Rules Committee,  certainly, as we talked about our differences, we learned a whole lot  about things that we have in common, not just on criminal justice  reform, not just on D.C. statehood, not just on healthcare, but across  the board, places where we can come together and make a difference for  those constituents that we serve.   I tell my colleagues, please vote ``no'' on the rule today because we  have a chance to go back and do these in partnership right now. But  should these bills pass the House today, we will still have a  partnership opportunity coming forward.   I hope that folks will not harden their positions today, having gone  through a partisan beginning. We all seek successful conclusions. Those  will only be done together.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Burgess), who serves on the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Arizona (Mrs. Lesko), a Rules Committee member and a distinguished  leader on the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko).    Madam Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I  will amend the rule to provide for consideration of H. Res. 1023, a  resolution by Mr. Steube.   Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Jordan), the ranking member and one of the great advocates on our side  of the aisle.                                time  1100     Madam Speaker, I would say to my friend from Florida, I  don't believe we have any further speakers coming to the floor, so I  will reserve the balance of my time and wait to close.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, while I don't always agree with what my  friend from Maryland has to say, I do agree with my friend from Florida  about his scholarly expertise. We don't talk about the Ninth and Tenth  Amendments enough down here on the floor of the House. I suspect this  will be the only time in the second quarter that we mention the Ninth  and Tenth Amendments, and I am grateful to my friend for his words.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close if there are no  further speakers remaining.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining  on both sides.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 6 minutes.   Madam Speaker, I told you at the beginning all of the things that  this rule did not include. It did not include partnership at the  committee level or any Republican input whatsoever. It did not include  any partnership in the Rules Committee, or any Republican amendments  made in order.   We have got as many bills as I have ever seen jammed into a single  rule, and, again, not done in any way that creates any consensus, that  provides any opportunity for being able to move a bill to the Senate  and on to the President's desk.   That is disappointing, because as I have heard from colleagues on  both sides of the aisle, the American people want action on all of  these issues, and we are not going to be able to provide that in this  way. That is what is not in here.    But, Madam Speaker, it is particularly important to me that we find  you in the chair today, as my friend from Florida recognized. What this  might be is one of those moments we look back on as when something got  started.   You don't ever know how things get started. You know how they finish,  but it is sometimes hard to understand how they got started.   I am absolutely certain that the bill we have before us today isn't  going to the President's desk on police reform, I absolutely am, as are  my Democratic colleagues.   One of my friends on the Judiciary Committee, Sheila Jackson Lee, was  quoted in the Hill today saying:         Ultimately there will probably be a conference, but I don't       want to take any issue with Democrats saying, You know we       have the stronger bill.    Of course, that is true. Folks have the opportunity to start the  process where they want to start the process.   The House majority whip, James Clyburn, went on to state further:         A cleaner road to compromise would have been to have the       Senate negotiators smooth out the wrinkles between Senator       Scott's bill and the one championed by Democrats Corey Booker       and Kamala Harris. It could very well have been that they       could have come to some kind of a compromise that will fly in       the House. Why worry about going to conference between the       two bodies if you can work it out together.    Well, of course that is true. The gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.  Clyburn) has been a successful legislator on this floor for decades.  You work it out together, you find that consensus, you find that  compromise.   It is not lost on me that my Democratic friends in the House have  come today to say, ``Please accept this police reform bill, even though  you have gotten no Republican amendments whatsoever.''   My friend from Florida asked us not to make the perfect the enemy of  the good in that way. I understand those words.   But my friend from South Carolina, Tim Scott, offered the very same  proposal to Senate Democrats. In fact, he offered them 20 amendments to  his bill, and the Democratic leadership in the Senate said, ``No, that  is not good enough. We are going to walk away.''   Well, 20 amendments aren't good enough. Certainly, no amendments  aren't good enough. It frustrates me, because we all know we want to  move forward.   My friend from Florida recognized yesterday, Madam Speaker, that he  is the oldest member of the Rules Committee. I won't name names here-- 83--but he is the eldest member of the Rules Committee. I think I am  the youngest member of the Rules Committee.   I don't believe the gentleman from Florida has spent one second  thinking about what this bill will mean to him in his life. I think he  has spent all this time thinking about what the bill that you have  championed is going to mean to that child born in a Washington area  hospital today and what will it mean to him or her in their life.   I was born 2 years after Martin Luther King was murdered. His work  and his impact on the country I was the beneficiary of, but I was not  around during that. I know that is where folks' hearts and minds are  focused.   While I am certain this bill is not starting the way I would have  wanted it to start, I am hopeful that I am going to look back one day  and say, Karen Bass and Alcee Hastings and I were on the floor of the  House on that very first day that legislation was moving across the  House floor that made this difference in the country that 330 million  Americans want to see made.   I don't have to like the way that it starts. I like even less that it  hasn't started already.   All the comments you will hear today from our side of the aisle are  based not on an opposition to our goals, but a great hope that we will  get to our goals faster.   Madam Speaker, I urge defeat of the previous question and defeat of  the rule, for an opportunity for partnership, and I yield the balance  of my time to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings).    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted  to insert the text of the amendment I would have offered had the House  rejected the previous question on House Resolution 1017, along with  extraneous material, into the Congressional Record immediately prior to  the vote on ordering the previous question on House Resolution 1017.
