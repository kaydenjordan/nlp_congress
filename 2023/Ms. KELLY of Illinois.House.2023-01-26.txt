 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  and legacy of Larry Rogers, Sr.   Larry was a loving father and grandfather and a devoted Chicago  sports fan, but he was known to many for changing their lives in the  courtroom.   Larry was a native of the Roseland community in Chicago and came to  the practice of law while he was working three jobs to support his  family. There were very few other Black attorneys at the time, and  Larry Rogers, Sr., helped pave the way for more lawyers who looked like  him.   As a lawyer, Larry fought for the little guy. He won hundreds of  millions of dollars for victims of corporate malfeasance and medical  malpractice. One of his most notable accomplishments was winning an  eight-figure verdict for victims of chloride-deficient baby formula  even after the Department of Justice declined to press charges.   He lived a life devoted to giving the powerless a chance to take on  the most powerful. Larry Rogers, Sr., leaves behind a legacy that all  of Illinois can be proud of. It was an honor to know him.                            ____________________
