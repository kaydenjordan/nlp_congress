 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 1665) to direct the National Science Foundation to  support STEM education research focused on early childhood.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1665         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Building Blocks of STEM       Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The National Science Foundation is a large investor in       STEM education and plays a key role in setting research and       policy agendas.        (2) While studies have found that children who engage in       scientific activities from an early age develop positive       attitudes toward science and are more likely to pursue STEM       expertise and careers later on, the majority of current       research focuses on increasing STEM opportunities for middle       school-aged children and older.        (3) Women remain widely underrepresented in the STEM       workforce, and this gender disparity extends down through all       levels of education.       SEC. 3. SUPPORTING EARLY CHILDHOOD STEM EDUCATION RESEARCH.         In awarding grants under the Discovery Research PreK-12       program, the Director of the National Science Foundation       shall consider the age distribution of a STEM education       research and development project to  [[Page H7167]]       improve the focus of research and development on early       childhood education.       SEC. 4. SUPPORTING FEMALE STUDENTS IN PREKINDERGARTEN THROUGH                     ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN STEM EDUCATION.         Section 305(d) of the American Innovation and       Competitiveness Act (42 U.S.C. 1862s-5(d)) is amended by       adding at the end the following:        ``(3) Research.--As a component of improving participation       of women in STEM fields, research funded by a grant under       this subsection may include research on--        ``(A) the role of teacher training and professional       development, including effective incentive structures to       encourage teachers to participate in such training and       professional development, in encouraging or discouraging       female students in prekindergarten through elementary school       from participating in STEM activities;        ``(B) the role of teachers in shaping perceptions of STEM       in female students in prekindergarten through elementary       school and discouraging such students from participating in       STEM activities;        ``(C) the role of other facets of the learning environment       on the willingness of female students in prekindergarten       through elementary school to participate in STEM activities,       including learning materials and textbooks, classroom       decorations, seating arrangements, use of media and       technology, classroom culture, and gender composition of       students during group work;        ``(D) the role of parents and other caregivers in       encouraging or discouraging female students in       prekindergarten through elementary school from participating       in STEM activities;        ``(E) the types of STEM activities that encourage greater       participation by female students in prekindergarten through       elementary school;        ``(F) the role of mentorship and best practices in finding       and utilizing mentors;        ``(G) the role of informal and out-of-school STEM learning       opportunities on the perception of and participation in STEM       activities of female students in prekindergarten through       elementary school; and        ``(H) any other area the Director determines will carry out       the goal described in paragraph (1).''.       SEC. 5. SUPPORTING FEMALE STUDENTS IN PREKINDERGARTEN THROUGH                     ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN COMPUTER SCIENCE                     EDUCATION.         Section 310(b) of the American Innovation and       Competitiveness Act (42 U.S.C. 1862s-7(b)) is amended by       adding at the end the following:        ``(3) Uses of funds.--The tools and models described in       paragraph (2)(C) may include--        ``(A) offering training and professional development       programs, including summer or academic year institutes or       workshops, designed to strengthen the capabilities of       prekindergarten and elementary school teachers and to       familiarize such teachers with the role of gender bias in the       classroom;        ``(B) offering innovative pre-service and in-service       programs that instruct teachers on gender-inclusive practices       for teaching computing concepts;        ``(C) developing distance learning programs for teachers or       students, including developing curricular materials, play-      based computing activities, and other resources for the in-      service professional development of teachers that are made       available to teachers through the Internet;        ``(D) developing or adapting prekindergarten and elementary       school computer science curricular materials that incorporate       contemporary research on the science of learning,       particularly with respect to gender inclusion;        ``(E) developing and offering gender-inclusive computer       science enrichment programs for students, including after-      school and summer programs;        ``(F) providing mentors for female students in       prekindergarten through elementary school in person and       through the Internet to support such students in       participating in computer science activities;        ``(G) engaging female students in prekindergarten through       elementary school and their guardians about the difficulties       faced by such students to maintain an interest in       participating in computer science activities;        ``(H) acquainting female students in prekindergarten       through elementary school with careers in computer science       and encouraging such students to consider careers in such       field;        ``(I) developing tools to evaluate activities conducted       under this subsection; and        ``(J) any other tools or models the Director determines       will accomplish the aim described in paragraph (2)(C).''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous materials on H.R. 1665, the bill now  under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 1665, the Building Blocks  of STEM Act.   Employment in computer and information technology jobs is projected  to grow faster than any other occupation between the years of 2016 and  2026.   Despite the opportunity for good, high-paying jobs when they  graduate, women earned only 19 percent of undergraduate computer  science degrees in 2016.   Disturbingly, the ratio of women to men earning computer science  degrees actually declined between 2006 and 2016.   H.R. 1665 devotes resources to ensure girls in prekindergarten and  elementary school are exposed to STEM activities and encouraged to  pursue STEM studies from a young age, before many are dissuaded or  discouraged from doing so.   The legislation includes a focus on computer science education to  help ensure we will have the talent to fill the jobs of the future.   We must act now to increase the participation of women in STEM, and  it starts with the focus on early childhood education.   Mr. Speaker, I want to commend my colleagues, Representatives Stevens  and Baird, for their leadership in this legislation, and I urge my  colleagues to support it. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Stevens).    Mr. Speaker, I have no more requests for time.  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member and the Members on both sides  of the aisle for their support of this bill. I urge its passage, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 2397) to amend the National Institute of Standards  and Technology Act to make changes to the implementation of the network  for manufacturing innovation, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on H.R. 2397, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 2397, the American Manufacturing Leadership  Act.   I thank Ms. Stevens for her leadership in introducing this bipartisan  bill and for her commitment to developing legislation that will help  strengthen America's manufacturing base.   I also thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who have  worked with us to develop and advance this important legislation.   Back in 2014, I was proud to support the original Revitalize American  Manufacturing Innovation Act that established the Manufacturing USA  program. That bipartisan bill was sponsored by   Tom Reed and  Joe  Kennedy and was signed into law by President Obama.   Since its inception 5 years ago, the Manufacturing USA program has  grown to support 14 manufacturing institutes focused on a variety of  technology areas, ranging from 3D printing to groundbreaking energy- saving manufacturing processes.   H.R. 2397 would ensure the continued success of the Manufacturing USA  program by reauthorizing the program for another 5 years and by  allowing agencies to renew funding for institutes after reviewing the  institutes' progress on clear performance goals.   This bill also strengthens the ability of the institutes to leverage  existing programs all across the Federal Government to improve their  role in regional innovation, education and training, defense technology  procurement, and other activities.   Today, manufacturing remains a vital component of our Nation's  economy and national security. H.R. 2397 will help to grow our  manufacturing industry and to bring along with it many good-paying jobs  for our workforce.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Stevens).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy).    Mr. Speaker, I simply urge all Members on both  sides of the aisle to support the bill.  [[Page H7172]]    I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 3153) to direct the Director of the National  Science Foundation to support research on opioid addiction, and for  other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3153         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.         (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Expanding       Findings for Federal Opioid Research and Treatment Act'' or       the ``EFFORT Act''.        (b) Findings.--The Congress finds that--        (1) research gaps currently exist in the prevention and       treatment of opioid addiction;        (2) the National Science Foundation's research on opioid       addiction has increased understanding of the neuroscience of       addiction, substance abuse intervention, the role of illicit       supply networks, the secondary effects on families, the use       of technology to address the opioid epidemic, and options for       alternative, non-addictive therapeutics for pain; and        (3) the National Science Foundation and the National       Institutes of Health have recognized that fundamental       questions in basic, clinical, and translational research       would benefit greatly from multidisciplinary approaches and       collaboration.       SEC. 2. NSF SUPPORT OF RESEARCH ON OPIOID ADDICTION.         The Director of the National Science Foundation, in       consultation with the Director of the National Institutes of       Health, shall support merit-reviewed and competitively       awarded research on the science of opioid addiction.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on H.R. 3153, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 3153, the EFFORT Act.   The effect of the opioid epidemic on communities across our country  is clear. Research from the CDC shows that, on average, 130 Americans  die every day after overdosing on illegal opioids. In 2017,  approximately 1.7 million Americans had a substance abuse disorder  related to opioids. Those statistics are staggering, and the effects of  this problem on our communities is heartbreaking.   While past and ongoing research conducted by the National Science  Foundation has greatly increased our knowledge of opioid addiction,  more work, of course, is needed. The basic research authorized in H.R.  3153 will extend and expand our understanding of opioid addiction and  its impact on our communities and allow us to develop more effective  evidence-based policies to address this epidemic.   I commend my colleagues, Representative Wexton and Representative  Baird, for their leadership on this good, bipartisan legislation and  urge my colleagues to support it, and I reserve the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Virginia (Ms. Wexton).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Stevens).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for  speeches. I would like to close at this time.   Mr. Speaker, I would first like to thank all of the members of this  committee on both sides of the aisle and wish to recommend that we pass  the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 36) to provide for research to better understand  the causes and consequences of sexual harassment affecting individuals  in the scientific, technical, engineering, and mathematics workforce  and to examine policies to reduce the prevalence and negative impact of  such harassment, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 36         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.         (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Combating       Sexual Harassment in Science Act of 2019''.        (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents for this Act       is as follows:  Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents. Sec. 2. Findings. Sec. 3. Definitions. Sec. 4. Research grants. Sec. 5. Data collection. Sec. 6. Responsible conduct guide. Sec. 7. Interagency working group. Sec. 8. National academies assessment. Sec. 9. Authorization of appropriations.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) According to the report issued by the National       Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in 2018       entitled ``Sexual Harassment of Women: Climate, Culture, and       Consequences in Academic Sciences, Engineering, and       Medicine''--        (A) sexual harassment is pervasive in institutions of       higher education;        (B) the most common type of sexual harassment is gender       harassment, which includes verbal and nonverbal behaviors       that convey insulting, hostile, and degrading attitudes about       members of one gender;        (C) 58 percent of individuals in the academic workplace       experience sexual harassment, the second highest rate when       compared to the military, the private sector, and Federal,       State, and local government;        (D) women who are members of racial or ethnic minority       groups are more likely to experience sexual harassment and to       feel unsafe at work than White women, White men, or men who       are members of such groups;        (E) the training for each individual who has a doctor of       philosophy in the science, technology, engineering, and       mathematics fields is estimated to cost approximately       $500,000; and        (F) attrition of an individual so trained results in a loss       of talent and money.        (2) Sexual harassment undermines career advancement for       women.        (3) According to a 2017 University of Illinois study, among       astronomers and planetary scientists, 18 percent of women who       are members of racial or ethnic minority groups and 12       percent of White women skipped professional events because       they did not feel safe attending.        (4) Many women report leaving employment at institutions of       higher education due to sexual harassment.        (5) Research shows the majority of individuals do not       formally report experiences of sexual harassment due to a       justified fear of retaliation or other negative professional       or personal consequences.        (6) Reporting procedures with respect to such harassment       are inconsistent among Federal science agencies and have       varying degrees of accessibility.        (7) There is not adequate communication among Federal       science agencies and between such agencies and grantees       regarding reports of sexual harassment, which has resulted in       harassers receiving Federal funding after moving to a       different institution.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous materials on H.R. 36, the bill that is now  under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 36, the Combating Sexual Harassment  in Science Act.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend, Ranking Member Mr.  Lucas, for joining me in introducing this bill and for his commitment  to expanding access to STEM studies and careers.   This bill is a product of more than a year of activity by the  Science, Space, and Technology Committee. We heard from many experts  about the prevalence of sexual harassment in STEM, what factors have  enabled it, the impact it has on the lives and careers of so many  talented young scientists and engineers, and the loss to our Nation  when they leave research altogether.   We also learned of some best practices for universities, scientific  societies, and Federal agencies to begin to bring transparency and  accountability to this challenge.   Federal science agencies have an important role to play, because they  have the responsibility to ensure that all federally-funded  researchers, including students, are able to carry out their research  in safe environments at all times.   However, agencies need universities to be partners in that area and  effort, and that partnership starts with universities reporting to  their funders when a student or researcher is brave enough to come  forward with an allegation of sexual harassment.   Mr. Speaker, I applaud the National Science Foundation for its bold  leadership in implementing a reporting policy, and NIH and NASA for  their own more recent efforts. Unfortunately, other agencies have been  slow to respond.   H.R. 36 directs the Office of Science and Technology Policy to issue  uniform guidance to all Federal science agencies to implement reporting  requirements for all grantees.   We worked closely with the university community to define the  circumstances that should trigger a report. Not everybody was happy  with the result, but it was a good compromise, and protects the most  vulnerable.   Also, it is important to note that this bill does not interfere with  due process. It simply requires transparency while protecting privacy.   H.R. 36 also supports research to inform updated policies in the  future, it seeks to incentivize culture change at universities, and it  makes clear that sexual harassment should now be considered as  important as research misconduct, as recommended by the National  Academies.   While sexual harassment in science is not a problem that can be  solved with legislation alone, H.R. 36 helps ensure that the Federal  agencies are doing their part. No researcher should be forced to choose  between her passion for science and her right to feel safe.   This legislation has broad support and has been endorsed by 28  scientific and scholarly organizations.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this bipartisan bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for  time.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this bipartisan bill. I thank members  of the full committee for their work on this bill, I recommend passage,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 3196) to designate the Large Synoptic Survey  Telescope as the ``Vera Rubin Survey Telescope'', as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3196         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Vera C. Rubin Observatory       Designation Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Dr. Vera Rubin was born July 23, 1928, to Philip and       Rose Applebaum Cooper.        (2) Dr. Rubin pursued her graduate studies at Cornell       University and Georgetown University, earning her Ph.D. in       Physics in 1954.        (3) Dr. Rubin's Ph.D. thesis on galaxy motions provided       supporting evidence that galaxies are not uniformly       distributed, but exist in clusters.        (4) Dr. Rubin continued to study the motions of galaxies,       first as research associate and assistant professor at       Georgetown University, and then as a member of the staff at       the Carnegie Institution of Washington Department of       Terrestrial Magnetism.        (5) Dr. Rubin faced barriers throughout her career because       of her gender.        (6) For instance, one of the world's leading astronomy       facilities at the time, the Palomar Observatory, did not       permit women. Dr. Rubin persisted and was finally allowed to       observe at Palomar in 1965, the first woman officially       allowed to do so.        (7) In 1970, Dr. Rubin published measurements of the       Andromeda galaxy showing stars and gas orbiting the galaxy's       center too fast to be explained by the amount of mass       associated with the light output of the stars.        (8) In the years that followed, Dr. Rubin and her       collaborators used their observations, in conjunction with       the work by earlier astronomers on the rotation of stars in       spiral galaxies, to provide some of the best evidence for the       existence of dark matter.        (9) This work contributed to a major shift in the       conventional view of the universe, from one dominated by       ordinary matter such as what produces the light of stars, to       one dominated by dark matter.        (10) Dr. Rubin was elected to the National Academy of       Sciences in 1981, the second woman astronomer to be so       honored.        (11) Dr. Rubin was awarded the President's National Medal       of Science in 1993 ``for her pioneering research programs in       observational cosmology which demonstrated that much of the       matter in the universe is dark, and for significant       contributions to the realization that the universe is more       complex and more mysterious than had been imagined''.        (12) Dr. Rubin was an outspoken advocate for the equal       treatment and representation of women in science, and she       served as a mentor, supporter, and role model to many women       astronomers throughout her life.        (13) The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, funded jointly by       the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy,       will honor the legacy of Dr. Rubin and her colleagues to       probe the nature of dark matter by mapping and cataloging       billions of galaxies through space and time.       SEC. 3. DESIGNATION.         The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope shall be known and       designated as the ``Vera C. Rubin Observatory''.       SEC. 4. REFERENCES.         Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper,       or other record of the United States to the facility       described in section 3 shall be deemed to be a reference to       the ``Vera C. Rubin Observatory''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on H.R. 3196, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3196, which, after  today's consideration, will be known as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory  Designation Act.   I thank Representative Gonzalez-Colon for joining me in introducing  this bill.   Dr. Vera Rubin was a trailblazing astronomer, who dedicated her life  to advancing our understanding of the cosmos. She was also a tireless  advocate for women in science, and she was well known for her  mentorship of aspiring women astronomers. Today would have been Dr.  Rubin's 91st birthday, but, sadly, she passed away on Christmas Day in  2016.   During the 1970s, Dr. Rubin published the best set of measurements of  the galaxy rotation to date. Her data revealed something surprising.  The stars orbiting in the outer regions of the galaxies were moving  much faster than expected. Dark matter, first proposed decades prior,  was the only way to explain the observed motion.   Dr. Rubin's work helped to convince the broader astronomy community  of the existence of dark matter and revolutionized the way we  understand the universe. Instead of being dominated by light-emitting  matter, Dr. Rubin's work revealed that most of the universe is made up  of a mysterious and invisible substance called dark matter.   The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, or LSST, is an 8.4-meter  telescope currently under construction in Chile. Funded jointly by the  National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy, LSST will  conduct an unprecedented survey of the night sky. The data collected by  this telescope will enable scientists to build on Dr. Rubin's  pioneering work and probe the nature of dark matter.   Dr. Rubin's exemplary science and her sterling character will drive  scientific discovery and inspire girls and women in STEM for decades to  come. While Dr. Rubin has already claimed a well-deserved place in  history, H.R. 3196 will further elevate her story by designating one of  the world's preeminent research facilities as the Vera C. Rubin  Observatory.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time to close.   Mr. Speaker, I also thank Miss Gonzalez-Colon for cosponsoring this  bill, and I thank the full committee for supporting it. I urge its  passage, and I yield back the balance of my time.   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in  strong support of H.R. 3196, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Designation  Act, of which I am the co-lead alongside Chairwoman Johnson.   Dr. Rubin exemplified perseverance and tenacity in science. As a  woman scientist, she encountered many obstacles during her academic and  professional career. As a student, her application to Princeton  University was denied because, at the time, women were not allowed to  enroll in the astrophysics graduate program of this institution.  Similarly, years later, she had problems accessing the Palomar  Observatory in California, one of the most iconic scientific facilities  in the world, also because she was a woman. Experiences such as these  would be enough to discourage a young student and scientist. Still, Dr.  Rubin persevered, demonstrating exceptional intellectual capabilities  and character.   Dr. Vera Rubin changed the way we understand the universe. Her  groundbreaking work on dark matter and galaxy rotations remain at the  forefront of STEM research in the field of astronomy. Her legacy will  undoubtedly continue to influence future generations of scientists and  will hopefully be memorialized in the new Large Synoptic Survey  Telescope (LSST) Observatory under construction in Chile. I am very  much looking forward to the great work this facility will produce by  researchers, like Dr. Rubin.   I am immensely proud of this bill. Especially to be speaking about it  today, July 23rd, on what would have been Dr. Rubin's 91st birthday.   I believe highlighting the sacrifices and contributions women have  made to the sciences is one of the many ways we can continue to foster  their participation in STEM fields. Like multiple minorities, women  face their own subset of challenges that hinder their decision to  pursue or remain in STEM careers. This has a negative impact on the  development and advancement of women in general, and in our economy by  not capitalizing from the remarkable talent of women in STEM.   I would like to thank Chairwoman Johnson and Ranking Member Lucas for  their leadership and for moving this bill through Committee. As someone  with a STEM background, and as a representative of many young girls and  women who are either pursuing or interested in pursuing a career in  STEM--I look forward to working with my colleagues to get this bill  signed into law. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 34) to ensure consideration of water intensity in  the Department of Energy's energy research, development, and  demonstration programs to help guarantee efficient, reliable, and  sustainable delivery of energy and clean water resources, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on H.R. 34, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 34, the Energy and Water  Research Integration Act of 2019.   I first thank my friend, Mr. Lucas, who joined me in introducing this  legislation, which calls attention to the critical link between energy  and water and instructs the Department of Energy to ensure due  consideration of water issues in its research, development, and  demonstration programs.   As we all know, especially those of us who represent Texas, Oklahoma,  and other southwestern and western States, we have limited water  resources that must be distributed appropriately to our large energy  industries, agricultural communities, and rapidly growing populations.  We have experienced crippling droughts in recent years, so it is vital  that we do as much as possible to use this commodity wisely.   However, not many people are aware of the importance of water to  energy generation and, similarly, the crucial role that energy plays in  delivery of safe, sanitary water to our constituents.   The Energy and Water Research Integration Act encourages research  into energy technologies that would improve and minimize the use of  water and energy production, and also establishes a mechanism for  Federal agencies to work with State and local governments and other  stakeholders to advance our understanding of what is known as the  ``energy-water nexus.'' In addition, the bill requires a regularly  updated strategic plan to guide these efforts. These are important,  positive steps towards using our limited resources in the most  efficient and effective way possible.   I am pleased that these issues have already received serious  attention so far this Congress, with the committee hosting a hearing on  this bill in March and two markups, one at the subcommittee level and  one before the full committee. Our hearing witnesses and other crucial  stakeholders, including the Department of Energy, were able to  contribute and shape the legislation to the well-vetted proposal that  we are finally considering today. I hope that we can demonstrate a  strong, sustained commitment to research and development in this vital  area.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this bipartisan bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to make sure that all  members of this committee and staff are thanked for their efforts, and  I urge support of this bill.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 617) to authorize the Department of Energy to  conduct collaborative research with the Department of Veterans Affairs  in order to improve healthcare services for veterans in the United  States, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 617         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Department of Energy       Veterans' Health Initiative Act''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Department.--The term ``Department'' means the       Department of Energy.        (2) National laboratory.--The term ``National Laboratory''       has the meaning given that term in section 2 of the Energy       Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 15801).        (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of Energy.       SEC. 3. PURPOSES.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous materials on H.R. 617, the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 617, the Department of  Energy Veterans' Health Initiative Act. This bill authorizes the  Department of Energy to conduct collaborative research with the  Department of Veterans Affairs to address large and complex data  management challenges associated with veterans' healthcare issues.   H.R. 617 also authorizes the Department of Energy to support  activities that will better enable other Federal agencies to leverage  the Department's capabilities in developing advanced data analytics  tools for a broad range of applications.   I would like to thank the members of the Veterans' Affairs Committee  for working with us to improve this legislation. I would also like to  thank the bill's sponsor, Mr. Norman, for his hard work on this bill.   Before I began my career in politics, I worked as a chief psychiatric  nurse for the Dallas VA Medical Center in Dallas, Texas. In that  position, I saw firsthand the unique healthcare needs of the veteran  community. I believe the bill before us today will be a positive step  toward tackling some of the critical problems that the VA is currently  facing in providing our veterans with the care they deserve when they  come home.   I strongly support this bipartisan bill and encourage my colleagues  to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no requests for time, and I  continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to close by simply  thanking all of the members of the full committee, as well as the  staff, and to urge passage of this legislation, H.R. 617.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
