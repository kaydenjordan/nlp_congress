 Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of my  colleague and friend Jeff Sessions to be the Attorney General of the  United States.   Why? We have had this debate. It has gone on a long time, and we have  heard from a lot of proponents and opponents of Jeff Sessions. Who  would know Jeff Sessions better maybe than I would? I have worked with  Jeff Sessions since he came to the Senate 20 years ago. Between us we  have been here 50 years, 30 years for me, 20 years for him. Our staffs  worked day and night on issues that have affected our State and  affected the Nation.   I first really got to know Jeff Sessions when he was the Attorney  General of Alabama. He had been the U.S. attorney. He was pretty well  known, but I didn't know him. We didn't really know each other until he  became the Attorney General.   I urged him to run for the U.S. Senate. I thought he could win, but I  thought not just that he could win but that he could bring something to  this body. I thought he would be a good colleague, he would be a good  Senator for the State of Alabama and for the United States of America,  and he has been.   When you deal with people day after day--remember, we all know each  other as colleagues here. There are just 100 of us. It sounds like a  lot of people, but it is not. When we interact on committees, when we  deal with each other, when our families are thrown together, we talk,  we debate, we maybe even fight a little bit at times over issues. We  get to really know somebody.   I know Jeff Sessions pretty well. I believe he is competent as a  lawyer, he was a good lawyer, he was a good prosecutor, and he served  our State as Attorney General. He has been active on the Judiciary  Committee where he has chaired a subcommittee. He has been active on  the Budget Committee. He has been active on the Armed Services  Committee. He has been active right here in the Senate--our Senate--on  the Environment and Public Works Committee, and he is well respected.   What kind of Attorney General do we want? We want somebody who is  competent, somebody with integrity--integrity above everything. That is  what counts in this job. This is a very, very important job. These are  big shoes. Jeff Sessions can fill those shoes, and I am happy and proud  to be here and to vote for him tonight. I wish my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle would join us.   I yield the floor.
