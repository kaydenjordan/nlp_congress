 Madam Speaker, St. Louis and I rise against the Speaker of  this House sending Members of Congress home on a break as he is taking  our economy hostage in service of his dangerous, MAGA Republican agenda  designed to gut social programs that save lives.   We are on the brink of economic disaster because of a fabricated  Republican ultimatum, and the Speaker has decided to send everyone  home.   This is not a game. Real people and real lives hang in the balance,  but the Speaker seems intent on holding our economy hostage and  rewarding himself with a break, as he is bringing us to the brink of a  default that would devastate communities like mine in St. Louis.   Just over 2 years ago, the Republican Party tried to hold our  democracy hostage. Now they are holding our economy hostage. They are  gambling with Social Security checks, with Medicare and Medicaid  benefits, with food for children, and with people's rent money, and  that is a bad deal.   The Dems are here. The Dems are here. The Dems are here, and we are  saying: Where are the Republicans? Sign the discharge petition.   Madam Speaker, will you sign the discharge petition? Where are the  Republicans? Sign the discharge petition.   The Speaker needs to do his job.                            ____________________
