 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor Dick Shellenberger, a  wonderful man who dedicated his life to serving Lancaster County.   Dick recently passed away and left an enormous legacy in our  community. I attended a memorial in his honor on Friday, and you could  tell how well-loved he was in the community by so many people who  showed up to pay their respects.   Dick first ran a dairy farm with his father. He was a graduate of  Lancaster Mennonite High School. He worked for Kreider Farms and  established the farm's ice cream business, operating its four family  restaurants, two dairy stores, and wholesale milk business. He then was  a restaurateur, but he eventually became Lancaster County Commissioner.   He was a strong proponent of farmland preservation because he knew  the importance of agriculture and farming in our community. He served  on many community boards and on his church boards and was always  looking for ways to give back.   He is survived by his wife, Pam; a son, Richie; a daughter, Missy;  and his six grandchildren.   Dick's legacy will undoubtedly live on in our community. We are  grateful for his service to Lancaster County. We also know that he is  in a better place, but we will certainly miss him here. It is humbling  to be able to honor his life.                            ____________________
