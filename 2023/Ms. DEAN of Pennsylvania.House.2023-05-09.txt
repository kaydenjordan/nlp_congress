 Mr. Speaker, it should not be partisan or  political to pay our bills because raising the debt ceiling is simply  honoring our word, our commitments. In fact, the Constitution demands  that the validity of the public debt shall not be questioned.   Congress has a duty, an obligation, embedded in the very framework of  our being to raise the debt limit so the world knows that America will  never default.   Republicans want to skip out on this bill because they don't like how  Congress spent it. We spent it helping the poor, helping veterans,  helping seniors. Skipping out is not an option.   Since 1960, Congress has renegotiated our debt ceiling 78 times.  Under President Trump, and without any fanfare, we raised the debt  ceiling three times. Now, under President Biden, House Republicans are  playing arsonist with the financial well-being of all Americans and  threatening to cut SNAP, create roadblocks for Medicaid, and jeopardize  funding for veterans.   Mr. Speaker, real leaders would not do this. Mr. Speaker, we should  end the madness.                            ____________________
