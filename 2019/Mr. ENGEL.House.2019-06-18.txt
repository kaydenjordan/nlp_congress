 Madam Chair, I compliment my colleague from California.  This is something that is very serious, and obviously, we have been  talking about it for a long time now.   We are a coequal branch of government. We want the executive branch,  no matter who is in the executive branch, to respect the fact that we  are.   That is clear to the people in this House. We have voted that way,  and we have talked that way. We believe that what the administration  did by calling these weapons ``emergency'' was not the right thing to  do. It is clearly not an emergency. It is clearly a way of skirting  around Congress. It is clearly a way of trying to not work with  Congress.   I think that it is time that the Congress takes back important  things, such as declaring war, such as sending these things to our  allies.   I feel very, very strongly, and I think that my colleagues will, too,  that Mr. Lieu should be supported in this.
