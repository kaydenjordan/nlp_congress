 Mr. Speaker, as my colleague, Brad Schneider, just  said, yesterday we held a moment of silence for those who were killed  at Santa Fe High School. I have relatives and their children who live  in Parkland, so these kinds of shootings affect us all.   Everybody in this country knows that we have a gun epidemic in this  country. We also know that we have a severe mental health crisis in our  Nation. In my opinion, it is morally unjust for this Congress to do  nothing.   I own a gun. I believe in the Second Amendment. I would stand toe-to- toe with anyone who would urge that we take guns away from people, but  I will stand with anyone who says that assault weapons should only be  in the hands of military and police.   I cannot understand how we continue to have these moments of silence  and return to doing nothing. We don't have all of the answers, but we  do have some of the answers, and to do nothing is morally bankrupt and  legislative malpractice.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding me the customary 30  minutes for debate.   Mr. Speaker, the underlying measures that are in this combined rule  are matters of substance that do need to be addressed, and I will get  back to it in a moment.   Several of my colleagues will join me today in recognizing a historic  moment in this particular body in this great country of ours.   Madam Speaker, let me recognize that tucked inside this rule is the  majority's 83rd and 84th closed rules of this Congress--and we are just  in May--with more to go.                                time  1130    That is a historic number because it makes the 115th Congress the  most closed Congress ever. My Republican friends have made history for  all the wrong reasons.   But we should not let this milestone go unrecognized right from the  very beginning, because it is a sad point in this Chamber's history. It  is why we have ignored virtually every major issue the public cares  about. It is why this Congress can't get anything done. It is why we  are so dysfunctional.   It is clear to me that the majority has turned a deaf ear, which is  absolutely shameful. Please know this: 1,793 amendments offered by  Members of this body have been denied.   When I came to Congress in 1992, there was an echo chamber from the  right talking about the Democrats' closed rules. Quite frankly, at that  time, I did not understand that dynamic. I arrived here, and during  that particular session of Congress, we did have open rules, but there  were closed rules as well.   When Nancy Pelosi was last Speaker, we had 12 open rules. This  Speaker, our now lame-duck Speaker, up to this point, has been and is  the only Speaker of the House of Representatives never to have an open  rule. What that means is not just Democrats have been shut out but  Republicans have been shut out.   Day in and day out, night in and night out, in the Rules Committee,  Members offer up meaningful suggestions to this Congress, and they are  denied. That is not denying the Member of Congress; it is denying the  people those persons are here to represent and who expect them to  advance measures that are pertinent to their respective communities.   There will be Members who will talk about the shamefulness of the  kinds of amendments that have been denied.   This particular measure authorizes $647 billion in base budget  authority for defense programs in the coming fiscal year, as well as an  additional $69 billion in overseas contingency operations.   The legislation comes on the heels of the bipartisan budget agreement  signed into law in February, which increased the budget caps for  defense and nondefense spending for 2 years.   The legislation provides, rightly, a 2.6 percent pay raise for  Active-Duty troops, the highest such raise in 9 years. It strengthens  the Military Health System, provides assistance to local educational  agencies servicing military dependent students, and improves the  Transition Assistance Program to provide servicemembers better tailored  resources and information as they prepare to enter civilian life.   I was glad to see that this NDAA establishes a prescription drug  monitoring program in order to prevent opioid abuse within the  military, a proactive step that will help our country combat drug  addiction.   What is important about this particular measure is the chairman,  Chairman Thornberry, and the ranking member, Adam Smith, have worked  together, along with the members of the Committee on Armed Services, to  [[Page H4295]]  produce a bipartisan product. It proves it can be done.   This is a bipartisan measure, and most Members in this body will have  amendments that will be made in order and will have an opportunity to  present their ideas how to better sustain military readiness. That is  as it should be.   But there are members of the Committee on Armed Services who belong  to other committees of jurisdiction. In those committees of  jurisdiction where few hearings are held, no bipartisan effort is  undertaken, they are shut out just as well as the rest of the members  of the other jurisdictions.   Every jurisdiction in this Congress should be bipartisan and should  have input from both parties.   And I find it passing strange that I hear voices saying that  Democrats are obstructionists. Obstructionists of what? We can't even  get amendments made in order.   The only thing we have left that we can do is voice our objection to  the kind of closed process that we have witnessed during this  particular session of Congress. I hope the American public understands  how much their Members are being denied an opportunity to represent  them.   In terms of military readiness, the fiscal year 2019 NDAA dedicates  substantial funding toward cutting-edge military capabilities and  countering emerging threats through investments in cyber and space. The  bill includes funding for thousands of additional Active-Duty troops  and authorizes important funding for military construction and  infrastructure.   You know what it doesn't include and what it won't? There will be  Members who will offer that we have an Authorization for Use of  Military Force. Seventeen years have passed since we have had a new  Authorization for Use of Military Force. Congress should be declaring  war, not Presidents.   And it doesn't mean this President. The three or four before him  operating in this Congress were allowed to go forward under the aegis  of a 17-years-ago Authorization for Use of Military Force.   I was also pleased to see an improved commitment to Historically  Black Colleges and Universities in this year's package--schools that  are critical to ensuring a pipeline of highly skilled, diverse college  graduates into the United States Armed Forces.   This bill also takes significant steps to support our allies. It  provides $6.3 billion for the European Deterrence Initiative and  declares that it is the policy of the United States to counter Russian  influence campaigns.   The bill also imposes additional sanctions on Russia for violating  the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, and it renews authority  in the war against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and fully funds  Israeli missile defense partnerships.   Madam Speaker, there is a lot that we can be proud of in this NDAA.  Unfortunately, despite all of these important investments, there are a  few provisions in this bill that raise serious concerns.   I have already spoken to the failure to pass a new military-use-of- force measure. The one that we have is overly broad, and Members have  never had an opportunity to vote on a new one, even as we commit to  military engagements overseas.   Members on both sides of the aisle agree that an up-or-down vote on a  new AUMF is long overdue. So this is the time and the place to do it.  My colleague Barbara Lee, I am sure, and my colleague on the Rules  Committee Jim McGovern, I am sure, are going to offer measures that  will accomplish that.   I am also particularly alarmed that this legislation repeals the  Federal ban on military production of low-yield nuclear weapons.  Repealing this 15-year ban and pursuing low-yield nuclear warheads for  submarine-launched ballistic missiles will have significant  ramifications for global security.   Additionally, the NDAA includes a number of provisions targeting  DOD's fourth estate, which refers to nonmilitary portions of the  Department of Defense. These provisions affect human resources,  information systems, and other important services that affect the day- to-day lives of our servicemen and -women as well as national  readiness.   Under this bill, these offices are targeted with an unrealistic and  unnecessary spending cut, setting up a sequester-like automatic 25  percent reduction to critical support functions.   Madam Speaker, this brings me to the second measure, the Economic  Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act.   Under the pretext of providing relief to community banks, this bill  rolls back important financial and consumer protections and provides a  giveaway to large Wall Street banks, allowing them to skirt enhanced  regulations aimed at protecting our economy from another financial  crisis.   The third measure, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan  McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act, exposes more patients to  harm and further sidelines the Federal Drug Administration's ability to  oversee investigational treatments than the bill passed by the House in  March.   In fact, during the Rules Committee hearing in March, Energy and  Commerce Committee Chair Walden and Health Subcommittee Chair and  fellow Rules Committee member Burgess had reservations about this  measure, which is why the House took up the more narrowly focused bill  in the first place.   Madam Speaker, last Friday, there was another school shooting. Again,  America watched in horror as students and teachers fled their  classrooms from a murderous gun rampage. Again, community leaders and  government officials offered thoughts and prayers. Yesterday, we  offered a moment of silence. Again, calls for stricter gun control laws  and heightened school security returned.   We all know that this will happen again to our young people. And for  that reason, I can state emphatically and without fear of having to  correct the Record that the Republican leadership of this House has not  only abdicated their responsibility to the American people and our  children but their common sense as well.   No other country in the world has as many guns, as many homicides, or  as many mass shootings as we do. There is simply no more time to waste.  We need to be considering a ban on bump stocks. We need to be  considering a ban on assault weapons.   And don't anybody tell me we can't ban assault weapons. We did that  when I first came to Congress. We banned assault weapons, and the kind  of mass killings we have seen went down after we did that.   We need to be considering protective orders allowing people to  petition the court to temporarily remove firearms from an individual in  crisis. We have seen evidence of that working when Florida passed its  law. One week after that law went into effect, a person had his guns  removed who would have been a harm to himself and to others.   We need to be considering comprehensive background checks, and we  can't stop there. We need to increase access to mental health services.  We need to eliminate the feeling in this country that seeking help  carries with it some sort of stigma.   We need to learn to recognize the danger signs and offer a clear  course of action. We need to teach students about conflict resolution.   And we need to do more about civility in this Nation, in this House.  And we should be its leaders, not standing and offering a moment of  silence and returning to do nothing, as we have done, shooting after  shooting, mass shooting after mass shooting, in this country.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Ted Lieu), a member of the Foreign Affairs and  Judiciary Committees, to discuss the commonsense issues that we all  care about but have been blocked during this closed Congress.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), a member of the Foreign Affairs and  Judiciary Committees, to discuss the commonsense issues that we all  care about but that have been blocked during this closed Congress.    Madam Speaker, just to respond briefly to Mr. Burgess,  it is a good thing that they made a handful of amendments in order that  added up to 1,000. If we went through it, they would look like studies  and things that were not significant; but when it came to the  healthcare measures or when it came to tax reform, not one amendment by  a Democrat was made in order.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut  [[Page H4297]]  (Ms. DeLauro), who is a member of the Appropriations Committee, to  discuss the significance of this record-breaking closed Congress and  real people affected by these closed rules.    Madam Speaker, may I ask how much time both parties  have remaining.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Kildee), a member of the Financial Services  Committee, to discuss the significance of this record-breaking closed  rule and the real people affected by the GOP shutting down our  democratic process.    Madam Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I am  going to offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Representative  Sarbanes' bill, H.R. 20, the Government by the People Act.   This legislation would overhaul our broken campaign finance system  and return to a government of, by, and for the American people.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes), who is a member of the Committee on Energy and  Commerce and the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, to  discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gonzalez), a member of the Financial Services  Committee, to continue the discussion of commonsense issues that we all  care about but have been blocked during this closed Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch), my good friend, a former member of  the Committee on Rules who is now a member of the Committee on Energy  and Commerce, to discuss the commonsense issues that we all care about  that have been blocked during this closed Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), the ranking member of the  Committee on Rules, my good friend, who also serves on the Committee on  Agriculture, to discuss the significance of this record-breaking closed  Congress and real people affected by these closed rules.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 15 seconds to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern).    Mr. Speaker, I ask how much time I have remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I would advise the gentleman from Texas  that I am prepared to close if he is.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I ask the American people to look at this chart. Rules  under Speaker Ryan: structured rules, 44 percent; closed rules, 56  percent; open rules, zero. That is what we are talking about.   As with all bipartisan measures, this NDAA has many things to like  and some provisions that are causes for concern, but it did demonstrate  that there can be bipartisan cooperation in order to safeguard our  national security, and that should be the case in every one of the  jurisdictional undertakings here in Congress.   I commend the committee for once again tackling such a major  legislative package, but sadly, this approach is far and away the  exception to the rule around here.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, we have a moral responsibility to address gun  violence in this country. Gun violence has overtaken our country. We  have a moral responsibility to every child who now attends school  thinking about, not if a school shooting will happen, but when it will  happen to them. This responsibility is not owed to them at our leisure,  it is not owed to them next month or next week or tomorrow, but today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
