 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to shine a light on one of my  constituents, Mr. Dan Shultes.   Dan, who lives in Schoharie County, is a wonderful family man with a  wife, two young children, and a community that loves him dearly. At 42  years of age, he has, in just a matter of months, gone from being  completely healthy to being diagnosed with ALS.   This devastating disease has stolen his ability to complete basic  tasks such as brushing his teeth, feeding himself, or signing his name.  When I saw him last month at a barbecue, he was confined to a  wheelchair, surrounded by loved ones.   Stories like Dan's should remind us how important it is to continue  to raise awareness about ALS and motivate Congress to take every action  possible to help the 30,000 Americans struggling with ALS. Congress  must provide robust funding for disease research and create expedient  pathways to market for new treatments and medications that could save  or drastically improve the quality of life for those living with this  disease. We should work tirelessly to provide guidance or therapeutic  solutions as soon as possible.   Lastly, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend and colleague,  Paul Tonko, a true ally in this fight, as we are working closely with  the Shultes family.   May God bless Dan Shultes and his family.                            ____________________
