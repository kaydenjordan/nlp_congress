 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Darris  Smith for his outstanding athletic achievements, having won two State  track titles for Appling County High School in Baxley, Georgia.   The senior took home first place in the Georgia High School  Association Class 3A 400-meter individual race in Carrollton, as well  as the gold medal on Appling County's 4x400-meter relay team.   Darris is not your typical track star. The 6-foot-6-inch, 230-pound  runner is also a standout basketball player as well as one of the top  football recruits in the Nation, committed to playing linebacker at the  University of Georgia. Go Dawgs.   He finished his high school football career rated as the Nation's  number 14 defensive end and the number 162 overall prospect for 2022.   These unbelievable achievements are worth appreciation and will  inspire the next generation of athletes to push for their goals.   Congratulations, Darris. We are all excited to see where your talent  and hard work take you. Go Dawgs.                            ____________________
