 Madam Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 228, I call up  the bill (H.R. 1628) to provide for reconciliation pursuant to title II  of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2017, and  ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 7 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on  H.R. 1628, the American Health Care Act of 2017.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today to speak in favor of the American Health Care Act, a  bill that repeals many of the worst aspects of ObamaCare, and begins to  repair the damage caused by the law by bringing choice, competition,  and patient-centered solutions back into our healthcare system.   Standing here today in the House debating this bill is a proud moment  for me. I was working as a nurse in Nashville in the 1990s when, fresh  off of the failure of HillaryCare, the Clinton administration pushed  out a single-payer pilot program in Tennessee called TennCare.   As the story goes, Vice President Gore and the Democratic Governor  sketched out a program on a napkin while sitting in a local bar. I saw  firsthand the negative impact of government-run health care on patient  care. I saw the costs rise, and the quality of care fall. I saw the  burdens being placed on doctors, patients, hospitals, and care  providers. I saw patients faced with fewer choices and more regulation.  And I saw the devastating impact that TennCare was having on our  State's budget, gobbling up so much State spending that other  priorities like education and infrastructure were getting squeezed.   I couldn't sit idly by while this was happening in my State, so I  decided to get involved in public service, and it is what inspired me  to run for office at the very beginning. And when, in 2009 and 2010, I  saw the same principles being debated and eventually implemented on the  national level, I thought my experience in Tennessee would be valuable  to the national debate. I told the people in my district that, if  elected to Congress, I would fight to repeal and replace ObamaCare.   In 2011, I sponsored the first piece of legislation that repealed a  part of ObamaCare. And today, we take the largest step yet in rescuing  the American people from the damage that has been done by ObamaCare.   We are united in our goal to repeal ObamaCare and replace it with  patient-centered health care. Right now, ObamaCare is imploding. We  were promised premiums that would decrease by $2,500; instead, average  family premiums in the employer market have soared by $4,300.   We were promised healthcare costs would go down; instead, deductibles  have skyrocketed.  [[Page H2406]]    We were promised we could keep our doctor, and keep our health  insurance plans; instead, millions of Americans have lost their  insurance and the doctors that they liked.   In short, the Affordable Care Act was neither affordable, nor did it  provide the quality of care that the American people deserve.   The American Health Care Act is a first step in our efforts to  deliver patient-centered healthcare reform. This bill returns to the  American people freedom and choice in their healthcare decisions. It  gets government out of the relationship between patients and their  doctors--where it has never belonged--and puts people back in charge of  their own health care. It brings the free market principle of  competition to an industry that has long been dominated by government  intervention.   Today we are faced with a stark choice: Do we vote to continue the  damage ObamaCare is doing to our country and our constituents, or do we  vote to go down another path, a better way of doing health care in this  country?   While no legislation is perfect, this bill does accomplish some  important reforms. It zeros out the mandates. It repeals taxes. It  repeals the subsidies. It allows people to choose health insurance  plans that are unique to their families, instead of purchasing a one- size-fits-all plan that is mandated by some Washington bureaucrat, and  it modernizes Medicaid, a once-in-a-lifetime entitlement reform.   Ending Medicaid's open-ended funding structure will play an important  role in addressing the future budget deficits and our growing national  debt. I applaud my colleagues who have stayed in this fight and  continue to make this bill better.   The members of the Budget Committee, which I chair, outlined four  principles they believed would improve the bill. Those principles led  to significant changes to allow more State flexibility in Medicaid and  ensure that tax credits truly served the people they are meant to  serve.   Others fought to eliminate Federal ObamaCare regulations that drive  up the cost of health care for all Americans and give those powers back  to the States. At the same time, we also ensure that States have the  resources to provide maternity and newborn care and treatment for  mental health and substance abuse.   I agree with these changes, and I applaud my colleagues for the work  to make sure that we truly reverse the damage ObamaCare is doing to our  healthcare system and our economy.   ObamaCare's legacy is clear: more government, less choice, and higher  costs. Our vision for health care in America is the opposite: more  freedom, more choice, and lower costs. Put simply, the American Health  Care Act is a good first step, but it is only a first step.   My good friend and our former colleague, Dr. Tom Price, will use his  position as Secretary of Health and Human Services to address some of  the regulatory burden of ObamaCare through administrative action. We  have voted already and will continue to vote on individual pieces of  legislation to implement even more patient-centered, free market  reforms that we cannot address through reconciliation.    In fact, we just passed two bills already this week. One would allow  small businesses to join together to purchase insurance, and the other  would increase competition by tearing down antitrust regulations. That  bill received 416 votes. This shows that these bills are commonsense  measures that include bipartisan support.   The day is finally here where we have an opportunity to fulfill that  promise that we have made to the American people. I, for one, cannot  sit idly by and let this opportunity go to waste. Campaigning is easy  compared to governing, but our constituents did not elect us to do what  is easy. They elected us to do what is right.   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting ``yes'' on the American  Health Care Act, to rescue the American people from ObamaCare.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McClintock).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Johnson), a member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Lewis), who is a distinguished member of the Budget  Committee.                                time  1145     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Arrington) who is a member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Faso), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Gaetz) who is a distinguished member of our Budget  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Rokita), who is the vice chair of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Higgins).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize that our Members on the other side  of the aisle are sharing some data on the coverage of per congressional  district based on a study that was conducted by the Center for American  Progress, which is a left-leaning organization to begin with. The  Center for American Progress employs a flawed methodology for  estimating this coverage. In  [[Page H2411]]  fact, their foundational numbers are actually based on CBO's coverage  estimates, estimates that the CBO itself has established are not  infallible.   These coverage numbers only take into account plans that they  consider comprehensive major medical policies. This is a term that is  used in the very law that we are trying to dismantle today. These  coverage estimates do not account for things that we have in our bill,  such as HSA plans that allow purchase with tax credits, and many  medical plans.   So the AHCA increases freedom for Americans to purchase the kind of  coverage that works for them, not the narrowly defined coverage that we  see that the Federal Government likes.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from California  (Mr. McClintock), who is a member of our committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Sanford).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman), who is also a member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Kansas (Mr. Marshall), who is a physician.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to remind my fellow colleagues that, currently,  when we look at the access to care for people, one-third of our  counties only have one provider; two-thirds of our counties only have  two providers. In my State of Tennessee, there are 14 counties where  they will have no insurance provider on the marketplace. So when we  talk about people losing their insurance, they are losing their  insurance by not having access to even purchase the insurance.   One of my former colleagues, the gentleman from Minnesota, asked:  What are my colleagues on the other side of the aisle trying to  preserve?   I want to point to this chart here to ask that question, because  these are the broken promises of ObamaCare.   Why are you trying to preserve something where they say premiums will  decrease by $2,500, and we see the average family premiums have soared  by $4,300, making insurance unaffordable for many families?   Another broken promise: the cost of health care will go down.   We see some deductibles that have gone up as much as 60 percent. In  my own State, they have gone up by 63 percent, making coverage  unaffordable.   You can keep your doctor--70 percent of the plans consist of narrow  networks, which means they cannot keep their doctor. I cannot tell you  the number of people who have called me because their doctor was not on  their inept plan.   Finally, ``middle class Americans won't see a tax increase.'' This  was a promise by former President Obama. ObamaCare penalties were put  in place, so people are receiving a tax penalty.   These are the broken promises that the other side of the aisle wants  to continue to protect. As opposed to that, we  [[Page H2415]]  want a system that is going to be open with patient care and give  affordability so people can get the services that they want with a cost  that they can afford.   I also thank the Budget Committee for the work that they have done,  and all the staff that have worked endless hours to make it possible  for this to be here on the floor today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  Walden), and I ask unanimous consent that he may control that time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Brady), and I ask unanimous consent that he may control that  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I include in the Record a letter dated March 7, 2017, from Dr. Thomas  Price, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, who sent a letter of  support for the American Health Care Act to Chairmen Walden and Brady.                                                    The Secretary of                                       Health and Human Services,                                      Washington, DC, March 7, 2017.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, Committee on Energy & Commerce,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, Committee on Ways & Means,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Walden and Chairman Brady: On behalf of the       Trump Administration, I am writing in support of the       reconciliation recommendations recently released for       consideration by your Committees. Together, they align with       the President's goal of rescuing Americans from the failures       of the Affordable Care Act. These proposals offer patient-      centered solutions that will provide all Americans with       access to affordable, quality healthcare, promote innovation,       and offer peace of mind for those with pre-existing       conditions.        Your legislative proposals are consistent with the       President's commitment to repeal the Affordable Care Act;       provide advanceable, refundable tax credits for Americans who       do not already receive such tax benefits through health       insurance offered by their employers; put Medicaid on a       sustainable path and remove burdensome requirements in the       program to better target  [[Page H2434]]       resources to those most in need; empower patients and put       healthcare dollars and decisions back into their hands by       expanding the use of health savings accounts; ensure a stable       transition away from the Affordable Care Act; and protect       people with pre-existing conditions.        Achieving all of the President's goals to reform healthcare       will require more than what is possible in a budget       reconciliation bill, as procedural rules on this type of       legislation prevent inclusion of key policies such as selling       insurance across state lines, lowering drug costs for       patients, providing additional flexibility in Medicaid for       states to manage their programs in a way that best serves       their most vulnerable citizens, or medical legal reforms.       Your proposals represent a necessary and important first step       toward fulfilling our promises to the American people. We       look forward to working with you throughout the legislative       process, making necessary technical and appropriate changes,       and ensuring eventual arrival of this important bill on the       President's desk.            Yours truly,                                             Thomas E. Price, M.D.,                                                         Secretary.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter that comes  from 24 of our Governors in support of the repeal of ObamaCare, and I  would like to read just two quick paragraphs out of the letter:   ``We support efforts to Reform the system.   ``To provide access to affordable and quality health care, we must  reform the system. We support a plan that gives state governments  maximum flexibility to reform Medicaid and the system surrounding it.  The states are more effective, more efficient and more accountable to  the people. What works in one state may not work in another location,  and true reform will allow states to recognize and meet the unique  needs of the people all across America.   ``We recognize that a vote in the House of Representatives is the  first step in the Repeal, Replace and Reform process. The members of  the United States Senate will undoubtedly make additional improvements  before final approval by the President. We also recognize that the  Secretary of Health and Human Services is committed to working with  state leaders to provide maximum flexibility for true reform.''                                                     March 24, 2017.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Paul D. Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan:  Thank you for your       service to our country. Please allow us to offer our thoughts       about the pending vote on the American Health Care Act.       Americans want personalized, patient-centered healthcare that       treats them as individuals not a statistic, and that demands       we repeal Obamacare, replace it, and reform the system.                      We support the Repeal of Obamacare         Obamacare is collapsing. If we do nothing, people will lose       access to health care coverage. As it stands now, one-third       of the counties nationwide have only a single insurance       carrier. Americans in these areas have essentially no       choices, while they watch their premiums rise dramatically.       The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 28 million       Americans will lose coverage over the next decade if changes       are not made to the Affordable Care Act.        As the Affordable Care Act continues to deteriorate, and as       insurance premiums skyrocket across the nation, opposition to       this failed policy grows. Governor Mark Dayton (D-MN) said,       ``the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable.''       Similarly, Bill Clinton called ObamaCare, ``. . . the       craziest thing in the world.'', adding that people ``wind up       with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half.''       The President and Congress must act now to repeal the       Affordable Care Act to protect the citizens we serve in the       states.                   We support efforts to Replace Obamacare         Most Americans receive their health insurance coverage       through their employer or through Medicare. These individuals       will not see a direct change from the repeal of Obamacare.       For those Americans who do not receive coverage through their       employer, Medicare or Medicaid, we support a refundable tax       credit they can use to obtain affordable health care coverage       within the marketplace.                   We support efforts to Reform the system         To provide access to affordable and quality health care, we       must reform the system. We support a plan that gives state       governments maximum flexibility to reform Medicaid and the       system surrounding it. The states are more effective, more       efficient and more accountable to the people. What works in       one state may not work in another location, and true reform       will allow states to recognize and meet the unique needs of       people all across America.        We recognize that a vote in the House of Representatives is       the first step in the Repeal, Replace and Reform process. The       members of the United States Senate will undoubtedly make       additional improvements before final approval by the       President. We also recognize that the Secretary of Health and       Human Services is committed to working with state leaders to       provide maximum flexibility for true reform.        Governors are pleased to have an administration and a       Congress willing to collaborate with the states to address       the legitimate needs of our people. We have compassion for       those concerned about the uncertainty surrounding the       changes. This is why it is imperative that the Congress act       quickly on Repeal, Replace and Reform.        This is a multi-stage process. There is much more work to       be done, and process can only begin with a vote in the House       of Representatives. With this in mind, we humbly request that       you vote to repeal and replace Obamacare and to reform the       system going forward. Thank you.            Sincerely,        Governor Scott Walker, Wisconsin; Governor Robert Bentley,       Alabama; Governor Rick Scott, Florida; Governor C.L.       ``Butch'' Otter, Idaho; Governor Eric Holcomb, Indiana;       Governor Terry E.
