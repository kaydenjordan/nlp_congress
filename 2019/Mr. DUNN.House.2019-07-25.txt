 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an extraordinary  man. He is from Bay County, Florida, and I am fortunate to have him as  a dear friend of mine, Mr. Grover Davis.   Grover was born into a fishing family in December of 1941 in Parker,  Florida, and he learned the value of hard work at a young age. He built  fishing boats with his father and his brothers, leading his family to  own the first charter fishing boats in Panama City.   When his father died, Grover dropped out of high school and worked  with his brothers to support the family. They made a living in the  charter fishing business, with young Grover below deck keeping the  boats running. He still keeps the boats running 70 years later.   He learned a lot about life at a young age. He met his wonderful  wife, Judy, at Bay High School, and married her in 1961.   By the 1970s, the Davis family was managing the St. Andrews Marina,  and Grover became interested in a new business venture. In 1974, he  began Marine Transportation Services, which provided transport services  for oil and gas companies in the Gulf of Mexico. Marine Transportation  Services has truly become a family affair, with his wife, Judy, and his  daughters, Kim and Kerrie, joining him at the helm.   Grover treats all of his employees like family. In fact, 50 percent  of his employees started at Marine Transportation right out of high  school and still work there to this day.   He is unfailingly supportive of all of his employees. When they make  a mistake, he doesn't let them go. He is famous for sitting with them  and saying: ``Did you learn something from this?''   His favorite phrase is: ``There are only two kinds of captains; those  who have run aground and those who are about to run aground.''   Grover truly leads by example in all aspects of his life, and he has  spent much of his life giving back to the community. He is a big  supporter of Camo Dreams, a nonprofit that helps disabled children go  on hunting trips, and routinely supported events for the Girl Scouts  when his daughters were growing up.   Grover, his wife, Judy, and his daughters, have long since cemented  their place in the firmament of stars that are the foundation of our  community back home.   He has always preached that honor is the most important value among  people, and no one person is better than another. He never asks anyone  to do what he would not do himself.   Judy and Grover have two children, Kim and Kerrie, two grandsons, and  two great grandsons. They all describe him as an amazing friend,  father, and leader in our community.   He is the single most social man I know. A great storyteller, he  always surrounded himself with his friends, and if he stood still for  more than a few minutes, it was certain that he was frying grouper or  mullet for a host of people. He loves people and they love him.   I have to say, Grover is also widely known as a huge and very  inventive practical joker. He has been known to go to elaborate lengths  to prank his friends.  [[Page H7384]]    He is also an amazing historian, especially knowledgeable about the  minutiae of World War II. All of his friends, and I count myself lucky  to be among those, revere our time that we spend with him. He is always  entertaining, educational, and exceptional.   One of his daughters recently said to me: ``Daddy is so social and he  knows so many people that he could cause a traffic jam in Calhoun  County.'' That is a lot of personality.   I spoke with him on the phone last week, after he received his  diagnosis of a rapidly progressing terminal illness. After sharing his  terminal diagnosis with me, he lightheartedly promised that, come what  may, he would vote for me by absentee ballot next year.   Mr. Speaker, as the curtain draws closed on the life of my friend, I  ask that we cast our attention on a man who lived an extraordinary  life; a man who changed my community for the better; a man who cared  for and supported many, many friends and family; a man who is, quite  literally, larger than life.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing my friend, who made me a  better person, made my community a better place, Mr. Grover Davis.   Grover, we are praying for you, my friend, and for your family.                            ____________________
