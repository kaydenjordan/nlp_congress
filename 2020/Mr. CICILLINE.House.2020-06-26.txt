 Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will vote on the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act, a bill that  will lower healthcare costs and prescription drug costs, protect  patients with preexisting conditions, expand Medicaid, and lower  prescription drug costs.   Democrats have been committed since the day we arrived here to  strengthening access to quality healthcare.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle, on the other hand, are  trying to rip away healthcare from 20 million Americans and weaken  protection for 135 million Americans with preexisting conditions.   They have been trying to do this for 10 years. They are obsessed with  the very idea.   Yesterday, President Trump joined 18 Republican Governors and  attorneys general in filing a brief in the United States Supreme Court  to have the entire Affordable Care Act declared unconstitutional in the  middle of a global health pandemic. More than 40 million Americans have  filed for unemployment; 120,000 Americans have died; and more than 2.25  million Americans have been infected with this virus. There has never  been a more important time to protect access to quality, affordable  healthcare than right now.   That is why Democrats are going to move forward with another bill  that will further strengthen access to high-quality, affordable  healthcare. It is important that we continue this fight to protect the  American people and their access to healthcare.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank you, who brought me to the site  of this horrible tragedy and allowed me to see the warmth and beauty of  your community in response to it.   Four years ago, 49 people were murdered in a violent, hate-filled  mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando. In the days that followed,  we saw and heard stories of courage, bravery, and resolve. But mostly,  there was unspeakable pain for those who lost someone in this attack.  And although I pray that the passage of 4 years has brought some  measure of relief, the truth is that their pain will never fully go  away.   It is critical that we designate this memorial today so that our  country never forgets those who are lost, but it is also important to  take action so this never happens again.   Individuals convicted of hate crimes should never own a gun, and that  is why I introduced the Disarm Hate Act--to do just that. If you commit  a hate crime, you shouldn't be allowed to own a gun, period. We know  that those who commit hate crimes become increasingly violent as time  goes on.                                time  1115    No American family should have to suffer because of this loophole.  Let's disarm hate once and for all.   We will never forget the 49 young people who lost their lives at the  Pulse club in Orlando, the extraordinary response of the first  responders, and the hospital facilities that provided miraculous care  that prevented so many other lives from being lost.   Let's do all that we can to prevent the next hate-filled tragedy.   Again, I salute Orlando Strong for the magnificent and nurturing  response of the entire community to this devastating attack on all of  us.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I  rise in strong support of the resolution to override the President's  veto.   In 2016, the Obama administration issued the borrower defense rule in  order to provide relief to student borrowers defrauded by predatory  for-profit institutions, which promised an education and credentials to  pursue a career only to find these credentials did not have the value  they were promised.   In the aftermath of the collapse of institutions like Corinthian  Colleges and ITT Technical Institute, the Obama administration sought  to provide relief to those students left out in the cold.   The borrower defense rule provided a path to relief to those students  who sought to receive an education but were instead left with nothing  but debt and few paths forward.   Sadly and predictably, the Trump administration ended these  protections and implemented a rule making it harder to obtain relief,  siding with predatory for-profit institutions rather than the victims-- the students and veterans--of these wrongdoers.    According to the Institute for College Access and Success, the number  of students eligible to seek debt relief or loan forgiveness will drop  from 53 percent of borrowers under the Obama-era rule to just 3 percent  under the Trump rule.   In response, Congress, in a bipartisan way, came together to reject  the administration's rule change, rejecting efforts to leave defrauded  students out in the cold. The President vetoed this relief. Now,  Congress must once again stand on the side of those who sought to  obtain a higher education and provide a better life for their lives and  family.   I urge adoption of the override resolution.
