 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   I rise today to join my colleagues to honor National Police Week. I  became a police officer when I was very young--20 years old. Many of  the calls I responded to still stand in sharp relief in my memory.   Today, as we honor the many who have fallen while serving our  communities, I first want to talk about a couple of friends of mine,  Sergeant James Severin and Patrolman Tony Rizzato. They were my friends  and colleagues who were killed by snipers as they were participating in  a walk and talk program, an exercise designed to help police better get  to know the communities they serve.   I think of my dear friend, Erwin Jackson, a patrolman, who just  months before Severin and Rizzato had passed away, had saved my life  while we were arresting a man wanted for murder. Erwin was killed in  the line of duty while his partner attempted to disarm an offender with  a gun. Their losses have left indelible marks on me.   Now as a Representative for Arizona's First District, I have known  the pain of losing the hardworking men and women serving our State.  Just before I started my first term in Washington, Show Low Officer  Darrin Reed was killed in a hostage altercation attempting to save the  life of a 15-year-old girl from her captor.                                time  1715    His loss shook an entire Arizona community and is a testament to his  service and his kindness. I remember talking to his family at his  memorial.   In February of last year, we lost White Mountain Apache Officer David  Kellywood in the line of duty. On the day we laid him to rest, blue and  black ribbons and American flags lined our State highways.   The loss of too many good officers working on the front lines this  past year has left unbearable empty chairs at kitchen tables across our  States and families that are suffering.   The officers I work with in Arizona's First District are kind, honest  men and women who were drawn to service for the sake of others. At the  end of the day, their names are too great to count and the sacrifices  they have made too many.   As we honor this week, we also recognize the changes that must be  made to our policing system to ensure that those who have sworn to  protect and serve are held to the highest standards, and we, as  Congress, must help with that.   We must rebuild broken trust between police and our communities and  work in bipartisan ways to do so.   That is the type of police I worked with, many of us have, and we  want to see that those officers who are participating in that type of  community continue to work.   As a former officer, a member of the bipartisan Law Enforcement  Caucus, and the sponsor of several bills to reform policing and better  keep our communities and our officers safe, this week is not one I take  lightly.  [[Page H2250]]    We must continue to honor the good, honest officers who have laid  down their lives in the line of duty. We must also work toward equal  rights, justice, and treatment for all Americans in our criminal  justice system. Those goals can go hand in hand if we put aside our  differences and work together.   Above all, today, we mourn and remember all those we have lost and  hope that our words will offer comfort to their families.   As we keep close in our hearts the loved ones of our fallen officers,  we also think of the families across our Nation who have lost loved  ones to senseless violence.
