 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 8163) to amend the Public Health Service Act with respect to  trauma care, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 8163         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Improving Trauma Systems and       Emergency Care Act''.       SEC. 2. TRAUMA CARE REAUTHORIZATION.

(d) Program Funding.--Section 1232(a) of the Public Health       Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300d-32(a)) is amended by striking       ``2010 through 2014'' and inserting ``2023 through 2027''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 8163.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 8163, the Improving  Trauma Systems and Emergency Care Act, sponsored by Representative  O'Halleran of Arizona. This bill will improve access to trauma services  throughout the country and better coordinate emergency care when  patients need it the very most.   Traumatic injury is a major public health issue claiming more than  270,000 lives every year, and accounting for billions of dollars in  healthcare spending throughout the Nation.   Trauma affects every one of our communities, but about 46 million  Americans, most of whom live in rural areas, do not live within one  hour of a Level I or Level II trauma center. This is often referred to  as the ``golden hour'' following traumatic injury. Prompt medical  treatment during this hour produces the highest likelihood of  preventing a patient's death.   H.R. 8163 reauthorizes grants that will enhance access to trauma  care, improve coordination among trauma systems, and provide resources  for rural access to trauma services. The grants included in the bill  are intended to help trauma systems develop best practices, not only  for their own patients, but also to facilitate the dissemination of  those best practices to similar trauma systems throughout the Nation to  improve overall care.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce  Committee for their tremendous work to reach bipartisan agreement on  this bill. I also commend Representative O'Halleran for his tireless  advocacy on this issue for all rural communities.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 8163 is a strong bill that will help people in  every community. I urge my colleagues to support it, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I also urge support. This is bipartisan.  This is really important to rural areas, in particular.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 958) to amend the Public Health Service Act to expand the  allowable use criteria for new access points grants for community  health centers.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 958         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Maximizing Outcomes through       Better Investments in Lifesaving Equipment for (MOBILE)       Health Care Act''.       SEC. 2. NEW ACCESS POINTS GRANTS.         (a) In General.--Section 330(e)(6)(A) of the Public Health       Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254b(e)(6)(A)) is amended by adding at       the end the following:        ``(v) Mobile units.--An existing health center may be       awarded funds under clause (i) to establish a new delivery       site that is a mobile unit, regardless of whether the       applicant additionally proposes to establish a permanent,       full-time site. In the case of a health center that is not       currently receiving funds under this section, such health       center may be awarded funds under clause (i) to establish a       new delivery site that is a mobile unit only if such health       center uses a portion of such funds to also establish a       permanent, full-time site.''.        (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a)       shall take effect on January 1, 2024.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on S. 958.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 958, the Maximizing  Outcomes through Better Investments in Lifesaving Equipment for Health  Care Act, or the MOBILE Health Care Act. This Senate bill is the  companion to H.R. 5141, which passed out of the Energy and Commerce  Committee last week. The bipartisan bill will help expand access to  community health centers and the important care they provide to  individuals who live in hard-to-reach areas of the country.   Community health centers are a critical source of care for nearly 30  million Americans. Unfortunately, many people who live in rural and  geographically isolated areas can struggle to reach a community health  center. Many others may lack access to reliable transportation that can  make it difficult to get the care they need.   Now, one way to mitigate these barriers to access is to allow  community health centers to establish mobile health clinics. These  clinics can meet people where they live to provide the care they need.  There is already funding to establish new community health centers  through the New Access Points grants but, unfortunately, existing rules  for these grants make it difficult to receive Federal funding to set up  these mobile sites.   So this legislation will make it easier for community health centers  to use New Access Points grants to establish mobile clinics and help  eliminate one of the barriers to care for rural areas.   I thank Representatives Susie Lee, Hudson, Ruiz, and Herrera Beutler  for their leadership on this issue and their hard work to advance this  important bill.   The House companion to this commonsense, bipartisan legislation was  voted out of the Energy and Commerce Committee by a unanimous vote of  52-to-0 last week, so I am proud to support this bill, and I look  forward to sending it to the President's desk.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting S. 958, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Nevada (Mrs. Lee), the sponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, this is an important bill. It is  bipartisan. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4081) to require the disclosure of a camera or recording  capability in certain internet-connected devices, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4081         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Informing Consumers about       Smart Devices Act''.       SEC. 2. REQUIRED DISCLOSURE OF A CAMERA OR RECORDING                     CAPABILITY IN CERTAIN INTERNET-CONNECTED                     DEVICES.         Each manufacturer of a covered device shall disclose       whether the covered device manufactured by the manufacturer       contains a camera or microphone as a component of the covered       device.       SEC. 3. ENFORCEMENT BY THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION.         (a) Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices.--A violation of       section 2 shall be treated as a violation of a rule defining       an unfair or deceptive act or practice prescribed under       section 18(a)(1)(B) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15       U.S.C. 57a(a)(1)(B)).        (b) Actions by the Commission.--        (1) In general.--The Federal Trade Commission shall prevent       any person from violating this Act or a regulation       promulgated under this Act in the same manner, by the same       means, and with the same jurisdiction, powers, and duties as       though all applicable terms and provisions of the Federal       Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.) were incorporated       into and made a part of this Act.        (2) Penalties and privileges.--Any person who violates this       Act or a regulation promulgated under this Act shall be       subject to the penalties and entitled to the privileges and       immunities provided in the Federal Trade Commission Act (15       U.S.C. 41 et seq.).        (c) Commission Guidance.--Not later than 180 days after the       date of enactment of this Act, the Commission, through       outreach to relevant private entities, shall issue guidance       to assist manufacturers in complying with the requirements of       this Act, including guidance about best practices for making       the disclosure required by section 2 as clear and conspicuous       as practicable.        (d) Tailored Guidance.--A manufacturer of a covered device       may petition the Commission for tailored guidance as to how       to meet the requirements of section 2.        (e) Limitation on Commission Guidance.--No guidance issued       by the Commission with respect to this Act shall confer any       rights on any person, State, or locality, nor shall operate       to bind the Commission or any person to the approach       recommended in such guidance. In any enforcement action       brought pursuant to this Act, the Commission shall allege a       specific violation of a provision of this Act. The Commission       may not base an enforcement action on, or execute a consent       order based on, practices that are alleged to be inconsistent       with any such guidelines, unless the Commission determines       such practices expressly violate section 2.       SEC. 4. DEFINITION OF COVERED DEVICE.         As used in this Act, the term ``covered device''--        (1) means a consumer product, as defined by section 3(a) of       the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2052(a)) that is       capable of connecting to the internet, a component of which       is a camera or microphone; and        (2) does not include--        (A) a telephone (including a mobile phone), a laptop,       tablet, or any device that a consumer would reasonably expect       to have a microphone or camera;        (B) any device that is specifically marketed as a camera,       telecommunications device, or microphone; or        (C) any device or apparatus described in sections 255, 716,       and 718, and subsections (aa) and (bb) of section 303 of the       Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 255; 617; 619; and       303(aa) and (bb)), and any regulations promulgated       thereunder.       SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.         This Act shall apply to all devices manufactured after the       date that is 180 days after  [[Page H8154]]       the date on which guidance is issued by the Commission under       section 3(c), and shall not apply to devices manufactured or       sold before such date, or otherwise introduced into       interstate commerce before such date.       SEC. 6. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 4081.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4081, the Informing  Consumers About Smart Devices Act.   For consumers, the benefits of technological progress are all around  us. Perhaps nowhere is this more apparent than in our homes. The  growing array of smart devices and household appliances with voice,  video, and internet connectivity and technology make our lives easier,  more entertaining, and more comfortable.   So, while there is no question that smart refrigerators, home  assistants like Amazon's Alexa, and the countless other internet- connected devices that have microphones or cameras benefit consumers,  there is also no question that these devices should not be able to  listen to or watch us without our knowledge or consent. Unfortunately,  studies confirm that many devices do not disclose these capabilities.  Some are easily tricked into recording when people do not want them to  do so.   So H.R. 4081 addresses this straightforward problem with a  straightforward solution. The bill requires manufacturers of internet- connected devices that are equipped with a camera or microphone to  disclose to consumers that a camera or microphone is part of the  device. The bill does not apply to mobile phones, laptops, or other  devices that a consumer would already reasonably expect to include a  camera or microphone.   Now, the Federal Trade Commission must issue guidance to help  businesses comply with these new requirements and may seek penalties,  including civil penalties, for violations.   This bill will protect consumers; and I commend Representatives  Curtis and Moulton for their bipartisan work on this legislation.   This bill is commonsense, balanced, and bipartisan. It is a solution  to an issue that touches all Americans. It unanimously passed out of  the Energy and Commerce Committee in July by a vote of 53-to-0 and is  yet another example of the work the committee is doing to protect  consumers. I hope that trend continues today here on the House floor  because there is no reason why consumers should ever be spied on by  their own household devices without their knowledge and consent.   So, Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this important  consumer protection legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to take this opportunity to talk about one of our key staff  people who is leaving in the next few days. The person, of course, is  Jerry Leverich, who is right behind me here.   Jerry has played an instrumental role in the committee's work, not  only with consumer protection but on so many issues. Shortly after I  became the top Democrat on the committee, more than 7 years ago, he  started. He is currently the staff director for both our Subcommittee  on Communications and Technology and our Subcommittee on Consumer  Protection and Commerce.   Over these last 7 years since he has been here, he has played a  critical role in our efforts to expand access to broadband nationwide,  make internet service more affordable, and protect consumers from  annoying robocalls.   I have to also say that if it wasn't for him, I don't know that I  would be able to deal with a lot of technological issues in the  committee or even explain a lot of what we are doing on the issues.   He led our efforts this summer, on the Democratic side, on passing  out of committee for the first time the bicameral and bipartisan  consumer data privacy bill, which we consider on both sides of the  aisle a significant achievement. We are still working, obviously, to  bring that to the House floor before the end of this session of  Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I thank him for his counsel. I wish him nothing but the  best in his future endeavors. Obviously, we don't want him to leave. I  also want to say that not only is Jerry such an expert and so  intelligent and wise on so many issues, but he is also a great  individual and someone you can always rely on to be straightforward and  tell us when we are doing good things, tell us when we are not, telling  us when we can do things that are achievable and when they are not.  Generally, overall, he has been a great staff member, so I thank him.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that we all support this legislation, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
