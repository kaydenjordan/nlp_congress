 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and friend,  Congressman LaHood, for having this tribute tonight.   Bob Michel was a giant here in Washington, and he left this world in  a manner in which he probably would liked to have--without fanfare,  without parades, just going home.   As was said, Bob Michel actually served in this House for 38 years.  He loved the House of Representatives. He cherished this Chamber and he  cherished this institution. He served as minority leader for 14 years  in, as he lovingly called it, the people's House, in this institution  he dearly loved.   Few are left in this Chamber who actually served with him. It is my  hope that Minority Whip Hoyer gets to the floor, who served with him. I  think Steny also tries to represent that era of time when there were  people who disagreed without being disagreeable or who could work  across the aisle. I look forward to hearing Steny's remarks.   Bob was known for his aw-shucks demeanor and his baritone singing  voice. I remember once at a Lincoln Day dinner, when he was leaving and  I was running, and the people always wanted him to finish the Lincoln  Day dinner singing ``God Bless America.'' Always.  [[Page H1343]]  It was mandatory. But his aw-shucks demeanor and his baritone voice  should not distract from his keen legislative ability, where he steered  the Reagan Revolution through this Chamber as the minority leader. As  those of us who have served post-Bob Michel know, that is a difficult  thing to do.   Many times you would see Bob Michel wearing his CIB on his lapel pin.  For those of us who served in the military, the CIB is one of the most  treasured awards because it means he was an infantryman who served in  combat. My colleague, Congressman LaHood, relayed his service from  Normandy to the Battle of the Bulge, meritorious service awards, and  wounded in combat.   You can see Bob's presence here in the Chamber. The Speaker's Office  is named the Bob Michel Room. Or go to Peoria--which I was fortunate to  go to to attend the funeral--and you will drive across the Bob Michel  Bridge. The funeral service was on the campus of Bradley University,  and the student union is named after Bob Michel.   Bob Michel loved baseball. As an avid player myself, we shared fond  memories. I pitched, he pitched. I think he won more games than I did.  One flaw in Bob Michel's character was being a Cubs fan. As a Cardinals  fan, I was able to say that. But when all the ceremonies were going on  with the Cubs winning the World Series, I finally found that a reason  to be happy about the Cubs' success is that Bob was alive to experience  it. In fact, stories over the weekend said he stayed up to see the  final play and the final out. There is a great picture of him on his  porch flying the W.                                time  2000    Bob was laid to rest in Peoria on Saturday. I remember one of the  statements made at the funeral, ``If Pekin is good enough for Senator  Dirksen, then Peoria is good enough for me,'' and there he was laid to  rest.   My thoughts go out to his sons, Scott and Bruce, and daughters, Robin  and Laurie, and also Vicki, who, after Corinne's death, became a loyal  companion.   I appreciate this time to reflect. I will end with: You get to meet  some great people in this Chamber, and one of those that I will always  cherish is my opportunity to get to know and become friends with Leader  Bob Michel.   Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Shimkus for those  beautiful words for Leader Michel.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Bustos),  who shares Peoria, Illinois, with me, Bob Michel's hometown, and she  was also at the funeral on Saturday.
