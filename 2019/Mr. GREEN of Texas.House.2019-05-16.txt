 Madam Speaker, it is my privilege to be  recognized by you for this 5 minutes.   Madam Speaker, I rise, and still I rise, because I love my country  and because I believe that no one is above the law.   We say that quite religiously here in this institution: No one is  above the law.   I have in my hand the ``Report on the Investigation into Russian  Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election.'' This document, known  as the Mueller report, has been released to the public for some 29 days  now.   Since its release, we have had many persons, many of whom are Members  of  [[Page H3846]]  this august body, say that they have concluded that the President has  committed impeachable acts. Some have gone so far as to say that he  should be impeached. I am one of them.   We have also had hundreds of lawyers, many of whom are prosecutors  and former prosecutors, say that if anyone else committed the offenses  outlined in this document, the Mueller report, that person would be  arrested and prosecuted. That person would be prosecuted. That person  would not be above the law.    Hence, since this document addresses acts by the President, since the  President is not being prosecuted, and since the House of  Representatives has not moved to impeach the President, one can  conclude that the President is indeed now, for some 29 days, above the  law.   No one is above the law, unless you are the President.   No one is above the law. The House of Representatives has a duty to  enforce the law.   The President of the United States of America, it has been said by  constitutional scholars, by Members of this august body, and by  lawyers--hundreds--that he is subject to the law and that he should be  properly prosecuted.   It is not happening.   The prosecution of the President in the House of Representatives will  take place once impeachment is initiated. Until impeachment is  initiated, this President is above the law. He continues to obstruct.  He is above the law.   I am using this refrain because it is important for the American  public, the people who understand that no one is above the law, to at  least see that we have a problem. We have a President who, by most  standards, has committed impeachable acts, yet we have not started the  impeachment process.   If the President is not impeached, one of two things will happen:  one, he won't be impeached; or, two, the Congress of the United States  of America would become a toothless paper tiger, not only as it relates  to this President, but also as this relates to future Presidents.   We cannot allow the perception of the Congress to be toothless when  it comes to our constitutional responsibilities. We have a duty, a  responsibility, and an obligation to bring the President to justice.   The bar of justice for this President and any other President is this  House of Representatives, and each Member of this House has the  responsibility to make sure that justice is served.   I will now start a process that will commence on the second  anniversary of my initial call for the impeachment of this President,  which will be tomorrow. Tomorrow will be the second anniversary, and I  will start a process tomorrow of bringing to this floor a display.   We will display the number of days since the Mueller report was  produced and the number of days that this President has gone above the  law because until the President is impeached, those who say that he  should be impeached, those who say there is evidence enough to impeach,  until this President is impeached, we who say this must conclude that  he is above the law.   I love my country. I stand on the law. I believe in the Constitution.  As such, I believe that this House has a duty and a responsibility to  take up impeachment.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   Before getting into my message, I would like to acknowledge that I am  an ally of the LGBTQ community. I do this and announce my support for  H.R. 5 because of a debt I owe.   I haven't always had the privileges that I enjoy now. Someone stood  and suffered so that I could come in the front door of, probably, this  very facility. Someone suffered so that I would have the opportunity to  go to some of the schools that I attended.   I believe that there is reciprocity in life and that you don't get  where you are and fail to appreciate those who have suffered so that  you could have the opportunities that you enjoy.   I support H.R. 5 for a multiplicity of reasons, the least of which is  not the fact that I am repaying a debt. I am going to help make sure  that others don't endure the pain and suffering that I endured and that  my predecessors endured. No one should be punished or treated with  disrespect because of how you look or who you are.                                time  2045    Every person's dignity is given to them from a higher authority, and  we all should respect the dignity and humanity of every individual. So  I support H.R. 5, and I do so proudly because of a debt I owe.   I thank my friends for bringing this to my attention. It was not to  be a part of my message this evening, but it is a part of my life, to  make sure others are treated properly.   Madam Speaker, and still I rise tonight to address a crisis that our  country finds itself engulfed in, a crisis that, if we are not very  careful, will cause the Congress of the United States to be seen as a  ``less than'' when it comes to the coequals that it is supposed to be  on the same plane with.   This crisis is a constitutional crisis. And while there are some who  would differ with me and say that this is not a constitutional crisis,  remember this: There is no hard and fast definition of what a  constitutional crisis is, so whenever I give my thoughts or someone  else gives their thoughts, we are giving opinions.   Tonight, I would like to share my opinion about this constitutional  crisis. Remember, all of these thoughts are opinions; just as the  thoughts of persons who hold themselves out to be constitutional  scholars, they are opinions.   There are some who say that you don't have a constitutional crisis in  the circumstance that we are dealing with with the President, who has  refused to honor subpoenas by and through his various administrators.   There are some who say that this will not be a constitutional crisis  until the case gets to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court has to  rule on whether or not the subpoena must be honored. And if the Supreme  Court rules that the subpoena must be honored, and then the members of  the administration refuse to obey the Supreme Court, there are persons  who conclude that this, now, is a constitutional crisis.   I would conclude that if the President of the United States fails to  honor a subpoena, after having been so ordered by the Judiciary, that  this is more than a constitutional crisis; you now have a  constitutional collapse.   The crisis occurs when the President is at odds, meaning the  executive branch, with the legislative branch; and currently, the  legislative branch and the executive branch are at a stalemate.   The executive branch is declining to cooperate, declining to allow  the legislative branch to fulfill its constitutional responsibilities  associated with oversight and investigation. And, as such, there is a  crisis, and that crisis, clearly, is rooted in the Constitution,  because the legislative branch has this responsibility pursuant to the  Constitution.   So this is a constitutional crisis, and we have a duty to address it,  and we must do so, or we will have failed on our watch to take up our  responsibilities as Members of Congress.   This is our watch, and we have a responsibility to make sure that  this House takes its proper place in the annals of history, with  reference to the question of impeachment.   Impeachment is something that we should not take lightly; but it is  also something that we have to take seriously, and we have to take it  seriously because, if we fail to do so, we will have allowed this  august body to become minimized.   You see, there are checks and balances in the system. The check on  the executive branch is impeachment. That is the check. That is the  sword of Damocles that hangs above the head of the executive. And if we  fail to exercise this duty when it properly should be, we, then, do not  provide the checks to make sure the balance of power remains as it  should be.   I fear for what is happening to this Congress. I am gravely concerned  because I don't see us aggressively pursuing the checks so as to make  sure the balance of power remains in place.  [[Page H3919]]    Checks and balances are in place to make sure that there is no  concentration of power in any branch of government. If we don't become  the last line of defense with reference to the President, if we fail to  do so, we then say that there are no guardrails; that there are no  rules that the President has to obey. He doesn't become just another  president. He metamorphoses into a monarch.   The Framers never intended for us to have a monarchy. The Framers  intended for the President to be checked by the Congress.   My hope is that we, in this Congress, will take up our  responsibilities, and we will provide the checks necessary to make sure  that this President, and no other President, is above the law.   I hear many Members of Congress say that the President is not above  the law. No one is above the law. And they go on to say, however, this  President, notwithstanding his actions, we should not impeach.   How can we say that he has committed impeachable acts, and then  conclude that he should not be impeached? We, literally, are saying he  is above the law when we say that he has committed impeachable acts,  but then decline to impeach.   Anyone else breaking the law will have to answer to the bar of  justice, except the President. We know that he has done it. The Mueller  report is replete with examples, yet we have not exercised our  constitutional responsibilities and, as a result, we, the Congress of  the United States of America, are allowing the President to be above  the law.   This is unacceptable. I refuse to allow this to continue. And I say,  as I have said, that the President will have to come before the bar of  justice, which is the House of Representatives. If we fail to do so, we  will have literally allowed him to be above the law. Not in this  country, and not on my watch.   I take my oath seriously, and I assure you that this will not be the  final word; that the President is not impeachable, because he is, and  we will have to have a vote on it.   Tomorrow will be the second anniversary of the date that we initially  called for the President's impeachment. I believe that we cannot have  another anniversary without another vote.    There will be one. My hope is that it will come through the  appropriate committees of the House of Representatives. But, if not, it  will come. And I don't know that there will be others who will vote to  impeach him, but I do know that I will.   And there are times when you may have to stand alone; but I know that  it is better to stand alone than not stand at all.   Madam Speaker, I am grateful for the time that I have had. I thank  you all for allowing it to take place, and I assure you, I love my  country, and I only speak these words because I see a country in peril  because of a reckless, ruthless, lawless President that we are allowing  to be above the law.
