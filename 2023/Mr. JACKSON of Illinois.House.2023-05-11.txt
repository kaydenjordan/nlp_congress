 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the  heartbreaking tragedy of a young and courageous public servant, Chicago  Police Officer Areanah Preston, who was senselessly killed near her  Avalon Park home this past weekend.   Officer Preston, just 24 years of age, had already devoted 3 years to  protecting the citizens of Chicago, working tirelessly in the West  Roseland community. She was also an exemplary student on the cusp of  graduating from Loyola University with a master's of jurisprudence in  Chicago today. Areanah's life was marked by her kindness, intellect,  and unwavering commitment to service.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House to join me in offering  our shared condolences to Officer Preston's family, friends, and  colleagues and to join me in honoring her life and unwavering  dedication to protecting and serving the entire city of Chicago.                            ____________________
