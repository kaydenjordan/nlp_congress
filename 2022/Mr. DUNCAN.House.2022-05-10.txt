 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 91 to honor  Private First Class Barrett Lyle Austin, a fallen son of South Carolina  who gave his life in service to our country, by designating the Easley,  South Carolina post office the Private First Class Barrett Lyle Austin  Post Office Building.   This resolution is cosponsored by the entire South Carolina  delegation and supported by the city of Easley, their city council, as  well as the family of Private First Class Barrett Lyle Austin, his  parents, Curt and Yolanda Austin.   Not long after he won his stripes as a private first class in the  Army, he was driving an armored truck on patrol in the Wardak Province  of Afghanistan when insurgents attacked. A bomb exploded, and he  suffered massive head and chest trauma. Private First Class Austin died  in Germany days later, on April 21, 2013, at the young age of 20.   Private First Class Austin was posthumously awarded a Purple Heart,  Bronze Star, Palmetto State Hero award, and the South Carolina  Governor's Award for Extraordinary Sacrifice and Heroism.   Private First Class Austin was an avid sportsman, a 2011 graduate of  Pickens High School, and a member of Rock Springs Baptist Church in  Easley.   I attended his service, and the pastor said he was awarded the medals  posthumously, but he was awarded the jewels in his crown the minute he  entered the pearly gates. He was that kind of believer.   He was an inspiration to many. He is an American hero and deserves to  be honored for his bravery and sacrifice for our country as a soldier  defending our freedoms and security.   As John 15:13 says, greater love has no one than this, that someone  lay down his life for his friends. Barrett did that.   I thank the committee and Ranking Member Comer for bringing this  measure to the floor and allowing us to honor our fallen heroes. Again,  I urge passage of the legislation.    Mr. Speaker, we come tonight to honor another Pickens  County fallen hero, Specialist Four Charles Johnson, Jr., an American  hero and fallen son of South Carolina, by designating the Pickens,  South Carolina post office the Specialist Four Charles Johnson Post  Office.   This resolution is cosponsored by the entire South Carolina  delegation and supported by the city of Pickens, their city council, as  well as the family of Specialist Four Johnson.   Specialist Four Johnson, Jr., was killed in action on March 30, 1966,  in Vietnam and was the first casualty from Pickens County in that war.   Specialist Four Johnson of Pickens, South Carolina, began his  military career in the Army at a young age of 17  [[Page H4789]]  years old. He was one of three brothers to serve in Vietnam at the same  time.   He was awarded the Purple Heart, the Vietnam Gallantry Cross, and the  National Defense Service Medal, among other commendations.                                time  2250    Specialist Four Johnson was a 1958 graduate of Clear View High School  in Easley, South Carolina, and was a member of the Griffin Ebenezer  Baptist Church.   He is an American hero and deserves to be honored for his sacrifice  for our country as a soldier defending our Nation. We know that freedom  isn't free, and it is because of brave men like Specialist Four Johnson  that we enjoy the freedom and security that we have today.   I thank the committee and Ranking Member Comer for bringing this to  the floor and allowing us to honor our fallen heroes. Again, I urge the  passage of this legislation.
