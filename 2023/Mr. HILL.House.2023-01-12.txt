 Madam Speaker, I am grateful for the time to address the  House.   Isn't it outstanding, Madam Speaker, to see the people's House open,  once again, to the public, have the public in our galleries, and see  the Capitol open to our families.   That is a big change after the years of the pandemic and our Chamber  being closed from the citizens and families who send us here to  Washington. So that is a great way to have seen this House under  Republican majority leadership open the week.   As we close this first week under Republican leadership back in the  majority on this House floor, it is also good to see my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle put a premium on talking about  bipartisanship.   I particularly like my friend from Ohio (Mr. Landsman) and Mr.  Sorensen of Illinois, two new freshman Members on the House floor for  the first time this week as fully sworn Members of Congress talking  about their priorities as newly elected Democrats and seeking  bipartisanship on this side of the aisle.   This week the House has taken two important steps regarding our  strategic competition with the Chinese Communist Party, the CCP, and,  Madam Speaker, those steps on this House floor were overwhelmingly  bipartisan.   First, we created a Select Committee on the Strategic Competition  Between the United States and the CCP, which is our vision of an  integrated, open, and free world where people can celebrate their  religion, people can travel, and people can trade. That strategic  competition presses the Western values of Europe and the United States  with the more narrow and authoritarian view of the Chinese Communist  Party.   Secondly, we prevented oil being released from our Strategic  Petroleum Reserve and that being sold to Communist China. Today over  320 Members of this body agreed with that by voting ``yes'' on H.R. 22.   The Strategic Petroleum Reserve has played an important role in U.S.  energy and national security policy for four decades. It was created in  response to the Arab oil embargo in the early 1970s which resulted in  the tripling of oil prices at the time.                                time  1145    Since that time, the SPR has remained a backstop for the United  States in case of oil supply disruption.   Madam Speaker, those on the other side of the aisle talked about  America becoming the largest exporting nation in the world and that  somehow that is a bad thing and that we freed our ability to export oil  and gas outside the U.S., as if that were a bad thing. It is not.   They are two completely different issues. The Strategic Petroleum  Reserve is there for an emergency affecting the United States, our  citizens, our households, our industry, principally in case of a Gulf  hurricane or a disruption in a pipeline, or in some other aspect of oil  and gas disruption from war or an accident somewhere in the world. It  is not meant to be supplying oil, per se, to everybody besides the  United States.   Just over the last year, President Biden has released 180 million  barrels of our Strategic Petroleum Reserve, bringing it down to a 1985  level, a four-decade low. This is not smart economic policy or energy  policy in this country.   In fact, Madam Speaker, over 1 million barrels went to a Chinese- affiliated company. At the same time, China is reportedly holding its  own crude oil reserves of 900 million barrels.   Anyone with realistic knowledge and expectations in and around the  debate about climate change or energy policy knows that this  administration's energy policies have hurt American families and put  our economy at risk while at the same time weakening the globe's  interest in fighting climate change.   President Biden's failed policies to shut down the Keystone XL  pipeline, deny permits, discourage new drilling, discourage new  pipeline construction, and, through his bank and securities  environmental, social, and governance policies, so-called ESG policies,  that, too, has discouraged badly needed capital investment to go to our  energy industry and has weakened American global leadership and our  strategic benefit, as referenced by my friends on the other side of the  aisle, of energy independence. President Biden has weakened our energy  independence.   Instead, the Biden administration has doubled down, even tripled  down, on these bad policies that have not only raised costs on every  American but do nothing in the long run to impact climate.   While President Biden's nanny-state regulators this week considered  outlawing your gas stove in your home or in your kitchen or your  restaurant, Republicans on this House floor began their first step at  unleashing an all-of-the-above energy strategy.   We have to let that sink in, that a Federal regulator actually  considered a serious policy proposal of banning you from having a gas  stove in your home or in your restaurant. I mean, everyone in America  was shaking their heads this week with the preposterous nature of that  new idea from the Biden administration.   Republicans believe in an all-of-the-above strategy, which benefits  America and benefits the globe, and we must continue to invest in  energy development in order to make it through a full global  transition.   First, we have to keep investing in natural gas. We have natural gas  fields across our Nation from the West Coast to the East Coast, in the  heart of Pennsylvania, and, of course, in the heart of New York State,  where New York State's Democratic leadership refuses to let that be  brought online, let that be developed, benefiting the New York tax  base, New York workers, and New York consumers.   That gas field just in Pennsylvania and New York alone, Madam  Speaker, some believe it is larger and more lucrative than the largest  gas field that we know of in Qatar in the Persian Gulf. Yet, we will  never see a pipeline from Pennsylvania to East Coast ports under this  administration and possibly under any other future Democratic  leadership.   If the war in Ukraine showed Europe and the world anything-- anything--it is that Russia cannot be trusted any longer, if they were  ever, to be a reliable source to Europe for their energy consumption  needs.   The United States stands ready to export more liquefied natural gas  to Europe, but the pipelines and other infrastructure don't fully exist  in this country in order to have that impact  [[Page H224]]  to help our allies and partners in Europe and Asia in the short run. We  need to make that investment.   Second, I have a solution for Democrats that should meet all of their  objectives for world energy reliance and consistent with their climate  objectives. It is clean; it is renewable; and we can export it to  developing nations: nuclear energy.   International financial institutions, like the European Bank for  Reconstruction and Development, will not, or are very reluctant, to  finance any nuclear power expansion in Europe, yet the countries of  Central Europe are demanding it. They want that energy diversity. They  want an all-of-the-above energy strategy.   Yet, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, in which  the United States is a shareholder, turns a blind eye to clean,  renewable, dependable nuclear energy. The EBRD insists on financing  green energy projects to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars  yet ignores this commonsense, all-of-the-above strategy.   Today's reactor designs are not the plants of yesteryear. They are  not the plants of lore at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania or  Chernobyl. They are safe and reliable.   For many, the top concern has been what we do with nuclear waste.  Research in recent years has significantly advanced, and today, we have  the ability to recycle nuclear waste components to produce even more  abundant energy. Nuclear power plants in France have the ability to do  this, but we don't currently do it here in the U.S.   Recently, I visited Entergy's Nuclear One facility in Russellville,  Arkansas, and saw the nuclear waste byproducts that could be repurposed  for future energy needs.   Further, I learned that the process to lengthen the life of an  existing nuclear plant here in the United States, much less build a new  one, is an immense tangle of regulatory red tape that takes years to  navigate and millions of dollars of out-of-pocket fees. We in Congress  can do a better job streamlining that kind of review.    When America leads in research and development, that knowledge and  the resulting benefits are exported around the world. We can only  export that success if we have the successful policies in place to spur  that development.   We cannot expect the developing nations in Africa, Southeast Asia, or  here in the Western Hemisphere to power their growing cities and their  growing-in-wealth populations by wind and solar alone principally  because the issues with storage deficiencies and production of energy  from renewables efficiencies that remain, while improving, in the years  ahead. Solely depending on that is unrealistic.   When America does not have the will to export this kind of R&D, those  countries will turn to bad economic actors like China and Russia.   Energy policy is a long-term investment in the needs of not only our  future but around the globe. Our globe needs 100 million barrels  equivalent per day to power our homes and our economies.   As more and more countries develop and their people grow in wealth  and prosperity, their energy needs will rise, Madam Speaker, not  shrink.   We cannot wait and have nothing to offer, and we certainly don't want  to impose California's energy policies on the world and expect a good  outcome. We should be investing in all of our energy options.   That is why House Republicans in the weeks ahead, just as we started  out here in our first week, will be bringing policies to this House  floor to unleash an all-of-an-above energy strategy--oil, natural gas,  nuclear, and, of course, renewables like wind and solar. They all play  a part.   The mistakes of our policies today under this President mean we don't  have the energy capacity and dependability that we need not only today  but tomorrow. This unleashing policy by House Republicans not only puts  America first, but it puts families across the globe first--first in  opportunity, first in food and fuel security, and first in prosperity.              Appreciating the Public Service of Anushree Jumde     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Anushree Jumde, a  cherished member of my district staff.   Recently, Anushree joined Attorney General Tim Griffin's team as the  director of the Office of Community Relations.   Anushree, who is lovingly known around our district as A.J., came to  Arkansas from India at age 11. She is a proud alum of the University of  Central Arkansas, where she graduated in 2011, and she earned her  graduate degree at the Bush School at Texas A& Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight the mission of the  Arkansas Martin Luther King, Jr. Commission.   For 30 years, the commission has led in community outreach and  education. The commission is ably led by its executive director, DuShun  Scarbrough.   A division of the Arkansas Department of Education, the MLK Jr.  Commission seeks to promote and preserve the life and legacy of Dr.  King throughout the Natural State.   The commission's outreach projects of promoting education and  appreciation for history and encouragement of our youth to engage in  positive leadership development and roles within their communities has  been outstanding.   I am proud to have been involved with the commission over the years  and watch it evolve into one of the most active in our entire country.  The work of our commission has been praised by Dr. King's daughter, Dr.  Bernice King.   On the upcoming Martin Luther King Day, I am honored to celebrate the  milestone of the commission's 30th anniversary and look forward to  continuing to watch its impact on our youth and our communities for  years to come.                    Commemorating the Life of Hank Browne     Madam Speaker, I come to the House floor today to  commemorate the life of a good friend and great leader in our State,  Hank Browne, who passed away last month at the age of 82.   Mr. Browne was born in Oklahoma before moving to Arkansas in his  youth, where he graduated from high school in Perryville in 1956. After  4 years of service in the Navy, he received a management degree from  Little Rock University, now the UA Little Rock.   In 1975, Hank Browne founded Freight Sales Furniture in North Little  Rock, which is now known around the region, Arkansas and beyond, as  Hank's Fine Furniture.   In addition to leading and expanding Hank's for over two decades, Mr.  Browne was an active member of our community. A passionate outdoorsman  and conservationist, Hank was a valued and dedicated member of the  board of directors at the Nature Conservancy in Arkansas.   The impact of Hank Browne on our community will not be forgotten, and  I thank him for his years of philanthropy in our State and business  leadership. My prayers are with his wife, Cathy, and his children.                                time  1200         Recognizing Nicholas Covington, Logan Simon, and Wade Simon     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize three welding  students from St. Joseph's High School in Conway, Arkansas.   Last month, Nicholas Covington, Logan Simon, and Wade Simon were  selected out of 150 welding students to represent the Conway Area  Career Center in SkillsUSA, a State competition held in Hot Springs.  [[Page H225]]    SkillsUSA is a partnership of students, teachers, and industry  leaders working together across the country to make sure that we have a  fully skilled workforce.   The winning team at the statewide competition will receive full  scholarships to the welding program at the University of Arkansas  Community College at Morrilton and could have the opportunity to  participate in both national and world welding competitions.   I congratulate these students for their accomplishment, and I look  forward to seeing the results from the SkillsUSA competition.                          Congratulating Mary Smith     Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Mary Smith for  her two decades of service to the people of Conway.   Last month, Mayor Bart Castleberry of Conway and the Conway City  Council recognized Ms. Smith's 19 years as an alderwoman.   Ms. Smith's compassion, insight, and wisdom were greatly appreciated  by those around her. She is a beloved member of the Conway community.   I wish her all the best in her next endeavors, and I thank Mary for  her years of service to the city of Conway.                     Recognizing the Museum of Discovery     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Museum of  Discovery for winning the 2022 Roy L. Shafer Leading Edge Award for  Resilience.   This award, presented by the Association of Science and Technology  Centers, recognizes organizations that have overcome significant and  specific adversarial impacts on their museums, yet were able to use  that hardship to promote their mission and actually grow their  potential. This award is touted as the science museum equivalent of an  Oscar.   The Little Rock-based Museum of Discovery and their exceptional staff  received this award for how they rebounded from a 6-month facility  closure due to flooding caused from a burst pipe in the terrible winter  storm in February 2021.   The museum used this time to repair and extend their virtual  operating capabilities, build on what they had started during the  COVID-19 pandemic, and through this tactical shift, they were able to  deliver an immersive and deeply educational virtual experience to  thousands during this period of repair.   I am proud to honor the Museum of Discovery for their dedication and  hard work after a disaster that made them stronger and better for all  that they educate in science and technology.                         Congratulating Paul Browning     Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Paul Browning,  the assistant fire chief of the city of Morrilton, Arkansas.   Paul recently announced his retirement after 3 decades of service  with the Morrilton department.   Just before his departure, Paul was given the opportunity to present  the department's newest captain with his captain's badge. The  recipient? His son, Joseph Browning, who had been with the department  15 years.   Paul presented Joseph with his original captain's badge as a token of  his promotion.   Madam Speaker, I congratulate Joseph on his promotion and  congratulate Paul on his retirement. I thank them both for their  dedication and service to the community of Morrilton.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
