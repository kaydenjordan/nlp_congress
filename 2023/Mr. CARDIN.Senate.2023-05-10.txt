 Madam President, I would like to take this  occasion to congratulate Mike Rock on his retirement last month from  the American Hospital Association--AHA. For 39 years, Mike was a valued  member of the AHA's Federal Relations team and proved to be one of the  most knowledgeable, effective, and indefatigable healthcare lobbyists  on Capitol Hill.   Mike came to Washington in 1975 from Nebraska. He started working in  the mail room of Senator Roman Hruska and then joined the staff of  Representative Charles Thone of Nebraska. From there, he went to work  for Representative Virginia Dodd Smith as a legislative assistant,  handling tax, education, and defense issues.   After 9 years on the Hill, Mike joined the AHA in December 1984.  Shortly after Mike started at the AHA, his mother Marilyn paid a visit,  where his colleagues informed her that their nickname for him was  ``Cool Breeze.'' For nearly four decades, Cool Breeze Mike played an  integral role in the AHA's advocacy activities and so many of its  successes, including expanding access to healthcare for millions of  Americans. I have been on the receiving end of Mike's advocacy work for  my entire time in Congress. During my tenure on the House Ways and  Means Committee and now as a member of the Senate Finance Committee, I  relied on Mike's subject matter mastery of healthcare and tax policy,  his political astuteness, and his intuitive grasp of what Congress  might be able to achieve to improve the Nation's healthcare system. It  was always a joy to welcome him into my office.   At the AHA, Mike met his future wife Renee Blankenau, and they have  two grown children: Clare and Paul. I am glad Mike will have more time  to spend with his family and his avocations: cycling and swimming. I am  truly grateful for our friendship and wish him many more happy miles  and adventures in his retirement.                            ____________________     Madam President, I would like to take this  occasion to congratulate the Greater Prince George's Business  Roundtable, which is celebrating its 20th anniversary tomorrow at MGM  National Harbor. Since 2003, the roundtable--a nonprofit, nonpartisan  business alliance of chief executives whose companies employ nearly  60,000 people--has worked to improve the county's political and  economic landscape and enhance the county residents' quality of life.   Nearly 200 years ago, in ``Democracy in America,'' Alexis de  Tocqueville wrote, ``In America I encountered sorts of associations of  which, I confess, I had no idea, and I often admired the infinite art  with which the inhabitants of the United States managed to fix a common  goal to the efforts of many men and to get them to advance to it  freely.'' Voluntary associations, de Tocqueville observed, were one of  the building blocks upon which our democratic self-governance rests.   The roundtable is a perfect example of such an association. Its  members participate voluntarily, hosting community forums on crime and  education, creating a VisionFramework to help residents imagine a  bright future for the county, and producing a Quality of Life Index to  gauge the county's progress toward that future. The roundtable  established and runs the Andrews Business and Community Alliance, which  promotes Joint Base Andrews, the home of Air Force One, the 459th Air  Refueling Wing, and one of the county's two largest employers. All  these activities and efforts are done collaboratively, with input from  residents and in a spirit of cooperation and mutual respect. As the  roundtable's home page states so eloquently, ``We believe that business  is more than just adjusting overhead or the bottom line. We believe  that by giving of our time, our expertise and our inherent sense of  altruism, we will help to bring about a better home for all Prince  Georgians.''   I want to thank Jim Estepp, the roundtable's president and chief  executive officer; Doyle Mitchell, Jr., the roundtable's board  secretary and treasurer; Michael Chiaramonte, the board chair; the  other board members; and all roundtable members for their indefatigable  efforts to make Prince George's County a better place to live and work  in. I have been privileged and please to work with the roundtable on so  many initiatives these last 20 years. I congratulate the roundtable,  confident in my expectation that the next 20 years will bring even more  success.                            ____________________
