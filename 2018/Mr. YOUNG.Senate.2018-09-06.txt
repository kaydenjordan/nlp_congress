 Mr. President, as a member of the Committee on  Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I am proud to recognize the  Marcuccilli family for the 75th anniversary of an Indiana-based  community bank, STAR Financial Bank. Since its founding, STAR Financial  has become an essential business in northeast and central Indiana. The  bank has continuously prioritized putting their customers and local  businesses first, while providing decades of dependable services and  accountable staff.   Established by a group of trucking partners from the Marion Trucking  Company in 1943, STAR Financial Bank was formed to build financial  security for the Fort Wayne community. For that reason, the bank has  tailored its practices to support the community and local families.  Generally, STAR Financial focuses on three key areas involving arts,  education, and economic development. In 2017, the company donated more  than $635,000 to Indiana nonprofits, as well as volunteered 3,600 hours  of community service valuing over $97,128. Some of the nonprofits  include the Fort Wayne Museum of Art, the Fort Wayne Children's Choir.  The Children's Museum of Indianapolis, PBS 39, Big Brothers Big Sisters  Northeast Indiana, Brightpoint, and many United Way chapters.   It is my privilege to honor STAR Financial Bank for 75 years serving  the Fort Wayne community. I look forward to STAR Financial Bank's  future endeavors, and I congratulate the Marcuccilli family on this  significant milestone.
