 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule, which  provides consideration of the Limit, Save, Grow Act. It is a bill that  is critical to our country's economic future.   President Biden characterized the Limit, Save, Grow Act as  ``irresponsible,'' that this commonsense legislation was really asking  hardworking Americans, seniors, and children to shoulder an enormous  new burden. The only thing irresponsible would be to do nothing.   If we want to talk about a burden on the backs of hardworking  Americans, then let's actually talk about it. Let's dig into it.   Let's talk about how folks in my home State of New York had to pay as  much as 40 percent more this winter just to heat their homes while the  Biden administration halted new pipeline construction and new  exploration, and they brought the approval of new oil and gas  infrastructure to a standstill.   Let's talk about how seniors in rural communities across my district  living on fixed incomes can now afford less in an inflation-ridden  economy where the basic cost of goods and groceries has exploded and  crushed their budgets.   Let's talk about the $80 billion for the IRS to supply an army of new  bureaucrats ready to rain down audit after audit onto middle-class  families and small, mom-and-pop business owners.   These are the burdens shouldered by the American people for the  trillions of dollars in spending that Democrats have foisted onto their  backs and onto the backs of our children and grandchildren.   Mr. Speaker, if we care about the future that we would like to leave  our children and grandchildren, a future that isn't crushed by debt,  inflation, and paying the price for today's excesses, then we should  have no problem in supporting this critical step forward.   I strongly support the Limit, Save, Grow Act, a bill that saves  hardworking Americans from continuing to shoulder the burden of  Democrats' destructive spending policies.
