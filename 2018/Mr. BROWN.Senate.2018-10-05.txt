 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I announced my decision to vote against  Judge Kavanaugh several weeks ago, after meeting with him and after  studying his record, because he essentially put his thumb on the scale  in support of corporate interests. He has  [[Page S6676]]  consistently sided with corporate special interests, large corporations  that outsource jobs over workers, and has sided with Wall Street over  consumers.   I made that decision before Dr. Ford came forward, but I am grateful  for her. I am grateful she did, even at great personal cost and  personal risk. I believe Dr. Ford. Why in the world would someone do  what she said--again, at great personal cost and great personal risk-- if she weren't telling the truth precisely? I am grateful to her. I am  grateful for all of the brave women inspired by her to speak out and  share their own stories. A number of them have written to my office. A  number of them I have spoken to on the phone. Some of them told us for  the first time in their lives, after--one woman was in her seventies,  and it was the first time she had spoken of her sexual assault.   Please understand, all of the people, all of the women and men--I  have gotten letters from men, too, but mostly women--understand. To all  of you all over the country: We see you. We hear you. Your story  matters, and you make a difference.   It is wrong that political influence and artificial deadlines put on  them, imposed by the majority leader down the hall and the President of  the United States--artificial deadlines and political influence  prevented the FBI from performing the complete and thorough  investigation the American people deserve. Instead, Senate leaders and  the White House straightjacketed the FBI.   I don't blame the FBI. They only did what Senate leaders--what  Republican leaders who wanted to ram this nomination through as quickly  as possible and the White House, which would never want to compromise  on anything like this--they straightjacketed the FBI. They kept our law  enforcement professionals from doing their job.   According to Dr. Ford's lawyer, the FBI didn't even speak to more  than a dozen witnesses that Dr. Ford asked them to interview. They are  trying to corroborate whether her story was true, but the FBI then  didn't interview Dr. Ford or Judge Kavanaugh, nor did they interview  the people Dr. Ford suggested to them, the names that Dr. Ford gave  them, people who could corroborate what happened. So the FBI did not  interview any of the people that Dr. Ford asked or Dr. Ford herself.   Then my colleagues say that there is no corroborating evidence, so  she didn't do it, so we have to believe Judge Kavanaugh. That is their  logic: The investigation--again, not because the FBI didn't want to do  it right but because of what leadership, what political leadership,  elected officials and bureaucrats in the White House and the Senate did  to prevent the FBI from doing its job--that is why that was a scam.   So what really matters here? It really matters that we listen to  women. It also really matters because the Supreme Court has enormous  influence over the lives of everyone in my State. Any nominee must  defend the rights of all Americans to have comprehensive healthcare  coverage and make their own healthcare decisions, must defend the  rights of Americans to collectively bargain for safe workplaces and  fair pay.   I don't think my colleagues really understand the process of  collective bargaining. I am working on a bipartisan basis with a number  of our colleagues on a pension bill right now. I don't know that our  colleagues here understand that people--when it comes to pensions, they  sit down at the bargaining table, and they give up wages today so they  will have a secure retirement. I am concerned about this Supreme  Court's rejection, potentially, of collective bargaining rights and  safe workplaces and fair pay and fair benefits. I am concerned about  this Court in terms of protecting American workers and American  consumers from discrimination and, shall we say, Wall Street greed.   I am troubled already by the Supreme Court's recent decisions  stripping rights from Ohioans on many issues. That is why I met with  Judge Kavanaugh before I made my decision earlier this summer and why I  asked him about his views on the issues that matter to Ohioans. I  reviewed his record. I am not a lawyer, but I pay a lot of attention to  these issues. I looked at these decisions, and I listened to Ohioans  who weighed in. It was clear that I could not support Judge Kavanaugh's  nomination to our highest Court, again, because he puts his thumb on  the scale of justice, always with a bias toward corporate interests  over workers, over consumers.   On healthcare, you have heard Senator Shaheen, Senator Markey,  Senator Hassan; I listened late last night. You have heard them talk  about preexisting conditions. This Court is moving toward saying to the  health insurance industry: You can cancel the insurance of people with  preexisting conditions.   For 10 years, we have had consumer protections. If you are a cancer  survivor, if you have asthma, as my wife had at a young age and has  continued to manage her asthma well--and she has said very publicly  that we can talk about this--or if you have Parkinson's or any other  preexisting condition--heart disease or high blood pressure--you are  protected from the insurance company canceling your insurance. That has  been the law for 10 years. That law is under duress.   If this body votes to confirm Judge Kavanaugh today, it means that 5  million Ohioans--almost half of the people in my State have a  preexisting condition. It means they should be concerned that this  Supreme Court will take away those consumer protections and will say to  the insurance company: You can cancel somebody if they get expensive.  You can cancel somebody's insurance if you find out they had cancer.  You can do all those things.   Its rulings and positions on the rights of Ohio workers and women and  consumers would take us in exactly the wrong direction. His nomination  comes when the stakes for working Ohioans couldn't be higher. He will  talk about settled law, but settled law is only settled--again, I am  not a lawyer, but this is pretty obvious. Settled law is only settled  until the Supreme Court says it isn't. We know it with voter rights; we  know it just recently with worker rights.   Last term, the Court issued a string of anti-worker decisions. In  Janus v. AFSCME, the Court overturned decades of precedent--oh, yeah,  settled law--and limited the ability of public sector unions to  advocate for the workers they serve. This is a Supreme Court that  almost always sides with corporations over unions, with corporations  over workers, with corporations over consumers.   The decision in Epic Systems Corp v. Lewis limited the ability of  workers to have their day in court when they are mistreated by their  employer. The power already rests with employers on all of these kinds  of worker-employer issues. This Court wants to make it worse. Judge  Kavanaugh's record shows that he will accelerate that direction. This  Court has proved time and again that it stands on the side of powerful  corporations, not American workers.   We know what has happened in this country. We know that profits have  gone up. We know that executive compensation has exploded. We know that  productivity is up for workers, but we know that workers' wages have  been stagnant. So the top 1 percent or 5 percent--they are doing great.  They get big tax cuts. They get stock dividend buybacks. They get all  kinds of breaks. The fact is, workers have seen their wages stagnate.  This Court will make it worse.    There are several cases next term where the Court has the power to  fundamentally tip the balance of power even further toward  corporations--cases like Lamps Plus Inc. v. Varela, in which the Court  could rule on whether a worker can file a class action suit against an  employer that violates her privacy and releases personal information to  the public. An individual worker never has the power or the money to  hire an attorney to take on these companies. That is why workers need  to band together to take on a powerful company, a powerful employer, a  powerful corporation.   In another case, New Prime Inc. v. Oliveira, the Court will decide  whether a worker who was misclassified as an independent contractor can  bring a class action lawsuit, whether the Federal Arbitration Act  applies to an independent contractor agreement. In other words, this  Court has already moved in the direction--as this Congress did, by one  vote, if I recall--of giving corporations more power, in saying to  employees: Sorry, you don't  [[Page S6677]]  get your day in court. Again, employees individually don't have the  financial wherewithal to be able to go to court and hire a lawyer, but  if the employees band together, they can. That is what the issue of  forced arbitration is about. That is what Judge Kavanaugh has  consistently been wrong about.   I have looked at his record. It is clear, we can't trust him to stand  with Ohio workers in any of these cases. He has opposed basic  protections for workers trying to hold employers accountable--cases  like AFGE v. Gates. He has consistently ruled against claims of worker  discrimination and worker safety violations. He has consistently ruled  against workers who stand up to corporate mistreatment in cases like  Verizon New England v. National Labor Relations Board.   His nomination also poses a serious threat to the 5 million Americans  under age 65 with preexisting conditions. Again, that is half of my  State. If you meet a 40- or a 50-year-old--if you are in almost any  group, you sit there and you look to your right and you look to your  left, one of those two people, on average, is going to have a  preexisting condition. Is their insurance going to be jeopardized? It  is with this Congress, which wants to do this, and this Supreme Court  and this President want to strip away the consumer protections for  people with preexisting conditions.   They want to give the insurance companies the right to cancel your  insurance. Oh, you have cancer? You cost us a lot. I am the insurance  company; you cost us a lot. I am going to cancel your insurance then  because you cost us too much money. You can't do that under present  law. You can't do that because of the Affordable Care Act. They will be  able to do it if Judge Kavanaugh gets on the Court because you can bet  the Court is moving in that direction.   Consumer protections are under attack in our court system right now  with the case of Texas v. United States. It is likely going to make its  way to the Supreme Court, and Judge Kavanaugh's record on healthcare  gives us a pretty darned good clue how he would rule.   He refused to uphold the entire law that is constitutional--a law  that says if your child has diabetes or your mother has asthma, the  insurance companies can't raise your costs or turn them away.   This is about the cost of health insurance. It is about saying all of  us want good insurance. All of us want to be able--nobody wants to get  sick. Nobody wants to have high healthcare costs. The reason we have  insurance is so that people who get sick can make sure they keep their  insurance and can have help. But the insurance companies--if they get  their way now, they may not deny you care if you have cancer; they will  just raise your rates so high that you will not be able to afford it.  There really is no difference.   Without these protections, insurance companies will once again be  free to charge you five times the rate of your neighbor. If you are  sick, if you have neighbors on both sides who aren't, they will raise  your rates because you are sick, if they have their way. We can't risk  it. You are lucky enough to be well; your neighbor is diagnosed with  high blood pressure; the other neighbor, their child has epilepsy, and  their rates get raised, but yours don't, all because Judge Kavanaugh  and this Court and this Congress seem to want it that way. We can't  risk Ohio families not having access to care by sending him to the  Supreme Court.   It is not just on preexisting conditions where he would pose a threat  to Ohio's healthcare. Dozens of cases pending in lower courts could  determine the price you pay for healthcare over the next few years or  whether you get care at all. Again, if the price is so high, it is the  same as denying you care because you can't afford it. There are cases  on everything from false advertising by insurance companies to whether  your employer is required to give you access to healthcare.   Of course, we know that the stakes are particularly high for women.  That was true before Dr. Ford courageously came forward. It remains  true. We can't risk the ability of Ohio women to make their own  personal private health decisions between themselves and their doctors  by giving a lifetime appointment to a judge who has shown repeated  hostility to women's healthcare freedom.   We know the promises President Trump made when he was a candidate,  saying that he would put somebody on the Supreme Court who would  overturn Roe v. Wade. We know the list of judges he chose from, and the  Federalist Society had that same commitment to overturn Roe v. Wade.  Anybody in this body that thinks the judge is promising that this is  settled law ought to use the cliche that I have a bridge to sell you.  It is clear what he is going to do if he is on the Court.   This whole issue, this whole vote, this whole nomination comes down  to this: Whose side are you on? Are you a judge who stands on the side  of workers or multinational corporations? Will you stand on the side of  a mother seeking treatment or on the side of insurance companies who  want to raise her rates to deny her care?   Judge Kavanaugh's record is clear. He has consistently sided with the  most powerful special interests in this country--not American workers,  not American consumers, not American patients who struggle with the  cost of their healthcare. The stakes for Ohio are too high to give this  judge a lifetime appointment to our highest Court.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that several documents  corroborating Dr. Ford's allegations against Judge Kavanaugh and a  statement from Dr. Ford's attorneys be printed in the Record   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    October 5, 2018.    Statement by Debra S. Katz, Lisa J. Banks and Michael R. Bromwich,                  attorneys for Dr. Christine Blasey Ford         As the Senate debates the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh,       numerous false claims have been repeated to undermine the       credibility of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford. Whatever the       outcome, Senators deserve to know the truth:        1. An FBI investigation that did not include interviews of       Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh is not a meaningful       investigation in any sense of the word.        2. Had the FBI interviewed Dr. Ford, she would have       answered questions about Judge Kavanaugh's assault, including       questions that Ms. Mitchell and the Judiciary Committee       members failed to ask during the hearing. She would have       provided corroborating evidence, including her medical       records and access to the phone from which she sent messages       to a reporter about the assault prior to his nomination to       the Supreme Court.        3. The suggestion that our refusal to give medical records       to the Judiciary Committee bears on Dr. Ford's credibility is       completely false. The Committee has released every document       we have exchanged, and in the case of their letters to us,       sometimes before we received them. We lost confidence in the       Committee's ability or desire to maintain the confidentiality       of materials and information we provided, especially with       respect to something as sensitive as medical records.        4. Dr. Ford wanted to detail the events of the sexual       assault by Judge Kavanaugh directly to members of the       Judiciary Committee. Dr. Ford was timely provided with all       communications from the Majority's staff and chose from the       multiple options she was given by them. At the hearing, Dr.       Ford understood Senator Grassley's comment to be that he       personally would have flown to California to speak with her.       She would have welcomed Senator Grassley and other Committee       members to California but that was not one of the options       offered by Committee staff.        5. At no time did members of Dr. Ford's team advise       Committee staff that she could not travel to Washington, D.C.       because of her fear of flying. Rather, staff was told that       Dr. Ford could not travel on the schedule the Committee       demanded because she was focused on taking measures to       protect her family from threats, including death threats.       Those measures included meeting with the FBI to report these       disturbing threats. In fact, Dr. Ford does have a decades-      long fear of flying for which she takes medication prescribed       by a physician, but this had no impact on the timing of her       testimony.        6. Committee staff repeatedly rejected our requests for       multiple corroborating witnesses to be allowed to testify,       including Jeremiah Hanafin, the highly experienced former FBI       agent who administered the polygraph to Dr. Ford on August 7,       2018. He was also prepared to cooperate with the FBI's       investigation, including making the underlying polygraph       results and process available. Had Mr. Hanafin been permitted       to testify or been interviewed by the FBI, he would have       explained that his conclusions of ``no deception'' were       validated by four independent outside reviewers. There were       seven people whom Dr. Ford told about the assault prior to       the nomination who could have testified to the Committee or       been interviewed by the FBI.        In her testimony, Dr. Ford said: ``It is not my       responsibility to determine whether Mr.  [[Page S6678]]       Kavanaugh deserves to sit on the Supreme Court. My       responsibility is to tell the truth.''        We believe Christine Blasey Ford and we fully support her.       Senators claiming to want a dignified debate should not       repeat lies constructed by the Judiciary Committee that were       cynically designed to win support for Judge Kavanaugh.                                   ____                                                      July 30, 2018.      Confidential       Senator Dianne Feinstein.        Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing with information       relevant in evaluating the current nominee to the Supreme       Court. As a constituent, I expect that you will maintain this       as confidential until we have further opportunity to speak.        Brett Kavanaugh physically and sexually assaulted me during       High School in the early 1980's. He conducted these acts with       the assistance of his close friend, Mark G. Judge. Both were       1-2 years older than me and students at a local private       school. The assault occurred in a suburban Maryland area home       at a gathering that included me and 4 others. Kavanaugh       physically pushed me into a bedroom as I was headed for a       bathroom up a short stairwell from the living room. They       locked the door and played loud music, precluding any       successful attempts to yell for help. Kavanaugh was on top of       me while laughing with Judge, who periodically jumped onto       Kavanaugh. They both laughed as Kavanaugh tried to disrobe me       in their highly inebriated state. With Kavanaugh's hand over       my mouth, I feared he may inadvertently kill me. From across       the room, a very drunken Judge said mixed words to Kavanaugh       ranging from ``go for it'' to ``stop''. At one point when       Judge jumped onto the bed, the weight on me was substantial.       The pile toppled, and the two scrapped with each other. After       a few attempts to get away, I was able to take this opportune       moment to get up and run across to a hallway bathroom. I       locked the bathroom door behind me. Both loudly stumbled down       the stairwell, at which point other persons at the house were       talking with them. I exited the bathroom, ran outside of the       house and went home.        I have not knowingly seen Kavanaugh since the assault. I       did see Mark Judge once at the Potomac Village Safeway, where       he was extremely uncomfortable seeing me.        I have received medical treatment regarding the assault. On       July 6, I notified my local government representative to ask       them how to proceed with sharing this information. It is       upsetting to discuss sexual assault and its repercussions,       yet I felt guilty and compelled as a citizen about the idea       of not saying anything.        I am available to speak further should you wish to discuss.       I am currently vacationing in the mid-Atlantic until August       7th and will be in California after August 10th.            In Confidence,                                                  Christine Blasey,      Palo Alto, California.                                   ____       Text Messages Between Dr. Ford and the Washington Post Tip Line                             friday, july 6, 2018         10:26 AM: Dr. Ford--Potential Supreme Court nominee with       assistance from his friend assaulted me in mid 1980s in       Maryland.

Feel like I       shouldn't be quiet but not willing to put family in DC and CA       through a lot of stress        11:47 AM: Dr. Ford--Brett Kavanaugh with Mark Judge and a       bystander named PJ.                            tuesday, july 10, 2018         8:03 AM: Dr. Ford--Been advised to contact senators or NYT.       Haven't heard back from WaPo.        9:21 AM: Washington Post--I will get you in touch with       reporter                                   ____                         Declaration of Russell Ford         I, Russell Ford, hereby state that I am over eighteen (18)       years of age, am competent to testify, and have personal       knowledge of the following facts:        1. I have a Master of Science degree and a Doctor of       Philosophy degree in mechanical engineering from Stanford       University.        2. I have been married to Christine Blasey Ford since June       2002. We have two children.        3. The first time I learned that Christine had any       experience with sexual assault was around the time we got       married, although she did not provide any details.        4. Christine shared the details of the sexual assault       during a couple's therapy session in 2012. She said that in       high school she had been trapped in a room and physically       restrained by one boy who was molesting her while another boy       watched. She said she was eventually able to escape before       she was raped, but that the experience was very traumatic       because she felt like she had no control and was physically       dominated.        5. I remember her saying that the attacker's name was Brett       Kavanaugh, that he was a successful lawyer who had grown up       in Christine's home town, and that he was well-known in the       Washington, D.C. community.        6. In the years following the therapy session, we spoke a       number of times about how the assault affected her.        7. The next time she mentioned that Mr. Kavanaugh was the       person who sexually assaulted her was when President Trump       was in the process of selecting his first nominee for the       Supreme Court. Before the President had announced that Judge       Neil Gorsuch was the nominee, I remember Christine saying she       was afraid the President might nominate Mr. Kavanaugh.        8. These conversations about Mr. Kavanaugh started again       shortly after Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his       resignation and the media began reporting that Mr. Kavanaugh       was on the President's ``short list.''        9. Christine was very conflicted about whether she should       speak publicly about what Mr. Kavanaugh had done to her, as       she knew it would be emotionally trying for her to relive       this traumatic experience in her life and hard on our family       to deal with the inevitable public reaction. However, in the       end she believed her civic duty required her to speak out.        10. In our 16 years of marriage I have always known       Christine to be a truthful person of great integrity. I am       proud of her for her bravery and courage.        I solemnly swear or affirm under the penalties of perjury       that the matters set forth in this Declaration are true and       correct to the best of my personal knowledge, information,       and belief. Executed on this 25th day of September, 2018.

I graduated from Amherst College in 1992 with a       Bachelor's Degree in History. I earned my Juris Doctor degree       from Vanderbilt Law School in 1997.        2. I have known Christine Blasey Ford and her husband,       Russell Ford, for more than five years, and consider them       close friends.        3. We met when I was coaching their son's baseball team.       Our children are close friends and have played sports       together for years. I have spent a lot of time with Christine       and her husband traveling to and attending our kids' games.       Our families have also gone on vacation together.        4. The first time I learned that Christine had experienced       sexual assault was in early summer of 2016. We were standing       together in a public place watching our children play       together.        5. I remember the timing of the conversation because it was       shortly after Stanford University student Brock Turner was       sentenced for felony sexual assault after raping an       unconscious woman on Stanford's campus. There was a common       public perception that the judge gave Mr. Turner too light of       a sentence.        6. Christine expressed anger at Mr. Turner's lenient       sentence, stating that she was particularly bothered by it       because she was assaulted in high school by a man who was now       a federal judge in Washington, D.C.        7. Christine did not mention the assault to me again until       June 29, 2018, two days after Justice Anthony Kennedy       announced his resignation from the Supreme Court of the       United States.        8. On June 29, 2018, she wrote me an email in which she       stated that the person who assaulted her in high school was       the President's ``favorite for SCOTUS.''        9. On June 29, 2018, I responded with an email in which I       stated:        ``I remember you telling me about him, but I don't remember       his name. Do you mind telling me so I can read about him?''        10. Christine responded by email and stated:        ``Brett Kavanaugh''        11. In all of my dealings with Christine I have known her       to be a serious and honorable person.        I solemnly swear or affirm under the penalties of perjury       that the matters set forth in this Declaration are true and       correct to the best of my personal knowledge, information,       and belief. Executed on this 24th day of September, 2018.

I have known Christine Blasey Ford for over 10 years and       consider her to be a good friend. Our children attended       elementary school together.        2. In June of 2013, Christine and I met at a restaurant       that was then called Pizzeria Venti Mountain View, located at       1390 Pear Avenue, Mountain View, California.        3. I remembered the year of the meeting because I was       temporarily working in the South Bay at that time. I would       pass Mountain View on my way home, so that restaurant was a       convenient place to arrange a meeting. I believe this was the       only time I ever went to this restaurant. I also have a       receipt from the restaurant from that meal.        4. During our meal, Christine was visibly upset, so I asked       her what was going on.        5. Christine told me she had been having a hard day because       she was thinking about an assault she experienced when she       was much younger. She said that she had been almost raped by       someone who was now a federal judge. She told me she had been       trapped in a room with two drunken guys, and that she then       escaped, ran away, and hid.        6. Christine said it was a scary situation and that it has       impacted her life ever since.        7. The last time I saw Christine was in May 2018.  [[Page S6679]]             8. After reading her first person account of the assault in       The Washington Post on September 16, 2018, I contacted       Christine's lawyers to advise them that she had told me about       this assault in 2013.

HanaFin--Polygraph Examination Report         Date of Report--08/10/2018.        Date of Examination--08/07/2018.        Location of Examination--Hilton Hotel, 1739 West Nursery       Road, Linthicum Heights, MD 21090.        Examinee's Name--Christine Blasey.        Synopsis--On August 7, 2018, Christine Blasey reported to       the Hilton Hotel, 1739 West Nursery Road, Linthicum Heights,       MD 21090, for the purpose of undergoing a polygraph       examination. The examination was to address whether Blasey       was physically assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh while attending a       small party in Montgomery County, MD. This assault occurred       in the 1980's when Blasey was a high school student at the       Holton-Arms School. Accompanying Blasey was Attorney Lisa       Banks of the firm Katz, Marshall & Banks. After introductions       were made, this examiner left the room so Blasey and Attorney       Banks could discuss this matter. During this discussion,       Blasey provided a written statement to Banks detailing the       events that occurred on the evening of the assault. The       statement was provided to this examiner when he returned.       Blasey stated that the statement was true and correct and       signed it in the presence of this examiner and Banks       attesting to its accuracy. A copy of this statement is       attached to this report. After a brief discussion, Banks       departed.        Blasey was then interviewed in an effort to formulate the       relevant questions. During this interview, Blasey described       the events that occurred on the night of the assault. She       stated she attended a small party at a house where the       parents were not home. Those attending the party were       drinking beer. Blasey stated that Kavanaugh and his friend,       Mark, became extremely intoxicated. Blasey stated that she       had met Kavanaugh before at previous parties and she briefly       dated one of his friends. She stated that Kavanaugh attended       Georgetown Preparatory School and she previously attended       parties hosted by students of this school. Blasey remembers       another male at this party, PJ, who she described as a very       nice person. At some point in the evening, Blasey went       upstairs to use the restroom. When she got upstairs, she was       pushed into a bedroom by either Kavanaugh or his friend,       Mark. The bedroom was located across from the bathroom. She       was pushed onto a bed and Kavanagh got on top of her and       attempted to take her clothes off. She stated she expected       Kavanaugh was going to rape her. Blasey tried to yell for       help and Kavanaugh put his hand over her mouth. Blasey       thought if PJ heard her yelling he may come and help her.       Blasey stated that when Kavanaugh put his hand over her mouth       that this act was the most terrifying for her. She also       stated that this act caused the most consequences for her       later in life. Blasey stated that Kavanaugh and Mark were       laughing a lot during this assault and seemed to be having a       good time. Kavanaugh was having a hard time trying to remove       Blasey's clothes because she was wearing a bathing suit       underneath them. She stated Mark was laughing and coaxing       Kavanaugh on. Blasey recalls making eye contact with Mark and       thinking he may help her. Mark continued to encourage       Kavanaugh. On a couple of occasions, Mark would come over and       jump on the bed. The last time he did this, all three became       separated and Blasey was able to get free and run to the       bathroom. She stated she locked herself in the bathroom until       she heard Kavanaugh and Mark go downstairs.        Following this interview, Blasey was given a polygraph       examination consisting of the following relevant questions:                                   Series I         A. Is any part of your statement false? Answer: No        B. Did you make up any part of your statement? Answer: No        Four polygraph charts (which included an acquaintance or       ``stim'' chart) were collected using a Dell Inspiron 15       notebook computer and Lafayette LX4000 software. This       software obtained tracings representing thoracic and       abdominal respiration, galvanic skin response, and cardiac       activity. All of these physiological tracings were stored in       the computer along with the time that the questions were       asked as well as text of each question.        The format of the test was the two question Federal You       Phase Zone Comparison Test (ZCT). As part of a 2011 meta-      analysis study done by the American Polygraph Association       (APA), the ZCT is one of the polygraph examinations       considered valid based upon defined research protocol. As       part of the validation process, the APA chose techniques that       were reported in the Meta 22 Analytic Survey of Validated       Techniques (2011) as having two, independent studies that       describe the criterion validity and reliability. The ZCT       includes relevant questions addressing the issues to be       resolved by the examination, comparison questions to be used       in analysis, symptomatic questions, and neutral or irrelevant       questions. All questions were reviewed with Blasey prior to       the test. The charts collected were subjected to a numerical       evaluation that scored the relative strength of physiological       reactions to relevant questions with those of the comparison       questions. An analysis was conducted using a three (3) point       scale (-1, 0, +1). If reactions were deemed to be greater at       the relevant questions, then a negative score was assigned.       If responses were deemed to be greater at the comparison       questions, then a positive score was assigned. A decision of       deceptive is rendered if any individual question score is -3       or less or the grand total of both questions is -4 or less. A       decision of non-deceptive is rendered if the grand total of       both questions is +4 or more with a +1 or more at each       question.        Blasey's scores utilizing the three (3) point scale are +4       at Question A and +5 at Question B with a total score of +9.       Based upon this analysis, it is the professional opinion of       this examiner that Blasey's responses to the above relevant       questions are Not Indicative of Deception.        A second analysis was conducted utilizing a scoring       algorithm developed by Raymond Nelson, Mark Handler and       Donald Krapohl (Objective Scoring System Version 3) which       concluded ``No Significant Reactions--Probability these       results were produced by a deceptive person is .002.''       Truthful results, reported as ``No Significant Reactions,''       occur when the observed p-value indicates a statistically       significant difference between the observed numerical score       and that expected from deceptive test subjects, using       normative data obtained through bootstrap training with the       confirmed single issue examinations from the development       sample. Truthful results can only occur when the probability       of deception is less than .050.        Deceptive results, in which an observed p-value indicates a       statistically significant difference between the observed       numerical score and that expected from truthful persons, and       are reported as ``Significant Reactions.''        When the observed p-value fails to meet decision alpha       thresholds for truthful or deceptive classification the test       result will be reported as ``Inconclusive.'' No opinion can       be rendered regarding those results.        A third analysis was conducted utilizing a scoring       algorithm developed by the Johns Hopkins University Applied       Physics Laboratory (PolyScore Version 7.0) which concluded       ``No Deception Indicated--Probability of Deception is Less       Than .02.''        One high school summer in 80's, I went to a small party in       the Montgomery County area. There were 4 boys and a couple of       girls. At one point, I went up a small stairwell to use the       restroom. At that time, I was pushed into a bedroom and was       locked in the room and rushed onto a bed. Two boys were in       the room. Brett laid on top of me and tried to remove my       clothes while groping me. He held me down and put his hand on       my mouth to stop me from screaming for help. His friend Mark       was also in the room and both were laughing. Mark jumped on       top of us 2 or 3 times. I tried to get out from under       unsuccessfully. Then Mark jumped again and we toppled over. I       managed to run out of the room across, to the bathroom and       lock the door. Once I heard them go downstairs, I ran out of       the house and went home.                                                   Christine Blasey,                                                    August 7, 2018.     I yield the floor.
