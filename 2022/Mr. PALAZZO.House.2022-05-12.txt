 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  submit extraneous materials.    Mr. Speaker, today, I stand here to recognize and honor  the servicemembers of the National Guard and Reserve components.   Over the last few years, our National Guard soldiers have been more  in the spotlight than ever before. These men and women proved true to  their motto of ``Always Ready, Always There,'' as they face some of our  Nation's toughest times.   We have seen guardsmen from all over the country help in ways we  never thought would be needed or possible: a 5-month deployment to  defend the U.S. Capitol; to assist in an attempt to secure the southern  border; to aiding our healthcare workers in the delivery of COVID-19  vaccinations and other COVID-related assignments. These men and women  leave behind their loved ones and livelihoods to assist all Americans  when we most need it.   Today is an opportunity for Members of the House to thank these brave  soldiers for the tremendous work and sacrifice our Guard and Reserve  servicemembers have endured since the first muster of militia forces to  present day.   There are a lot of issues that divide our Nation and Congress, but I  know for certain that support for our National Guard and Reserve  continues to be bipartisan. I am proud of the work we are doing to  assist these soldiers, their families, and the mission.   Not all Members have a military base, but almost everyone has a  National Guard Armory and National Guardsmen in their district.   I look forward to hearing from more of my colleagues today as we take  this moment to thank them for their service.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Kahele), the  co-chair of the National Guard and Reserve Components Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my cochair, Representative Kahele,  for his remarks. Also to be noted, the Representative is an Air Force  veteran, and he is also a current Air National Guardsman. He has served  in multiple theaters including Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation  Iraqi Freedom. So we appreciate his service to the Nation not just as a  Representative but also as a veteran.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the State of Mississippi  (Mr. Kelly), who has spent 36 years in the Mississippi Army National  Guard. He currently serves as a major general throughout his  deployments. He has also earned two Bronze Stars, the Combat Action  Badge, and the Bronze, Silver, and Gold de Fleury Medals for his  service. He also serves on the Armed Services Committee where he is a  huge asset for our Nation.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Kelly for his remarks  and his service.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin), who is  a former Texas Army Guard and U.S. Army Reserve officer. He has over  seven major commands and over 25,000 guardsmen in his great State. I  know he is a huge supporter of them.     Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Babin for his  service not only in the military but also in the U.S. House of  Representatives. Also I thank him for what the Texas National Guard is  doing to try to secure our border in Texas.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Carey).  Representative Carey also is a former Army Guard officer. He represents  18,000 guardsmen. Actually, Ohio has 18,000 guardsmen and nine major  commands Army and Air. So I thank my friend for his service and for his  participation tonight.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Carey. I know the State  is very proud of his support of the Ohio National Guard and all the  military services that he has.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Owens). Burgess  Owens represents Utah's Fourth Congressional District, a State that has  11 major commands and over 7,500 guardsmen. Fortunately, Representative  Owens serves on the Judiciary Committee and the Subcommittee on Crime,  Terrorism and Homeland Security, so I know he appreciates our guardsmen  and servicemembers, and he is looking out after the homeland.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Bergman), who is from Michigan's First Congressional District.  Representative Bergman was a lieutenant general in the United States  Marine Corps. Semper Fi. He is also, notably, the highest-ranking  combat veteran to have ever served in the House of Representatives.    General Bergman, being over the 4th Marine Division  gives you insight that many people don't understand. Being able to  connect the relationships between the actual serving member, their  family, and their employer is extremely important.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from the great State of  Mississippi (Mr. Guest). He represents Mississippi's Third  Congressional District. Michael also serves as the vice ranking member  on the Homeland Security Committee, so he definitely takes homeland  security and national security very seriously. He loves the Guard so  much, he even hired a retired Adjutant General to serve on his staff.  Thank you for being here.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia's  Ninth District (Mr. Clyde). Congressman Clyde has served as a U.S. Navy  officer for over 28 years, with three combat deployments to Kuwait and  Iraq. We appreciate him being here to support our National Guard and  Reserve components.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas' Sixth  Congressional District (Mr. Ellzey). Congressman Ellzey is a graduate  of the U.S. Naval Academy and flew 860 helicopters, F-14 Tomcats, FA-18  Hornets, and Super Hornets, and served five combat tours in Afghanistan  and two in Iraq.   If I may just note, since you are a graduate of the Naval Academy, I  actually happen to serve on the Board of Visitors for the Naval  Academy. My best experience was in 2011 when a little team called  Southern Miss, the Golden Eagles from Hattiesburg, Mississippi, was  able to travel up to Annapolis and put a beatdown on the Naval Academy.  It only happened once, but once in a lifetime is good for me.    Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Oklahoma's  First Congressional District (Mr. Hern), my good friend. He has five  major commands and over 10,000 guardsmen.   From his actions and deeds, he is truly supportive of not just our  Active Duty but our Guard and Reserve components. Thank you for being  here tonight.                                time  1800     Mr. Speaker, at this time I recognize a colleague of  mine from Virginia's Sixth District. He has seven major commands and  over 9,000 guardsmen. I would like to note he serves on the  Appropriations Committee. Ninety-two percent of all funding that  guardsmen receive comes from the Federal Government through his  committee.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Cline).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Cline so much for his  remarks.   At this time, I would like to introduce Congressman Carter from  Georgia's First Congressional District, where they host eight major  commands in his State and over 16,000 patriotic guardsmen.    Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Carter for those  wonderful remarks.   Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining?    Madam Speaker, as a former Marine Corps reservist and  current member of the National Guard, I am proud to represent my fellow  Mississippi guardsmen in Congress.   It is no secret that Mississippi has a continued history of support  of our Armed Forces. The south Mississippi community understands what  backing our military every step of the way truly means.   I am proud to have been able to lead the way on a project that  directly benefits the guardsmen in Mississippi and across America.   The Mobilization and Annual Training Equipment Site, MATES, located  at Camp Shelby, would update the current MATES facility that was built  in 1984 and was designed to handle smaller models of armored vehicles.  This new facility would construct 52,000-square feet of maintenance  training bays and supporting facilities that are currently being  utilized to maintain the equipment that supports the readiness of two  heavy brigade teams.   As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I am happy to have been  able to assist our guardsmen in securing funding for this project in  the fiscal year 2022 omnibus bill.   The MATES facility at Camp Shelby is a crucial asset to south  Mississippi and our national defense. These funds will make the work of  our National Guard at Camp Shelby safer and more efficient as well as  boost the surrounding economy.   The National Guard and Reserve Caucus is committed to pursuing  legislative and policy initiatives that ensure the National Guard and  Reserve components have strong representation on policy, procurement,  force structure, and utilization within the Department of Defense.   This caucus is one of the largest and most bipartisan caucuses in the  House. As co-chair of this caucus, I am excited to highlight a few of  the caucus' legislative priorities and recent policy wins for our  guardsmen.   H.R. 3626, the National Guard and Reserve Incentive Pay Parity Act  was included in the final version of the NDAA and was signed into law  on December 27, 2021. This legislation would require the military to  provide Reserve and National Guard servicemembers incentive and special  duty pay at the same rate as their Active Duty counterparts. I am also  thankful for previous Co-Chair Tim Ryan's leadership on this bill that  will ensure guardsmen are receiving pay parity.    Additionally, I was proud to see current Co-Chair Kai Kahele's 1095  Rule Amendment Act included in the most recent NDAA that recently went  into effect. This law will strengthen the National Guard and Reserve by  increasing the maximum days reservists can serve on Active Duty. I  thank Congressman Kahele for his steadfast work on this victory that  directly benefits all guardsmen.   Going forward, the caucus will continue to push on legislative  priorities that will benefit our guardsmen and reservists. I encourage  all of my colleagues to join the caucus and receive monthly updates on  legislation that benefits the National Guard and Reserve components and  also share with the caucus success stories of their own National Guard.   Madam Speaker, I am about to close, but I have one more gentleman I  would like to yield time to.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Weber).                          A Tribute to Mickey Gilley     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his remarks. I  thank you, Madam Speaker, for allowing me to host this Special Order  today. It was great to hear from each of my colleagues on the  importance of our Guardsmen and Reservists. I thank all who  participated, and I look forward to working together on the issues that  lie ahead.   Finally, I thank all our National Guardsmen, our Reservists, and  their families. The work you are doing is making America better, you  are making America safer, and I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
