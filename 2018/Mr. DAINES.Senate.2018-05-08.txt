 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the service and  achievements of an esteemed and valued member of our Armed Forces, RDML  Leonard C. Dollaga, U.S. Navy, on the unanimous confirmation of his  promotion on Thursday, April 26, 2018.   Over the past 2 years, I have had the pleasure of working with  Admiral Dollaga in his capacity as Director of the Navy's  Appropriations Matters Office. As the principal representative of the  Secretary of the Navy and the Chief of Naval Operations to the Senate  and House Appropriations Committees, he has provided invaluable support  to Members and committee staff in presenting the budgetary needs of the  Department of the Navy for our consideration and ensured timely and  transparent communication flow to support Congress's enactment of  appropriations for fiscal years 2017 and 2018. Throughout that time,  Admiral Dollaga has provided superior support to me during a number of  engagements with political and military leaders across the Asia-Pacific  region. I would like to share with you some highlights of his fine  career.   For the past 28 years, Admiral Dollaga excelled in leading our Navy's  sailors aboard fast-attack and fleet ballistic missile submarines. He  served sea tours on the USS Los Angeles, SSN 688; USS Rhode Island,  SSBN 740 (Blue); and USS Cheyenne, SSN 773. He commanded USS Charlotte,  SSN 766, followed by a command tour as commodore of Submarine  Development Squadron Twelve, where he was in charge of nine fast-attack  submarines and led the tactical development of the U.S. Submarine  Force.   Ashore, his assignments enabled him to positively impact the  submarine  [[Page S2547]]  force and Navy. He served as an admissions officer at the U.S. Naval  Academy; the technical assistant to the director of Naval Nuclear  Propulsion; the nuclear officer program manager and submarine officer  community manager on the staff of the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations,  Manpower, Personnel, Training, and Education; the prospective  commanding officer instructor for the Pacific submarine force; and the  chief of the program and budget branch on the Joint Staff, Program and  Budget Analysis Division. His current assignment as director of the  Navy's Appropriations Matters Office, FMBE, exposed him to the widest  possible view of the Department of the Navy's budgetary requirements  within the broader context of the national defense arena, preparing him  well for future leadership at the highest levels of our Navy.   As Admiral Dollaga departs the Pentagon for his next assignment, I  want to take this opportunity to urge my colleagues to join me in  extending our congratulations to him on his promotion; to thank him,  his wife, Lani, and his family for their years of service; and to wish  him ``fair winds and following seas'' as he continues to lead our Navy  in the years ahead.   Thank you.                            ____________________
