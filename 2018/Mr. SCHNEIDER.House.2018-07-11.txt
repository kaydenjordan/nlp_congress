 Mr. Speaker, another week, another two blatant  attempts by this administration to sabotage the Affordable Care Act.   On Saturday, the Trump administration announced it is ending payments  that help insurers meet the requirement to cover individuals with  preexisting conditions. These risk adjustment payments pool risk for  insurers so all Americans can be covered, not just the healthiest few.   Just yesterday, the Trump administration announced it is slashing  funds for healthcare navigators by 70 percent. These navigators are the  individuals trained to help Americans compare and enroll in plans.  Without navigator assistance, more Americans will struggle to enroll,  and more people will go uninsured.  [[Page H6051]]    These changes and other actions previously announced by this  administration will result in higher premiums for millions of  individuals and small businesses.   Remember this: the 130 million Americans, those of us with  preexisting conditions, will pay the heaviest price.   This cynical effort to diminish access to quality, affordable care  has to stop. The Trump administration needs to abandon its effort to  undermine the ACA and instead start working with those of us who want  to improve, rather than tear down, our healthcare system.                            ____________________
