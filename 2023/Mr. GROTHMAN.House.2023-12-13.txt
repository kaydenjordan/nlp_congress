 Mr. Chair, I thank Ms. Foxx for making Biblical  allusions. Last week, we were here talking about National Bible Week.  One of the phrases that you run across again and again as you read the  Bible is that God promised Abraham a land flowing of milk and honey. I  will let the body decide what type of milk the Lord was promising  Abraham. I think I know.   As somebody who has been drinking milk my whole life, I can tell you  a better tasting milk, and a milk that I think is more likely to be  consumed, is whole milk. For some reason, the current administration is  waging war on milk. The USDA's current restrictions on school lunches  are limiting nutritious options for kids. This comes at a time when it  is found that 90 percent of Americans do not eat enough dairy to meet  the dietary recommendations.   Drinking milk leads to better bone health and lower risk for type 2  diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Additionally, milk stands as a  leading and accessible source of nine essential nutrients that children  often fall short of.   Proposed guidelines such as limiting milk options by age group and  counting milk fat against weekly saturated allowance threaten to  deprive students of essential nutrients.   It is crucial that students have access to the nutritional benefits  of milk. With these restrictions, they might choose to forgo milk  entirely, if you have to drink the less tasty 1 percent, or even worse,  fat-free milk.   These proposed restrictions ignore several recent research studies  examining the effect of higher fat milk consumption which found that it  is associated with lower childhood obesity and concluded that dietary  guidelines that recommend reduced-fat milk versions might not provide a  benefit in lowering the risk of childhood obesity, which we are all  for.   I implore each of you to consider the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act  of 2023 as a commonsense solution to ensure that we have healthy  children.   Mr. Chair, I ask my fellow Members to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 1147.    Mr. Speaker, like most Americans, I happened to be in  the room because I am on the committee and was a little bit startled  and stunned by the lack of concern for rampant anti-Semitism in the  most prominent universities in this country--the leaders who were  chosen to lead those universities.   We have to ask ourselves why is it happening on our premier campuses?   I can go out in Wisconsin, all the hard workers in the factories, all  the hard workers on the farms, all the people working in retail, I  don't see any evidence of this. As a matter of fact, I don't think  there is anywhere in the State of Wisconsin I would go and find this  sort of thing.   Nevertheless, we seem to be fighting it in our universities.   The question is: Why is that so? Is there anything out there that  would give an indication that you have a possibility of anti-Semitism?   Part of it, I think, is coming from recent immigrants who are  carrying grievances from long ago to the United States, but the more  concerning one is the spoiled, upper-middle classes that make up so  many of the college students and professors.  [[Page H6910]]    I think what we are coming out of is what I will call the bored  upper-middle classes looking for something to do and the unhappiness  out of that boredom that leads them to anti-American, but also anti- Semitic and anti-Israel. Because when they see Gaza and Israel, they  see one successful Western country and they see an unsuccessful crooked  country, and it leads them to be so mentally muddled up that they can't  see what is wrong with the horrific murders that took place.    Madam Speaker, over the next month, there is going to  be more discussion with regard to what is going on in Ukraine and  whether we should have more Ukraine aid. I will emphasize, again, there  is not enough discussion about how this war is going to end because  eventually all wars end.   Madam Speaker, I think if you talk to the Biden administration, they  have no plan nor vision as to what that war is going to look like a  month or a year from now. One thing I will point out is that you are  dealing with two countries who already have a shortage of young people  and who should want this war to end. Ukraine has the second-lowest  birth rate in the world. There is also a low birth rate in Russia, and  a lot of people are moving to the United States.   During the Korean war, a bloodier war than this, President Eisenhower  had a negotiation with the North Koreans and Red China, arguably the  two most evil regimes in the last century. Nevertheless, he didn't say:  Oh, we can't negotiate with Putin.   He negotiated with completely evil people, and tens of thousands of  Koreans are probably alive today because of what President Eisenhower  did.                            ____________________
