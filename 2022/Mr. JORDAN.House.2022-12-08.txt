 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Democrats want Americans to believe that the Supreme  Court at any moment--in fact, the chairman just referenced this--at any  moment could step in and overturn its opinions in Obergefell and  Loving. It is just not true. The Supreme Court is not poised to  overturn its opinions in either of those decisions.   Just look at what the Court has said. The Dobbs opinion does not  undermine other substantive due process rights in any way. Just in case  anyone is not clear on the meaning of does not undermine them in any  way, the Court later reiterated that the Dobbs decision should not be  misunderstood or mischaracterized `` . . . to cast doubt on precedents  that do not concern abortion.''   The Court condemned the alarmist idea that the Dobbs decision would  lead to the overturning of other cases as ``perhaps . . . designed to  stoke unfounded fear that our decision will imperil those other rights  . . . ''   It is that unfounded fear that brings us here today.   Democrats have conjured up this nonexistent threat based on one line  in Justice Thomas' concurrence in Dobbs, and they are misunderstanding  or deliberately misrepresenting what Justice Thomas wrote.   Justice Thomas made the same point that he has made for years: that  the collection of rights secured by the doctrine of substantive due  process is better understood as being a function of the Constitution's  privileges and immunities clause. That is it.    From his statement that a body of law should flow from one place in  the Constitution instead of another comes the hyperbolic arguments that  we have heard about the necessity of this bill.   After the House last considered this bill in July, the Senate was  forced to make significant changes to the bill. Unfortunately, those  changes do not go far enough in protecting religious liberty.   For example, the Senate amendment does not protect a private entity  that is determined to be a State actor as a result of the services they  provide on behalf of a government. These entities could be adoption  agencies, shelters, or other service providers operated by a religious  organization under contract with a city or State.   Across the country, people of faith serve their neighbors and their  communities through these charitable efforts, but this bill could force  them to abandon their faith or abandon the service. That is an  unacceptable outcome in the United States.   For years, the Democrats have been playing a dangerous game with the  Court. They want Americans to believe that the Court lacks transparency  and struggles with its ethics. That is simply not true.   This bill is simply the latest installment of the Democrat's campaign  to intimidate the highest court in our land. They have engaged in a  smear campaign against sitting Justices and nominees. Democrats have  stood on the steps of the Court and threatened Justices by name for not  ruling the way they want in high-profile cases. Democrat members of the  Judiciary Committee, including the chairman, have introduced a bill to  pack the Court; to add four Justices to our highest court--not one, not  two, not three, but four, because they simply want to take it over.   Democrats have held hearings to showcase fringe legal and conspiracy  theories about the Court and its rulings.   In fact, later today, the Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing to  again suggest that the Court has somehow been compromised based on a  totally unsubstantiated allegation that Justice Alito leaked  information 8 years  [[Page H8829]]  ago about an opinion in the Hobby Lobby case.   There is just one problem: Justice Alito denies this allegation. The  individual who allegedly was the conduit for the leak denies it ever  happened. Even the media admits there are holes in the story.   Politico said this:         We spent several months attempting to corroborate the       allegation but was unable to locate anyone who heard about       the decision directly from Alito or his wife before the       release of the case.    The New York Times reported that there are ``gaps'' in the  allegation. The New York Times is the one who broke the story. They  reported there are gaps in this allegation about a leak from Justice  Alito 8 years ago. Gaps in an allegation.   Do you know what that is? That is liberal-speak for that story  doesn't add up. But the Democrats are determined to not let the truth  get in the way of their story and their intimidation tactics on the  Court.   This is not the way we are supposed to operate. I hope that we can  vote this bill down. I hope it does not pass because I think it is  dangerous and takes the country in the wrong direction.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from the great State of Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from the great State of Virginia (Mr. Good).    I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from the great State of Michigan (Mr. Walberg).    Mr. Speaker, I would just first say, the previous speaker  talked about being out of step with the American people.   Are you kidding me?   The Democrats are the party who think men can use women's restrooms;  the Democrats are the party who think boys can participate in girls'  sports; the Democrats are the party who think you can take the life of  an unborn child  [[Page H8831]]  right up until their birthday; and the Democrats are the party who  actually had a witness in committee who said that she thought men could  get pregnant.   And we are the ones who are out of step?   You have got to be kidding me.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from the great State  of Florida (Mr. Mast).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H8833]]         Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, what happened in Colorado, as the  gentleman referenced, was wrong as wrong could be. We all understand  that.   But you know what else is wrong?   The 100 churches and crisis pregnancy centers that were attacked in  the aftermath of the Dobbs decision--actually, when the leak happened.  Dozens and dozens of those attacks happened between the leak of the  opinion and the opinion itself, all designed to intimidate the Supreme  Court.   And what did this body do while that was happening and Supreme Court  Justices' homes were being--protests, harassed, all kinds of things  said about their family, an assassination attempt on one of those  justices, Justice Kavanaugh--what did this body do?    They waited a month to pass legislation to give our highest court  members the protection they needed. This body did that.   There is no place for violence. But let's be clear: Let's condemn all  of it. Let's do what we can to protect against it, and let's not stay  on this concerted effort to intimidate the Court.   By the way, Madam Speaker, we have yet to have a hearing on the leak  of the Dobbs decision, but in 1 hour and 15 minutes we are going to  have a hearing on the fake leak that was brought up about Justice Alito  in the Hobby Lobby case.   Why can't we get to the bottom of what happened earlier this year  with the Dobbs decision that resulted in all that violence--over 100  churches and crisis pregnancy centers attacked?   I would like to have a hearing on that. I hope at some point the  chairman will--we will look into doing that next year when we convene  the new Congress.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.                                time  1015     Reclaiming my time, the fact is, the Senate passed the  bill and you guys waited a month before we passed it on the House  floor, and you know that is accurate.    Justices' families; I will correct that. But you guys  waited a month to do that when they were being threatened. That is my  point.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would urge a ``no'' vote based on  arguments we have made on the floor today. I think this is--I just urge  a ``no'' vote. I think this is the wrong way to go.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 258,  nays 169, answered ``present'' 1, not voting 4, as follows:                               [Roll No. 513]                                 YEAS--258       Adams      Aguilar      Allred      Armstrong      Auchincloss      Axne      Bacon      Barragan      Bass      Beatty      Bera      Beyer      Bishop (GA)      Blumenauer      Blunt Rochester      Bonamici      Bourdeaux      Bowman      Boyle, Brendan F.
