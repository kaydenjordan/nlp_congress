 Madam Speaker, we are a government of the people, by  the people, and for the people, but our brothers and sisters, our  fellow Americans on the island of Puerto Rico are not recognized as a  government by the people. Puerto Rican Americans received citizenship  105 years ago today.  [[Page H1270]]    If we are going to truly be the land of the free, we must make good  on America's promise to be a government of the people for all people.  We need to be who we say we are. We need to be the country where every  voice and every person matters. For over a century, the residents of  Puerto Rico have been treated as second-class citizens within our  country. It is un-American and it is unjust.   Second-class citizens not only in their vote, but also in healthcare,  senior assistance, and the Child Tax Credit. This is wrong. Today, on  the 105th anniversary of the citizenship for Puerto Rico, it is time  for us to stand up, yet again, and declare that equal rights are an  American value, and that fairness and justice are American values, and  that the Americans on the island of Puerto Rico must have justice, must  have fair treatment, and must have statehood.   We fought this year to ensure that the residents of Puerto Rico would  start to receive equal treatment on Federal programs like Social  Security, Medicare, and the Child Tax Credit. This fight is not over,  and we are not giving up.   Yet, even with the weight of this fight for a century, I feel  optimistic. In fact, I feel better than I ever have before. Puerto  Ricans have spoken with a clear voice, with a fair and open vote, and  demanded that it is time for full representation.   I am grateful for the leadership of Congresswoman Gonzalez-Colon and  Congressman Soto on this issue, and I look forward to continuing the  work in Congress until we get this done.   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON. Madam Speaker, how much time do I have  remaining?
