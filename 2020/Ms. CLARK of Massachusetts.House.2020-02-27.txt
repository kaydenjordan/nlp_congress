 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor my  constituent, friend, and mentor, Joe Lawless.   Joe loved his home city of Malden, Massachusetts, and his city loved  him. He was a longtime supporter of the Irish American Club and of The  Immigrant Learning Center. He served Malden on the Library Board of  Trustees, the Housing Authority, and as deputy mayor.   But Joe's legacy of generosity is best described by what he did  behind the scenes. I remember Joe, while suffering from debilitating  back pain, purchasing gallons of ice cream with all the fixings to  serve sundaes for seniors. And catching a ride with Joe only to find  the back seat of his car and the entire trunk filled with food to  distribute to neighbors in need.   Joe was a natural teacher. While I was never fortunate enough to sit  in his classrooms at Boston College or Suffolk University, he taught me  so much. He was the rare friend who made everyone whose lives he  touched feel seen and appreciated, and we will all strive to live the  wisdom and lessons in friendship, integrity, and service he gave us.   Thank you, my friend. Rest in peace and love.                            ____________________
