 Madam Chair, before I begin my speech, I just want to  tell the American people, you are not hearing all the truth on this.  Sometimes my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will try to  repeat things, mislead the American people. It is rinse, lather,  repeat. The American people are smarter than that.   H.R. 1 is a priority for this Conference. It helps to modernize the  permitting process.   Madam Chair, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1, Majority  Leader Scalise's Lower Energy Costs Act, a bill I am an original  cosponsor of, helped to write, and a bill America needs now more than  ever.   I am also pleased that the House Natural Resources Committee received  primary jurisdiction. I thank the Committees on Energy and Commerce and  Transportation and Infrastructure for their important contributions as  well.   Americans put Republicans in control of the House, in part, because  we campaigned on making life more affordable and making it easier to  build. We want to let miners mine, farmers farm, builders build, and  let small businesses succeed. However, under today's permitting scheme,  that is all but impossible.   In the district I represent, we have a proposed mine that would  provide a huge resource of copper, nickel, cobalt, a huge resource of  those critical minerals that we need, and it is on year 20 of  permitting and litigation. It has a signed project labor agreement,  committed to domestic union labor for the mine's construction.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle at every turn reject  that mine as well as this administration does. This mine has won every  lawsuit thrown its way, but further frivolous litigation and endless  bureaucracy continue to mire the project year after year. We can help  to build the energy transition with domestic minerals mined by  Minnesotans, but the permitting bureaucracy stands in the way.   That is why I am proud that my own legislation, which has 33  cosponsors, the Permitting for Mining Needs Act, is included in the  base text.   PERMIT-MN creates what miners want. They want certainty. It limits  frivolous litigation, puts in place commonsense review timelines, and  just puts American miners to work, whether they are in Minnesota,  Alaska, Arizona, Nevada, California, or anywhere else.    This is about so much more than mining. If you are at all serious  about emissions reduction, you will vote to support H.R. 1.   Why? Because right now, for example, it takes years to decades to  permit transmission projects that will add wind and solar to the grid.   At our February 9 oversight hearing on permitting, American Clean  Power testified that failure to enact permitting reforms puts an  estimated 100 gigawatts of clean energy projects at risk.    Madam Chair, that means risking $100 billion worth of  investment and 150,000 potential jobs in the clean energy sector.   In the Natural Resources Committee, we have a real tangible example.  At our February 28 legislative hearing on my colleague Garret Graves'  BUILDER Act, Dairyland Power testified about the Cardinal-Hickory Creek  transmission line. This transmission line, which will put more wind  power on the grid, is about 103 miles long, but it is locked in year 7  of permitting.   We need to pass H.R. 1 for energy independence and critical mineral  dominance.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the urgent need for  permitting reform to secure America's energy future.   H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act, will modernize our outdated  permitting process for projects and allow us to unlock the full  potential of America's energy and mineral resources.   I want to discuss the mining provisions of H.R. 1, which includes my  Permitting for Mining Needs Act. The district that I represent in  northern Minnesota, Minnesota's Eighth Congressional District, has 95  percent of America's nickel reserve, almost 90 percent of America's  cobalt reserve, 75 percent of our platinum group metals, and more than  a third of our copper--all of which are minerals needed for our energy  security and mineral supply chains.   It is unconscionable that a mining project in my district for these  minerals is on year 20 of permitting and litigation.   We have the resources and the workforce here in the United States, we  just need the will, the political will, to mine here. Whether it be  mining oil and gas, wind or solar energy, we support all of the above  and all of the best energy, but you can't have all of the above and all  of the best without permitting reform.   We also need permitting reform to build transmission lines, roads,  bridges, and more. Take Dairyland Power's Cardinal-Hickory Creek  transmission line project in Wisconsin, for example. This 103-mile-long  project is designed to put more wind power on the grid, but is  currently locked in year 7 of permitting because just 1.3 miles of it  is unlucky enough to touch Federal land.   This is simply unacceptable, and we can and must do better. If we  want to establish American mineral independence and dominance and end  our current reliance on the Chinese Communist Party, we must pass H.R.  1.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from West Virginia (Mrs.  Miller).                                time  1900     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for those comments.  She is spot on.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa),  the executive vice chair of the Western Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. LaMalfa for his very spot-on  comments, as well.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Baird).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments that  rural America matters. Their voice should be heard in our Nation's  Capitol.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Kiley).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Kiley for those spot-on words.  He demonstrated that H.R. 1 will save the American people money so they  have more money in their pockets, so they can take care of their  families. He is absolutely right. Higher energy costs for oil and gas  equal the rising cost in food prices.   The next speaker is my colleague and friend from the neighboring  State of Wisconsin and one of the vice chairs of the Western Caucus.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Tiffany)  for the purpose of a colloquy.    Mr. Speaker, I am the father of 6 children and Mr.  Tiffany is the father of 3. Nobody controls that term  ``environmentalists.'' We are all environmentalists. He is right.    Absolutely.    I am.    It is the PolyMet project, NewRange. Twenty years in the  permitting process.    And the Twin Metals one, correct.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Tiffany.   Again, this is about modernizing our permitting process without  reducing any environmental standards, as he so clearly stated. We  appreciate those comments.   Mr. Speaker, as you can see, my Western Caucus colleagues have made  [[Page H1521]]  it very clear: we need permitting reform.   I thank them for their comments tonight, and I yield back the balance  of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 7 o'clock and 24 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, March 29, 2023, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
