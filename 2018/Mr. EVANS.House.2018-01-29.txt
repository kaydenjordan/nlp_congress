 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from the great State of  Georgia for introducing me and for this opportunity to talk about an  important Supreme Court case, Janus v. AFSCME, Council 31, and the  importance of our unions.   Our unions give us much to celebrate in our neighborhoods nationwide.   As we know all too well, this case stands to destabilize collective  bargaining rights within the public sector. This is clearly an attack  on freedom and liberties of hardworking Americans.   We are in the business of doing no harm. That is what we should be.   All that this case aims to do is take away the rights of the ability  of hardworking Americans to have a strong voice in their workplace.  That is just not right.   Next month, the Supreme Court will hear the oral arguments in this  case to determine whether fair share fees violate the First Amendment  rights of workers.   When it comes to this case, a negative decision for our unions  nationwide would take us in the wrong direction.   Across the country, more than half of African-American workers and  nearly 60 percent of Latino workers are paid less than $15 per hour.  Union jobs have historically been, and continue to be, a path to the  middle class for people of color, who often face low-wage jobs.   African-American union members today earn 14.7 percent more and  Latino workers earn 21.8 percent more than their nonunion counterparts.  In some sections, the difference is even greater.   African-American women in unions earn an average of $21.90 an hour,  while nonunion workers earn $17.04.                                time  2030    In addition, there are more than 72 percent of women in unions who  have health insurance, while less than 50 percent of nonunion African- American women do not.   Our unions are a key road to our growing middle class, especially for  women and communities of color. Nationwide, our unions continue to be  on the frontline of fighting for higher pay, fair wages, safer working  conditions, and better hours to provide for themselves and their  families.   I will continue to stand on the frontline of protecting rights for  all hardworking Americans. It is up to us to lift up unions in all of  our communities.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for leading this  caucus in this need.   Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis), a leader and a fighter from the  very State where Mr. Janus is from.   Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for  anchoring this session, and all of those who have come to join in it.   I read someplace the other day where there are three men in this  country who own as much of the wealth as 50 percent of all the poorest  people in this country. If it were not for organized labor, not for  unions, and the influence, millions of individuals who are middle class  would be working at peon wages. Individuals would not be able to send  their children to college, wouldn't be able to own an automobile or a  home. So we can never undermine or not understand the value of  organization.   Many of us in this room enjoy the support of organized labor. You  have got to get resources from somewhere. You have got to get money in  order to function.   If you cannot match what the big megabucks individuals can give to  maintain control of our society, how do you expect to change it?   So I am simply pleased to join with my colleagues and suggest that  nothing is more important in the distribution and redistribution of the  wealth of this country than organized labor.   Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I am so pleased that the  gentleman mentioned the important fact of the fantastic role that labor  has played. Without organized labor, there would be no middle class in  America. There would be no 40-hour workweek. Child labor laws would not  be on the books.   The role that organized labor has played cannot be communicated  better than our next speaker, the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Lee), who is a legend in standing up and fighting for working people  and labor unions.
