 Madam President, President Trump has made a superb  selection to serve as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the  United States: Judge Brett Kavanaugh of the DC Circuit. Judge Kavanaugh  possesses an impressive resume, an outstanding legal mind, and an  exemplary judicial temperament. He has served 12 years on the Nation's  most consequential circuit court. During that tenure, he has proven to  be one of the most thorough and thoughtful jurists in our country.  Importantly, that record demonstrates an understanding of a judge's  proper role in our constitutional Republic.   Judge Kavanaugh understands that in the United States of America  judges are not--not--unelected superlegislators whom we select for  their personal views or policy preferences. A judge's duty is to  interpret the plain meaning of our laws and our Constitution according  to how they are written.   Judges need to be unbiased. They need to treat all parties fairly.  They need to approach every case with open ears and an open mind.  Judges' decisions must turn on the facts of each case and be based on  the texts that it is their job to interpret.   By all accounts, Judge Kavanaugh is precisely that kind of judge. His  resume, to put it simply, is topnotch: a bachelor's degree from Yale,  with honors; a law degree, also from Yale, where he was a member of the  law review; a lecturing position at Harvard Law School, to which he was  appointed, by the way, by then-Dean and now-Justice Elena Kagan.   After graduating, he quickly built a reputation as a star law clerk,  including on the Supreme Court, for Justice Kennedy; as an energetic  and talented public servant; and as one of the preeminent legal minds  of his generation.   In 2006, the Senate confirmed him to the DC Circuit. He has compiled  an extensive record on the Federal bench. He has published more than  300 opinions and has earned considerable praise for his clear writing  and reasoning.   Judge Kavanaugh has built a long and distinguished record. It paints  a clear picture of how he would conduct himself as a member of the  Nation's highest Court. It reflects a firm understanding that judges  must interpret laws as they are written. We do not choose them to make  policy, to pick favorites, or to craft novel legislation from the  bench.   Some of our colleagues--and others on the left--seem to see the role  of judges very differently. President Obama summed up this alternate  view well when he was running for President. He explained that he  sought to appoint judges who harbored particular empathy for certain  parties in certain cases. That is great if you happen to be the party  in the case whom the judge likes. It is not so great if you are the  other guy. It doesn't align with our Nation's historical understanding  of the rule of law or the role that Federal courts play in our  democracy.   I respectfully submit that, then and now, some of our Democratic  colleagues seem to be a little confused. They seem to be confusing the  nature of a political office with the nature of a judicial office. This  would explain why some of our colleagues sound  [[Page S4848]]  eager to try and turn judicial confirmations into something like  political elections--to grill Judge Kavanaugh on policy outcomes, like  voters rightly grill all of us when we run for our seats in the Senate.   Some Democratic Senators have telegraphed that they will heed the  demands of the far-left special interest groups and try to force Judge  Kavanaugh to commit under oath to decisions he might make on particular  issues in hypothetical cases. Forget that the cases don't even exist  yet. Forget the total absence of any facts, legal arguments, or  research. Forget how inappropriate and undesirable it would be for a  judge to predetermine a ruling before either side's lawyers uttered a  single word.   That is simply not how this process has ever worked or ever could  work. I am not the one saying this. Here is what a prior Supreme Court  nominee said on this very subject: ``A judge sworn to decide  impartially can offer no forecasts, no hints, for that would show not  only disregard for the specifics of the particular case, it would  display disdain for the entire judicial process.''   Those are the words of another then-DC Circuit Court judge and  current Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg during her Senate  confirmation to the Supreme Court in 1993.   I think we all should remember that standard. We will do well to  remember that we are evaluating a judge, not debating a candidate for  political office.   Even more regrettably, a number of our Democratic colleagues could  not even wait until the President's announcement last night before  launching attacks on his nominee. This was, in some cases, quite  literally a fill-in-the-blank opposition. They wrote statements of  opposition only to fill in the name later.   Sadly, this is not a new approach for the far-left special interest  groups. Just last year, Justice Gorsuch met with partisan opposition  before the ink was even dry on his nomination. I am sorry to say that  Judge Kavanaugh seems to have already broken that record, because  Senate Democrats were on record opposing him before he had even been  named--just fill in the name, whomever it is we are against--before the  ink was even dry on Justice Kennedy's resignation.   This is a telltale sign that some of our colleagues are throwing  thoughtful independent judgment out the window and are outsourcing  their thinking on this matter to far-left special interest groups.   There has been a lot of talk about outsourcing here. If anybody is  outsourcing, it is the Democrats outsourcing what they say to these  outside groups that are demanding opposition to anyone at all costs, no  matter who it is.   As I discussed on the floor yesterday, we know exactly what this  partisan playbook looks like. It has been hauled out for most everyone  who a Republican President has nominated to the Supreme Court for the  last 40 years. It is like clockwork.   I fully anticipate that we will hear all kinds of fantastic stories  about the pain and suffering that this perfectly qualified, widely  respected judge will somehow unleash on America if we confirm him to  the Court. That kind of cheap, political fearmongering insults the  intelligence of the American people because Americans understand the  difference between a political office and a judicial office. They  understand the difference between the policymakers who throw pitches  and the judges who call balls and strikes.   I look forward to the Senate's fair consideration of this most  impressive nomination. I look forward to meeting with Judge Kavanaugh  later this morning, to hearing his testimony in committee, and to  voting on his confirmation right here on the Senate floor.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and that the Chair lay before the Senate  the message to accompany H.R. 5515.

Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:29 p.m., adjourned until  Wednesday, July 11, 2018, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
