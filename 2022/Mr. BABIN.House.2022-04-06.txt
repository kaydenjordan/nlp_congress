 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to call up H.R.  471,  [[Page H4222]]  the PAUSE Act, to protect all Americans from Biden's border crisis.    Mr. Speaker, I certainly appreciate my good friend from my  neighbor, Louisiana, Mr. Johnson, for having this Special Order.   No, it doesn't look like things are going to change, as the gentleman  said. Joe Biden has no interest in securing the southern border. He has  proven it time and time again over the last 14 months.    On day one of his Presidency, our Commander in Chief stopped  completely the construction of our border wall, which is, by the way,  something that Congress appropriated funds for and is something that we  know for a fact deters illegal crossings.   In fact, the Department of Homeland Security reported that illegal  entries in areas with the new border wall system along the Yuma sector  plummeted more than 87 percent in fiscal year 2020, compared with the  previous year of 2019.   President Biden's foolish decision to stop construction of this wall  left millions of taxpayer dollars' worth of steel just rusting away in  the hot sun and the cold, wet winters; millions of your tax dollars  simply gone to waste.   He ended remain in Mexico, a policy that The Washington Post reported  made illegal apprehensions fall by 30 percent in its very first year  alone.   He has tied the hands of ICE who, last year, deported the lowest  number of illegal aliens since 1995, despite more than 2 million alien  apprehensions. Interior enforcement is drying up to nothing.   And now he is scrapping title 42, the very last policy that saves CBP  from drowning in a complete sea of chaos.   But if all of this isn't enough to convince you that Joe Biden  doesn't have your best interests in mind, take a look at his budget  request for 2023. He wants $73 trillion--that is with a T--in spending,  $58 trillion--another T--more in taxes. And our debt will increase by  $16 trillion--with a T--over the next decade.   I did a quick search for the phrase ``border security'' in this  budget. It is mentioned twice. We are facing the worst border crisis on  record and a historic number of fentanyl overdoses from drugs illegally  smuggled into our country, over 100,000 dead Americans from drug  overdoses, and yet, the President mentioned border security only twice.   Do you know how often he mentions the word ``climate''? 187 times.   Joe Biden claims that he is working to protect America but, folks,  the facts actually say otherwise. The facts show that he doesn't care  about keeping you and your family safe. The facts show he doesn't care  about protecting the livelihood that you worked so hard for. And the  facts show that he doesn't care about the sovereignty or the security  of our great Nation that we love, a beacon of liberty and freedom for  all the world to look at and envy.   That is why they are coming here. Shame on President Biden.                                time  1945
