 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the  rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1594) to amend the Homeland Security Act  of 2002 to establish a process to review applications for certain  grants to purchase equipment or systems that do not meet or exceed any  applicable national voluntary consensus standards, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1594         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``First Responder Access to       Innovative Technologies Act''.       SEC. 2. APPROVAL OF CERTAIN EQUIPMENT.         (a) In General.--Section 2008 of the Homeland Security Act       of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 609) is amended--        (1) in subsection (f)--        (A) by striking ``If an applicant'' and inserting the       following:        ``(1) Application requirement.--If an applicant''; and        (B) by adding at the end the following new paragraphs:        ``(2) Review process.--The Administrator shall implement a       uniform process for reviewing applications that, in       accordance with paragraph (1), contain explanations to use       grants provided under section 2003 or 2004 to purchase       equipment or systems that do not meet or exceed any       applicable national voluntary consensus standards developed       under section 647 of the Post-Katrina Emergency Management       Reform Act of 2006 (6 U.S.C. 747).        ``(3) Factors.--In carrying out the review process under       paragraph (2), the Administrator shall consider the       following:        ``(A) Current or past use of proposed equipment or systems       by Federal agencies or the Armed Forces.        ``(B) The absence of a national voluntary consensus       standard for such equipment or systems.        ``(C) The existence of an international consensus standard       for such equipment or systems, and whether such equipment or       systems meets such standard.        ``(D) The nature of the capability gap identified by the       applicant and how such equipment or systems will address such       gap.        ``(E) The degree to which such equipment or systems will       serve the needs of the applicant better than equipment or       systems that meet or exceed existing consensus standards.        ``(F) Any other factor determined appropriate by the       Administrator.''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:        ``(g) Review Process.--The Administrator shall implement a       uniform process for reviewing applications to use grants       provided under section 2003 or 2004 to purchase equipment or       systems not included on the Authorized Equipment List       maintained by the Administrator.''.        (b) Inspector General Report.--Not later than three years       after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Inspector       General of the Department of Homeland Security shall submit       to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and       Governmental Affairs of the Senate a report assessing the       implementation of the review process established under       paragraph (2) of subsection (f) of section 2008 of the       Homeland Security Act of 2002 (as added by subsection (a) of       this section), including information on the following:        (1) The number of requests to purchase equipment or systems       that do not meet or exceed any applicable consensus standard       evaluated under such review process.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1594, the First  Responder Access to Innovative Technologies Act.   Our Nation's first responders put their lives on the line to ensure  all of us are safe. These brave women and men should have access to the  equipment they need to protect lives and property around the country.   One of the Department of Homeland Security's most important missions  is to help ensure the effectiveness of our Nation's emergency services  sector. Key avenues for such support are the Department's  counterterrorism grant programs: the Urban Area Security Initiative and  the State Homeland Security Grant Program.   Unfortunately, the grant guidance for these grant programs sometimes  hinders first responders' ability to acquire innovative  counterterrorism equipment. Today, each piece of equipment must meet or  exceed national voluntary consensus standards.   Although FEMA will review requests to purchase equipment that does  not meet consensus standards, the Committee on Homeland Security has  learned from stakeholders that the process lacks uniformity,  predictability, and transparency. The process for developing voluntary  consensus standards for first responder equipment has not kept pace  with the evolution of technology or the demands of first responders.   H.R. 1594 would direct FEMA to implement a standard process for  reviewing applications to purchase equipment that do not meet consensus  standards or for equipment not included on FEMA's authorized equipment  list. H.R. 1594 seeks to ensure that the safety of our first responders  remains a top priority.   As today's threats faced by first responders are constantly evolving,  it is important that our technology evolve, too. Enactment of H.R. 1594  will help ensure first responders can do their job more safely and  effectively.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, by passing this bill today, we can ensure first  responders have a reliable and uniform process for acquiring  technologies and equipment that will keep them and our communities  safe. The House unanimously passed previous versions of this bill in  the prior two Congresses.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support me in passing this  legislation today. As the gentleman from Pennsylvania said, they have  our backs, we should have their backs.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the  rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1313) to amend the Implementing  Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 to clarify certain  allowable uses of funds for public transportation security assistance  grants and establish periods of performance for such grants, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1313         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Transit Security Grant       Program Flexibility Act''.       SEC. 2. ALLOWABLE USES OF FUNDS FOR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION                     SECURITY ASSISTANCE GRANTS.         Subparagraph (A) of section 1406(b)(2) of the Implementing       Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (6 U.S.C.       1135(b)(2); Public Law 110-53) is amended by inserting ``and       associated backfill'' after ``security training''.       SEC. 3. PERIODS OF PERFORMANCE FOR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION                     SECURITY ASSISTANCE GRANTS.         Section 1406 of the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/      11 Commission Act of 2007 (6 U.S.C. 1135; Public Law 110-53)       is amended--        (1) by redesignating subsection (m) as subsection (n); and        (2) by inserting after subsection (l) the following new       subsection:        ``(m) Periods of Performance.--        ``(1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2),       funds provided pursuant to a grant awarded under this section       for a use specified in subsection (b) shall remain available       for use by a grant recipient for a period of not fewer than       36 months.        ``(2) Exception.--Funds provided pursuant to a grant       awarded under this section for a use specified in       subparagraph (M) or (N) of subsection (b)(1) shall remain       available for use by a grant recipient for a period of not       fewer than 55 months.''.       SEC. 4. GAO REVIEW.         (a) In General.--The Comptroller General of the United       States shall conduct a review of the public transportation       security assistance grant program under section 1406 of the       Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of       2007 (6 U.S.C. 1135; Public Law 110-53).        (b) Scope.--The review required under paragraph (1) shall       include the following:        (1) An assessment of the type of projects funded under the       public transportation security grant program referred to in       such paragraph.        (2) An assessment of the manner in which such projects       address threats to public transportation infrastructure.        (3) An assessment of the impact, if any, of this Act       (including the amendments made by this Act) on types of       projects funded under the public transportation security       assistance grant program.        (4) An assessment of the management and administration of       public transportation security assistance grant program funds       by grantees.        (5) Recommendations to improve the manner in which public       transportation security  [[Page H3757]]       assistance grant program funds address vulnerabilities in       public transportation infrastructure.        (6) Recommendations to improve the management and       administration of the public transportation security       assistance grant program.        (c) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of the       enactment of this Act and again not later than five years       after such date of enactment, the Comptroller General shall       submit to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and       Governmental Affairs of the Senate a report on the review       required under this section.       SEC. 5. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the House of       Representatives, provided that such statement has been       submitted prior to the vote on passage.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1313, the Transit  Security Grant Program Flexibility Act.   Securing our Nation's transit systems is critical to keeping our  country safe. Transportation systems are vital to the economic and  social lives of everyday people all around the country. The emergence  of so-called ``lone wolf'' domestic terrorists pose a threat to these  critical systems and the people that use them.   In response to this and other threats to our surface transportation  systems, Congress established the Transportation Security Grant Program  to help State and local authorities enhance the security of their  systems. By all accounts, the Transportation Security Grant Program is  making a difference.   However, increasingly, we have heard that some of the aspects of this  program need refinement for it to live up to its full potential.  Specifically, the Committee on Homeland Security has received testimony  from grant recipients that the period of performance is too short,  especially when they are trying to undertake long-term security  projects.   H.R. 1313 addresses these concerns and makes the program more  flexible by lengthening the period of performance for these grants.  With flexibility in mind, the bill also allows for the funding in this  program to be used for backfilling officers to allow for security  training.   Finally, it mandates a report by the Government Accountability Office  on the Transportation Security Grant Program, including recommendations  to improve the grant program. These commonsense fixes will increase the  efficacy of the Transportation Security Grant Program to help bolster  preparedness and response within our transportation systems.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my House colleagues to support this legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers,  and I am prepared to close after the gentleman from Pennsylvania  closes.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, today, the  Transportation Security Grant Program is a meaningful tool to help  communities improve the safety of our surface infrastructure, but, as  discussed, there are areas where it could be improved. H.R. 1313 seeks  to do just that.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman King for his bipartisan work on this  legislation.   Before I yield back, I would like to note that this legislation is  identical to a measure that the House approved last Congress by a voice  vote on January 31, 2017.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1313, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the  rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1437) to amend the Homeland Security Act  of 2002 to require the Under Secretary for Management of the Department  of Homeland Security to achieve security of sensitive assets among the  components of the Department of Homeland Security, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1437         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Securing Department of       Homeland Security Firearms Act of 2019'' or the ``Securing       DHS Firearms Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2.

INCLUSION OF SECURING FIREARMS AND OTHER SENSITIVE                     ASSETS IN RESPONSIBILITIES OF UNDER SECRETARY                     FOR MANAGEMENT.         Section 701 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C.       341) is amended--        (1) in subsection (a)(6), by inserting ``(including       firearms and other sensitive assets)'' after ``equipment'';        (2) by redesignating the second subsection (e) (relating to       the definition of interoperable communications) as subsection       (f); and        (3) by amending such redesignated subsection (f) to read as       follows:        ``(f) Definitions.--In this section:        ``(1) Interoperable communications.--The term       `interoperable communications' has the meaning given such       term in section 7303(g) of the Intelligence Reform and       Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (6 U.S.C. 194(g)).        ``(2) Sensitive assets.--The term `sensitive assets' means       any asset, regardless of value--        ``(A) that the Department issues to a Department employee;       and        ``(B) that either the Under Secretary for Management of the       Department or a component head determines requires special       control and accounting.''.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1437, the Securing DHS  Firearms Act of 2019.  [[Page H3759]]    Mr. Speaker, this bill, authored by Mr. Correa of California, would  require the Department of Homeland Security to take action to safeguard  sensitive assets, such as firearms, badges, and immigration stamps.   According to the DHS Office of Inspector General, during a 3-year  period between fiscal years 2014 and 2016, the Department lost track of  more than 2,000 highly sensitive assets. Failing to safeguard these  assets puts the public at risk.   This legislation, if enacted, would require the DHS under secretary  for management to issue a department-wide directive for securing  firearms, immigration stamps, badges, and other sensitive assets with  reporting requirements for any assets that are lost or stolen.   It is a commonsense measure the House passed by voice vote a little  over 1 year ago.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage this Chamber to again support this  legislation and help safeguard the Department's most sensitive assets.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Correa).    Mr. Speaker, a robust and  standardized policy on safeguarding DHS assets and other law  enforcement equipment is not just an administrative matter. It is a  matter of public safety and homeland security.   Additionally, clear requirements on the reporting of lost equipment  are just as important. Official badges, immigration stamps, firearms,  and other sensitive assets are issued by the Department to properly  equip the frontline personnel of DHS who defend our homeland security  every day. We must ensure that such equipment is well-protected and  maintained and not accessible to bad actors.    Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 1437, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the  rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1912) to amend the Homeland Security Act  of 2002 to provide for requirements relating to documentation for major  acquisition programs, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1912         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents in section       1(b) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 101 et       seq.) is amended by adding after the item related to section       707 the following new item:  ``Sec. 711. Acquisition documentation.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on this matter.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1912, a measure I introduced  with the support of Congressman   Dan Crenshaw to ensure the Department  of Homeland Security effectively manages its largest acquisitions,  those with an estimated lifecycle cost of $300 million or more.   Each year, DHS invests billions of dollars in its acquisition  programs to help execute its many critical missions. However, since the  Department was created, DHS has struggled to keep some of its largest  programs on schedule and on budget.   For example, the Department's attempts to modernize and integrate its  various financial management systems has been in the works for 15 years  with little to show for its multimillion expenditures.   A plan to deliver a DHS-wide human resources IT system has faced  similar delays, as has a decade-long attempt to consolidate the  Department's headquarters at the St. Elizabeths campus in southeast  Washington, D.C.   The Department's acquisition management challenges have been on the  Government Accountability Office's high-risk list since 2005. GAO has  identified shortfalls, including acquisition programs lacking key  analyses and schedules.   H.R. 1912, the DHS Acquisition Documentation Integrity Act of 2019,  would attempt to address some of these concerns by requiring DHS to  maintain complete, accurate, timely, and valid documentation for all  its major acquisitions. This includes documentation such as lifecycle  cost estimates, cost-benefit analyses, and project schedules. Codifying  these acquisition documentation requirements, which are already  embodied in DHS acquisition policy, is necessary to safeguard against  future cost overruns and schedule delays.   A previous version of this bill passed the House unanimously in the  115th Congress, and I urge my colleagues to pass it again today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it is not enough for the  Department of Homeland Security to simply analyze the upfront costs of  acquiring systems to fulfill capability gaps. DHS must also budget for  the long-term operation and maintenance costs of a system.   Given the criticality and budgetary risks associated with major  acquisitions, it is critical that requirements are created,  alternatives are considered, a cost estimate is completed, and a  schedule is developed.   It falls to us, the Congress, to ensure that the Department has  reliable acquisition documentation in place. Enactment of H.R. 1912  will ensure that DHS does its homework and is a good steward of  taxpayer dollars.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the  rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1892) to amend the Homeland Security Act  of 2002 to make technical corrections to the requirement that the  Secretary of Homeland Security submit quadrennial homeland security  reviews, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1892         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Quadrennial Homeland       Security Review Technical Corrections Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS TO QUADRENNIAL HOMELAND                     SECURITY REVIEW.         (a) In General.--Section 707 of the Homeland Security Act       of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 347) is amended--        (1) in subsection (a)(3)--        (A) in subparagraph (B), by striking ``and'' after the       semicolon at the end;        (B) by redesignating subparagraph (C) as subparagraph (D);       and        (C) by inserting after subparagraph (B) the following new       subparagraph:        ``(C) representatives from appropriate advisory committees       established pursuant to section 871, including the Homeland       Security Advisory Council and the Homeland Security Science       and Technology Advisory Committee, or otherwise established,       including the Aviation Security Advisory Committee       established pursuant to section 44946 of title 49, United       States Code;

       (B) in paragraph (2)--        (i) in subparagraph (B), by striking ``description of the       threats to'' and inserting ``risk assessment of'';        (ii) in subparagraph (C), by inserting ``, as required       under subsection (b)(2)'' before the semicolon at the end;

(b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this Act shall       apply with respect to a quadrennial homeland security review       conducted after December 31, 2021.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1829, the Quadrennial Homeland  Security Review Technical Corrections Act. This bill, authored by Mrs.  Watson Coleman of New Jersey, will ensure that the Quadrennial Homeland  Security Review, or QHSR, is a driving vision for the Department of  Homeland Security.   Given the importance of DHS' mission, it is vital that the Department  continually review its policy positions so that they, with Congress'  help, can continue to stay ahead of the constantly changing threats  facing our country.   By enacting this legislation, Congress can see that DHS carries out  its long-overdue third QHSR and stays focused on the mission.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman).    Mr. Speaker, this legislation will  see that the Department of Homeland Security remains focused on its  primary mission.   It is important that the Department complete this review so that it,  in partnership with Congress, can continue to evolve with the threats  that face our homeland.   I would also add that this measure passed the House last Congress by  a vote of 415-0, and I would hope my colleagues would do the same  today.   Finally, I urge DHS to deliver the long-overdue 2018 QHSR to  Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 1892, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the  rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2066) to amend the Homeland Security Act  of 2002 to establish the Intelligence Rotational Assignment Program in  the Department of Homeland Security, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2066         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``DHS Intelligence Rotational       Assignment Program Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. INTELLIGENCE ROTATIONAL ASSIGNMENT PROGRAM.         Section 844 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C.       414) is amended by adding at the end the following new       subsection:        ``(b) Intelligence Rotational Assignment Program.--        ``(1) Establishment.--Not later than one year after the       date of the enactment of this section, the Secretary shall       establish an Intelligence Rotational Assignment Program as       part of the Rotation Program under subsection (a).        ``(2) Administration.--The Chief Human Capital Officer, in       conjunction with the Chief Intelligence Officer, shall       administer the Intelligence Rotational Assignment Program       established pursuant to paragraph (1).        ``(3) Eligiblity.--The Intelligence Rotational Assignment       Program shall be open to employees serving in existing       analyst positions within the Department's Intelligence       Enterprise and other Department employees as determined       appropriate by the Chief Human Capital Officer and the Chief       Intelligence Officer.        ``(4) Coordination.--The responsibilities specified in       paragraph (3)(B) of subsection (a) that apply to the Rotation       Program under such subsection shall, as applicable, also       apply to the Intelligence Rotational Assignment Program under       this subsection.''.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, almost 18 years ago, Americans were horrified by the  devastating September 11 attacks. While the perpetrator sought to bring  us to our knees, we emerged more determined to protect our Nation.   In the years since the attacks, efforts to improve information  sharing, interoperability, and coordination across all levels of  government have been redoubled. H.R. 2066, the DHS Intelligence  Rotational Assignment Program Act, continues in the same vein by  providing DHS employees with the opportunity to complete a rotational  assignment within DHS' Office of Intelligence and Analysis.   By establishing this program, officers and analysts across DHS who  have a passion for keeping our Nation secure would be provided the  opportunity to develop and broaden their intelligence and  counterterrorism skills. Organizations with such programs find that  they yield benefits far beyond what the individuals who participate  learn.   As the threat landscape continues to rapidly change, ensuring that  those charged with keeping us safe have ample opportunities to enhance  their analytical skills must remain a priority. Mr. Speaker, I urge my  House colleagues to support this bipartisan  [[Page H3763]]  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, last year, H.R. 2066  passed the House of Representatives under a suspension of the rules.  Authorizing this program will help to improve the effectiveness of DHS'  intelligence analysis operations for years to come. As such, I  encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 2066, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
