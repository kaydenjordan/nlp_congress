 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  leadership on the Budget Committee, and I thank him for his patriotism,  his love of this country, and for his desire to do what is right for  our country, first and foremost.   Madam Speaker, today was a sad day, I believe, for our country. We  have got, now, round two of this phony impeachment process.   It is purely political. It is not based in facts, not based in the  pursuit of truth and justice. There is no openness; there is no  fairness; and there is, really, no credibility.   The American people are not buying this bologna, not a single bit.   That is why we are seeing round two of putting lipstick on a pig, as  we say in Texas. But, listen, the nature of this phony process is what  it is, no matter how you dress it up.   It is sad because we are allowing this institution to be degraded. We  are making a mockery out of this Chamber, the serious business of this  country, and the serious nature of impeachment.   I would say, first and foremost, that the claim that this President  has committed a high crime, treason, or impeachable offense is absurd,  really.   From the outset, I would say that this is a baseless claim that only  firsthand knowledge, the only primary source of evidence, is his  conversation with President Zelensky. Unlike the cherry-picked leaks  from Chairman Schiff, he let it be known what he said, what their  conversation was about, in the full sunshine, for all the public to  see.   And it was clear that the President not only didn't have a quid pro  quo, the President not only didn't commit some impeachable offense, for  heaven's sake, he was ensuring that taxpayer dollars, as the fiduciary,  the chief fiduciary of this country, weren't going to be wasted or  abused or misspent on anything except for what they were intended for  and that every stone would be turned over to root out graft and  corruption.                                time  1400    Now, that is not just appropriate; that is to be commended for any  chief executive, especially for our President.   I think that this process is purely political and aimed, again, not  at truth and justice, but at a distraction from what is not happening  on trade, on prescription drugs, and a whole host of things that we  have to address if we are going to have a real impact on our fellow  countrymen and move this country forward.   I think it is a distraction from the socialist policies that have  been advanced through this Chamber that have no chance of having any  real effect on mainstream America.   I think, ultimately, it is to discredit this President; and instead  of actually doing battle for hearts and minds the old-fashioned way in  the public squares and at the ballot box, they are doing it  [[Page H8715]]  by weaponizing this serious constitutional provision of impeachment.   Again, it is a sad day. But what I would say in closing, to my dear  friend from Wisconsin, is that it is one thing to take the oxygen out  of this Chamber for actually doing things that are going to have a real  impact and make a real difference in the lives of our fellow Americans,  it is one thing to take this President down yet another rabbit hole,  another Russian collusion hoax, but another thing to do irreparable  harm to our democracy.   The Presidency, how is it ever going to be the same after this? How  will a President ever have a phone call with a foreign leader where  they can have the candor that is necessary to build relationships and  to do the people's business.   Madam Speaker, I say to my fellow Americans: This isn't about truth  and justice. This is about fear and hate, hate for our President and  for what he stands for, for his agenda, and fear that they can't beat  him at the ballot box, so they are going to do it by weaponizing our  congressional oversight responsibility and abusing the power of this  great institution for their political objectives. I say that is wholly  un-American.   For my children's sake, they are doing irreparable harm to not only  the Presidency, but to all of our democratic institutions. If you lose  that, you lose the ability to govern, Republican or Democrat; you lose  the ability to govern functionally for the American people.   What a sad day. History will judge cruelly those who participated in  this instead of doing it the old-fashioned American way, from house to  house in the neighborhoods, in the public squares, and at the ballot  box.   God save our great country, and God help us all if this political  railroad job and farce continues any longer.   I thank my friend from Wisconsin for yielding to me. I am grateful  for the opportunity.   God bless America, and go, West Texas.
