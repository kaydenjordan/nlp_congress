 Mr. Chairman, I would like to highlight the importance  of medication-assisted treatment in combating the opioid epidemic.   This epidemic has pervaded all populations, including our seniors.  Medicare beneficiaries have among the highest and fastest rate of  opioid use disorder, yet they do not currently have coverage for the  most effective treatment.   The SUPPORT Act, which will be before the House today, would change  that. This bill provides for a fully coordinated, bundled-care model  that will help patients through medication-assisted treatment, which  combines the use of medication with counseling, group therapy, and drug  testing.   Just this week, the NIH released a study that found delivering  medication-assisted treatment to patients following an opioid overdose  dropped the death rate by 59 percent.   The President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid  Crisis also cited the value of medication-assisted treatment in  reducing overdoses and relapses while retaining patients in a treatment  program.   For example, a constituent named Jeff from North Carolina became  dependent on opioids after a difficult back surgery. He initially tried  to stop cold, but went into withdrawal and relapsed. Fortunately, Jeff  was able to receive treatment from the Goldsboro Comprehensive  Treatment Center where he went through counseling. His progress was  monitored, and monthly drug screens kept him accountable. He--Jeff--now  says that his life has changed 100 percent for the better.                                time  1030    Every Member of this House has constituents just like Jeff who have  struggled with addiction but can regain their life with the right  treatment. While there is no silver bullet to this crisis, we need to  ensure patients and doctors have all options at their disposal to  combat the opioid epidemic.
