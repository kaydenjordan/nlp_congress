 Mr. President, I rise today to honor a departing member  of my team. This is the first time in 7 years that I am delivering a  farewell speech regarding one of my team members that wasn't written by  my speechwriter, Mike McKiernan, because Mike is the departing team  member we are honoring today.   In June of 2016, he left a glamorous job at the Motion Picture  Association of America to join my office. He was excited to return to  Congress ahead of what many anticipated would be the incoming Hillary  Clinton administration. Well, as we all know, history doesn't always  work out along the path that one anticipates. It worked out a little  differently.   Six months later, President Trump was sworn into office, and Mike  found himself in the middle of many intensive issues, writing speech  after speech regarding the new administration's policies--often  opposing those policies--and the administration's nominees--often  nominees who didn't seem to have the qualifications necessary for the  roles they were nominated to.   Then not far into 2017, we arrived at a watershed moment of Trump's  first year in office: Trump's determination to complete the theft of a  Supreme Court seat through his nomination of Neil Gorsuch. It was Mike  McKiernan who compiled a whole set of big three-ring binders with  details of Supreme Court history, the influence of powerful special  interests on the Court, and, of course, every detail, large and small,  about Judge Gorsuch's record, enabling me to hold the floor for over 15  hours, attempting to focus America's attention on the grave injustice  that for the first time in American history, a Supreme Court seat had  been stolen from one administration and passed on to the next with no  hearing or consideration of the nominee from the previous President.   It was a long night--a long night for Mike McKiernan, a long night  for me--but an important effort to highlight something very important  about the politicization and polarization of one of our three key  institutions, the Supreme Court of the United States.   If you asked members of my staff for a couple of words or a phrase to  describe Mike, you might hear the words ``steady presence.'' Throughout  the years, he has brought a cool, calm, and collected aura, even during  moments of considerable stress.   Being a speechwriter might seem like a quiet, intellectual job, but  here in the Senate, chaos finds us all--many moments of frantically  making last-minute edits, last-minute edits on a script for a speech or  a conversation over Zoom, conversations recorded as a video greeting to  an organization operating back in Oregon, or crafting comments with  only an hour or two of notice to make, to block, or to request a  unanimous consent request on an amendment or on a bill.   There was, for every speechwriter and for Mike, the near daily  challenge of finding just the right story or just the right analogy or  just the right poem to illuminate a commentary over a policy, as,  indeed, Mike delivered just the perfect poem on butterflies last year  for my closing remarks at the Monarch Summit.   It was Mike who crafted my 2017 quiz show series that I conducted  here on the floor of the Senate featuring weekly climate facts, trying  to find a new way to engage Americans about the challenges facing us  with the evolving impact on our forests and our fishing and our farms  and so many aspects of our environment. Our quiz show did not become  the smash hit on YouTube that we had hoped for, but at least the Senate  pages perhaps learned a thing or two from the quiz shows, and we had  fun doing them. Our climate work also led to other fun moments, like  hosting Bill Nye the Science Guy in my office and doing a joint video  on climate science.   Mike always had the extremity challenge of deciphering my  handwriting--handwriting I can't decipher after I have been away from  it for even a few moments. I have no idea what I wrote, but I am sure  it was excellent--figure it out.   Mike, I think we are sending you away with a certificate in advanced  handwriting decoding.   Along with the fun and good humor that Mike brought to the team, he  also brought deep care and purpose to some of the most challenging  moments we have handled as an office. He found great meaning in  bringing, in his words, ``to life as accurately and impactfully as  possible'' the stories of those who are oppressed and suffering.   When the previous administration tried to take DACA status away from  Dreamers, Mike helped me share the stories of young Americans who have  known no other home.  [[Page S1663]]    When President Trump sent Federal agents to attack Portlanders on the  streets in the summer of 2020, Mike helped me to share the experience  of those whose civil liberties had been shattered and to hold the  administration accountable.   When President Trump implemented his horrific tactic of tearing  children out of the arms of their parents at the border, Mike was  instrumental in sharing the stories of those families with the world-- stories of little children with hopes and dreams who simply wanted to  play, to learn, to be loved, and be able to go to school; parents who  would do anything to protect their children from violence and  oppression and build for those little ones a safer future.   Mike, we will miss your wordsmithing. We will miss your adorable  photos and hilarious stories of your two young children, Clara and  Braden, and we really require you to keep sharing them as you go  forward. Most of all, we will miss your kind, compassionate, mission- driven spirit that embodies what it means to be on our team. You are  leaving big shoes to fill, but we are thrilled that you will be staying  in the extended Team Merkley family, going to join our former deputy  chief of staff J.P. Piorkowski in the Director's Office at the Peace  Corps.   One thing our world needs more of is peace and the cross-cultural  understanding that comes from Americans going out around the globe to  help communities thrive.   I know that in your next chapter and whatever else you do throughout  your career, you will never stop working to build a better world, and  what better mission could there be for one's life than building a  better world?   I wish you all the best. And thank you so much for being a member of  the team.                            ____________________     Madam President, I have 11 requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate.
