 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, as the distinguished senior Senator from  Alabama has said, we are going to be voting soon on our ``domestic  minibus.'' We will vote on a cloture motion to proceed to H.R. 3055.   I understand that once we are on the bill, Chairman Shelby is going  to offer a substitute amendment that will include four bills that were  reported from the Appropriations Committee with every Republican and  every Democrat voting for them--the Agriculture bill, the Interior  bill, the Commerce-Justice-Science bill, and the Transportation,  Housing and Urban Development bill.   I know that some feel that sometimes the Congress gets so polarized  that we could not have a unanimous vote that the Sun rises in the east,  but this was a case where we did in our committee, which has  representatives of all wings of the Republican Party and all wings of  the Democratic Party. We all voted aye, and I would urge Members to  vote aye.   I am pleased that the substitute package will not include the  Military Construction and the Veterans Affairs bill, and let me explain  why.   The underlying House vehicle we are moving to contains the House  version of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs bill, but the  Senate Appropriations Committee has not yet considered this bill. We  have not had debate in the committee. We have not had a vote on it in  committee. It would be premature to bring it to the Senate floor.   It is an important bill. It is an important bill that I have always  supported because it funds critical programs, particularly for our  veterans. But President Trump wants to insist on using the bill to take  funding from our troops and their families to fund his ineffective  wall--a wall that he gave his word Mexico would pay for--and that is  unacceptable.   Look at the people who are affected by the Military Construction and  Veterans Affairs bill. Let's not get them tied up in a Presidential  campaign promise. Let's look at the military families who are now  living in substandard housing. Let's look at the veterans who are not  getting the care they need. Let's have a clean bill.   Had the bill with the President's wall been in this--the American  people would be paying for it and not Mexico, as the President  promised--I would have been unable to support the cloture motion.   I am going to have more to say about each of the four bipartisan  bills included in Chairman Shelby's substitute when we turn to them.  Hopefully we can by tomorrow. Each one funds programs that are  important to the American people and our economy. They make critical  investments in affordable housing, infrastructure, rural development,  our farming communities, our small businesses, and our environment.  They are good bills. I was glad to work with Senator Shelby so we could  have these bills before the Senate. They speak to real needs of the  American people.   Now we have only 4 short weeks before the continuing resolution we  are operating under expires. Four weeks can go by very quickly around  here. We need to do our work. We need to do it quickly. We should be  able to enact all 12 appropriations bills into law. I was going to say  the Senate deserves no less, but it is the American people who deserve  no less. So I will continue to work with Senator Shelby and others,  both Republicans and Democrats alike, to get these bills done.   We have a vote coming up soon.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I understand we are waiting for another  Senator, and when he arrives, of course, I will yield.                                  H.R. 3055    Mr. President, I was just talking with the distinguished senior  Senator from Alabama a couple of minutes ago. I know he has spoken, and  we have begun consideration of a bill containing the fiscal year 2020  Commerce, Justice, Science, Agriculture, Interior, Transportation,  Housing and Urban Development.   I mention this because all four of these bills are the product of  hard work and bipartisan cooperation by each of the subcommittees. They  were reported from the Appropriations Committee unanimously. Every  single Republican, every single Democrat voted for it. It makes  critical investments in affordable housing and infrastructure, rural  development, our farming communities, small businesses, science, and  our environment. They are good bills, and I am glad to have them before  the Senate.   I want to thank the chairs and ranking members of the subcommittees  and their staff for the good work: Senators Hoeven and Merkley,  Senators Murkowski and Udall, Senators Collins and Reed, and Senators  Moran and Shaheen. They all worked so closely together. They show,  despite the difficult atmosphere we often operate in, the  Appropriations Committee can still put partisan disputes aside and make  strong investments in the priorities of our American people.   The Agriculture bill continues the significant progress made by this  committee and in the 2018 farm bill to deliver real wins for farmers,  families, and rural communities throughout Vermont and across the  country. The bill rejects the disastrous cuts the Trump administration  proposed for on-farm conservation, rural development, and rural energy  programs and, instead, makes important investments in farming  communities.   It is disappointing that this bill supports the administration's ill- advised relocation of USDA research agencies. I have spoken out about  this relocation effort and remain concerned about the loss of expertise  and focus such a move precipitates at USDA.   I am pleased this bill further invests in the viability of our  cornerstone Vermont industries, including dairy, maple, and organics.   It significantly increases funding for innovation in the dairy  sector, funding that will directly benefit dairy producers in Vermont  and across the country as they meet the challenges of a changing  marketplace. The bill also takes important steps to preserve the  [[Page S5952]]  integrity of the organic dairy market, increasing funding for key  organic programs and directing USDA to finally implement rules that  will level the playing field for small-scale producers.   The Agriculture bill also once again includes funding to support the  farm to school program. This nationwide program has given children and  schools across the country the tools to craft farm-fresh, healthy, and  delicious meals that students enjoy, while teaching children about  healthy eating habits.   The Interior bill makes significant necessary investments in clean  water, clean air, stewardship of our public lands. I am particularly  pleased it has critical funding through the Environmental Protection  Agency that will support work on water quality, habitat and fishery  restoration, and invasive species in Lake Champlain. The bill also  increases funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund that will  support efforts in Vermont and across the country.   For States like mine that have seen communities impacted by PFAS  contamination, the bill includes additional funding for remediation.   The Transportation, Housing and Urban Development bill continues  critical support for infrastructure programs like BUILD. Vermont and  States across the country rely heavily on these Federal programs.   It also invests in our Nation's rail systems that I hope will help  extend and maintain rail service within my State of Vermont.   I am also pleased that this bill continues support for a development  partnership between the University of Vermont and the University of  Mississippi to research unmanned aircraft systems. The bill also  protects important investments in affordable housing and community  development.   The bill again rejects the administration's request to eliminate  programs that support our communities, including HOME, Community  Development Block Grant Program, NeighborWorks, and the Rural Capacity  Building Program.   The Commerce, Justice, Science bill makes critical investments in  economic development programs. It also invests $7.6 billion for the  2020 census, the results of which determine how we distribute $900  billion in Federal spending every year. It also ensures appropriate  representation in Congress. This once-a-decade investment is critical.   I am grateful that this bill has increased support for the lifesaving  Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program, which earlier this year was  given a permanent authorization by a unanimous vote in the Senate. It  also supports important programs to provide support to crime victims,  help to exonerate the wrongfully convicted, and to reduce recidivism.   So there are four good, bipartisan measures. I urge all Senators to  support it. We have only 4 short weeks before the continuing resolution  we are operating under expires. We need to do our work, and we need to  do it quickly, so we can enact all 12 appropriations bills into law.  These four bills are a good start.   Mr. President, I see our distinguished leader, a man we always rely  on, on the floor, so I yield to Senator Durbin.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Bob Ross, a  detailee on the Agriculture Subcommittee, Faisal Amin, a detailee on  the Interior Subcommittee, and Olivia Matthews, an intern on my  Appropriations Committee, be granted floor privileges for the length of  the current debate on H.R. 3055, the Commerce, Justice, Science,  Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, Interior,  Environment, Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, Transportation,  and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act of 2020.
