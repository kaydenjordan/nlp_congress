 Mr. Speaker, the Republican House bill is a  disaster for the American people. The process by which the bill was  voted on, Members had very little time to review the text. As a result,  we were forced to vote on legislation without the benefit of facts, on  a bill that affects a $3 trillion annual industry.   That is why I have joined Congresswoman Jayapal in introducing H.  Res. 441, to require a review by the Congressional Budget Office before  a bill comes to the floor.   Members of Congress should have as much information as possible to  make a smart decision on major legislation affecting 18 percent of the  American economy. This resolution would simply affirm the time-honored  principle that facts do matter and that a fair, honest, and transparent  policymaking process is essential to a healthy and thriving democracy.                            ____________________
