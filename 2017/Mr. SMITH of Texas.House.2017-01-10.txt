 Mr. Speaker, science, technology, engineering and  math are critical to America's future prosperity.   Women are unfortunately underrepresented in STEM careers. Despite  representing nearly half of the college-educated and total U.S.  workforce, women account for less than 25 percent of America's STEM  workforce.   Supporting women's involvement in the fields of aerospace and space  exploration should be an important part of NASA's mission.   Current NASA programs such as NASA GIRLS and NASA BOYS are important  and give young students the opportunity to interact and learn from real  NASA engineers, scientists, and technologists.   They provide virtual mentoring that use commercially available video  chat programs to pair NASA innovators with young students across the  country.   H.R. 321 builds upon this success. It leverages NASA's talent pool of  current and retired astronauts, and early career female scientists,  engineers, and innovators to inform and inspire young women to pursue  their dreams in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. One  day, these young people will push the boundaries of space.   Space can be a catalyst for inspiring young girls to enter the STEM  fields. By doing our part to support their engagement in space with  this legislation, we are investing in the futures of our daughters,  nieces, and grandchildren.   I again want to thank the bill sponsor, Research and Technology  Subcommittee Chairwoman Comstock for her leadership on this topic. I  encourage my colleagues to support this bill.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 321,  the INSPIRE Women, Act.   I support this legislation because Article 1 Section 8 of the United  States Constitution states our duty ``To promote the Progress of  Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and  Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and  Discoveries . . .''   This includes the education of our next generation of women  considering participation in the fields of science, technology,  engineering, and mathematics and to pursue careers in aerospace.   Statistics show that women remain underrepresented in the science and  engineering workforce, although to a lesser degree than in the past,  with the greatest disparities occurring in engineering, computer  science, and the physical sciences (NSF, Science & Engineering  Indicators, 2014).   1. Female scientists and engineers are concentrated in different  occupations than are men, with relatively high shares of women in the  social sciences (58 percent)   2. biological and medical sciences (48 percent)   3. relatively low shares in engineering (13 percent)   4. computer and mathematical sciences (25 percent) (NSF, Science &  Engineering Indicators, 2014).   Women make up 47 percent of the total U.S. workforce, but are much  less represented in particular science and engineering occupations  (U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Women in the  Labor Force: A Databook, 2014):   1. 39 percent of chemists and material scientists are women;   2. 27.9 percent of environmental scientists and geoscientists are  women;   3. 15.6 percent of chemical engineers are women;   4. 12.1 percent of civil engineers are women;   5. 8.3 percent of electrical and electronics engineers are women;  [[Page H273]]    6. 17.2 percent of industrial engineers are women; and   7. 7.2 percent of mechanical engineers are women.   These statistics show that measures need to be taken in order to  promote women participation in the fields of science, technology,  engineering, and mathematics and to pursue careers in aerospace.   H.R. 321 will support NASA GIRLS and NASA BOYS, virtual mentoring  programs using commercially available video chat programs, to pair  National Aeronautics and Space Administration mentors with young  students anywhere in the country.   NASA GIRLS and NASA BOYS give young students the opportunity to  interact and learn from real engineers, scientists, and technologists.   H.R. 321 will also support the ``Aspire to Inspire'' Program (A2I),  which engages young girls to present science, technology, engineering,  and mathematics (STEM) career opportunities through the real lives and  jobs of early career women at NASA.   H.R. 321 also promotes the Summer Institute in Science, Technology,  Engineering, and Research (SISTER) program at the Goddard Space Flight  Center designed to increase awareness of, and provide an opportunity  for, female middle school students to be exposed to and explore  nontraditional career fields with Goddard Space Flight Center women  engineers, mathematicians, scientists, technicians, and researchers.   Let me close by urging all Members to join me in voting to pass H.R.  321.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Comstock) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill, H.R. 321.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 255, the Promoting  Women in Entrepreneurship Act. I thank my Science Committee colleagues  Ms. Esty, who authored the bill, and Research and Technology  Subcommittee Chairwoman Comstock for their initiative on this issue.   H.R. 255 authorizes the National Science Foundation (NSF) to use its  existing entrepreneurial programs to recruit and support women and help  them develop their research and technology ideas for the marketplace.   STEM education is critical to our country's economy and global  competitiveness. A well-educated and trained STEM workforce promotes  our future economic prosperity.   These STEM workers have the potential to develop technologies that  could save thousands of lives, jump-start new industries, or even  discover new worlds.   That's why I authored with Ms. Esty the STEM Education Act, a new law  that strengthens science, technology, engineering and mathematics  education efforts at federal science agencies. It also, for the first  time, expands the definition of STEM to include computer science. The  bill was signed by the President in October 2015.   Unfortunately, studies show that only 26 percent of women who attain  degrees in STEM fields work in STEM jobs.   H.R. 255 encourages NSF to tackle this problem. It enhances women's  ability to translate their enthusiasm, scientific expertise and  research ideas into tangible products and businesses.   Inspiring American students to seek science and math careers is a  goal shared by Republicans and Democrats alike. Some of the most  energizing and exciting moments of my Science Committee chairmanship  have been interactions with young people who want to pursue STEM  studies and careers.   At various Committee hearings and robotics competitions in my  district, I have encountered motivated, talented young people who want  nothing more than an opportunity to pursue their dreams. And, in some  cases, change the world with their ideas.   Their passion for learning and science reminds me of why I enjoy  serving in Congress and on the Science Committee.   I again thank Ms. Esty and Chairwoman Comstock for their work on this  bill. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of H.R. 255.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 255 the  ``Promoting Women in Entrepreneurship Act.''  [[Page H275]]    As a Senior Member on the House Committee on Homeland Security who  sits on the Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection,  and Security Technologies, I know well of the need to encourage and  train women to thrive in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and  Mathematics (STEM) fields.   Promoting diversity in the STEM professions is more than just an  idea; it requires an understanding that there is a need to have a  process that will ensure the inclusion of all minorities and women in  all areas of American life.   Studies have found that women make up almost 50 percent of the  workforce.   Studies note that 23 percent of STEM workers are women; however,  women make up 48 percent of workers in all occupations.   Only 26 percent of women who do attain degrees in STEM fields work in  STEM jobs.   According to the most recent available data women are less likely to  focus on the STEM disciplines in undergraduate and graduate studies.   In 1991, women received 29.6 percent of computer science B.A.'s,  compared to just 18.2 percent in 2010.   Jobs in computer systems design and related services, a field  dependent upon high-level math and problem-solving skills, are  projected to grow 45 percent between 2008 and 2018.   There are approximately 6 million women and minority owned businesses  in the United States, representing a significant aspect of our economy.   My home city of Houston, Texas, the energy capital of the world,  knows the importance of professionals in the STEM industries.   It has been reported that the highest-paying STEM occupations are  petroleum engineers with an annual salary of $147,520, architectural  and engineering managers with an annual salary of $138,720, natural  sciences managers with an annual salary of $136,450, computer and  information systems managers with an annual salary of $136,280, and  physicists with a reported annual salary of $117,300.   There is an increasing demand for individuals with STEM degrees to  extend their focus beyond the laboratory so they can be leaders in  discovery and commercialization.   Women deserve a fair shot in the STEM programs in this nation.   In addition, I believe that work needs to be done to modernize key  contracting developmental programs designed to increase opportunities  for women, minorities and low-income individuals who pursue STEM  degrees and STEM job training.   I support programs at the National Science Foundation that have  worked to reduce the current barriers and ensure women have the support  they need in the STEM fields.   Mr. Speaker, we should encourage women to pursue degrees and careers  in the STEM fields so we can continue to compete in the global economy.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Marchant). The question is on the motion  offered by the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Comstock) that the House  suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 255.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.
