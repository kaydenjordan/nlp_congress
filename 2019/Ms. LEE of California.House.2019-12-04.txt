 Madam Speaker, first, I would like to thank  Congressman Bobby Rush for leading this effort in the memory of the  late beloved Fred Hampton.   Madam Speaker, fifty years ago, the people of Illinois and the world  lost a devoted public servant with the untimely brutal murder of Fred  Hampton. A man whose reputation followed him. I knew of Fred Hampton  during my time as a community worker with the Black Panther Party in  Oakland, California. Fred's fight for freedom and justice were known  throughout the country including in my district. Fred took the Black  Panther's Party motto to heart--he fought to end widespread poverty,  increase economic and educational opportunities, and ensure peace and  justice for all.   Promoting the idea of ``All Power to the People'', and unwilling to  wait for the political leaders of the time to address the needs of the  African American community, the Panthers--and Fred--took action  themselves to force change and bring about liberation from all forms of  human exploitation and oppression.   Above all, Fred was deeply dedicated to the Black Panther Party's  Free Breakfast Program, which gave thousands of children the necessary  nutrition to focus and excel before their school day. He understood the  importance of meeting the needs in the community while fighting for a  fair chance to overcome structural and oppressive barriers.   Years ago, I was lucky enough to also work on the Party's Free  Breakfast Program in Oakland, California. And as many of my colleagues  know, it was the success of the program that pressed the Federal  government to  [[Page H9251]]  increase funding for free breakfast for public school children.   Madam Speaker, above all--Fred was a leader and worked to form a, a  more peaceful world. His unparalleled leadership as former Chair of the  Illinois Black Panther Party and as a warrior for peace and justice  will always be his legacy.   The legacy of Fred Hampton shall never die, and may he continue to  rest in peace.                            ____________________
