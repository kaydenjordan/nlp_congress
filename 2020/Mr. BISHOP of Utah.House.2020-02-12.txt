 Mr. Chair, I appreciate having the ability to  speak  [[Page H1064]]  after Mr. Grijalva, my good friend from Arizona, so I can bring some  balance to the rhetoric that we are doing because somebody has to  realize that the ideas of conservation, recreation, and economic  development in the vast territories we have in the West are not  mutually exclusive. They never have been. They never need to be.   But the bill we have in front of us today is very unbalanced. It is  pretty ideological, and as Yogi Berra used to say: ``It's deja vu all  over again.''   This puts 1.5 million acres, as has been said, in new wilderness  designations and over 800 miles of wild and scenic rivers, which  destroys or shuts down all forest management activity in those  particular areas, including things like fuel reduction and wildfire  mitigation.   To put this in perspective for some of you, especially those in the  East, in the last 10 years, 7.3 million acres of our most restricted  public lands have been burned out. That is like burning the entire  State of Massachusetts, all of which was set in this kind of  restrictive area.   Now, what the majority wants to do, what the Democrats want to do, is  add more to that potential problem. It is unbalanced simply because  there is not a single Republican who has cosponsored any of these bills  in this package, including the two Colorado Republicans who are most  directly impacted by this package.    This puts critical military-readiness training at risk. This has  concerns for private property that have never been resolved in elements  of this package. It doesn't even address the local consensus.   This is a bill that the Senate will not pass, that the President has  already said he is going to reject.   Earlier in this session, as we began, we had a lands package that  came through. It was a consensus between Democrats and Republicans both  here and in the Senate. Many of these bills were not part of that  consensus land package, and for justifiable reasons, because they  haven't reached that consensus status.   It hasn't happened before, which means--you know, Earl Weaver once  came out and got thrown out of a game because he looked at the umpire  and said: Are you going to get better, or is this as good as it gets?   We are looking at the other side and saying: Are you going to get  better, or is this simply as good as it gets?   What we should be doing is realizing, instead of creating more  problem areas, we should be trying to solve the problem of the land we  already own. I am specifically talking about H.R. 1225, the Restore Our  Parks Act. We have a maintenance backlog in our parks that is huge and  a solution to it that actually works. Why are we not bringing that bill  to the floor instead of this bill, which is destined to fail?   We all talk a big game about how much we revere our national parks,  yet when we had the opportunity to do something about it with a bill  that has 330 sponsors and cosponsors, we have the chance of doing it,  we don't.   For some reason, the Democrats don't decide to bring that up on the  floor so it can move along. Instead, they bring packages up here that  create more wilderness, more problems, and more costs without having  solved any of the underlying problems with these packages, which is why  they weren't in the consensus bill we had at the beginning of the  session in the first place.   We can do better. We need to do better. We are wasting our time with  messaging bills that have no future when we have the opportunity to do  stuff that works.   I am calling on my friends on the other side: Put that bill on the  floor so we can vote for something that solves our problems and saves  our parks instead of these simply messaging bills that are dedicated to  having special interest groups being able to check off the box that you  did something for them. It is about time we did something that works.                                time  1315
