 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of my  constituent, Orange County Public Defender Elliot Blair, who passed  away while celebrating his first anniversary with his wife in Mexico.   Elliot graduated from Cal State Fullerton and earned his degree in  law from Loyola Marymount University. Elliot was a devoted public  servant and advocate for the underserved and underrepresented. He was a  young attorney, a promising young attorney that was loved by our  community.   On the evening of his passing away, he called his mother and he said,  mom, I am going to have dinner at your favorite restaurant. Those were  the last words he uttered to his family.   Elliot will be missed, but he will not be forgotten.                            ____________________
