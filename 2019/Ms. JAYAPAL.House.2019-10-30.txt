 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of  longtime Seattle resident Ginny NiCarthy.   Ginny was a wonderful friend, author, activist, and advocate. She was  humble, brilliant, and deeply compassionate, and she changed the lives  of tens of thousands of people across the world through her writing and  her activism.   She passed away at the age of 92 last month, choosing to die  gracefully on her own terms before dementia could take over her life  and her mind.   Ginny was born in 1927 in San Francisco. She was the youngest of  five. Her father once served as the mayor of Redwood City, California.  Her mother worked as a switchboard operator.   Passionate about social justice as a young woman, Ginny moved to  Seattle in her 20s and became involved in her new city's artistic and  political scene. She first pursued a teaching certificate in the 1960s,  going on to teach middle school in Seattle's Central District.   Informed by her experience working as a caseworker at a mental  hospital, she decided to pursue a master's degree in social work at the  University of Washington and became a practicing therapist.   Born with the last name McCarthy, she changed her surname to NiCarthy  in the 1970s to use an Irish prefix that means ``daughter of,'' rather  than ``Mc,'' which means ``son of.'' This was emblematic of her deeply- rooted feminism and her drive to challenge the status quo in every  aspect of her life.   In 1972, Ginny cofounded Seattle Rape Relief, which at the time was  the only rape crisis center in the country. The volunteer-run  organization managed a 24-hour hotline for sexual assault victims.   A decade later, she published her groundbreaking book, ``Getting  Free: A Handbook for Women in Abusive Relationships.'' Her book, based  on the premise that women's voices needed to be heard and believed,  became a bible for domestic violence survivors. Translated into  multiple languages, her book had and continues to have a global impact.   She went on to publish several more books on abuse at home and in the  workplace, as well as many articles addressing issues of disability,  race, sexuality, youth, and aging. She volunteered on behalf of  countless groups advocating for women's rights, criminal justice  reform, and antiwar efforts.   We first met when I approached her to join the board of Chaya, an  organization that supports South Asian survivors of domestic violence  that I, too, was on the board of. Much later, Ginny gave me some of her  writings that turned into a book of her travels around the world for  peace and justice.   I was amazed at her curiosity, her love of life, even with all the  traumas that she, herself, had been through. I was struck by the way  that she listened to others and absolutely refused to stop living life  to her fullest. She was fearless in questioning what she saw as unjust,  and her commitment to racial equity was striking.   She was arrested multiple times for peaceful, civil disobedience  actions, even at the age of 86, for speaking out for more fair and just  immigration policies.   Ginny always found meaning in politics and social justice activism,  and her legacy lives on strong--in her books, her friendships, the  tremendous work she did her entire life on behalf of survivors of  violence, and her quest for justice for all.   Ginny saw the intersectionality of gender, race, and class very  clearly. She was right there on every major issue that we fought for,  whether that was a $15 minimum wage, rights for immigrants, mass  incarceration of Black and Brown people, sexual assault, and LGBTQ  rights. It is fitting that The New York Times devoted a substantial  part of one of their pages of obituaries to Ginny and her national  impact.   I would like to commemorate Ginny's lifetime of achievements, her  decades of service to our community, and her never-ending dedication to  the fight for justice. My heart is with her loving family and friends.   Mr. Speaker, may Ginny rest in peace. May Ginny rest in power. She  will long be remembered and missed by all of us.                            ____________________
