 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.J. Res. 66.   Working families in my home State of Oregon and across the country  deserve the opportunity to retire with security and dignity.  Unfortunately, that is not a reality for far too many Americans who  face a growing retirement security crisis. In fact, nearly 40 million  private sector workers, including an estimated 1 million in Oregon, do  not have access to retirement savings plans at their jobs.   The AARP and others have noted that people who do not save for  retirement risk becoming dependent on social safety net programs that  increase costs for taxpayers.   Mr. Speaker, Congress has not stepped up to address our country's  retirement security crisis, so several States, including my home State  of Oregon, have developed and implemented innovative solutions that  will help workers save for retirement.   Oregon's program is set to launch in just 5 months. Workers who do  not have access to a retirement plan through their employer will have  access to a plan facilitated by the State. It is not mandatory--workers  can opt out--and there is minimal paperwork for employees. Oregon's  plan is portable, so workers can keep their retirement savings when  they change jobs.   Consider Oregonian Penny Wicklander, who has worked hard but hasn't  had access to a good retirement plan. Penny managed an apartment  complex for low-income seniors, and she saw the hardships that  residents faced without retirement security. Some lived on $10 in the  last 10 days of the month. She said, in support of Oregon's plan:         No one wants to retire into poverty and rely on public       services, but it's hard to plan for the future when there are       so many other financial challenges facing our families. We       need a simple retirement account that makes it easy for       everyone to save part of what they earn, regardless of where       they work.    Bobbie Sotin, a home care worker who cares for seniors and people  with disabilities doesn't have access to a retirement savings plan  through her employer. Bobbie said:         Working with seniors in poverty, many care providers see       their own future every day. Once they reach retirement age,       they have to make the decision to live in poverty or keep       working until they die. Even if it  [[Page H1207]]       means just $50 or $100 more per month, that kind of income       would make a huge difference to each and every one of us.    Penny, Bobbie, and people across the country need access to  retirement savings plans. Oregon and several other States are working  to fill that need. Congress should be supporting them and encouraging  retirement savings programs like Oregon's and similar plans in  California, Illinois, Connecticut, and Maryland. Instead, House  Republicans are advancing a Congressional Review Act joint resolution  of disapproval that would endanger these plans, discourage other States  from taking action, and undermine states' rights.   Specifically, this resolution would nullify an important Department  of Labor rule that simply clarifies that these State-based savings  plans do not run afoul of ERISA, the Employee Retirement Income  Security Act. The safe harbor rule went into effect last October.   Now, my friends on the other side of the aisle may characterize this  as ``closing regulatory loopholes'' and they may question whether more  government is the answer, but that is not what this is about.   The National Conference of State Legislatures and the State  treasurers of Oregon, Illinois, and California submitted letters in  opposition to this resolution. They found the ``DOL safe harbor  provides flexibility to states, codifies clear protections for  employers who facilitate retirement savings arrangements for their  employees, and enables innovative solutions to addressing the growing  retirement crisis facing this country.''   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record these letters and several other  letters in opposition to this resolution.                                                  February 10, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House,      Washington, DC.        Speaker Ryan: Earlier this week, Reps. Tim Walberg and       Francis Rooney introduced two resolutions of disapproval       (H.J. Res 66, H.J. Res 67) to roll-back key Department of       Labor (US DOL) rules. These resolutions will limit our       abilities as states to provide solutions to the growing       retirement savings crisis, and could make it harder for small       businesses to participate in state-run programs.        We are writing to ask that you defend our state's rights by       voting ``No'' on H.J. Res 66 and H.J. Res 67.        The rule in question gives clarity for states across the       country to provide access to retirement savings options for       millions of private-sector workers. California, Illinois, and       Oregon are all in the process of implementing legislatively       approved state-administered plans that will enable nearly 8       million private-sector workers to save their own money for       retirement.        As Treasurers, we chair the respective Boards governing our       state plans and have been actively working with employers,       employees, payroll providers, and financial service       organizations for the last two years. The reality is, that       without access to an easy and affordable savings vehicle, far       too many workers risk retiring into poverty and becoming       overly reliant on Social Security or state and federal safety       net programs.        The final rule from US DOL provides key protections for       employers who facilitate enrollment for their employees--      confirming a safe harbor from ERISA and protecting businesses       from litigation or liability related to state programs--while       maintaining key consumer protections for program       participants.        While this rule has been finalized, opponents are seeking       to repeal or weaken the rule through the Congressional Review       Act. We respectfully request that you oppose efforts to       repeal the rule and vote no on H.J. Res 66 and H.J. Res 67.       The US DOL safe harbor provides flexibility to states,       codifies clear protections for employers who facilitate       retirement savings arrangements for their employees, and       enables innovative solutions to addressing the growing       retirement crisis facing this country.        We are happy to provide additional information. Thank you       for your support.            Sincerely,      John Chiang,        California State Treasurer.      Michael Frerichs,        Illinois State Treasurer.      Tobias Read,        Oregon State Treasurer.                                   ____                                                             AARP,                                                   February 8, 2017.        Dear Member of Congress: On behalf of working Americans who       struggle to save for their retirement, AARP urges you to vote       against a Congressional Review Act resolution to overturn the       Department of Labor's final rule on ``Savings Arrangements       Established by States for Non-Governmental Employees''. AARP,       with its nearly 38 million members in all 50 States and the       District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands,       is a nonpartisan, nonprofit, nationwide organization that       helps people turn their goals and dreams into real       possibilities, strengthens communities and fights for the       issues that matter most to families such as healthcare,       employment and income security, retirement planning,       affordable utilities and protection from financial abuse.        Today, 55 million working Americans do not have a way to       save for retirement out of their regular paycheck. Despite       decades of federal incentives, employer sponsorship of       retirement savings plans has remained static. The lack of       employer-sponsored savings plans has a direct impact on the       retirement readiness of workers, because employees are 15       times more likely to save if they have access to a payroll       deduction savings plan at work.        In response to the stubborn lack of growth in employer-      sponsored retirement savings plans, numerous states have       removed regulatory and operational barriers for small       businesses who want to offer a retirement savings vehicle to       their workers. These bipartisan, commonsense solutions are       known as Secure Choice or Work and Save. In the last two       years more than half the states considered a variety of       options to provide employers and their employees with low-      cost savings options, including Arizona, California,       Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana,       Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts,       Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New       Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon,       Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Utah, Vermont,       Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.        In 2016, the Department of Labor promulgated a rule       providing states with guidance on how to enter into public-      private partnerships aimed at increasing personal savings       rates among small business employees. This rule makes it       clear that any automatic IRA program established by a state       must remove the operational burden of running a retirement       plan from small business owners. In fact, it asserts that a       small business owner's only interaction with a Work and Save       plan would be to facilitate payroll deductions for these       individual savings plans.        A Congressional Review Act resolution to overturn this       rulemaking will have a significant chilling effect on states,       sending the political message that state flexibility is not a       priority. There is successful precedent for states to take       action to promote personal financial responsibility. When       college savings plans, known as 529 plans, were created       twenty years ago, less than $2.5 billion had been saved for       college in these programs. Today, individuals have put away       more than $253.2 billion for college in 529 plans. Similarly,       in the retirement context, states are acting as facilitators,       aggregating small businesses to get the cost benefit of       pooling. All private financial firms can bid to invest the       savings from employees. The only employer role is to set up       the payroll deduction and forward materials to employees, a       role employers already perform for unemployment insurance,       workers' compensation, and other similar programs.        Often, states are the pioneers of solutions. State       governments more directly interact with both workers and       employers, and state policymakers are aware that growth in       the number of older Americans who do not have a secure       retirement will be felt most acutely in cities and states. As       laboratories of change, states are often more willing and       able to test creative solutions to improve the retirement       security needs of their workforce while respecting the unique       characteristics and demographics of each jurisdiction. The       lack of options to save for retirement at work is a       persistent problem that demands action today. States desire       flexibility to move forward with innovative reforms--Congress       should not curtail state efforts to promote retirement       savings. Americans need easy savings options. No one wants       older Americans solely dependent on Social Security. Employer       plans are not growing and states are trying to meet the needs       of their citizens using private investment firms. Lack of       access to workplace savings plans is especially acute for       people of color--only 54 percent of African American and       Asian employees and 38 percent of Latino employees work for       an employer that sponsors a retirement plan, compared to 62       percent of White employees. Those who do not save enough for       retirement risk becoming dependent on social safety net       programs, costing taxpayers down the line. In fact, states       taking action today could save taxpayers as much as $4.8       billion in the next ten years. Congress should support these       important state savings programs, not take steps to end them.        AARP urges Congress to support private retirement savings       and vote no on a Congressional Review Act resolution to       overturn the Department of Labor's rule on Savings       Arrangements Established by States for Non-Governmental       Employees. If you have further questions, please feel free to       contact me.            Sincerely,                                                  Nancy A. LeaMond,        Executive Vice President and Chief Advocacy and Engagement       Officer.                                   ____           American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial             Organizations, Legislative Alert,                                 Washington, DC, February 15, 2017.        Dear Representative: The AFL-CIO urges you to oppose H.J.       Res. 66 and H.J. Res. 67. These resolutions of disapproval       block Department of Labor (DoL) regulations that  [[Page H1208]]       create safe harbors under which certain retirement savings       arrangements established by states or eligible political       subdivisions for private-sector workers will not be       considered ERISA-covered employee benefit plans.        While the vast majority of union members who work in the       private sector benefit from collectively bargained pensions       and retirement savings plans, over 38 million private-sector       workers are not offered any kind of plan at work. The DoL       regulations provide a path forward for states and       municipalities to create an easier way for these Americans to       begin building a retirement nest egg through payroll       deduction contributions into their own Individual Retirement       Account (IRA). A vote to rescind these regulations is a vote       to ensure that these Americans will remain financially       vulnerable in retirement.        Thank you for your consideration of our views.            Sincerely,                                                    William Samuel,      Director, Government Affairs Department.                                   ____           American Federation of State, County and Municipal             Employees, AFL-CIO,                                 Washington, DC, February 10, 2017.      U.S. House of Representatives,      Washington, DC,        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.6 million members       of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal       Employees (AFSCME), I am writing to urge you to oppose the       two Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolutions of disapproval       blocking the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) regulations for       state and city retirement savings programs, H.J. Res 66 and       H.J. Res 67.        Using the CRA to overturn these rules is an example of an       arbitrary process that upsets years of work by federal       agencies acting in strict adherence to the Administrative       Procedures Act to promulgate important federal rules and       actions. After thorough consideration that has involved the       public, state and local governments, and the Congress,       resolutions of disapproval should not be used for partisan       purposes to scrap agency rules at the last minute and to       subvert the regulatory process contrary to real needs of       Americans.        We know there is a growing retirement security problem in       this country. It is estimated that 55 million full- and part-      time private sector workers in the U.S. lack access to       retirement coverage through work. This problem has grown       unabated and without adequate attention at the federal level.       Finally, new DOL rules that are under attack will enhance       retirement security for the millions of Americans who do not       have access to pensions and have limited means to increase       savings for retirement. The new rules simply allow states and       cities to set up important auto-enrollment programs to       enhance savings if they chose to do so. One rule encourages       state auto-enrollment tax-free savings plans, or state-      created tax-free saving plans for private business. The       second resolution would block a rule that clarifies when       county and city auto-enrollment plans will be exempt from       federal retirement law. California and a number of other       states have either already adopted plans or are considering       adopting plans. In addition, cities such as New York,       Philadelphia and Seattle are also considering similar       measures.        These resolutions of disapproval would unfairly impact       these new plans and the millions who want to take advantage       of them. Approximately half of all workers lack access to any       type of pension or employment-based retirement savings plan.       The DOL regulation is narrowly tailored to authorize       governments to establish plans for those employers who do not       offer retirement programs. The burden imposed upon such       employers is minimal. Significantly, the regulation simply       clarifies that states and local governments can create auto-      enrollment programs. In the absence of the regulation, states       may still offer the programs, although the legal status is       uncertain. These regulations not only clarify the matter, but       provide some important protections for participants.        I urge you to vote no on H.J. Res 66 and H.J. Res 67, which       would harm these important state and local savings programs.            Sincerely,                                                        Scott Frey,      Director of Federal Government Affairs.                                   ____                                                 American Federation                                                     of Teachers,                                  Washington, DC, February 15, 2017.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: For many Americans, the ability to       maintain their living standards in retirement continues to be       a source of anxiety and concern. Two-thirds of participants       in the Employee Benefit Research Institute's 2016 Retirement       Confidence Survey indicated that they had no retirement plan,       and more than 50 percent reported they had less than $25,000       in retirement savings.        As a result, a large number of states are moving       legislation to help employees of small employers to access       retirement savings plans. The Department of Labor has       assisted this effort by excluding such plans from ERISA. In       light of these facts, the AFT urges you to vote no on       Congressional Review Act resolutions (H.J. Res. 66 and H.J.       Res. 67) that would reimpose ERISA standards on governments       and only serve to chill state and city innovation.        Although most jobs are created by small businesses, most       small business workers are not offered any retirement plan.       According to the Center for Retirement Initiatives (CRI), 98       percent of all firms in the U.S. employ fewer than 100       workers, and about two-thirds of these workers lack access to       any retirement plan. Many small-business owners who were       contacted by the Government Accountability Office reported       shying away from sponsoring any retirement plan because of       all of the administrative requirements and fiduciary       responsibilities for selecting investment funds and managing       plan assets. Unless something is done to improve the       retirement prospects of the small-employer workforce, these       individuals will fall into poverty in retirement, and place       emotional stress on their families and financial stress on       their government sponsors.        In response to this retirement savings gap, a large number       of states have removed regulatory and administrative barriers       for small businesses that want to offer a retirement savings       vehicle to their workers. These bipartisan common-sense       approaches are collectively known as ``Secure Choice.'' In       the last few years, about half of all states have considered       ways to provide small employers and their employees with low-      cost, professionally managed savings options. Seven states       already have enacted legislation and are preparing to       implement their plans.        In 2016, the DOL promulgated an rule providing states and       cities with guidance on how to enter into public-private       partnerships, with the goal of increasing savings rates among       employees of small businesses. The rule clearly states that       an automatic IRA program established by a state or city must       remove the burden of administering the retirement plan from       small-business owners. The rule puts in place only one       requirement: Small employers that do not offer any other       retirement plan to their employees must offer a payroll       deduction for employees who voluntarily choose to participate       in the savings plan. In short, the DOL rule eliminates much       federal red tape, and gives governments more flexibility to       innovate. This allows states and cities to provide a glide       path for small employers to offer a retirement savings plan       to their workers.        Just as states facilitated the pooling and investing of 529       college savings plans in partnership with private investment       firms, the same convention is being employed in a retirement       savings context. Private investment companies can bid to       invest the pooled savings from employees of small employers.       Workers will enjoy the twin benefits of low-cost and well-      managed investments. Small employers are only required to       provide payroll deduction and forward the program information       to employees.        Again, the AFT urges Congress to support these state-      sponsored, public-private retirement savings programs--      collectively referred to as Secure Choice--by voting against       Congressional Review Act resolutions H.J. Res. 66 and H.J.       Res. 67.            Sincerely,                                                  Randi Weingarten,      President.                                   ____                                                 National Conference                                           of State Legislatures,                                  Washington, DC, February 13, 2017.        Members of The United States House of Representatives: The       National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), the bi-      partisan organization representing the legislatures of our       nation's states, territories, and commonwealths, urges you to       vote against H.J. Res. 66, a Congressional Review Act       resolution to overturn the Department of Labor's final rule       on ``Savings Arrangements Established by States for Non-      Governmental Employees.''        As our nation's laboratories of democracy, states are       developing and implementing innovative solutions that will       improve the retirement security of private sector workforces       and that will also save taxpayers billions of dollars.       Passage of this resolution is an affront to those in Congress       who advocate for the 10th Amendment as it will result in an       unwarranted preemption of state innovation, will restrict the       ability of millions of hardworking Americans to save for       retirement, and will prove costly to federal and state       budgets.        As the number of workers who lack enough savings to cover       the costs of retirement expenses continues to grow, states       need the flexibility to develop creative solutions to this       problem. Restricting the ability of states to establish       private sector savings plans will put an even greater strain       on public finances because states and the federal government       are ultimately responsible for funding the social safety       programs that are utilized by retirees who are not       financially independent. Eight states have enacted laws that       will establish state-facilitated retirement plans' and many       other states are considering these plans for their state's       private sector workers. Passage of H.J. Res. 66 will likely       prevent states from establishing these innovative plans and       will result in increased costs for federal and state budgets       as tens of millions of Americans who depend solely on social       security will increase dependency on other entitlement       programs.        Finally, we challenge the argument that private sector       workers, who lack retirement options, should not depend on       their state governments to establish these retirement saving       programs. We ask members of Congress that if states did not       act to address this growing problem, who would? It was only       after years and years of failure by the private sector to       address the retirement of  [[Page H1209]]       its small business workers that state governments were left       with no alternative but to provide an innovative solution for       these retirees' future. Congress should respect the states'       efforts to reduce a further financial burden on future       taxpayers.        NCSL urges Congress to support state innovation regarding       private retirement savings and vote no on a Congressional       Review Act resolution to overturn the Department of Labor's       rule on ``Savings Arrangements Established by States for Non-      Governmental Employees.''            Sincerely,      Senator Daniel T. Blue, Jr.,        North Carolina, President, NCSL.      Senator Deb Peters,        South Dakota, President-Elect, NCSL.                        Retirement Savings Fast Facts         Three-quarters of private sector workers feel anxious about       having enough money to live comfortably in retirement.        Fifty-five million Americans work for employers that do not       offer any form of a retirement savings plan.        80 percent of private sector workers between the ages of 18       and 64 support state-facilitated plans designed to help them       save their money for retirement.        State-facilitated retirement savings plans are designed       similarly to the popular 529 college savings plans, as the       plan's assets would be the personal property of the       individual saver, and their money could only be used to       benefit the individual saver.        State-facilitated retirement savings plans would be managed       by outside private sector fund managers and there will be no       connection between state-facilitated programs and public       pensions for government employees.        State-facilitated retirement savings plans would provide       employees the options to decline participation; however, data       suggests that employees with access to workplace retirement       plans are 15 times more likely to save for retirement.                                   ____                                      National Council of La Raza,                                  Washington, DC, February 10, 2017.      Hon. Virginia Foxx,      Chairman, House Committee on Education & Workforce,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Bobby Scott,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Education & Workforce,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Foxx and Ranking Member Scott: On behalf of       the National Council of La Raza (NCLR), the nation's largest       Latino civil rights and advocacy organization, I write to ask       you to oppose H. J. Res 66 and H. J. Res 67, resolutions of       disapproval under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), to       block the Department of Labor (DOL) rules that allow states       and cities to implement their own Individual Retirement       Account (IRA) retirement plans.        In the absence of congressional action to increase access       to retirement plans, state plans have stepped up to innovate       and fill that gap. H.J. Res 66 and H.J. Res 67 impedes state       and local innovation and entrepreneurialism to solve the       retirement issue. If the DOL rules are abolished, it would       have a chilling effect on the states and cities that are       working to implement programs, including California,       Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, and Oregon, which have all       passed legislation to setup these programs and New York City,       Philadelphia and Seattle which are currently considering       their own auto IRA plans.        Rep. Tim Walberg's (R-MI) H.J. Res 66 and Rep. Francis       Rooney's (R-FL) H.J. Res 67 would nullify the DOL rules that       offered the clarification necessary to help states and cities       implement their own auto-IRA plans consistent with The       Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA),       which would provide millions of workers access to a workplace       retirement plan. If these retirement plans were to become       subject to ERISA, they would not be able to move forward.        One of NCLR's goals in 2017 is to ensure the successful       implementation of the California Secure Choice Retirement       Savings Program. In September 2016, California Governor Jerry       Brown signed into law a bill that allows workers to access       state-run IRAs, which will feature automatic enrollment for       people working for employers with five or more employees.       Just over 7.5 million Californian workers who do not       currently have an employer-sponsored plan--half of whom are       Latino--will benefit from this program.                    Latinos Have a Strong Desire To Save         NCLR has worked to improve opportunities for Hispanics in       the United States for nearly 50 years. One of our core areas       of work is economic security, which is contingent on an       individual's retirement readiness. While many Americans have       difficulty saving for retirement, the issue is even more       acute for communities of color. For example, 62% of Black and       69% of Hispanic households lack any assets in a retirement       account. For those who can save, their account balances are       disproportionately low: four in five Latino households aged       25-64 have less than $10,000 in retirement savings, compared       to one in two White households. Prior to the DOL rule,       limited access to traditional retirement savings products       severely affected Latino workers' ability to invest in their       future. Efforts, whether at the federal or state level, to       increase access to quality retirement savings plans are       crucial to enhance Latino retirement readiness.        The difficulty in saving for retirement is the result of a       variety of factors, including lack of availability of       employer-sponsored retirement plans and lower rates of       participation in those plans when they are offered. Workers       of color have less access to retirement savings vehicles       compared to Whites: 38% of Latino employees aged 25-64 work       for an employer that sponsors a retirement plan, compared to       62% of White employees. Of those workers who have access to       an employer-sponsored plan, not all participate: only 29.7%       of Latino workers who have an employer plan participate       compared to 53.8% of White workers.        Low wages make investing for retirement especially       challenging given that housing, health care, and education       costs continue to rise while wages remain stagnant. 42% of       all Latinos earn poverty-level wages, even with having the       highest rate of labor force participation among all racial       and ethnic groups. Despite earning low wages, numerous       studies have shown that Hispanics value saving. A 2014       national Prudential survey of Latino consumers found that       ``the `saver' mindset prevails'' with Latinos. However, while       53% Latinos think that saving for retirement is a high       priority, near-term financial needs often compete for limited       resources.        Limited access to traditional retirement savings products       severely affect Latino worker's ability to invest in their       future. Efforts to increase access to quality retirement       savings plans are crucial to enhance Latino retirement       readiness. In the absence of congressional action to increase       access, state and city plans can help to fill that gap. It is       for the above reasons that NCLR urges you to opposes H. J.       Res 66 and H. J. Res 67 and ensure that millions of workers       have access to a workplace retirement plan.            Sincerely,                                                 Eric Rodriguez,                  Vice President, Office of Research, Advocacy, and                                                        Legislation.     In summary, proponents of this Congressional Review Act  resolution are rushing to nullify a rule that will make it easier for  people save for retirement. That is unacceptable. Every American  deserves to retire with dignity, and this resolution puts that  fundamental American value at risk.   I ask my colleagues to join me in opposing H.J. Res. 66.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Davis), a senior member of the Committee on Education  and the Workforce.    Mr. Speaker, just to clarify, there was a comment made  that these are government-run plans. Under these plans, the States  establish the framework for deducting the contributions, but these will  be managed by investment professionals, not by the State.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  [[Page H1212]]  DeSaulnier), my colleague, and a leader on the Education and the  Workforce Committee.   Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from the State of  Oregon (Ms. Bonamici) for the brief opportunity to speak.   I did want to speak personally just briefly on my experience in my  previous job in the California legislature when I voted for the Secure  Choice Act. Then we spent over 4 years working with the business  community, the investment community, and our attorneys to make sure the  issues that the majority have brought up in regards to ERISA and other  concerns, and I did this specifically as a former small-business person  with the small-business stakeholders, to make sure these concerns were  taken care of. We think that they have been taken care of, and we are  proud of the Secure Choice Act.   Close to 7 million Californians and 55 million people nationwide,  most of them low- and middle-income, don't have access to retirement  benefits through their employer. We are talking about people mostly who  work for small businesses where neither the employer nor the employee  can afford to enroll in expensive Wall Street-type financial advisers.  They aren't able to pay the fees and the expenses.   This element of the U.S. economy, and at this point I have to agree  with The New York Times editorial today, that this resolution appears  to be more directed towards Wall Street than to Main Street. Wall  Street, the financial sector, takes around 25 percent of all corporate  profits in the United States, represents 7 percent of the U.S. economy,  and creates merely 4 percent of all jobs.   The Secure Choice Act was directed away from those expensive  investments and allowed for a more efficient process for working class  Californians and Americans to be able to replicate this program and to  be able to have a secure retirement.   The majority often talks about states' rights and having States be  the laboratories of creation. I think in California we have done that  on multiple issues, and certainly on this issue.   Without programs like this, most of the 55 million private sector  Americans will end up relying on social security for more than half of  their retirement income, which averages about less than $1,400 a month.   California and seven other States that have created similar  retirement programs are looking out for working families. American  workers are doing more today than they ever have before. Over the last  40 years, worker productivity has risen 73 percent, yet hourly pay has  only increased 11 percent. Now they find their retirement more and more  in jeopardy.   I would ask the majority to strongly reconsider this approach, and to  work with California and other States to make sure that we can allow  these Americans to have access to a secure retirement.    Mr. Speaker, I assure my colleague that, as someone  with a consumer protection background, I would not be opposing this  resolution if it had consumer protections. In fact, this rule applies  when States have strict investor protections.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Maxine Waters), the ranking member of the Financial Services  Committee.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman  for the time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.J. Res. 66, which is  just a continuation of the House Republicans' attack on working  families and their retirement security.   H.J. Res. 66 would dismantle the Department of Labor rule allowing  for State-based retirement savings programs. This does nothing more  than make it harder for this country's roughly 40 million private  sector workers who do not have a way to save for retirement directly  out of their regular paycheck.   Under the current Department of Labor rule, State administered  retirement programs can allow employees, who do not have access to a  workplace savings plan, to establish an IRA through a payroll  deduction. In my State of California, we have the California Secure  Choice retirement savings program through which the State is working to  provide a savings option to roughly 6.8 million low- to middle-income  workers.   Last Congress, House Republicans unanimously voted to undermine  another Department of Labor rule designed to protect retirement  security for working families. In that case, the rule ensured that  workers receive retirement investment advice that is in their best  interest, referred to as the ``fiduciary rule.'' Now congressional  Republicans want to prevent workers from participating in voluntary  savings programs.   The Department of Labor rule that the Republicans are now seeking to  roll back provides clarity for States and employers so that California,  and the several other States that have already enacted similar plans,  can provide a simple savings tool for millions of working families.   Mr. Speaker, I just don't understand the arguments that are being  made against the average working person who would like to have  retirement savings. I don't know who is going to benefit if we do away  with their ability to have a savings plan, even if they don't have one  under the job that they work on. Who benefits? Is it Wall Street again?  What is happening here, and why is it that we have H.J. Res. 66?    May I inquire as to the remaining time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Oregon has 11\1/2\  minutes remaining.    May I inquire as to the remaining time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Oregon has 11\1/2\  minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer), a senior member of the Ways and Means  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record additional letters  in opposition to this resolution.                                                   Service Employees                                             International Union,                                  Washington, DC, February 13, 2017.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the two million members       of the Service Employees International Union (SEID), I urge       you to vote against H.J. Res 66 and H.J. Res 67, resolutions       disapproving of the Department of Labor's rules relating to       retirement savings arrangements established by states and       qualified state political subdivisions. The Department of       Labor rules make it easier for small employers to offer their       workers access to programs for retirement savings and achieve       an essential component of the American dream.        There is a retirement savings crisis in our country. Fifty-      five million workers do not have access to a retirement       savings plan at work. As a result, nearly half of all workers       have no retirement assets--no pension, no 401(k), and no IRA.       States have stepped in to begin to address this crisis with       innovative legislation that gives workers the opportunity to       set aside their own money in low-fee, professionally managed       savings accounts. Importantly, private sector money managers       and administrators will be hired to run these programs on       behalf of the states, generating American jobs. The       Department of Labor issued rules that clarified that       employers would not be subject to the fiduciary       responsibilities and reporting requirements of the Employee       Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) under these state       initiatives.        In addition to helping workers achieve a dignified       retirement, the state initiatives provide small businesses       with easy, low-cost access to a retirement savings plan.       Small employers are the least likely to offer retirement       savings plans because the cost can be prohibitive and the       ERISA requirements can be onerous at the start. The state       initiatives also are fiscally prudent actions that will save       public spending. A new study by Segal Consulting estimated       that state Medicaid costs would be reduced by $5 billion       within the first ten years of implementation of the state       plans. Those savings would grow exponentially over time as       more workers retired with greater amounts of savings.        Five states--California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland       and Oregon--have enacted legislation and will soon begin       taking payroll contributions. About half of states have       studied or are studying this concept. Massachusetts and       Vermont are considering legislation that would also allow       employer contributions. Contrary to misinformation being       spread about these plans, the program funds are not       guaranteed by the state, and state and participating       employers will have no liability for the payment of       retirement funds earned by the participants. These state       plans are bipartisan public/private initiatives that       appropriately use states as laboratories for innovation. They       are a win for workers, for employers, and for governments at       all levels.        SEIU is also deeply concerned with efforts under the       Congressional Review Act (CRA) to circumvent the Executive       Branch process of rulemaking and issuing regulatory guidance.       Using the CRA authority to undo Agency regulations and       guidance crafted carefully and with public input strips away       the importance of the rulemaking process. Using this       authority could significantly weaken or undo past and future       rules that protect workers.        SEIU respectfully urges you to vote against resolutions       H.J. Res 66 and H.J. Res 67 disapproving of these important       rules. We may add votes on this legislation to our       legislative scorecard. If you have any questions please       contact John Gray, Legislative Director.            Sincerely,                                                    Mary Kay Henry,      International President.                                   ____                                          Small Business Majority,                                  Washington, DC, February 13, 2017.      Re House Joint Resolutions 66 and 67.       Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Majority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader McCarthy: As a leading representative       of the 28 million small businesses in America, Small Business       Majority writes today urging you to oppose HJR 66 and HJR 67,       which would overturn the U.S. Department of Labor's rule       enabling states to establish retirement savings plans for       private sector workers. Striking down this rule would have a       chilling effect on states that are setting up their own       retirement savings programs, which would be harmful to small       businesses and their employees. We strongly believe states       should be allowed to decide whether to implement these types       of programs and how best to administer them in order to serve       small businesses and employees who struggle to save for       retirement.        The U.S. currently suffers from a retirement savings gap of       more than $6 trillion, and more than three million households       do not have any retirement savings at all. This lack of       savings for retirement disproportionately affects those who       are employed by small businesses. Eighty percent of workers       employed by businesses with fewer than 25 employees do not       have any sort of pension or retirement plan at all. This is       important because small businesses employ about half of all       private sector workers. Unless small business owners and       their employees start doing more to prepare for the future,       many Americans will not have enough money for their golden       years.        Small Business Majority's state opinion polling found small       business owners struggle to offer retirement savings programs       due to a number of barriers, but they want to offer this       benefit to their employees because it helps them attract and       retain talent. What's more, the majority of small employers       are concerned their employees will not have enough saved for       retirement. That's why small businesses overwhelmingly       support state efforts to establish state-administered       retirement savings programs, like the Secure Choice Savings       programs in Illinois and California.        When implemented, these programs will offer a convenient       and affordable option for small businesses and their       employees to save for the future. What's more, these programs       will not be funded by taxpayer dollars, and employers will       not contribute to funds, manage funds or have any       responsibility for financial advice for their employees'       investments.  [[Page H1214]]         Business owners know offering benefits like retirement       savings create a happier and more productive staff, which in       turn leads to increased productivity. Many small business       owners think of their employees as family, so it's not       surprising they support programs that enable them to foster a       happier workforce while protecting their workers and their       bottom line.        Additionally, programs like these help level the playing       field between small businesses that want to offer retirement       benefits but can't, and their larger counterparts that can.       This helps small businesses compete for the best employees,       and gives employers peace of mind that they are doing what's       best for their workers.        Small employers need retirement savings options for their       employees that make sense for their business and their bottom       line. State-administered retirement savings programs, like       those currently being established in California and Illinois,       can help many small business employees better save for their       futures. We urge you to uphold the Labor Department's rule       and allow states to decide how best to serve their small       businesses and private sector workers.            Sincerely,      John Arensmeyer.                                   ____                                         Tuesday, February 14, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House,      Washington, DC.        Speaker Ryan: Nearly 55 million workers across the country       lack access to employer-sponsored retirement plans, and       millions more fail to take full advantage of employer-      supported plans. Without access to easy and affordable       retirement savings options, far too many workers are on track       to retire into poverty where they will depend on Social       Security, state, and federal benefit programs for their most       basic retirement needs. States across the country have been       innovating to address this problem. We are writing to       respectfully urge you to protect the rights of states and       large municipalities to implement their own, unique       approaches.        Last week, two resolutions of disapproval (H.J. Res 66,       H.J. Res 67) were introduced to repeal key Department of       Labor (US DOL) rules. If passed, these resolutions would make       it more difficult for states and municipalities to seek       solutions to the growing retirement savings crisis. We ask       that you support the role of states as policy innovators by       voting ``No'' on H.J. Res 66 and H.J. Res 67.        Thirty states and municipalities are in the process of       implementing or exploring the establishment of state-      facilitated, private-sector retirement programs. Eight states       have passed legislation to allow individuals to save their       own earnings for retirement (no employer funds are involved       as these are not defined benefit plans). While most state and       municipal plans will be governed by independent boards, the       day-to-day investment management and recordkeeping would not       be conducted by the state, but rather by private sector       firms--the same financial institutions that currently provide       retirement savings products. These programs would apply to       businesses that don't currently offer a retirement plan, and       would in no way limit an employer's ability to seek out and       offer their own employer-sponsored plan.        Many states and municipalities are planning to use       Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) that will be wholly       owned and controlled by the participant, while others are       pursuing options such as Voluntary Multiple Employer Plans       (MEPs) and marketplace concepts. These plans would follow all       relevant guidelines and other noted regulations, and current       consumer protections would apply. Many of these programs are       modeled off of the 529 College Savings Plans or supplemental       public retirement plans that states administer today.        States are pursuing a multitude of solutions to address       this growing retirement savings crisis. We request that you       vote ``No'' on H.J. Res 66 and H.J. Res 67 with the       understanding that the US DOL rule provides important       flexibility to states and large municipalities as they seek       to address the growing retirement crisis facing this country.       We insist that states be allowed to maintain their       constitutional rights to implement such legislation.        We are happy to provide additional information or answer       any questions. Thank you for your support.            Sincerely,        Beth Pearce, Vermont State Treasurer; Joseph Torsella,       Pennsylvania State Treasurer; Allison Ball, Kentucky State       Treasurer; Ron Crane, Idaho State Treasurer; David Da mschen,       Utah State Treasurer; Kelly Mitchell, Indiana State       Treasurer; Tobias Read, Oregon State Treasurer; Lynn Fitch,       Mississippi State Treasurer; Terry Hayes, Maine State       Treasurer; Michael Frerichs, Illinois State Treasurer; John       Chiang, California State Treasurer; Brian Bonlender,       Director, Washington State Department of Commerce; Nancy       Kopp, Maryland State Treasurer; Kevin Lembo, Connecticut       State Comptroller; Ron Henson, Louisiana State Treasurer.                                   ____                                                  February 14, 2017.

If passed, these resolutions would make       it more difficult for states and municipalities to seek       solutions to the growing retirement savings crisis. We ask       that you support the role of states as policy innovators by       voting ``No'' on H.J. Res 66 and H.J. Res 67.        Thirty states and municipalities are in the process of       implementing or exploring the establishment of state-      facilitated, private-sector retirement programs. Eight states       have passed legislation to allow individuals to save their       own earnings for retirement (no employer funds are involved       as these are not defined benefit plans). While most state and       municipal plans will be governed by independent boards, the       day-to-day investment management and recordkeeping would not       be conducted by the state, but rather by private sector       firms--the same financial institutions that currently provide       retirement savings products. These programs would apply to       businesses that don't currently offer a retirement plan, and       would in no way limit an employer's ability to seek out and       offer their own employer-sponsored plan.        Many states and municipalities are planning to use       Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) that will be wholly       owned and controlled by the participant, while others are       pursuing options such as Voluntary Multiple Employer Plans       (MEPs) and marketplace concepts. These plans would follow all       relevant guidelines and other noted regulations, and current       consumer protections would apply. Many of these programs are       modeled off of the 529 College Savings Plans or supplemental       public retirement plans that states administer today.        States are pursuing a multitude of solutions to address       this growing retirement savings crisis. We request that you       vote ``No'' on H.J. Res 66 and H.J. Res 67 with the       understanding that the US DOL rule provides important       flexibility to states and large municipalities as they seek       to address the growing retirement crisis facing this country.       We insist that states and large municipalities be allowed to       maintain their constitutional rights to implement such       legislation.        We are happy to provide additional information or answer       any questions. Thank you for your support.            Sincerely,      Tim Burgess,        Seattle City Council, Finance Chair.      Scott M. Stringer,        New York City Comptroller.      Alan L. Butkovitz,        Philadelphia City Controller.                                   ____                                                  February 15, 2017.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: We are writing to strongly oppose       H.J.Res 66, which overturns the recent Department of Labor       rule supporting states' efforts to establish retirement       savings plans for non-governmental workers. As a national,       non-partisan Millennial research and advocacy organization,       we have been working hard to strengthen the financial       security of young adults by increasing access to retirement       savings plans. This legislation may have a chilling effect on       the implementation of Secure Choice, an important new program       that will help address the looming retirement crisis without       costing taxpayers a dime.        Changing dynamics in the workforce mean that Millennials       tend to work in industries that offer lower wages and fewer       benefits. Despite an interest in saving the small amounts of       discretionary income they do have, many young adults do not       have access to workplace retirement savings plans, including       less than half of low-income Millennial workers. Young adults       are significantly less financially secure today than their       parents were just one generation ago: 25-34 year-old       Millennials have half the net wealth and earn 20 percent       lower incomes when compared to 25-34 year-old Baby Boomers.       Limiting access to tools for saving makes catching up       financially that much more challenging for this generation.        Many states have worked diligently for over four years to       develop Secure Choice, which will provide workers who do not       have access to a workplace retirement plan a simple,       voluntary, low-cost, and portable retirement plan. Experts       agree that direct contributions from a paycheck into a       retirement account is the simplest and most effective way for       individuals to save.        This is why support among Millennials for a state       facilitated retirement savings plan like Secure Choice is       extraordinarily high: over 85 percent of young adults across       political affiliation and ideology support ``a voluntary       option for workers without a way to save for retirement at       work.''  [[Page H1215]]         We urge you to oppose H.J.Res 66 and allow individual       states to develop the tools young Americans need to save for       retirement.            Sincerely,      Young Invincibles.                                   ____                                               State of Connecticut,                                 Office of the State Comptroller,                                    Hartford, CT, February 14, 2017.      Hon. Joe Courtney:      Rayburn House Office Building,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Courtney: I am writing to seek your       support in preserving and strengthening the rights of       Connecticut and other states to address a growing retirement       savings crisis that threatens our state and national economy.        I am proud that Connecticut is among the states leading the       way for retirement security. The Connecticut Retirement       Security Authority savings program will ensure that       retirement savings opportunities are more readily attainable       for the 600,000 private-sector workers who lack access to a       retirement savings plan through the workplace and who deserve       financial security after a lifetime of work.        According to Connecticut-specific data from the Schwartz       Center for Economic Policy Analysis at The New School,       between 2000 and 2010, employers offering a retirement plan       declined from 66 percent to 59 percent. In other words, four       out of 10 workers residing in Connecticut do not have access       to a retirement plan at work.        In Connecticut's market analysis conducted by Boston       College, we found that these uncovered workers were more       likely to earn lower income and are largely unserved by the       financial sector, so their needs are often different from       other 401(k) participants. It is important to protect against       a transfer of wealth from the bottom to the top because high       fees on low dollar accounts are a huge obstacle to retirement       savings, particularly for lower income workers.        There is an entire generation of employees, many of them       lifelong hard-working middle class people, who are headed to       retirement financially unequipped, in part due to lack of       access to a workplace-based retirement savings option. This       is a problem, not only for those individuals and families who       are financially forced to delay retirement indefinitely, but       for our entire state and economy. In many cases, these       individuals may be forced to turn to the state for assistance       with health care, nursing care, food, housing, energy or       other costly services.        The goal is not to compete or replace the private market,       but to fulfill a significant unmet need in the market that       must be answered for the sake of those families and our       entire state economy. The market is currently failing to       reach nearly half of our workforce even though the demand is       there According to an AARP 2015 survey, 64% of small       businesses in Connecticut that were not offering a retirement       plan stated that they would take advantage of a state plan if       it were offered.        Connecticut was heartened by the U.S. Department of Labor       rule last August, providing a safe harbor for states to       conduct these programs. While we have been advised by several       ERISA attorneys that the U.S. Department of Labor rule was       not required, and that states already have the right to       establish such programs, the proposed bills nullifying the       U.S. Department of Labor rule and attempting to roll back       states' rights may create a chilling effect on the companies       who would want to administer these programs. I strongly urge       you to vote against H.J.Res.66 and support states' rights to       create these programs.            Sincerely,                                                       Kevin Lembo,                                                 State Comptroller.     I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms.  Schakowsky), the co-chair of the Congressional Task Force on Seniors.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), a senior member of the Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 10 seconds to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the Democratic leader of the U.S. House of  Representatives.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to inquire as to the  remaining time, please.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Oregon has 4\1/4\  minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank all of my colleagues who came this afternoon to speak in  opposition to this resolution. It shows how important it is to the  working people in our States and in our districts. These are people who  do not have a retirement plan. That is who we are looking out for.   I urge all my colleagues today to stand up for workers who deserve  that chance at saving for retirement and who will get that chance  because Oregon and other States have stepped up and are taking action.   Again, the Department of Labor safe harbor rule applies to States  that have strict investor protections. We wouldn't be here today if  those strict investor protections were not maintained.   I especially urge my colleagues, particularly those of us who are  concerned about states' rights, not to undermine States like Oregon and  all the others that have stepped up to create these innovative  solutions. There is a gap. That is why so many people today do not have  retirement savings.   Colleagues, please join us in opposing H.J. Res. 66.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.  [[Page H1218]]                                ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in strong opposition to H.J. Res. 67, which would nullify the  Department of Labor rule enabling certain State political subdivisions,  such as cities or counties, to establish payroll deduction retirement  savings plans.   Working families across the country deserve the opportunity to retire  with security and dignity. That is not a reality for millions of  Americans. In fact, about 40 million private sector workers do not have  access to retirement savings plans at their jobs and are struggling to  make ends meet.   Several States, including my home State of Oregon, have developed and  are ready to implement innovative solutions that will help workers save  for retirement. Municipalities are also interested in stepping up to  address this challenge and help their residents save. These are people  who do not have a plan currently. They want help; they need help in  saving.   So in August of 2016, the Department of Labor issued its final rule  providing guidance and clarity to States and private sector employees  on the kind of State-based payroll deduction retirement savings  programs that would not be subject to ERISA, the Employee Retirement  Income Security Act.   As part of that August 2016 final rule, the Department of Labor  indicated that it would initiate another rulemaking process to consider  whether and how to include other jurisdictions. The Department of Labor  invited and considered public comment on this process.   As a result, in December of 2016, the Department of Labor issued a  final rule that would allow certain localities under specific  conditions to establish retirement savings programs.                                time  1530    To be eligible, the locality must have an authority under relevant  State law; it must be larger than the least populous State, which is  currently Wyoming, at approximately 600,000 residents; it must not be  in a State that has already enacted a statewide payroll deduction  savings plan; and it must implement and administer the plan for its  workers.   Now, according to the Department of Labor's final rule, three cities,  New York City, Philadelphia, and Seattle, were identified as having  potential interest. New York City's comptroller has noted that 57  percent of the city's private sector workers do not have access to a  retirement plan at their place of employment.   This final rule just went into effect last month, and now my friends  on the other side of the aisle are rushing to repeal the rule and  prevent the Labor Department from issuing any substantially similar  rule in the future.   Congress should be in the business of helping people save for  retirement, not in the business of unfairly limiting or jeopardizing  workers' ability to save for retirement; nor should Congress go out of  its way to undermine the rights of cities and counties to implement  innovative solutions that are needed for their residents.   I urge my colleagues to reject H.J. Res. 67 and get to work on  meaningful solutions to address our country's retirement security  crisis. America's working families deserve the opportunity to be able  to save enough to retire with dignity and security.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Crowley), the chair of the House Democratic Caucus and a  senior member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Crowley), the chair of the House Democratic Caucus and a  senior member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from New York.    Mr. Speaker, to clarify further, this rule simply  amends the State rule that we addressed in H.J. Res. 66, that gives the  safe harbor to jurisdictions with strict investor protections.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Espaillat), a new member of the Education and the Workforce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 3 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Crowley) because New York, according to  their comptroller, has noted that 57 percent of the city's private  sector workers do not have access to a retirement plan at their place  of employment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   This has been a good discussion, but I want to reemphasize that there  is a need in this country. People are insecure about their retirement.  There are too many people--millions of people across the country--who  do not have retirement savings. So, today, my colleagues aren't coming  here and saying: We have a plan; let's help these people save for  retirement.   Instead, they are going to make it harder for States and  municipalities who are stepping up to fill this critical need.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stand with workers who deserve a  chance at saving for retirement and who will get that chance because,  as with the State bill, now there are several large municipalities  stepping up to help.   I urge my colleagues not to undermine the work of those cities and  municipalities that are working to enact innovative solutions. Again,  these are managed by investment professionals. There are investor  protections in these plans. People do not have to participate, but they  are hungry for this opportunity. Millions of people across the country  are watching.   Where is the solution?   Let's not get in their way. Please join me in opposing H.J. Res. 66  and H.J. Res. 67.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.                            ____________________
