 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to present an amendment that  [[Page H5780]]  holds the key to accountability and transparency in the aftermath of  the devastating COVID-19 pandemic.   The amendment I am proposing to the fiscal year 2024 Labor, Health  and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill targets a  critical issue within the National Institutes of Health, NIH, Office of  the Director. Specifically, it aims to reduce funding by $3,748,715.  That is an amount equivalent to the grant awarded to EcoHealth  Alliance, Incorporated, for their research on ``Understanding the Risk  of Bat Coronavirus Emergence'' at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.   The gravity of the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be overstated. Lives were  lost, businesses shuttered, and families torn apart. It is a collective  responsibility to address the origins of this crisis, and my proposed  amendment aligns with three fundamental principles that I have  consistently emphasized while being in Congress.   First, we must uncover the truth of the pandemic's origins. This  shouldn't be a Republican or Democrat thing. This is an American thing.  Second, we must hold those involved responsible and accountable. Last,  we must provide the American people with full transparency.   After nearly 4 years of investigation, substantial evidence now  points to the Wuhan Institute of Virology as the source of the COVID-19  virus. Disturbingly, it has come to light that the Wuhan lab conducted  this research funded by the United States Government. While the  Department of Health and Human Services has taken action against the  institution, it is evident that more must be done.   The HHS Office of Inspector General released a report in January of  this year, January of 2023, revealing that the NIH failed to  effectively monitor or address EcoHealth's compliance with certain  requirements. Shockingly, the NIH only began investigating the Wuhan  Institute's role in the pandemic at the outset of the crisis. This lack  of foresight is unacceptable, especially considering the potential  consequences of such research.   Moreover, the investigation brought to light EcoHealth's delayed  submission of a critical report containing evidence of a virus with  enhanced growth, a report that should have been reported immediately.  This is just one instance of the NIH's failure to exercise proper  oversight.   In light of these findings, it is imperative that we hold the NIH  accountable for its shortcomings. The American people deserve an  assurance that our agencies are performing their duties diligently and  responsibly, especially when the consequences are as far-reaching as  the global pandemic was.   The HHS's report highlights a series of lapses in NIH's monitoring  and oversight. Given these documented failures, I strongly believe that  the NIH should face consequences for its role in the mishandling of  funds and lack of oversight. Our amendment sends a clear message that  we, as representatives of the American people, will not tolerate  negligence that results in such catastrophic outcomes.   In conclusion, let us come together to pass this crucial amendment,  demonstrating our commitment to accountability, transparency, and the  well-being of the American people. It is time to act decisively and  ensure that our agencies fulfill their responsibilities to prevent  future crises of this magnitude.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to the time remaining.    Mr. Chair, I disagree with my colleague from  Connecticut. The American people want the NIH to succeed. We need the  NIH to succeed, but the American people are also saying, show us  transparency. Tell us what is going on.   When the government is trusted, then we can actually get results and  do good things for the American people. This is about trust. In fact,  $3.7 million, I think that is a small price to pay when it comes to the  price that Americans paid.   Yes, I urge this to be a bipartisan amendment, that we have  transparency. If you are on the side of the American people, who  deserve better from government agencies, this should be an easy  amendment.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, thank you for joining me today as I bring  forth a matter of great concern and shed light on recently proposed  regulatory changes that will severely impact Medicaid programs across  the country, including Texas, and have profound consequences on the 90  million Americans who rely on Medicaid to access healthcare.   This year, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS,  introduced materials that challenge the statutory language governing  States' longstanding methods to fund the non-Federal share of the  Medicaid payments.   Two documents, in particular, have raised significant concerns: the  information bulletin on healthcare-related taxes and hold-harmless  arrangements and specific provisions of CMS's proposed rule titled  ``Medicaid and CHIP Managed Care Access, Finance, and Quality.''   The amendment I am proposing to the fiscal year 2024 Labor, Health,  and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill will protect the  safety net in Texas and many other States and ensure that Medicaid  beneficiaries continue to receive the essential care by prohibiting  Federal funds from being used to finalize, implement, and enforce  harmful policies that will severely limit States' ability to draw down  critical Federal Medicaid payments.   For the most part, I applaud CMS for pushing forward with a  comprehensive regulation to overhaul the structure of Medicaid-managed  care programs.   I acknowledge the potential positive impact of certain provisions  that could enhance access to coverage and care, if implemented.  However, there are legitimate concerns that specific policies within  this framework will compromise States' access to vital financial  resources, undermining the intended improvements.   Firstly, CMS's recently proposed changes directly contradict the  understanding that Texas and other States have relied on for years to  operate their Medicaid programs.   As Judge Kernodle recently stated in his ruling enjoining CMS from  using their unsupported interpretation: ``CMS may not rewrite clear  statutory terms to suit its own sense of how the statute should  operate.''   Secondly, the proposed rule expands CMS's authority over State- directed payments by granting the agency the power to withhold approval  or retroactively deny already approved State directed payments if it  believes they are financed with impermissible non-Federal dollars.   This newfound discretion may introduce uncertainties into States'  Medicaid financing structures, potentially hindering their ability to  implement and maintain State-directed payments that contribute to the  welfare of Medicaid beneficiaries.   To sum it up, these proposed policies are an overreach and the latest  efforts in a series of Federal actions seeking to erode States'  flexibility, increase oversight, and curtail arrangements that help  hospitals draw down Federal funds and provide much-needed access to  care for not only Texas patients but patients in many other States.   If enacted, policies of this kind would accelerate hospital closures,  limit access to care for low-income Americans, and leave States with a  more significant financial Medicaid burden.   Mr. Chair, I urge each of my colleagues to support this amendment and  recognize the gravity of this situation. My amendment aims to safeguard  consistent, predictable, and adequate funding, ensuring access to care  for all Americans, especially those in vulnerable situations.   Your support is crucial in protecting the stability of our hospitals  and ensuring that Medicaid beneficiaries continue to receive the care  that they deserve.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate my colleague from Connecticut,  and I think we probably have the same aim, which is to have care and  access to that care.   For States like Texas that chose not to expand Medicaid, this rule is  particularly damaging. Again, I can't stress enough how the risk of the  overreach of the Federal Government will hurt those who want to access  care.   The proposed rule expands the authority of our State directed  payments and has the ability to withhold the approval or retroactively  deny already approved State directed payments. In reality, the access  to care really is at stake.   I agree. We are both probably talking about a similar level of  access. This rule will negatively impact that.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
