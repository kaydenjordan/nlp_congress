 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Bill Reed, an  Arkansan who is retiring after more than 34 years of dedicated service  at Riceland Foods, the world's largest miller and marketer of rice.   Bill is a member of the company's senior management team whose  responsibilities include government affairs, public relations, and the  Riceland Sustainability Initiative. His interest in agriculture at a  young age led him to pursue degrees in this field. Bill earned a  bachelor's degree with honors in plant and soil science from the  University of Tennessee and a master's degree in agricultural  journalism from the University of Wisconsin.   In 1976, he moved to the Natural State to work as a State specialist  with the University of Arkansas Cooperative Extension Service. He has  continued his commitment not only to Arkansas but to Arkansas  agriculture for more than 40 years.   Bill is recognized as one of the most passionate advocates on behalf  of the Arkansas rice industry. Bill is constantly looking out for the  rice farmers and businesses by promoting policies to grow the industry  and pushing for expanding markets. His advocacy extended beyond the  boundaries of agriculture. He was always ready to lend a hand to me or  to my staff on any issue important to Arkansas.   He shares his passion for agriculture throughout the State, country,  and the world as a representative of Riceland on numerous boards and  trade associations, including the USA Rice Federation and the National  Council of Farmer Cooperatives. In addition, Bill serves as chairman of  the Associated Industries of Arkansas, vice president for agriculture  of the Arkansas State Council on Economic Education, and vice chairman  of the board of visitors of Phillips Community College of the  University of Arkansas.   He is a faithful servant of Jesus Christ and is leading his life as  Christ calls us to do. In recent years, Bill began seminary school, and  his retirement from Riceland will allow him to pursue the ministry full  time and help people in need.   I appreciate Bill's friendship, and I am confident that he will excel  in this role, just as he had done as an advocate for Arkansas rice. I  wish him well in all of his future endeavors and look forward to the  great work he will continue to do in helping the great State of  Arkansas.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________
