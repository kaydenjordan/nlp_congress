 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support  of H. Res. 630, introduced by my colleague Barbara Comstock, which  mandates antiharassment and antidiscrimination education for all  Members of Congress and their staff during each session of Congress.   I commend my colleagues, Representative Comstock and Representative  Speier, who have worked on this bipartisan resolution together. Both  know this issue too well from the Member and the staff level. Both have  seen firsthand how our current process has failed to protect many who  devote their lives to working on behalf of the American people in the  House of Representatives.   The resolution they have introduced is an important and appropriate  first step to educating Members and staff on inappropriate workplace  actions and how to report such conduct. It is absolutely unacceptable  to be subjected to harassment or discrimination of any kind wherever  you are or wherever you work.   Importantly, this resolution requires all who work for the House of  Representatives, from Members of Congress to staff, detailees, fellows,  and interns, whether paid or unpaid, to be educated on their rights  in the workplace and where they can safely and confidentially go to  report instances of misconduct.    Mr. Speaker, as chair of the House Ethics Committee, I can assure you  the committee takes allegations of discrimination and harassment very  seriously. Under House rule X, the House Ethics Committee is authorized  to enforce standards of conduct for Members, officers, and employees.  The committee is authorized to investigate alleged violations of any  law, rule, or regulation and to make recommendations to the House for  further action.   The committee has sole jurisdiction over the interpretation of our  Code of Official Conduct. In order for the Ethics Committee to fulfill  its obligation to investigate and potentially discipline Members and  staff, the committee must be given information on potential bad actors.   The Congressional Accountability Act was enacted over 20 years ago,  in 1995, and it needs to be reevaluated. It established the Office of  Compliance as the agency responsible to administer and enforce the  civil rights, labor, and workplace safety and health laws of the CAA.   There may be elements of the CAA that are working well today, but  silencing victims and potentially spending taxpayer dollars to settle  claims needs to be reevaluated. It is time for Congress to take action  to reform a process that is not working as well as it should and to  ensure that we have legislation that protects victims while also  ensuring due process for the accused.   While there is much more work to be done, I applaud the action my  colleagues have taken by introducing this important education  resolution. I am committed to continuing to work with the House  Administration Committee, as well as my colleagues in the House, to  improve the workplace called the  [[Page H9494]]  people's House and the conduct of those who work in it.   In supporting this resolution today, I believe we are one step closer  to expressing to the Nation that sexual harassment is wrong and must be  prevented and stopped. Mr. Speaker, I urge a unanimous vote by my  colleagues in the House.                                time  1445
