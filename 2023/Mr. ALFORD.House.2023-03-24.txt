 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the importance of  ensuring that all students are fed in a nutritious and affordable  manner. I am proud to have introduced H.R. 1168, the School Lunch  Affordability Act Of 2023.   Every year, schools are forced to raise their school lunch prices to  comply with the Paid Lunch Equity program set by the Richard B. Russell  National School Lunch Act. This arbitrary price increase mandated miles  away by Congress has no impact on nutritional content and puts  unnecessary pressure on hardworking American families and, ultimately,  leads to more hungry students.   This legislation would amend the regulation to return local control  to schools. Protecting the health and nutrition of our youth is a  critical, critical aspect of a strong educational system and it is  completely un-American to subject our local schools to the burdensome  Federal regulations.   Schools should be able to make these decisions for themselves, not  the bureaucrats in Washington. This legislation grants them this  ability at the local level.                            ____________________
