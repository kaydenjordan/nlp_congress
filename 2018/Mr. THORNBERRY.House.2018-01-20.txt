 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule, which will help give the  House the flexibility it needs to respond appropriately to whatever the  Senate may be able to pass.   I think it is important to remind everyone that the House has done  its work. We passed every one of the appropriations bills before the  fiscal year began in October. And, on Thursday, we passed a bill to  continue government funding until February 16. Now we are waiting to  see what the Senate may be able to pass, and this rule enables us to  respond to that.   But I want to focus my comments on the effects that this budget drama  is having on the United States military.   Mr. Speaker, the first job of the Federal Government is to defend the  country. We have to do that before we do  [[Page H591]]  anything else. There are more than 2 million men and women who have  volunteered to risk their lives to help keep us safe. Some of them are  stationed, this very minute, all around the world. Every single one of  them and their families depend upon us for the support they need to do  the job that the country has asked them to do.   As a matter of fact, Mr. Speaker, the Constitution is very explicit,  saying it is Congress' responsibility to raise and support, provide and  maintain, the military forces of this Nation.   But at this moment, those men and women, wherever they are around the  world, doing their job, are not getting paid. They will still do their  job, but now they have an additional concern to worry them.   There are other consequences.   All of the civilians who work at the Department of Defense are also  not getting paid. On Monday, about half of them will be told not to  come to work. The work on weapons maintenance activities, largely, will  be stopped. New contracts for support and other activities will not be  allowed to proceed. Many medical procedures at military treatment  facilities will not take place. And the Pentagon will not be able to  pay any of its bills, whether that is money that is owed to a family  who has lost a loved one in the line of duty, or whether it is paying a  doctor to take care of a servicemember.                                time  1630    Mr. Speaker, it is absolutely true that every day that we force the  military to live under a continuing resolution, it does damage to the  military. The damage that is being done now under this shutdown is far  worse.   Truthfully, we have not fulfilled our responsibility to the troops or  to the Constitution for some time. As the world grew more dangerous  over the last 8 years, we cut the military budget about 20 percent. No  other portion of the Federal budget--no other significant portion, at  least, of the Federal budget has undergone those kinds of cuts, and now  we do this.   Mr. Speaker, there is an even more disturbing problem here. Too many  people want to use our constitutional duty to the troops as leverage  for some other issue.   Mostly everyone on both sides of the Capitol agree that we need to  spend more on defense, and that is reflected in the votes we have had  on defense issues over the past year, but some have now made actually  spending that money that the troops need conditional on getting their  way on some other extraneous, unrelated issue.   Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that we ought to support the military  funding on its own merits and not tie it to any other issue, and then  we can look at those other issues on their own merits, too.   Using support for our military as a hostage to try to get political  advantage on some other issue--really on any other issue--is wrong and  it ought to stop.   We need to set our troops free from this political drama. The time to  do that is now.    Mr. Speaker, I have consistently said, and I continue  to say, that every day under a continuing resolution does damage to the  United States military. There is no question about it. I also have said  today that a government shutdown does more damage to the United States  military.   I want to just make one other point. I think we can have debates  about the proper level and the proper way to fund the military, but  what is completely unacceptable is to hold the United States military  hostage for some other political agenda that has nothing to do with  them, and that is what has been going on.   Mr. Speaker, this House passed a defense appropriations bill for the  full year back before October 1. That needs to pass now. Get the  military out of this political drama and set them free.
