 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 50th  anniversary of the Arab Community Center for Economic and Social  Services located in the heart of Dearborn, MI. Created in 1971 out of a  storefront on the impoverished south end of Dearborn, ACCESS has been  engaging and building a community to empower individuals, families, and  community members ever since. What began with a modest, volunteer-run  effort to support the growing immigrant population has blossomed into  the largest Arab American community nonprofit in the United States.  ACCESS has been integral in assisting the growing Arab population as  they adapt to life in the United States. By uplifting and advocating  for real and meaningful change, they have become committed to  safeguarding the engagement of Arab Americans throughout Michigan.   Fittingly, the mission of ACCESS is ``To empower communities to  improve their health and their economic, social, and cultural well- being.'' Spread throughout metro Detroit, ACCESS has 10 locations that  provide more than 120 different programs/services to the community;  they provide educational opportunities for youth including the Arab  American Youth Leadership course, in which they support and foster the  identity of the Arab American youth, as well as their 21st Century  Community Learning Centers, which provide academic support during the  school year and enrichment in the summer. Children are exposed to  topics that focus on their identity and culture, as well as help build  their advocacy, leadership, and civic engagement skills through youth  empowerment to encourage community involvement.   In addition to youth services, ACCESS also offers a large variety of  services to adults, especially recent immigrants. ACCESS provides  subsidized immigration services to the community, as well as many free  services addressing the community's basic needs, such as tax  assistance, legal services, and assistance with public benefits  programs. They also provide life skills training to settling families  via their Center for Working Families, including financial coaching,  workforce development, and skill-building. Most profoundly, ACCESS  provides affordable healthcare through two community health and  research centers--a fully integrated community health ``one-stop  service center'' that is comprised of medical, public health and  research programs, as well as mental and behavioral health programs.   While mainly focused on direct assistance to individuals, ACCESS also  works to preserve the Arab American history and cultural identity  through national programs such as the National Network for Arab  American Communities, the Center for Arab American Philanthropy, and  most notably, the Arab American National Museum, founded in 2005; the  museum is an affiliate of the Smithsonian Institute and is the Nation's  only cultural institution devoted solely to document, preserve, and  present the history, culture, and contributions of Arab Americans.   ACCESS has impacted countless lives throughout the course of 50  years. I ask my colleagues to join me today in recognizing ACCESS for  their tireless advocacy and support of the Arab American community,  both in Michigan and nationwide. I wish ACCESS continued growth and  prosperity in the years ahead.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 120th  anniversary of the Royal Oak Women's Club. For over 120 years, the  Royal Oak Women's Club--ROWC--members have come together for the  purpose of society and service within the Royal Oak community.   On the evening of November 8, 1902, 14 local Royal Oak women gathered  together in the parlor of Mrs. Frances Lathrup Martin, for the purpose  of creating a study club. It was Mrs. Martin herself that became the  first president of the newly formed club. At the time of its founding,  the club's mission included the expansion of opportunities for local  women, pursuit of issues such as pediatric health and safety, and the  promotion of general well-being within the Royal Oak community.   Over the years, as the ROWC expanded its presence in the area by  joining larger regional organizations such as the General Federation of  Women's Clubs--GFWC--the Michigan Federation of Women's Clubs--GFWC  MI--Detroit Federation of Women's Clubs, and the Oakland County  Federation of Women's Clubs. The club also transformed to become  increasingly civic-minded, with efforts including local advocacy  campaigns that resulted in better safety and sanitary equipment within  Royal Oak's local public schools.   One-hundred and twenty years later the club has continued to expand  and evolve, and now boasts a membership of over 120 persons, who  dedicate their time toward the pursuit of community projects that  promote good citizenship, civism, and quality education. The ROWC  continues to hold a place of high esteem and local importance to the  city, with many community groups and organizations using group's  clubhouse as a location to hold meetings and events. The clubhouse  itself holds significance, for both club and community. The structure,  purchased by the ROWC in the 1920s, was even then one of the oldest  buildings in the city. Originally a Baptist church constructed in 1839,  the building has been relocated and restored as necessary for its  preservation and continued use, but continues to exhibit many original  features. Upkeep of this structure, which was designated in 1979 as a  Michigan Registered Historical Site, 1999 a Royal Oak Historic  District, and is known today as the city's oldest building, remains  among the club member's highest charges.   The Royal Oak Women's club continues to make a difference today  through their philanthropic efforts, as well as by providing the women  of Royal Oak with a space they may gather, exchange ideas and  knowledge, and pursue the ``high ideals'' envisioned by the club's  original members. Their efforts to support the community continue as  well; the club provides financial support to the neonatal unit at  Beaumont Hospital, the Royal Oak Library, Haven of Oakland County, the  Boys and Girls Club for Southeast Michigan, and the South Oakland  Shelter to name just a few of their initiatives. Members of the ROWC  also volunteer their time to support the annual Royal Oak Community  Awards banquet, the community service luncheon, and the annual  Salvation Army Toy Luncheon, in addition to supporting the all-night  graduation parties for the three local high schools.   The Royal Oak Women's Club has been an integral part of the Royal Oak  community and the overall community of southeast Michigan for more than  120 years. As a Michigander and a resident of Oakland County, I am  honored to ask my colleagues in joining me in celebrating this  significant milestone for the Royal Oak Women's Club, its members, and  the entire city of Royal Oak. I wish the Royal Oak Women's Club  continued growth and prosperity in the years ahead.                            ____________________
