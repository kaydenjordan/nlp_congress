 Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of  the 75th anniversary of the Allied D-Day invasion of France, to honor  the bravery of our Armed Forces who served in that operation.   On June 6, 1944, 73,000 Americans took part in Operation Overlord to  storm the beaches of Normandy. Sadly, the United States suffered more  than 6,000 casualties in this operation. Ultimately, thousands more  U.S. servicemembers would fall in the coming weeks and months  liberating the rest of Western Europe from German control.   Madam Speaker, last year I attended a wreath laying ceremony at the  Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial in France. Looking out among  the white crosses, one could see fathers buried next to sons and  brothers next to brothers. The average age of those who perished was  just 19 years old.  [[Page H4338]]    This memorial serves as a constant reminder that the United States  will fight and die to protect the freedoms of not just American  citizens, but for those around the globe. We are eternally grateful for  this devotion to duty and devotion to country.                            ____________________
