 Mr. Speaker, I rise today, from the 1st  Congressional District of the Great State of Illinois, to include in  the Record a letter signed by over 650 faith leaders urging President  Biden to declare Mother's Day as a National Day of Prayer, Mourning,  Repentance, and Contemplation To End Gun Violence.  Over 650 Faith Leaders Call for Mother's Day To Be Declared a National    Day of Prayer, Mourning, Repentance, and Contemplation, To End Gun                                  Violence         Dear President Biden: The epidemic of gun violence has       become so dire that nearly 1 in 5 adults in the United States       have lost a family member to a gun death. Mass shootings have       escalated so much in recent years (23% since the start of the       COVID-19 pandemic began) that as of April 12, there have       already been at least 147 mass shootings so far this year. It       is a war taking place in our schools, houses of worship,       supermarkets, movie theatres, homes, businesses nightclubs,       and more. While some may throw up their arms and say that       this is a battle too large to win, we, an interfaith       coalition, made up of Christians, Jews, Muslims, Hindus,       Buddhists, and other faith traditions, remember the miracles       of ancient times and remain optimistic that this scourge can       be overcome.        Do we really believe as a nation that the second amendment       and the profits of those who manufacture AR-15-style assault       rifles, Hellfire missiles, and other instruments of death       should take primacy over our rights to life, liberty, and the       pursuit of happiness?        We thank you for having last year pushed through Congress       the first major gun violence protection legislation in 30       years, for highlighting the issue during this year's State of       the Union, and the executive order you issued last month.        Given the gravity and urgency of this issue, we ask for       more. We appeal to you to declare this Mother's Day, Sunday,       May 14, 2023, to be a national day of repentance, mourning,       prayer, and reflection to address the culture of gun violence       that is staining our collective soul.        We ask for our lawmakers and faith institutions to reflect       this Mother's Day on how we are allowing gun manufacturers,       the gun lobby, and a culture of gun worship to hold our       country hostage.        Mary, a role model for motherhood, stood at the foot of the       cross witnessing brutality, inhumanity, and death being       inflicted on her child. Today we are all parents looking on       as the brutality and death from another mass shooting is       inflicted on our children. At the same time, we are painfully       aware that gun violence is a racial justice issue. Black       Americans are twice as likely as white Americans to die from       gun violence.        Esther was counseled by her uncle Mordecai that she was       born for such a time as this. For her to go to the King and       expose the plots designed to steal the lives of young and old       alike. In that same vein, your administration has come into       office for such a time as this. Will you squander the demand       of this historical time, or go like Esther into the fury to       save lives and people?        The Holy Quran, Surah 5 verse 32, teaches: ``Whoever kills       one person, it is as if they killed all of humanity.'' The       various holy books teach us that ``to save a life is to save       the world entire.'' We are responsible to one another and       responsible to all life.        As faith leaders, we call on you, and on our communities,       to manifest our prayers and create a new covenant--a       reclaiming of the name of G-d--committed to honoring and       saving lives. We must pray together, not only with our words,       but with our feet, and take action, like Esther did, in such       a time as this!        In memory of the lives lost in Nashville--Evelyn Diekhaus       (9), William Kinney (9), Hallie Scruggs (9), Mike Hill (61),       Katherine Koonce (60), Cynthia Peak (61), the lives lost in       the Kentucky bank shooting on April 10, and the rest of the       nearly 50,000 people that die every year in the United States       from guns, we ask you to declare Mother's Day 2023 a national       day to end gun violence and heal our country.            Sincerely,        Over 650 faith leaders including Rev. Jesse Jackson; Bp.
