 Madam Speaker, this week, I was pleased to  announce the city of Buffalo Fire Department has been awarded a Federal  grant of more than $8.9 million by the Department of Homeland  Security's Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response program.  With this critical support, the Buffalo Fire Department will be able to  hire 50 additional firefighters.   The purpose of this grant is to make certain that local fire  departments are able to respond quickly to emergencies and at all  hours.   Buffalo is home to an incredible team of firefighters who work to  protect our community from fires and other emergencies. Just 1 month  ago, the department received a separate grant of $322,000 for equipment  and training. This Federal grant funding will go a long way in  strengthening the city's fire department and adding more dedicated  personnel who work tirelessly to keep our community safe.                            ____________________
