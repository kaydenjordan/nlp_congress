 Mr. Speaker, last Sunday, May 14, marked the 1-year  anniversary of the horrific mass shooting in Buffalo, New York.   America can only move forward if we acknowledge what is killing us in  droves--white supremacist extremism.   Congress needs to lead and say clearly to the country that white  supremacy is an existential threat.   Last year, a man, radicalized by the great replacement theory, drove  2 hours to a Black neighborhood in Buffalo with an assault rifle and  opened fire. Ten lives were lost, and we are still collectively  mourning.   We are also mourning the lives of those lost in other racist attacks,  including in Allen, Texas, at the hands of a neo-Nazi extremist.   These once-fringe ideologies are now being openly promoted by too  many in the Republican Party, which is seeking to criminalize migrants,  ban Black history curricula, take away food from children and  healthcare for all, and fan the flames of a culture war.   It has to stop.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 2 o'clock and 40 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, May 17, 2023, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
