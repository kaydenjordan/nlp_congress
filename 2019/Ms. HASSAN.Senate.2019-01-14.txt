 Mr. President, today I would like to recognize the  retirement of Mr. Millard ``Woody'' Crawford of Colebrook, NH.   Since 1975, Mr. Crawford has worked for the Colebrook District Office  of the New Hampshire Electric Co-operative in the New Hampshire North  Country.   The Colebrook District Office distributes power to about 1,500 co-op  members in Columbia, Colebrook, Dixville, Stewartstown, Clarksville,  and Pittsburg, NH and maintains miles of overhead lines.   Returning to New Hampshire after college in 1971, Mr. Crawford took a  job digging and setting poles for the co-op, before making a pitch to  the district representative as to why they should hire him as a utility  lineman. He learned line work on the job, and bringing power to a  household by connecting someone to the grid remained his favorite part  of the job throughout his career.   In 1997, Mr. Crawford was responding to an outage with his partner,  Mark Monahan, when they witnessed the shooting of a New Hampshire State  Trooper. The gunman, having already killed another state trooper, a  district court judge, and a newspaper editor, threatened Mr. Crawford  and Mr. Monahan, but they drove to the main road to stop traffic and  prevented the loss of more life.   Mr. Crawford's colleagues praise his professionalism and care for  others, and I am proud to join them in congratulating him on his  retirement.   I hope you will join me in honoring a dedicated Granite Stater, Woody  Crawford.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to join my Democratic  colleagues in sharing stories of what we are hearing from our  constituents who are being impacted by this government shutdown.   I want to take a minute to thank my friend and colleague from  Colorado for his thoughtful and comprehensive and passionate remarks  about where we are and why. This is a needless and terrible exercise in  politics, and we need to reopen the government.   This senseless shutdown has been dragging on now for weeks, affecting  vital government services and leaving many Federal workers without pay.  With every day that passes without a resolution, hard-working people  are dealing with greater uncertainty, and many are facing tough choices  in order to protect their families and the way of life they have worked  so hard to build. Like many of my colleagues, I have heard from a  number of people throughout my State who have been affected by this  shutdown.   On Friday, I visited two nonprofits in New Hampshire, the Nashua Soup  Kitchen and the Community Action Partnership--most of us know it as CAP  of Strafford County--which provides vulnerable people with shelter,  food, and support. They are now in danger of being unable to provide  services that are a critical part of our safety net. They also fear an  increase in demand for those services because unpaid Federal workers  will be turning to them for help.   Federal employees and others affected by the shutdown in New  Hampshire have also written to my office to describe the hardships they  are facing and to urge us to reopen the government. One of those  Granite Staters has been an air traffic controller for close to 19  years. Sadly, on Christmas Eve, her mother passed away, leaving her  with a terrible loss but also with the stress and expenses of a  funeral, all while having to work Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. On  top of that, now she has not received a paycheck for that work.   She wrote:         The government shutdown has been the last thing on my mind.       But now the realization of not being able to pay my mortgage,       credit cards from Christmas-time, and now this funeral is too       much to bear.    She put it simply, saying:         My colleagues and I deserve better.    I also heard from a Granite Stater who works for the IRS. He wrote to  me saying:         The prospect of not having a paycheck for an extended time       is causing sleepless nights, and I am recovering from an       extended bout of pneumonia that ended up putting me in the       hospital right before Christmas. . . . My wife is worried       about the bills for that. Last night, I worked pushing out       the car payments. Today I applied for unemployment for the       first time in 25 years, and talked to my mortgage company.    He continues:         All this was under control a month ago, but now has me       worried, and is costing me charges and interest.   He also detailed his concerns about a coworker who is terrified of  losing her home if she is not able to pay her mortgage and of another  who is waiting to address a health issue until she has a paycheck  again. He said of him and his fellow Federal workers:         We are hardworking, dedicated employees. Our jobs involve       long hours, nights away from home, and risks to our health       and safety. . . . All I want is to do my job and be paid       fairly for it.    Finally, I heard from a Granite Stater whose husband is in the Coast  Guard and recently relocated to New Hampshire. She said:         To say this shutdown is impacting us is an understatement.    She wrote that she and her husband recently relocated to New  Hampshire and spent every last penny purchasing a home in the State  where they first met.   She said:         We knew it was going to be tight with our two paychecks,       but we would have enough to make ends meet. . . . That all       changed after Christmas when we were informed that our       President was prepared to shut down the government over a       wall.    Since then, she and her husband have watched, hoped, and prayed that  funding would come because now they fear they are going to have to call  family members to beg and to borrow money to pay their mortgage and not  go in default.   As bad as the direct impact of this situation is on Federal workers  and on some of our most vulnerable and on people and small businesses  who rely on government services, the shutdown also has ripple effects  on other people and businesses across our State.   We must do better. The President's politically motivated crisis is  devastating for too many hard-working families in New Hampshire and  across the country. They deserve better than being used as pawns for a  campaign slogan created by President Trump.   It is time for these games to stop, for the President's shutdown to  end, and for our government to reopen. We need a vote on the floor of  the Senate on the bipartisan bills that we already passed that would  reopen this government with a veto-proof majority.   I yield the floor.
