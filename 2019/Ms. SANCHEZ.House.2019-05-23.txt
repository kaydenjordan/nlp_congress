 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the SECURE Act. I  thank Chairman Richard Neal for his tireless efforts to get this  legislation across the finish line.   I have been proud to support versions of this bill for many years,  and I am pleased that one of my bills has been included. My piece of  this package offers a simple yet impactful way for small businesses  across the country to better afford retirement plans for their  employees.   Too many Americans simply aren't putting enough money away to ensure  a secure retirement. Today's bill takes important steps to strengthen  access to retirement security for hardworking Americans, and I am proud  to have contributed one piece to solving this puzzle.                                time  0945    But we still have a lot of work to do. I look forward to the passage  of the SECURE Act today, and I am ready to keep working on the Ways and  Means Committee to continue addressing our national retirement savings  crisis.   Madam Speaker, I again thank Chairman Neal.
