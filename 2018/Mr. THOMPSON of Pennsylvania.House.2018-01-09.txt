 Mr. Speaker, over the weekend, the  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania kicked off one of my favorite events, the  Pennsylvania Farm Show.   For more than a century, farmers have gathered each January at the  Pennsylvania Farm Show in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. This week, we are  having the 102nd Pennsylvania Farm Show. This weeklong event is the  largest indoor agriculture exposition in the Nation, showcasing over  6,000 animals, featuring nearly 12,000 exhibits, and more than half a  million visitors.   Each year, I host a listening session at the Farm Show and we cover a  range of topics during the public forum, from raising awareness about  agriculture education to hearing very real concerns from our dairy  farmers and more. As we embark on crafting the next farm bill, the 2018  listening session was extremely important.   I want to thank the following Members who were able to join this  year's Farm Show: Agriculture Committee Ranking Member Collin Peterson,  Congressman Dwight Evans, Congressman Tom Marino, Congressman Roger  Marshall, and Congressman Lloyd Smucker. I also want to thank USDA  Under Secretary Greg Ibach for coming up to join us. I was honored to  be joined by Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture Secretary Russell  Redding.   The Pennsylvania Farm Show truly does bring together so many  different people in the ag community and it is an event like none  other. As vice chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, I am very  proud of this fine event that takes place in the Commonwealth.   The Farm Show complex houses 24 acres under one roof, spreading  throughout 11 buildings, including three arenas. There is no admission  fee and it is a great event for the entire family. There are numerous  educational shows that are all free of charge.   The Pennsylvania Farm Show provides an atmosphere for everyone to  walk through, observe, and educate themselves about different areas of  agriculture, the Commonwealth's largest industry, which brings in  nearly $6.9 billion annually in agricultural cash receipts. Almost half  a million jobs are tied to the industry, which positively impacts all  Pennsylvanians.   Undoubtedly, one of the most popular attractions at the Pennsylvania  Farm Show is the Food Court. Located in the Expo Hall and Main Hall of  the complex, the Food Court offers visitors a variety of Pennsylvania  products--PA Preferred products--and it generates income to support the  nonprofit Pennsylvania Agricultural Commodity Organizations.   Mr. Speaker, over a century ago, the first Pennsylvania Farm Show was  a 3-day exhibit. Today, the event is a weeklong, 8-day celebration of  how the agricultural industry touches our everyday lives. Proudly, this  event draws visitors from across the country to highlight everything  our State has to offer when it comes to ag.   Numerous students participate in the event as well from 4-H clubs and  FAA organizations.   The Pennsylvania Farm Show truly showcases our Nation's farmers and  landowners, and I was thrilled to again take part in the best  agricultural expo in the country.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today, on Law  Enforcement Appreciation Day, to commend law enforcement officers  throughout our Nation who answer the call to serve their communities.   Law enforcement officers face increasingly difficult circumstances  while working to serve and protect the public. It is a dangerous job,  and often it is a thankless job.   Our officers put on their uniform each day knowing that they can be  in harm's way at any moment. They answer the call in times of distress.  They follow the rules, and they wear the badges proudly.   This day is designated annually, on January 9, to show support to our  law enforcement leaders in every community, including the Capitol  Police, who are with us here today.   Madam Speaker, we must remember that our officers are mothers and  fathers, sons and daughters, husbands and wives. They are human, and  they, arguably, have one of the most difficult jobs in America.   So today, and each day, let's honor our brothers and sisters in blue.  Let's thank them for the important work that they do to keep us all  safe.                            ____________________
