 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Advanced, Innovative IT Solutions for its acceptance into the National  Center for Veteran Institute for Procurement.   Located in Ludowici, in the First Congressional District of Georgia,  Advanced, Innovative IT Solutions strives to eliminate the high cost of  technology for government agencies by providing them with assistance in  IT strategy planning, program management, and cybersecurity.   With its 15 years of experience, the company has earned an  exceptional reputation throughout the southeast. Now, with its  acceptance into the National Center for Veteran Institute for  Procurement, it is finally gaining the nationwide reputation that it  deserves.   Acceptance to the institute is highly competitive, and it includes a  3-day certification program for veteran-owned businesses to increase  their ability to win government contracts.   Graduates from this program increase their revenue on average by 51  percent within the first year of graduation.   I am so proud Advanced, Innovative IT Solutions is participating in  this program. Congratulations, and keep up the good work.                            ____________________
