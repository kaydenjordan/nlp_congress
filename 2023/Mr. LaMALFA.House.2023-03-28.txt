 Mr. Chair, I appreciate the time here tonight to talk  about this key issue.   I think, just as a reminder as we start, my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle are trying to make this bill into something that it  isn't. The atmosphere is made up of only 0.04 percent carbon dioxide,  so the hysteria, since it is raised from 0.03 for the last couple of  decades, is really misplaced as we try to have an energy source that is  reasonable and secure for the American people.   The Energy Information Administration predicts a 50 percent increase  in global energy consumption by the year 2050.   Currently, America is the world's leading producer of natural gas.  Petroleum and other fuels remain the largest energy source for  Americans, and natural gas consumption increases globally are expected,  as well.   We have, over time, the reality that no matter what the U.S. is  doing, the rest of the world is going to be increasing its energy  consumption.   You see on top here that all the renewables are great. They are only  going to remain a tiny part around the world while we are contorting  our economy to try to put our own selves out of business by meeting  these ridiculous goals.   We must promote more domestic energy production and open more Federal  lands for exploration and drilling. H.R. 1 is a tiny piece of  legislation that will do that.   Give the American people what they want. Yes, they want clean air and  clean water, but they also want reasonable energy. We know how to do it  cleanly and efficiently.   We must not forget that, in the clean energy conversation, America's  energy is cleaner than other top producers that will keep producing,  like China and Russia. American energy is clean energy.   I am glad to see this bill making the reforms that are necessary to  help on energy, as well as forestry, with the burdensome NEPA process  that is delaying the U.S. Forest Service doing needed thinning  projects, like in my district where they have had the Camp fire that  burned down most of the town of Paradise and a million-acre fire known  as the Dixie fire.   NEPA reform will make it where we can save our forests, have them be  cleaner, have them not put so much pollution in the air that it even  reaches the East Coast with smoke plumes, and, instead, have our wood  and paper products coming from our forests instead of having to import  them.   It makes a heck of a lot more sense to have a process to work through  NEPA and others that still is accountable ecologically but is something  you can get done so you can get ahead of the curve with better forest  management and energy that is cleaner and that comes from our country.   I am glad to be part of this bill. I thank the chairman for running  it.    Mr. Speaker, recently the California Department of Water  Resources announced that water deliveries throughout the State Water  Project would be increased to 75 percent of requested amounts. Also,  the Bureau of Reclamation made a similar announcement on 100 percent in  certain districts in northern California.   The State levels have increased from an announced 35 percent earlier  on. These increases are possible due to the massive amount of rain and  snowpack California has received from a series of winter storms.   Many of our State's reservoirs, once teetering on the brink of being  empty, are rapidly filling. While these increased water allocations are  good news, there is still a pressing need for more water storage in  California.   Sites Reservoir in my district, a project that should already have  been built, would already have 1\1/2\ million acre-feet of water in it.  Raising Shasta Dam farther north only 18 feet would result in 630,000  more acre-feet. One acre-foot of water, for example, is enough to  sustain two California families for a whole year.   Improving the flood controls and modernizing some of our water  infrastructure would allow us to keep more stormwater. Storage is key  for California's ability to weather droughts for more than 1 year.  Store the water we get in the winter and we will have it when we need  it in the summer.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for hosting tonight  and for his great work on mining in this country that we need so  desperately, especially with some of the ideas that are being pushed  forward in the name of climate change.   I appreciate Chairman Newhouse, as well, for organizing this.   What do we know about H.R. 1, the bill that was discussed here all  afternoon, known as the Lower Energy Costs Act? It will reform the  permitting process across industries, cut down on needless red tape,  and help drive down energy costs for Americans.   We heard all afternoon, though, that it is going to be a handout to  oil and gas companies--no, it is not; it is going to strip away  environmental laws--no, it is not; it will give companies free rein to  poison rivers and streams--yes, that is really what we are about here-- no, it doesn't do that either.   It is a monumental win for any American who wants to produce energy,  use energy, have their costs lowered, have a secure energy supply long  term instead of importing it from OPEC, China, or Russia.   The legislation we are talking about, the Clean Air Act, the Clean  Water Act, these were signed in the early 1970s by a Republican,  Richard Nixon. Republicans know how to do things ecologically soundly,  as well. You wouldn't know it from the other side of the aisle, or even  the press, but, yes, we are interested in doing things correctly.   Also, there is the reality that people need things. People need  energy. People need to stay warm. We need to produce crops in this  country instead of importing everything and exporting environmental  problems, if they are that, to other countries that do things much  dirtier than we ever thought about doing--to the Pacific Rim, China,  where have you.   Our natural gas that we produce in this country is extracted during a  cleaner process that is even cleaner fuel than what comes out of  Russia. That is why it is good if we were partners with Western Europe,  exporting natural gas to them instead of them getting it from a  pipeline from the Russian bear.   Despite this critical need for an increase in energy supply--the need  for the world is going to continue to go up. You may have seen the  chart earlier we were using where it keeps going higher and higher. Oil  and gas in the rest of the world are going to be part of that.   They are trying to clamp it down in this country. We are the only  ones that are going to be economically disadvantaged, compared to other  countries around the world, by doing so.   They yell at us about NEPA being untouchable and what we are talking  about in H.R. 1 being a heyday for polluters. It is not that at all.   What it does point out is it takes more than a decade to permit a  mine, more than a decade to get a new mine  [[Page H1519]]  going in America, for all these batteries they are going to want, for  all this electrical they are going to want. Canada and Australia can do  one in less than 3 years, and they are not ecologically unsound.   These delays and litigation make domestic energy production  unprofitable and time consuming, and it is just not going to happen  here, okay?   Critical minerals found in our mines are essential for renewable  energy infrastructure. Solar panels, vehicle batteries, and charging  stations are built with the minerals that are going to have to be  either mined in China or, with the help of Mr. Stauber, maybe they can  be mined in this country.    America always has some of the strongest environmental standards. We  are not going to shake those. We are just going to make a NEPA process  that is cleaner and smoother.   I haven't even got to talk about our forests in California and the  West yet. You have to have a NEPA to do the smallest thing, to have  access to the forests so you can tend to them, thin them, make them  safe, make them long-term healthy, or be able to get at them when fires  do start, which they will.   The current process is so cumbersome that it is a barrier to proper  management. That is why the smoke plumes that start in my State on a  million-acre fire end up on the East Coast, where people have to have  health days where they can't go outdoors.   We saw that million-acre Dixie fire in my district. We have seen  70,000 wildfires per year. NEPA does not help the process of thinning  timber or even putting a culvert in a forest road without having to do  this long study that doesn't tell anybody anything, other than a way to  stall things.   I am encouraging my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to break  away from the status quo. Don't buy into all these scare tactics that  it is going to poison the river, the air, and everything else. It  doesn't do that.   The regulations are still in place. It just streamlines the process  so you can reasonably get something done still with oversight from the  Federal agencies, as well as the industries themselves that understand  that, these days, it is a really bad idea to go polluting like we did  150 years ago.   I appreciate the time here tonight and the effort everybody is making  on H.R. 1.
