 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture  motions filed on Thursday, February 10, ripen at 5:45 p.m. today.    Madam President, reserving the right to object, I  strongly disagree with Senator Lee's proposal amending what has been  agreed to--not agreed to but what has gotten every single Member of the  Senate but for one. I want to also say that I was on the floor about 10  days ago, I think, on the subject of this. I want the Chair and the  Senator from Utah to know I didn't even mention who had objected while  I was here, but it was 1 out of 100 Senators. This bill passed the  House of Representatives with all but two votes. It passed with every  single vote from the Colorado delegation, and we have this gamut of  people in from Colorado.   The bill is strongly supported by my friend   Ken Buck, whom I ran  against in 2010. And if Ken were here, he would say there is very  little upon which we agree. I hope there is more than he thinks we  agree on, but we definitely agree on this.   So let me just explain why we wrote this bill. In 5 days, as the  Senator from Utah has said, we are going to mark the 80th anniversary  of Executive Order No. 9066, which began the forced dispossession and  internment of over 120,000 Japanese Americans during World War II. Two- thirds of them were citizens of this country, American citizens, forced  out of their homes into camps by our own government--by their own.   One of those camps was Amache on the Eastern Plains of Colorado,  where the Federal Government detained nearly 10,000 Japanese Americans  against their will. Most of them had less than a week--most of them had  less than a week--to get rid of virtually everything they owned and  crowd onto buses and trains with no idea where they were going or what  was going to happen to them.   Some of the first arrivals at Amache were kids younger than the pages  who are on the floor here today with us, who were forced to build the  camp where their own families were interred during the duration of the  war. The conditions were horrible. Walls didn't always reach the  ceilings. The windows weren't always sealed. It meant that snow blew in  during the winter, and dust blew in during the summer.   This is what our government did to our fellow Americans, to children,  forced to work in the fields to grow their own food in the jail that  the United States of America had committed them to. And what is even  more remarkable is that despite this treatment, 1 out of 10 of the  people at Amache still volunteered to serve during the war--a higher  rate than any other camp in America. Think about that. They were  willing to defend the very government that was detaining them, that had  locked up their children. That is how much they believed in America,  even when America turned our back on them.   And I had the opportunity to visit Amache a few years ago with John  Hopper, a high school principal in Grenada who worked with his students  to create the Amache Preservation Society. They have been taking care  of this site themselves all of these years, collecting items from all  over the world that former prisoners have sent back because they want  people to remember. They want a memorial to their captivity. Year after  year, these high school students and their teacher have worked to  restore this site so that the next generation of Coloradans can learn  about what happened there.   If it were up to me, every student in Colorado and throughout the  American West would go there--throughout our entire country--and learn  about the Americans of Amache, the men and women who held on to hope  year after year, who supported one another, who forged a community  behind the barbed wire of this site, who never gave up on the United  States of America, even as it was interning them on their own soil.   After I visited this site, I introduced a bill with Senator  Hickenlooper to make Amache a part of the National Park System so it  would have the resources and recognition it deserves for years to come.  We have to get this done because the survivors of Amache are growing  fewer and fewer in number each year, and we have to keep the memory of  what they went through alive for the next generation.   That is what Colorado wants. I have a list of over 70 groups that  support it, from the Asian Chamber of Commerce to the Colorado Council  of Churches, to the town of Grenada, which owns the site today.   So, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have this list  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:   List of Organizations Endorsing the Amache National Historic Site Act                           Endorsing Organizations         National Veterans Network; Japanese American C1t1zens       League (JACL); Colorado Municipal League; Colorado School of       Public Health; Interfaith Alliance of Colorado; Colorado       Council of Churches; Japanese American National Museum;       Japanese American Confinement Sites Consortium (JACSC)       Japanese American Services Committee; National Trust for       Historic Preservation; Anti-Defamation League Mountain States       Region; Fred T.

Madam President, this bill wasn't controversial in  Colorado,  [[Page S663]]  and it wasn't controversial in the House, where Republican Congressman    Ken Buck, whose district this is, took up the bill with   Joe Neguse,  a neighboring Congressman. Amache is in the 10th District in Prowers  County, and I said that the bill passed the House by 416 to 2.   It wasn't controversial in the Senate Energy and Natural Resources  Committee, where it passed with bipartisan support from the chairman  and ranking member, and that is why I came here 2 weeks ago to pass the  bill by unanimous consent. But now there has been an objection.   And I should mention, by the way, that this site is less than 1  square mile. It is a tiny, tiny fraction of even the county that it is  in. It seems to me that if we believe in federalism at all, we  shouldn't be blocking Colorado's right to preserve less than 1 square  mile the way we see fit; that we shouldn't have to reduce the public  lands of the United States by an equal amount. And I will say, in that  connection, that I formally object to the Senator from Utah's motion  for this reason. The land here is owned by Grenada. It is already  public land. The town has said it wants to donate it to the National  Park Service.   I have a letter from the town making this intention perfectly clear.   So it is not even private land that is becoming public. It is public  land transitioning from a local government to the Federal Government at  the request of the community.   And they are not asking for anything in return. And I think that is  an important point that the Senator from Utah has raised. And we have  worked with the town to show that they are not asking for an exchange.  They want to donate the land as their patriotic contribution to America  to protect this part of our history.   I would think all of us here should agree that, unless it is hurting  somebody else, the town can do whatever it likes with its own land,  just like a private landowner can do with their own land.   Let me stop there and see whether the Senator from Utah has any  reaction to that.   I will formally object to his motion, and I will stop there. I have  got other things to say, but I hope that maybe we can get to an  agreement based on what I would offer. So I object.    I thank, through the Chair, the Senator from Utah.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to  the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 255, H.R. 2497. Further, I  ask that the Bennet amendment at the desk be considered and agreed to;  that the committee-reported amendments be agreed to; that the bill, as  amended, be considered read a third time and passed; and that the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, this is all happening on the fly right  now, so I am actually going to withdraw that in the spirit of what  Senator Lee has said. Hopefully, we can do this later today. We need to  make sure that everybody has the benefit of seeing the language, and  then we will be back later to do this.   I thank the Senator from Utah, and I will spare him the rest of my  speech except that I think he deserves to hear this, and I think  everybody here deserves to hear this, which is, when the ENR Committee  took this legislation up this fall, here is what the survivors from  Amache wrote to the committee, and I just want to put their words into  the Record before I withdraw:         During World War II, we were forced to live as prisoners in       our own country. Along with our parents, we were forced from       our homes, tagged like animals, and sent to the desolate       prairie of southeast Colorado, where we lived in trauma, a       constant presence of armed guards, barbed wire, and suffering       too large to describe in one correspondence. Our families       suffered a loss of jobs, homes, property, and businesses, and       many of us lost family members. Many of our parents went to       their graves without even an apology from their country. Our       nation still has a long way to go to learn from this mistake,       and our community, both old and young, continues to suffer       from anti-Asian hate crimes, increasing to this day. Our       national parks and the stories they honor reflect our values       as a nation. Adding Amache to the National Park System would       allow us to protect a unique story that has largely been       forgotten and can only be told through the power of place.       With each year that passes, there are fewer of us. We are       counting on you to see us through.    Because of the discussion we have had tonight, we are going to have  the chance later to be able to do that.   I thank my friend from Utah.   I yield the floor.
