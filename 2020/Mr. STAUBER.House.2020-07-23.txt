 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable woman  named Rosemary Stratioti, a well-known West Duluth native who recently  passed away from COVID-19.   Her life serves as an example of what it means to be a friend, a  neighbor, and a patriot. As a daughter of a World War I veteran and a  spouse of a World War II veteran, Rosemary dedicated her life to  honoring those who fought and sacrificed for our country.   Rosemary served as the president of the West Duluth American Legion  auxiliary for over 50 years. She helped lead and organize the West  Duluth Memorial Day parade.   Rosemary made a special effort to ensure the children in her  community knew the real meaning behind Memorial Day and that it is not  just another day off from school. She was known to say: ``If it wasn't  for the soldiers who gave their lives for you and me, we wouldn't be  here today.''   She held this patriotic spirit year-round, and when vandals knocked  down a concrete eagle from a military veteran's monument in Duluth, it  was Rosemary who led an effort to restore the monument honoring  veterans.   Madam Speaker, I know that Rosemary Stratioti is already missed by  her family, friends, and our whole community of West Duluth, but I hope  they are comforted in knowing that she will be long remembered for her  many contributions.   Rosemary, rest in peace, faithful servant.

The Interior appropriations bill was introduced by my colleague from  St. Paul and produced by the subcommittee she chairs. Having anti- mining riders attached was no surprise, as Twin Cities Democrat  politicians have leveled attacks at future mining projects multiple  times this Congress.   However, section 435 of division C is a new low. It directly attacks  three existing iron ore operations: The Minntac mine, the Minorca Mine,  and the Northshore mine, along with the Coldspring Mesabi Black quarry.  Combined, this places more than 2,000 jobs in my district on the  chopping block. These blue-collar jobs support families in my district,  jobs we need, especially during this pandemic.   Twin Cities anti-job environmentalists continue to level bolder and  bolder attacks on our way of life in northern Minnesota by now putting  iron mining squarely in the crosshairs.  [[Page H3711]]    China controls more than half the world's steel market with a cheap,  low-quality product built with horrific and zero labor standards and  environmental standards.   In my district, reclaimed mines provide drinking water for entire  communities. Northern Minnesota has the cleanest air and water in the  world and much cleaner than the brown water in St. Paul.   We all care for our environment, but this legislation is no longer  about environmental protections. This is about ideology and our way of  life.   I will fight for northern Minnesota and our blue-collar jobs with  every fiber in my body.
