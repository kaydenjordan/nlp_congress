 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and  thank Dr. Joyce Turner Keller and her organization Aspirations for 20  years in the fight to end HIV/AIDS.   Aspirations' mission is to serve the needs of hurting people,  regardless of race, creed, gender, age, or social class affected by the  HIV/AIDS virus. Established in 2001, they have provided a much needed  service to our region by providing free testing, education, support  groups, and numerous other options to those who are fighting this  virus. Its founder, Dr. Joyce Turner Keller, has made it her life's  mission to be a face of the invisible that are living and surviving  with HIV/AIDS.   As a doctor, I treated uninsured HIV/AIDS patients and saw firsthand  the pain this disease can cause. Dr. Joyce Turner Keller has used her  God-given talents to care for the underserved and the stigmatized. I  commend her on her work and the work of Aspirations these last 20  years.                            ____________________
