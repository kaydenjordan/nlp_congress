 Mr. President, I am so pleased to join my colleague  in congratulating Mississippi State University's baseball team on its  recent 2021 NCAA College World Series championship, the first NCAA  championship in school history.   Mississippi State capped off its extraordinary season by defeating an  incredibly talented Vanderbilt University team 9 to 0 in game 3. My  house was full. We were all cheering. Their impressive and remarkable  run through this year's College World Series is a testament to the rich  tradition of the MSU baseball program, which has now appeared in 12  NCAA College World Series in its history, including most recently 3  consecutive series. The inspiring performance of this baseball team  continues to be celebrated all over our State. Maroon is everywhere.   I truly appreciate the hard work, skill, and dedication that earned  these athletes the first NCAA Division I baseball championship for  Mississippi State, which are aptly described in the accompanying  resolution.   We take pride in the legacy and inspiring example of these young men  and their coaches. Thank you for such a wonderful and historic season.  Hail State.   (Rings cowbell.)   I yield the floor.
