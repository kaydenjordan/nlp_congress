 Madam Speaker, a week ago, we had a roundtable in my  district, and we invited, including Madam Speaker today, to come and  listen to the workers.   Tamara, who works for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said  that she is trying to figure out how to tell her son that he is not  going to be able to have his birthday party. She is a young widow,  single mother.   Veronica said that she has to take care of her parents and has to pay  for their medicines and their copays, and it is really hard.   Lori said that workers at the IRS are trying to figure out how to pay  for gas to get to work, parking, and childcare. And the taxpayer  assistance office is closed, even though we have a new tax bill.   Kevin said the morale at the Bureau of Prisons is really tough. He  lives 50 miles from work and is just about out of gas money.   Crystal said: We are public servants. We are not public slaves.   And Florence, who helps people get food stamps, is applying for them  herself and waited 3 hours at a food pantry.   Madam Speaker, we need to get rid of the shutdown and pay the workers  now.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  I really appreciate the opportunity to come down and talk.   Our colleague from Alabama was talking about Martin Luther King, who  also talked about the urgency of now. If there is a time for urgency,  it is now to end the shutdown and pay the workers.   He also talked about and warned about that, if you wait too long, it  can be too late. So this is the time to spare what is a growing  disaster for all Americans from happening.  [[Page H1202]]    Wilbur Ross, our Commerce Secretary, said that he doesn't quite  understand why these furloughed and unpaid workers might have to go to  a food bank. He doesn't understand.   That is exemplary of the level at which this administration is  completely tone-deaf and out of touch, that they don't understand how  people--the beginning salary for a TSA worker at the airport is  $28,000, and sometimes it goes up to maybe $43,000. Tomorrow will be  the second paycheck that they don't get.   So a number of us in Chicago had a roundtable that included eight  Members of the House of Representatives, Democrats, and Senator Durbin.  Madam Speaker right now in the chair was at that roundtable. We heard  from 18 different workers from different agencies talking.   Wilbur Ross ought to talk to Florence, who is helping people get food  stamps and found herself having to apply for food stamps, for the SNAP  program. She waited 3 hours at a food bank. Why? Because the lines are  growing and growing and growing of people who, yes, need to get food on  their tables and can't afford to do it.   Shame on Secretary Ross for not understanding what is going on out  there.   We are hearing of people giving blood and plasma in order to have a  few dollars to put food on the table. We are hearing about people  running out of gas money, and that means that they can't get to work.  This is money that comes out of their pocket while they are not getting  paychecks.   Madam Speaker, to Mitch McConnell, who doesn't want to call bills  that would actually get the government going, I say: Shame on you.  Shame on you, Wilbur Ross. Shame on this administration. This is a  crisis. This is a disaster that you are creating. You can end it.   So the demand is clear: End the shutdown; pay the workers.
