 Mr. Speaker, for over 2 years, many institutions,  Federal agencies, and the mainstream media demonized anyone who  suggested that COVID-19 leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.   Senator Tom Cotton was ridiculed for simply suggesting that the lab  leak was a possibility.   Leading scientists, doctors, and pundits were censored for  questioning the natural origins theory promoted by Dr. Anthony Fauci,  the NIH, and CDC.   Now, FBI Director Chris Wray and the Department of Energy are  reporting that the pandemic most likely originated from a lab leak in  Wuhan.   Big Tech and the media worked to actively suppress this theory and  ridiculed anyone who promoted it.   At a time when accurate information was vital to saving lives, the  people and institutions who we trusted to tell the truth lied to the  American people and worked to hide important information.   House Republicans have been demanding transparency on the origins of  COVID since the pandemic began.   We must get to the truth of how this pandemic started so that we can  protect ourselves from future possible outbreaks.   Americans deserve to know the truth about their government, what it  knew, and when it knew it. We must restore faith and trust in  government and institutions, and that starts with transparency and  accountability.                            ____________________
