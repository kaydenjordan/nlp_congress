 Madam President, I want to speak briefly this evening  about S. 1, the Senate version of H.R. 1, the democracy reform bill  that we are going to be considering moving to proceed to this week, and  I hope we will be able to show a unified Democratic Caucus moving to  proceed.   It is often described as the voting rights bill, and it is described  that way with good justification because there are some very, very  important protections that are built into it to protect the voting  rights of Americans which are under, I would say, a unique and historic  threat now since the, perhaps, 1950s and 1960s, when the Voting Rights  Act was passed and some of the levers that were pulled to keep certain  people from voting had to be stopped and the vote and the ballot became  available much more broadly and led to a much more just society.   But that is not the only part of S. 1. In fact, in my view, it is not  even the central part of S. 1. In my view, the central part of S. 1 is  getting big, unlimited, anonymous money out of politics.   Now, the two relate because the big, anonymous money schemers that  are up to no good in politics are focusing on--guess what? Voter  suppression. And, in fact, the same individual, the same person who was  running the dark money scheme to control and capture the Supreme Court  and the circuit courts has--after being somewhat blown up by a  Washington Post expose about the $250 million he was running in dark  money through this court-capture scheme--jumped from court-capture  scheme, and where did he land? On something rather ironically called  the Honest Elections Project, which immediately went to work to file  lawsuits and harass election officials and try to make sure that voter  suppression took place.   If you think that is a coincidence, the Honest Elections Project is  actually a rebrand of an entity that was called the Judicial Education  Project--basically, just a name change through corporate hijinks. And  that Judicial Education Project is the corporate sibling of something  called the Judicial Crisis Network.   And guess what the Judicial Crisis Network did? For this same guy,  before he jumped to voter suppression, when he was still doing court  capture, the Judicial Crisis Network took the big, fat checks that  anonymous donors wrote to pay for the TV campaigns--the dark money TV  campaigns--against Garland and for Gorsuch in the first appointment,  for Kavanaugh through all of his troubles in the second appointment,  and then for Judge Barrett on the eve of the election in the third  appointment.   So, you see, it is the same person and the same organizational  connection between the court-captured dark money scheme and the voter  suppression dark money scheme. It is actually happening in kind of  plain light of day, except that we don't pay enough attention to the  links.   So this dark money business, getting the big, dark money out of  politics, is a big, big deal. And I wanted to share how much of a deal  it is to Americans. Dark money corruption polls at the top of all the  issues in the last poll I saw. It is the No. 1 issue. If you ask  people: If somebody says that they have dedicated themselves to  fighting corruption, is that going to make you more likely to vote for  them or more likely for you to vote for their opponent? Among all  voters, it is 89 to 1 more likely to vote for the candidate dedicated  to fighting corruption versus whoever this one is who said, no, not  such a big deal to me.   Among independent voters whom the two parties always fight for in  elections, 82 to 2--82 percent of independent voters would be more  likely to vote for somebody who they see as dedicated to fighting  corruption, and only 2 would be more likely to vote for their opponent.   So this is a strong public signal that we are sick of it. And you see  it over and over again. This is one poll. You can go through poll after  poll after poll, and you see people want the dark money out of  politics. They think we are controlled by big special interests. They  think much too much stuff gets done behind the scenes.   And, by the way, we just got a little window into the private  conversations about this that take place between the Koch brothers'  political apparatus and our minority leader, Mitch McConnell's  political apparatus.   Jane Mayer wrote about this recently in the New Yorker. And the Koch  political apparatus and the Mitch McConnell political apparatus were  being briefed on this bill, on S. 1, and on these provisions. And what  they were told by the pollster is: Do you know what? We are in big  trouble because our conservative voters hate this damn dark money stuff  just as badly as those liberals do, and we have tried all these  different ways to reframe this, to make it look bad so they might be  more against it--none of it worked. None of it worked.   People want their government cleaned up. They are sick to death of  big special interest money, and they are particularly sick to death of  big special interest money that hides behind fake front groups. So it  is not ExxonMobil or Marathon Petroleum that comes to Rhode Island and  says, Sheldon Whitehouse is a bum, you should vote against him. No, it  is under the phony group with a name like Rhode Islanders for Peace and  Puppies in Prosperity. And all they are is a mail drop.   Somebody is behind them, and the voters know in Rhode Island there is  no Rhode Islanders for Peace and Puppies in Prosperity. They know they  are being had, and they are sick of seeing the ads. And it is not fair  to them, as citizens, to not know what is going on in the American  governmental process, going on right in front of them.   And it matters to them. It really matters to them. It is the single  most important issue for 55 percent of all voters. And among the  independent voters we are trying to attract to our separate parties, 58  percent of independent voters, this question of Big Money corruption  and government not listening to them, it is the single most important  issue--the single most important issue.    Now, make it top three, expand the question. What are the top three  most important issues that you care about? Eighty-nine percent of all  voters have this in their top three. Eighty-eight percent of  independent voters have this in their top three. So let's say you have  a real concern about healthcare, or let's say you have a real concern  about voting rights, or let's say you have a real concern about the  economy--never mind, this is still there in that top three for pretty  much 9 out of every 10 Americans.   And what is the level of concern? Very concerned. Very concerned is  86 percent of all voters and 92 percent of all independent voters.  About this issue of corruption and money in politics, how concerned are  you? Eighty-six percent of all voters said very. Ninety-two percent of  independent voters said very.   And if you say: OK, let's, again, expand the aperture a little, very  concerned or somewhat concerned? Are you very concerned or somewhat  concerned about this dark money corruption, special interest pressure  in government--98 percent of all voters, 100 percent of independent  voters. I don't know about you all, but I have looked at a lot of  polling in my life. Seeing a 100-percent number, that is rare. Every  single independent voter polled is very or somewhat concerned about  corruption in our democracy.   So I can't wait to get onto S. 1. And if our Republican friends want  to filibuster it and stop us from moving forward, I can't wait to see  them explain  [[Page S4660]]  to their voters back home why they made the choice to come here and,  against 89 to 1 for all voters and 82 to 2 for independent voters, take  that brave fan for dark money and more corruption and more special  interest pressure in our politics. Good luck with that.   I hope at some point we bring that fight to the floor and we spend  weeks on it so that as we go into next year, every single American has  seen this play out. They have seen that this issue that they are very  concerned about, that for more than half of them is the single most  important issue, that there is a party here in the Senate that is  determined to protect the schemers, the special interests behind the  dark money corruption. Good luck taking that to the voters in November.   So to those who are listening and who are thinking: You know, I don't  see how we get around a filibuster here. I love S. 1. This is a really  important bill. We have to get there. We hope that the Democrats can  unite on this, but even then, it is only 50 to 1 or 51 to 1, if the  Vice President is allowed to vote, and that is not 60, so there is a  filibuster--my answer is: Give it effort and give it time because once  Americans--everybody from a Tea Partyer to a Bernie Bro--gets wind of  which party in here is the party of special-interest dark money, who  wants to protect that--like I said, single most important issue. People  go into the voting booth, and they tend to remember the single most  important issue, the issue that they are very concerned about, that 86  percent of all voters.   So I hope we find a good way forward. I think it is important for our  democracy that the rottenness of all of this come to an end. I don't  want to see more of these academic studies that show that Congress  listens to big special interests, provably, statistically, and Congress  doesn't listen to regular voters, provably, statistically, because of  this kind of dark money pressure.   We have got to get beyond that. We have a country out there to put  back on its feet not only economically, but we ought to be able to hold  our own heads high about having an honest government that is an example  to the rest of the world.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
