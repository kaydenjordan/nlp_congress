 Mr. President, I commend my colleague for his focus  on the farm bill and thank him for the work we are doing together on  the Consumer Protection Subcommittee of the Commerce, Science, and  Transportation Committee. I look forward to continuing that work  together, which involves so closely and importantly the rule of law.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I come to the floor on a separate  issue involving the rule of law. We have been reminded literally within  the last 24 hours about the importance of the rule of law as applied to  the families who have sought to cross the border and experienced  extraordinary cruelty and inhumanity when their children were taken  from them. A court, literally in the last 24 hours, issued an order  requiring that those children be reunited with their families. That  decision is not only a humane and moral one, it is also in accord with  constitutional and statutory requirements. Those children never should  have been separated from their parents, but now, because of the court,  an excessive and abusive use of power will be corrected.   We are living in a time of unparalleled threats to the rule of law  and fundamental rights and liberties from a Chief Executive who seems  to have no respect for them. The courts are exercising their  traditional role--in fact, the role the Founders envisioned for them as  a check on unhinged Executive power.    We also learned just today that a key figure in the judicial system,  Justice Kennedy, will be retiring this summer. This retirement is  earthshaking and gut-wrenching, and his departure means a historic  challenge is ahead. The American people should have a voice. My  Republican colleagues should follow their own precedent. A confirmation  vote should take place after the new Congress is seated. A historic  decision--one that will literally shake the decisions of the courts for  years and likely decades--requires deliberate consideration that simply  is impossible in the short months we have between now and the election;  indeed, politically charged months.   The future of privacy protections, women's healthcare, and many basic  civil rights, including healthcare--whether young people are on their  parents' insurance until the age of 26, whether people are vulnerable  to preexisting condition abuses, whether people have basic healthcare  rights that  [[Page S4499]]  are guaranteed to them under the Affordable Care Act--all of these  rights are at stake and at risk.   The Supreme Court is not just marble pillars and velvet drapes. Its  decisions have a direct impact on people's lives and the lives of our  children. So we are in this Chamber at a critical moment when the  judicial system literally will be determined for decades to come.   Nothing brings this issue home more readily and dramatically than  viewing the children who have been separated from their families and  the families themselves at the border.   I visited the border this past Friday, along with my colleagues  Senator Heinrich and Senator Udall of Utah--two good friends and  colleagues. At each stop we made, we saw the devastating human impact  of this President's immoral and inhumane policies of family separation  and family detention. In Tornillo, TX, we visited a tent city where  teenagers, 14 to 17 years old, are confined--in effect, incarcerated in  a modern-day internment camp. Make no mistake, they have been deprived  of basic access to the outside world and of access by that outside  world to them.   The deprivation of liberty is the core definition of incarceration,  and the potential detainment of tens of thousands of families in  exactly that kind of tent city located on our military bases throughout  the country should frighten and alarm every American because we are  seeing repeated in a different age, in color rather than black and  white, the images of those internment camps where thousands of people  of Japanese descent were sent during World War II.   We may not agree with every decision of the U.S. Supreme Court, but  we know it is unique. It is certainly different as a judicial  institution. It should be considered unique in choosing open-minded and  fair jurists in the mold of Justice Kennedy for these positions--not  right-wing fringe ideologues.   I believe colleagues on both sides of the aisle will stand up and be  counted if that kind of right-wing fringe ideologue is nominated. We  certainly must use every tool available to stop that kind of nominee  because what is at stake are real lives like the ones I saw in El Paso.   I met with a 2-year-old girl who trekked across Mexico with her  father for a month. Her father held her as we spoke to him. He must now  worry whether she will be separated from him and detained indefinitely  and indiscriminately. The anguish and anxiety I saw in that girl's eyes  still haunt me, and it will be with me for a long time.   We saw a legal, moral, and humanitarian crisis unfolding before our  eyes in realtime. This administration claims it is solving this crisis,  but the clear, virtually undisputed evidence suggests exactly the  contrary. More than 100 facilities nationwide house migrant children,  and the administration is looking to open even more facilities, very  likely, on military bases, and little progress has been made on  reuniting these families.   The Department of Health and Human Services has reported that 2,047  unaccompanied minor children are still in its custody. Health and Human  Services Secretary Azar claimed before the Finance Committee yesterday  that there is ``no reason why any parent would not know where their  child is located.'' He claimed that ``every parent should know where  their child is located.''   The reality is, there is no plan to reunite them. Thousands of  parents have no idea where their children are. What is happening on the  ground is that many parents are enduring the pain and suffering of  simply not knowing where their child is, and many children have the  pain and suffering of not knowing where their parent is. The father of  the 2-year-old whom I saw clutching his child to his chest as she  stared into the unknown future ahead of her has no reason to believe  the Secretary of Health and Human Services because he knows what the  reality is on the ground.   If the Department of Health and Human Services or the Department of  Homeland Security can tell parents where their children are as easily  as Secretary Azar claims, they should have done so yesterday. They  should have done so before Friday when I visited.   We all know, from firsthand accounts, it simply isn't happening and  that the emotional, mental, and physical damage to these families will  last a lifetime for many of them. That trauma will be enduring. The  President claims his Executive order has solved these problems, but it  has not. All it has done is substitute family imprisonment and  incarceration for family separation.   This Executive order is in clear violation of the Flores settlement  agreement, which is legally binding on the U.S. Government. It  prohibits detaining children for more than 20 days, in effect,  imprisoning them with their parents, as the Executive order has the  effect of doing. Putting aside the humanitarian and moral costs to this  Nation and the damage to our image around the world, the cost per  individual per day in Tornillo is $2,000. Let me repeat that number.  The cost per individual per day for every person in Tornillo is $2,000.  That cost alone, financially, is intolerable, but moral and  humanitarian costs are even more profound.    This Executive order is destructive. It is draconian. It is no answer  to the problem of family separation and detention. The evidence is  clear from my visit to the border, so far as I am concerned but also in  everything the administration said, that the time is now to end this  immoral and inhumane zero tolerance policy that involves, integrally,  criminal prosecution, and the rest of these issues really flow from  that criminal prosecution because it triggers the imprisonment. In  effect, confinement without bail is the way it would be looked at in  the civilian setting.   This administration must adopt less restrictive alternatives if it  wants to guarantee the appearance of these families for their hearings.  We know less restrictive alternatives work, they have been proven in  the past, and they also cost less. They are more humane. They protect  our moral principles, and they are less expensive.   Piecemeal announcements from this administration have been  contradictory and unclear. It has been the opposite of transparent.  Congressional committees now must exercise our responsibility for  oversight and scrutiny. There must be hearings. It must involve all the  Federal agencies with responsibility. As a member of the Senate Armed  Services Committee, I am particularly concerned that the Department of  Defense is dramatically increasing its involvement in immigration and  enforcement. The plan is to build these tent camps on two military  bases in Texas. Fort Bliss in El Paso is one of them, and unaccompanied  children will be held at Goodfellow Air Force Base in San Angelo. The  families at Fort Bliss and the unaccompanied children at Goodfellow Air  Force Base in San Angelo will be, in effect, incarcerated at the bases  of military men and women who serve and sacrifice for the values that  will be betrayed by that illegal and immoral confinement, in violation  of the Flores agreement and fundamental principles of fairness.   Military services are preparing, as well, to offer additional  military bases to detain migrants. DOD has sent 21 Active and Reserve  uniformed judge advocates to the border on temporary order to prosecute  Department of Justice immigration cases. All of these developments  represent a clear diversion of Department of Defense resources from  military mission to immigration enforcement.   The Presiding Officer and I serve together on the Armed Services  Committee as well as the Judiciary Committee. We both know the deep and  serious consideration that was required as to resource commitments in  the latest National Defense Authorization Act--the difficult decisions  that had to be made in a time of scarce resources and growing danger  around the world through our military and national security. I am  concerned that these policies will comprise military residents and  immigrants on American military installations.   I consistently oppose the use of these military installations to  house unaccompanied migrant children. I will continue to oversee the  Department of Defense's involvement in this critical issue.   Again, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that the  Senate Armed Services Committee must hold  [[Page S4500]]  an oversight hearing on this issue as soon as possible. We owe it to  the American people. Family separation and detention should no longer  be a political issue. We need to come together and make sure the  President understands that migrant children can no longer be treated as  pawns or hostages--as leverage to secure changes to parts of our  immigration system that have nothing to do with the plight of these  immigrant families. We should reject this President's crude and cynical  political strategy. We cannot risk continuing to separate and  indefinitely detain migrant families. These practices offend our basic  sense of morality and justice, and they are unnecessary to protect our  borders.   Yes, we all want border security. Yes, we want to stop drug  traffickers and human traffickers from taking advantage of our borders.  We want more resources in judges and Border Patrol agents and members  of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Service. They should have the  resources and support they need. We met with many of the dedicated men  and women who are serving in those agencies. Violating our basic sense  of due process, abrogating due process rights so adjudication is denied  and due process is abrogated certainly should be intolerable.   At this juncture, the emergent need that has to be addressed now is  reuniting these families. If shaming the administration is what is  needed, we should do it, but ultimately the rule of law will be  enforced by our courts. They will be regarded in history along with our  free press as the bulwark between a potentially tyrannical Presidency  and preservation of our fundamental rights. Now is the time to  celebrate and protect those basic rights and the rule of law.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today I wish to recognize MG  Thaddeus J. Martin on the occasion of his retirement from his position  as adjutant general of the Connecticut National Guard.   A dedicated member of our military, Major General Martin has  influenced Connecticut for the better and set an impressive standard  for the future of the Connecticut National Guard thanks to his decades  of leadership and public service. He is well regarded by his peers and  has consistently proven himself as a mindful and quick-thinking leader.   Major General Martin began his military service in 1977. He received  his commission in the U.S. Air Force through officer training school in  1980 and completed training as an aircraft maintenance officer in 1981.  Throughout his years on Active service, he held several squadron and  wing-level assignments and completed a major command headquarters tour  with Strategic Air Command.   After joining the Connecticut Air National Guard in 1990, he held  command positions at the squadron, group, and wing level and completed  a statutory tour with the National Guard Bureau. He also served as the  assistant adjutant general for the Connecticut Air National Guard prior  to becoming the adjutant general of the Connecticut National Guard.   Major General Martin is the longest currently tenured adjutant  general in the Nation and the third longest serving adjutant general in  Connecticut's history, having reached 13 years in the position last  month. During his time as adjutant general, he oversaw the Connecticut  National Guard with great integrity, addressing emergencies in the  area, and offering military support on behalf of the United States  wherever necessary. Major General Martin's decades of service to our  Nation enabled him to diligently and tirelessly carry out his  responsibilities of providing forces for the Governor and Chief of the  National Guard Bureau that were always mission-ready. As the direct  link to National Guard State resources, he routinely worked to better  prepare Connecticut and the Guard to face new challenges.   Already in his first year as adjutant general, he dealt with  challenges from the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission. Major  General Martin played a key role in establishing a lasting flying  mission for Connecticut by helping to organize the transition from the  A-10 Warthog to the C-130H Hercules tactical airlift platform. This  flying mission recently marked its first-ever large-scale overseas  deployment as a C-130 unit.   Over the past 13 years, the Connecticut National Guard has assisted  with relief efforts resulting from a number of natural disasters,  including Hurricanes Katrina, Harvey, and Maria, along with Superstorm  Sandy, by providing essential supplies, equipment, and personnel.  Additionally, over 6,000 Connecticut Army and Air guardsmen deployed in  order to support international efforts. All of this was accomplished  under the leadership of Major General Martin.   The Connecticut National Guard is a critical part of our State, and  the unfailing commitment and leadership of Major General Martin during  his tenure as adjutant general leaves his successor with an impressive  and accomplished Guard that will undoubtedly continue to valiantly  serve Connecticut and the Nation in the future.   I applaud his lifetime of service and hope my colleagues will join me  in congratulating Major General Martin on his well-earned  retirement.                            ____________________
