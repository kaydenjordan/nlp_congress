 Mr. Speaker, as I was preparing to give remarks, I was  listening to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, and one of  the points being raised was about champions of Title IX and what would  they say. I think that is a fantastic question.   Just today, in the House Judiciary Committee we had a witness, a  young lady who is a swimmer for the University of Pennsylvania. I asked  her whether Lia Thomas is a man or a woman. This female swimmer replied  without hesitation that, indeed, that swimmer is a biological male.   Now, that gets sometimes dismissed as, I don't know, humorous or  absurd or whatever in these culture battles, but the fact is the young  lady testifying was a victim of sexual assault and didn't want to have  to be in a bathroom changing with a biological male.   Yet, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle dismiss it. They  dismiss Riley Gaines' concern about competing against a biological  male, while they champion Title IX. You literally can't even make it  up. Come to the floor, champion Title IX, and yet they destroy Title IX  by virtue of saying, oh, yeah, it is fine. It doesn't matter if you are  a dude. Suit up, jump in the pool and swim.   I asked one of the witnesses today, I said, well, you know, is the  international federation of swimming, or whatever it is called, is that  some grand rightwing conspiracy?   She kind of chuckled and said no. She knew where I was going, which  is, that organization had banned Lia Thomas and other biological males  from competing against women in the 2024 Olympics because of course  they did, at least if they are being at all rational. It doesn't mean  that won't change. It doesn't mean that the irrational won't take over.  It doesn't mean that the absurd won't define how we live our lives.   But at least, in this case, the committee said, huh, yeah, maybe a  dude shouldn't swim against girls in the swim meets.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle dismiss that as  rightwing lunacy, MAGA extremism. I never know what I am. I support Ron  DeSantis and I am a MAGA hater. On the floor of the House, I am a MAGA  extremist because I dare to stand up for the American people who are  sick of having their world turned upside down.   I have my colleagues on the other side of the aisle saying, well, we  have important work to do, but all they care about are book bans. Well,  that is just a lie. It is just a straight-up lie, the accusations of  book banning.   Do you know what kind of books have been put on the chopping block in  Florida? Books that have straight-up pornography in them that parents  dared to say, wait a minute, I don't think I want that in the public  schools library.   Now, wait, is that what a book ban is? Because if it is, sign me up.  Sign me up because I don't want that in my kids' library, and that is  actually the fundamental question.   Are we going to stand up and say we are going to stand up for our  kids? Are we, in this body, are people who just want normalcy and their  lives back in legislatures across this country and in governors'  mansions across this country going to stand up and say yes, there is  man and there is woman; and no, the men shouldn't compete against women  in their swim meets or their track meets.   No, we shouldn't put pornography of any kind, straight, gay,  otherwise, in the public libraries of our kids' schools, and then be  labeled as book banners; because if that is what you are going to do, I  am going to stand up and say yes.   Meanwhile, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to shut  down free speech. They want to say anything I am saying--in fact, what  I am saying right now, they would say is disinformation. What I am  saying right now, they would say if I put it on social media, they  would be all too happy to have Big Tech companies with the power of  government shut down my speech.   Now, I am protected on the floor of the House, but every American is  supposed to be protected with free speech. I am going to keep saying  it. I am going to keep saying that Lia Thomas is a dude, and I will say  it here, and I will say it on social media, and I will say it on the  streets. If they dare try to stop me, that is what the First Amendment  is all about, and we are going to stand up and defend that. We are  going to stand up and defend normalcy.   We had accusations that, oh, this is all made up. We actually had  somebody in one of the hearings today in which we were talking about  transgender issues and so-called dysphoria, we had a young lady who, I  could barely speak after I heard her testimony. I could barely figure  out what to say to her because she had started to be transitioned,  changed sex, realized that she was going to lose the ability as a woman  to breastfeed her children--hopefully one day--and she stopped.   She was testifying today about the horrors of the pressure being  placed upon her to change her sex. She broke down in tears.   Then she was talking about one of the other witnesses at the table, a  mom that was talking about her child, the Democratic witness, and  saying how important it was to be able to have the transition.   Here is what our witness, Chloe Cole said:   ``I understand that Mrs. Reynolds is scared for her child and I just  want to set the record straight that I don't hate her. I don't think  anyone in this room hates her.   ``In fact,'' she said as she began to cry, and all of us, by the way,  on the dais were holding back tears, ``I see my own mother and my own  father in her, and that clearly she dearly loves her child and she is  doing the best with that she has been given and, unfortunately, it is  not much, and for that I am sorry.''   She remained emotional and she continued, she said:   ``I think every parent deserves the utmost grace and guidance with  how to help their child. I don't wish for her child to have the same  result as I did.   ``I don't wish for anyone to regret transition or detransition  because it is incredibly difficult. It comes with its own difficulties  and it is not easy.''   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle call that hate speech.  They say that if we bring these questions up about transitioning  people's sex, their God-given chromosomes and sex because you have got  pressure on social media and the devil that is or are these devices  that our kids spend hundreds of hours on, and you wonder, if I dare say  that, oh, no, that is hate speech.   If you think I am crazy, look around the world. Look around the  world. We had a public official in Finland who was being prosecuted  last year, prosecuted, and is still having to go through it, for daring  to have distributed materials saying that she believed in traditional  marriage instead of same-sex marriage. She was being prosecuted,  despite being a member of the Parliament.   I am just telling you, America, it is coming to a theater near you.  Don't think for a minute that the people who are decrying what I am  saying as hate speech don't want me to be in jail for it. They do, in a  heartbeat. I would be put in jail for daring to stand up in defense of  my faith, my values, my beliefs and, in this case, for simply saying  there is man and there is woman. That is where we stand as a society.   I heard my colleagues on the other side of the aisle--this is not  what I came to the floor to talk about, by the way. But I heard my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle talking about schools and how  we want to, you know, scare parents, by talking about these issues.  This is all to scare parents they said in the hearing.   Well, how about this? Today, news report: Vermont school district  removes male and female from the reproductive system lessons.   Let that sink in for a minute. I want you to think about it.   What is the first thing you do if you are a farmer and you get a new  calf, or you are trying to--what do you do? Is it a boy or a girl?   What is the first thing you do when your baby is born? Is it a boy or  a girl?   They are literally taking out of the lessons in the Vermont school  district on reproductive system, they are taking out male and female.  That is so bat-crap crazy I can't even possibly put it into words.  [[Page H4125]]    Yet, I am the one, according to my colleagues on other side of the  aisle, who is hateful because we are trying to pass in a National  Defense Authorization Act language to say that perhaps--color me  crazy--our Defense Department should be focused on a mission to kill  people and blow stuff up when called upon to do so, hopefully, on a  limited basis, but really dadgum effectively when called upon to do so.   I think if I polled most Americans, they would say I want my defense  to be better than every other country, by an order of magnitude, highly  trained; and I don't think any of them would rank diversity, equity,  inclusion, or transgender surgeries high on the national defense  authorization list of priorities, or climate change.   I don't think most of my constituents care that they drive around  battery-powered jeeps or battery-powered Hummers or battery-powered  tanks. They actually want them to work. They actually want them to blow  things up.   So we dare to say, how about the National Defense Authorization Act  focus on defense?   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle come down crying hate,  crying that we are injecting culture wars into the Defense Department.  Well, wait. Who exactly is it that injected culture wars into the  Defense Department? This administration, my Democratic colleagues, and  we are trying to get defense back on track. We did so, by the way.   But our Democratic colleagues in the Senate are going to refuse to  take up the version of the National Defense Authorization Act that we  passed. They are going to want to cleanse it.   Let's not forget, some of my colleagues from the other side of the  aisle, that when they cleanse it, what they are really doing is  polluting the Department of Defense, which is driving down recruiting  and driving down our effectiveness. We are losing simulations by the  day. Our numbers are going down by the day. Our effectiveness is going  down by the day. Our stockpiles are going down by the day because they  have turned the Department of Defense into a social engineering  experiment wrapped in a uniform, and that is criminal and we shouldn't  stand for it.   That is not the only thing we shouldn't stand for. Yesterday, I had  the pleasure of having Alejandro Mayorkas, the Department of Homeland  Security Secretary before us in the Judiciary Committee. I reminded the  Secretary that about 15 months ago he appeared before the Judiciary  Committee.   When he did so, I asked him, point blank, Mr. Secretary, do you have,  in your job as the Secretary, operational control of the border? He  said, I do.   I said, wait. You have operational control of the border? I pulled up  the statute, the Secure Fence Act, which requires this country and the  Secretary carrying out his job to maintain operational control.                                time  1645    I pulled up a second board with the statute definition of operational  control. It means you do not allow anybody to come across the border  and into our country without papers and knowing who they are. You don't  allow illegal trafficking. You don't allow narcotics to come across.  You have operational control of the border.   I put all that up. I said, are you sure you have operational control  of the border? The Secretary said, I do. I pushed on it multiple times.   Funny enough, in a different hearing later this year over in the  Senate, the Secretary changed his tune. He said: Well, by that  definition under the Secure Defense Act, I don't use that one. Under  that definition, nobody has ever had operational control.   The fact is, the Secretary wants the American people to believe that  our country is in charge of our border when anybody with eyes knows  that it is the cartels that have operational control of our border. It  is wide open and lawless while Americans are dying as a result of  fentanyl poisonings; migrants are dying in the false name of  compassion, as my Democratic colleagues pat themselves on the back  while 53 people roast in a tractor-trailer in San Antonio, which I  represent; and little girls are sold into the sex trafficking trade, as  exposed in the ``Sound of Freedom.'' Cartels are making tens of  billions of dollars moving human beings for profit.   That is what is happening, and my Democratic colleagues don't care,  and the Secretary of Homeland Security doesn't care. The Secretary of  Homeland Security lied in front of me, in front of the entire Judiciary  Committee, in front of all America, by saying that he has operational  control of the border when faced with the statute, knowing what it  means and knowing full well that he does not, we do not, our country  does not.   Governor Abbott was being criticized on the floor today by my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle because he is putting up  barriers. He is putting Texas DPS, Department of Public Safety,  troopers down on the Rio Grande. He is deploying barriers in the middle  of the Rio Grande. He is being criticized for being heartless.   Who is it that is heartless? Those who want the rule of law enforced  and to tell the world that you don't flood our borders in a way that is  going to empower cartels and endanger yourself, or is it heartless to  allow all of those people to get sold into the sex trafficking trade,  die in the Texas heat, get abused, get used by cartels like the Federal  judge in Texas who upward departed a few weeks ago from the penalties  under our statutes and the sentencing guidelines because he ran across  a case where the cartels had a stash house in Fort Worth, Texas, a man  illegally here, a father who was in Baltimore, Maryland, and he was  being told by the cartels his daughter would be raped if he didn't pay  $23,000.   That is happening every day in our country, every single day in the  supposed greatest country on the face of the Earth and in history. We  stand here, 435 of us, in front of that flag, and that flag is supposed  to mean something, and it sure as hell doesn't mean anything if little  girls are getting raped right here in D.C., up the road in Baltimore,  in Houston, in San Antonio, in Laredo, in Fort Worth.   We have evidence it is happening every day, and we don't do anything  about it except pat ourselves on the back and say, well, we can just  interpret parole and interpret asylum laws and just tell the world to  come on up through Mexico, but don't mind the fact that thousands of  you are going to die. You are going to get used by the cartels. You are  going to pay millions of dollars, and your little girls are going to  get exploited--the sound of freedom, indeed.   We should be ashamed of ourselves. By the way, that goes for  Republicans and Democrats because it has happened under both of our  watches for far too long.   Why am I standing in front of this chart? Because, about 4 months  ago, we passed in this body H.R. 2. We passed legislation that we  know--we don't believe; we know--would take significant strides to  securing the border of the United States, reestablishing operational  control, limiting the flow, limiting the power of cartels, empowering  ICE, empowering Border Patrol, reestablishing the rule of law so that  we can be the beacon of hope that people want to aspire to come here to  live under. Of course, that bill is sitting over in the Senate that  doesn't give a whit.   What do we do about it? That is my question for Republicans. I can  sit here and bash my Democratic colleagues all day long for not caring  about what is happening in Texas, for not caring about the five kids in  the school district where I live who died from fentanyl poisoning, not  caring about the 200 a day dying from fentanyl poisoning while fentanyl  pours cross our border, not caring about what is happening to Border  Patrol agents, not caring that the Secretary of Homeland Security lied  about Border Patrol agents allegedly whipping Haitian migrants, which  we knew didn't happen and the Secretary knew didn't happen 2 hours  before he went to the microphone and said they did it and they did it  because of systemic racism.   All of that is true, and my Democratic colleagues will not want to  pass H.R. 2. So, what will Republicans do about it? That is the  question, and the answer is that we should recognize the power of the  purse.  [[Page H4126]]    James Madison, Federalist Paper No. 58: ``The House of  Representatives cannot only refuse, but they alone can propose the  supplies requisite for the support of government. They, in a word, hold  the purse. . . . This power over the purse may, in fact, be regarded  as''--and this is the most important part--``the most complete and  effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the immediate  representatives of the people for obtaining a redress of every  grievance and for carrying into effect every just and salutary  measure.''   What that means is, we get to decide how the tax dollars and the  borrowed dollars are spent to carry out the laws of the United States  and no one else. We control the power of the purse. We are the people's  House. It is our job to decide how those dollars are spent and then  hold the executive branch accountable for carrying out the laws using  those taxpayer dollars.    That is not only our opportunity; it is our duty in the House of  Representatives.   That is the question for Republicans. Will we take inventory and  decide whether we care more about steak dinners at night, making a golf  event, or coming down to do three votes in a week and then getting home  for the weekend?   I mean, I noticed today is Thursday. We have one appropriations bill  passed. We are not coming in tomorrow. We are blowing out for a 6-week  recess. The government is going to run out of money on September 30.  That is one thing we know.   Most people I represent would tell you that they don't think we ought  to spend more money, that we ought to spend less. So, the question is,  between now and September 30, approximately 60 days from now, are we  going to find the ability to pass appropriations bills that reduce  spending, take our country back, and, most importantly, check the  executive branch from the tyranny that they are engaging in over the  American people?   The Department of Homeland Security is decidedly not securing the  homeland. It is just true by any objective measure.   Last September, I asked my House and Senate Republican colleagues if  they would vote for a CR and continue to fund the tyranny being waged  by this administration. I sent a letter with six pages of examples of  how a CR would continue funding the very things the GOP Members of this  body campaign against.   That was September 27 of last year, about 40 days before the November  election. What are the things GOP Members campaign against? Open  borders and funding for open borders; authoritarian bureaucrats, the  FBI, the IRS, the ATF, and the funding for those bureaucrats;  tyrannical public health agencies that shut down our economy, mandated  vaccines, mandated masks, and funding for those agencies; destructive  energy policies through the Inflation Reduction Act, EPA, and  Department of Energy undermining the ability of this country to produce  reliable energy that makes the world work--by the way, 3 billion people  on this planet do not have reliable energy and a billion people don't  have electricity at all; funding for radical, anti-American ideologies  at the Department of Education, NPR, and HHS; funding for the  degradation of our national security with a woke Department of Defense.  Nevertheless, 22 Senate Republicans still supported the CR, as did 10  House Republicans.   Funding runs out on September 30, and here we sit, once again--with  two notable differences. We are now operating under bloated spending  levels established by the FY23 omnibus bill passed last December. If  you don't know what that means, it is just the way this place works.  Spending runs out in September. If we haven't passed appropriations  bills through both bodies that are signed by the President, people  freak out. They want the lights to stay on. October 1 rolls around, and  they pass a continuing resolution to keep the government going. Might  pass it for a day or a week or a month. Often, they pass it for about  75 days.   Why would you do that on September 30 for about 75 days? Do the math.  That ends up in the middle of December. The uniparty establishment of  Washington elite, who doesn't give a crap about debt, who doesn't care  about what is happening in their country at the end of the day, really  cares more about getting home for Christmas. That is why.   What happened last December? That happened. A couple of days before  Christmas, a $1.7 trillion omnibus spending bill was passed, funding  Ukraine to the tune of about $45 billion, increasing defense spending  by about 10 percent, increasing nondefense by about 7 percent. All of  that got done while what? While we are at $32 trillion of debt and  counting, long before, by the way, a big deal was cut raising your debt  another $4 trillion on Memorial Day.   Again, that happened while Republicans were in charge of the House,  and 17 Republican Senators voted for that. Why? I will tell you why:  The defense establishment in this town, combined with those who wanted  to try to do something for Ukraine, said: Well, we know we have a lot  of debt, but we have to cut a deal. I want to go home for Christmas. I  want to wear a blue and yellow pin on my lapel. I want to feel good  about myself. That is okay. I will pass the buck down to my kids and  grandkids with a big pile of debt.   Again, I am going to ask my Republican colleagues, will we vote to  continue to fund this tyrannical government while our border is wide  open, little girls are getting abused, some 80,000 to 90,000 Americans  a year are dying from fentanyl poisoning, cartels are in power, and  China is in power? Are we going to continue to do that?                                time  1700    We have the power of the purse. Will we use it, or will we curl up in  a little ball, like we tend to do every single year, and say: ``Oh, no,  they are going to criticize us for a government shutdown''? Every year,  like clockwork.   I am all for moving the appropriations bills and getting them done by  September 30, but I can promise you, as sure as the Sun is coming up  tomorrow, Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats are not going to bless the  appropriations bills that we move through the House. They are not going  to. They are going to then want to claim it is Republicans who are  shutting down the government.   The question is, when we wake up on October 1, are we Republicans  going to have agreed to spend even one more dollar to advance a  tyrannical government that is stepping over the rights of the American  people at the Department of Justice and the FBI, that is funding a woke  government at the Department of Defense that leaves $85 billion behind  in Afghanistan with no real accountability?   Importantly, for the purpose of what I want to talk about more right  now, is the border. We have seen 5.6 million illegal crossings since  January 2021. Under Secretary Mayorkas and President Biden, the number  of known or suspected terrorists caught by border agents has increased  each year: fiscal year 2021, 15, their first year; FY22, 98; FY23, 140  so far.   You think: ``Oh, gosh, they are doing their job. They caught all  these guys.'' Well, what about the 1.8 million or so got-aways? Is  anybody concerned about the got-aways when you know you have 140, so  far, individuals nabbed who are known or suspected terrorists?   We have lost 85,000 kids, gone missing, can't track them.   As I said before, Border Patrol has seized 22,000 pounds of fentanyl.  I don't know if you understand, but a sugar packet of fentanyl could  kill most of the people in this room, depending on its strength. They  have seized 22,000 pounds of fentanyl, which would kill hundreds of  millions of people.   China sells the printing presses to cartels to make the pills that  are killing our kids, kids that take Xanax or Adderall, boom, one pill,  dead. It happens all across America. There are 72,815 fentanyl  poisonings, 200 per day.   I represent Texas. As of this month, 46 Texas counties have declared  an invasion because of the number and volume of migrants entering their  communities. They have to deal with schools. They have to deal with  hospitals. They have to deal with crime. They have to have police do  the job that needs to be done. They have to deal with bailouts. They  have to deal with fences getting cut. They have to deal with livestock  getting out. They have to deal with fentanyl pouring into their  communities. They have to deal with marijuana traffic. They have to  deal with all sorts of dangers.  [[Page H4127]]    Texas has appropriated $10 billion to deal with the border. Texas  should get that paid back.   I will be very clear. This Member of Congress will not vote for a  single CR or DHS appropriations bill that does not address the border  security issue, turning H.R. 2 into law, removing the actors at DHS  that refuse to do their job, and paying Texas back for the damage being  done to the State I represent.   I am not going to be alone. If those Senators think they are going to  roll us, they have a fight on their hands--including Republican  Senators. I don't care what party you are in. I don't care if you are a  Republican or a Democrat. The time for our border being in chaos and  dangerous and endangering migrants and endangering Americans, the time  for that to end is now, not after another Presidential election.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle say: ``Oh, we like to  use all of this for politics, to raise money, to campaign on it.'' My  constituents are sick of hearing about it. I don't get a whole lot of  praise from my constituents for talking about it. They want us to end  it. They are exhausted--ranchers breaking down in tears, 75-year-old  crusty Texans who find a dead body on their ranch or are worried about  their children, their livestock getting out, the ranch that has been in  their family for years. Moms come to me having lost their children,  like Stephanie Turner, who lost her son, Tucker, and who I have gotten  to know, along with dozens of others.   The Secretary of Homeland Security has the audacity to come before  the House Judiciary Committee and say he has it all under control and  lie. Yet, a number of my Republican colleagues run around going, well,  that is not a high crime or misdemeanor. Constitutional scholars,  indeed.   It is, in fact, an impeachable offense to lie under oath, and the  Secretary of Homeland Security has lied under oath. Putting aside all  the other stuff, putting aside ignoring the laws, putting aside  endangering Americans, all purposefully, put all of that aside, you  think, ``Oh, that is maladministration. Maladministration was rejected  by the Founders. Don't you see, Chip?'' I get these lessons all the  time, Con Law 101, from my colleagues.   First of all, not 100 percent true. Maladministration is viewed by  some of the people who have studied this to have been subsumed into  what was known to be high crimes and misdemeanors at the time our  Constitution was adopted.   Put that aside. The Secretary lied to us. That should mean something.  That should matter. We should act on it. Either remove him or stop  funding him or both.   I am going to call the question. This is fair warning. Oh, don't  surprise me, I am told around here. Don't be surprised. It is July  right now. We have 60 days until the government runs out of funding. I  am telling you, I will fight the rule. I will fight every bill that  comes to this floor that in any way will fund the Secretary of Homeland  Security to continue to lie and fail to secure the homeland.   The things that we need to do we laid out in H.R. 2, the bill we  passed this spring to secure the border: restart infrastructure, border  wall construction; clear the cane; build roads; provide the resources  needed to actually contain the flow; permanently implement the remain  in Mexico policy that President Trump adopted that requires migrants to  stay south of the border while any asylum claim is adjudicated; end  catch and release; keep migrant families together while their claims  are processed; treat minors from noncontiguous countries the same as we  treat minors from Mexico by saying we will return them to their  families; and end parole abuse and asylum abuse, restoring them to  their original intent.    These things will reestablish the very rule of law that attracts  migrants to come here. If you think and say, as my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle often do, that this is anti-Brown, anti- Hispanic racism, that is a lie. Talk to Hispanic Texans, Hispanic  Americans, sick of watching their communities get decimated, sick of  watching the rule of law crumble, sick of watching cartels get into  power, sick of watching their own die from fentanyl poisoning.   I am not going to allow the race-baiting and the game that we are  going to call you racist to cow me away from standing up and defending  the border of the United States, which we are required to do. I am not  going to do it.   That is why I am going to keep offering amendments to end diversity,  equity, and inclusion programs. I am going to keep offering amendments  to stop the racial division being sowed by my colleagues on the other  side of aisle, including the President of the United States and  everybody running these agencies, undermining our Department of  Defense, dividing our country, sowing seeds of hatred rather than  bringing us together under that flag united. We should end it. I am not  going to back away from it ever.   Let me close with one final point. I have some colleagues who I know  want some time, and I will be happy to give it to them.   I have focused a lot on the border. There are a lot of things that  need to change. When we passed the Limit, Save, Grow Act as a  Republican Party in, I think, April, I felt that was one of the high  watermarks, along with passing H.R. 2, of this Congress and laying out  a vision for where we want to take the country--find a path forward to  balance the budget, limit spending, cut the size and scope of the  Federal bureaucracy, secure the border of the United States, limit the  devastating damage that the so-called Inflation Reduction Act will be  causing on our ability to be energy independent and the strength of our  national security from energy freedom, cutting down the expansion of  the Internal Revenue Service. There are other items in that, but we  laid out an agenda. I hope we will stick with that as we go through the  appropriations process.   In addition to the border, I have to say that the Inflation Reduction  Act, which is effectively funding slavery in China, Congo, and around  the world, needs to be ended, needs to be capped, limited, or ended.   Goldman Sachs estimates the IRA's unreliable energy subsidies will  cost $1.2 trillion. Do you want to know how you ended up with $32  trillion, soon to be $36 trillion, in debt? There you go. We pass a  debt ceiling limit increase. Within a month, we had already added  another trillion dollars to the debt.   The IRA massively subsidizes EV purchases and manufacturing. The EPA  has mandated two-thirds of new cars be EVs by 2032. I live in Texas.  Driving from Austin to Midland ain't easy to do in an electric vehicle.  I also don't have $70,000 sitting around to buy a new car that then is  expensive to deal with when the battery goes out.   All of this is heavily owned by China. China has 80-plus percent,  pushing 90 percent, of the battery-making manufacturing base. We are  literally handing to China our entire energy security. It is like  literally one of the stupidest things a free people has ever done. At a  moment when we have military strength and economic strength that is  being challenged around the world, the geniuses of this administration  and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle decide we need to turn  over our energy industry to our adversary.   It is so much worse. The Democratic Republic of the Congo produces 70  percent of the world's cobalt. NPR reported on how modern-day slavery  in the DRC powers the rechargeable battery economy with children and  mines. There are probably 10,000 to 15,000 tunnels that are dug by hand  by artisanal miners. None of them have supports, ventilation shafts,  rock bolts, anything like that, and these tunnels collapse all the  time, burying alive children who are down there.   Trafficking--you have these malicious, sometimes called commandos,  who will abduct children, traffic children, and recruit children from  other parts of the DRC.   China owns 80 percent of the industrial cobalt mines in the DRC and  controls 15 of the 19 primary mines in the country. It controls almost  80 percent of electric vehicle battery manufacturing. Eighty percent of  solar panels installed in the U.S. come from Chinese firms. I could go  on and on.   Meanwhile, while they do this, China has 1,100 coal-fired plants. We  have 250. China is building two new coal-fired plants every week. We  are sitting around playing unicorn games saying, hey, let's throw up a  few more windmills and solar panels and just hope that we will be able  to get our power from China.  [[Page H4128]]                                     time  1715    Can you image, in 1939, going: Hey, let's go over to Germany and say,  Why don't you provide our energy, we have a deal for you--or Japan.  Here we sit. I want to bring it back to the final point and then I will  be yielding time to my colleagues in whichever order they choose.   This is about humanity. We are empowering tyrants who are abusing  children in mines around the world, enriching a handful of leftist  elitists in the country through corporate cronyism to the tune of $1.2  trillion in the so-called Inflation Reduction Act while little children  get exploited.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle pat themselves on the  back because they are fixing things for climate change. No, you are  not. You are not denting CO2 production. You could get rid  of every single internal combustion engine and you are going to drop  CO2 production by 2 or 3 percent.   Meanwhile, our border is wide open. Meanwhile, as I said today, while  I am sitting here in this Chamber a little girl has been driven up I-95  through the Nation's capital up to New York as part of the sex  trafficking trade. The data indicates that it is so prevalent that it  is likely true.   We know of the stash houses around this country. We know of the  abuses being perpetrated on children. We know of the deaths of our  children in this country to fentanyl poisoning. I am not going to  subsidize and fund evil.   I am asking my Republican colleagues to join me in committing--before  we get to the September 30 shutdown--to join our arms together and  stand to thwart an administration that is tyrannically undermining our  freedom and our safety in Texas and throughout this country. Little  children, our kids, and our people are dying by the thousands because  we refuse to do the basic duty of government, which is to secure our  national borders.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Langworthy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Owens).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Utah.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Salazar),  my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I close by recognizing an individual that I have grown  very fond of in my time here at the House of Representatives. I don't  do a lot of these Special Orders and come down and talk about  individuals, but since I have been in the House, getting to know Joyce  Hamlett has been an extraordinary pleasure and honor.   I wish Joyce were on the floor at this moment because she is going to  be retiring here shortly, either tomorrow or next week. She has worked  here on the Hill for 35 years.   Speaker McCarthy already gave a fantastic speech detailing her bio  and background. She grew up in North Carolina and she will be returning  to North Carolina. She devoted 35 years here, working up from being in  the cafeteria with her mom, if I remember correctly from Speaker  McCarthy's speech, and serving as the elevator operator.   For over a decade, she has faithfully protected the mace. The mace of  the House of Representatives is one of the oldest symbols of the United  States Government representing Congress' order and authority. Her duty  is to protect the mace that opens the House each day and closes it each  night.   Mr. Speaker, I would note she was also responsible for keeping  decorum on the floor of the House of Representatives, and I have been  the recipient of her admonition on more than one occasion. It has been,  frankly, an honor to receive it.   Mr. Speaker, I will miss her and I wish her God speed in her  retirement. I thank her and all the staff that serve the House of  Representatives. She is one of the best. I have worked with a lot of  people over the years, she is an exceptional human being. We are a  greater country and a greater body for her service.    Mr. Speaker, God bless Joyce, and I hope to see her today or tomorrow  before she goes off to North Carolina.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
