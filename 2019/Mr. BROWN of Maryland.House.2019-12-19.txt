 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Representative  Torres for yielding me the time and also my good friend from New York,  Congressman Suozzi, for his work on this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, this bill fixes several alarming defects in President  Trump's tax giveaway to the wealthy. It also takes steps to make our  tax code fairer for working people.   In 2017, my Republican colleagues tried and failed to eliminate a  $250 tax deduction for teachers buying school supplies for their  children in their classrooms.   Smaller education budgets have forced too many teachers to buy  supplies to fill the gap. More than 90 percent of public schoolteachers  are not reimbursed for these expenses. Nearly 80,000 educators in  Maryland claim this deduction on their taxes.   The average teacher spends $479 of their own money buying supplies  for our kids, so I am pleased that this legislation incorporates  language from my standalone bill that I filed in the 115th Congress and  again in this Congress, the Educators Expense Deduction Modernization  Act, which increases the deduction from $250 to $500. It is a small  benefit for educators who make a financial sacrifice.   It is critical for local school districts and States to better fund  education and pay educators. In Congress, we can  [[Page H12217]]  do more to ensure classrooms are stocked with the supplies that our  students, our children need.
