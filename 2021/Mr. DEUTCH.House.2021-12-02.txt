 Madam Speaker, as we begin to hear stories of the  victims,  [[Page H6863]]  Justin Shilling, Hana St. Juliana, Madisyn Baldwin, and Tate Myer, our  hearts are broken for the families in Michigan.   For the 17 dead and 21 wounded at a high school in Columbine 22 years  ago; for the 32 dead and 17 wounded at Virginia Tech 14 years ago; for  the 27 dead and two wounded at an elementary school in Newtown,  Connecticut, 3,275 days ago--9 years ago--for the 17 dead and 17  wounded at a high school in Parkland 3 years ago; and for the four dead  and seven wounded at a high school in Oxford, Michigan, 2 days ago, Mr.  Speaker, we know what can be done to help save lives.   We know red flags laws are bipartisan and can save lives. We know  that if we invest in mental health we can save lives. We know that  background checks save lives. These are not partisan, and these are not  controversial.   How many more scenes like the one in Michigan do we need to see  before this Congress, the Senate, this House, and the White House get  together to stop the violence?   Mr. Speaker, it is urgent. The time to act is not now, it was years  ago. We must come together and help save lives.                            ____________________
