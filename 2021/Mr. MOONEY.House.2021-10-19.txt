 Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the Congressional Rugby  Caucus, along with D.C. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, I am very  excited to see the legendary New Zealand All Blacks take the pitch  against the U.S.A. men's national rugby team when they face off this  Saturday, October 23. We hope to pack FedExField here in the D.C. area.   The All Blacks of New Zealand are the world's most famous rugby club.  They strike fear in their opponents with their world-famous traditional  pregame war dance, called the haka.   As a bonus, the Army Black Knights will face off against the U.S.  Naval Academy Midshipmen in the curtain-raiser match.   Men's and women's rugby are fast-growing sports in America and give  us all a chance to put partisan politics aside. That is why bringing an  international event of this magnitude to the D.C. area is a tremendous  accomplishment for U.S.A. Rugby, Events D.C., and Left Field Live. The  match is an important barometer of the United States' ability to host  future world-class events, including the Rugby World Cup.   Please support the game of rugby by joining me this Saturday, October  23, here in D.C. at FedExField.                            ____________________
