 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, well, the Biden administration is on  track for another record-shattering year on our southern border--in all  the wrong ways.   The Department of Homeland Security is reportedly preparing for up to  18,000 attempted border crossings per day--18,000 per day.   President Biden's border crisis is a symptom of the modern Democratic  Party's inability to support any remotely reasonable policy of border  enforcement.   Now, thus far, the Biden administration has kept the chaos at least  somewhat in check by leaning on emergency authorities that are specific  to the COVID pandemic. To be clear, even with these title 42  authorities in place, our border has still been in crisis. Last month  was the worst February in more than 20 years. We just saw the worst 12- month period for illegal crossings since at least--listen to this-- 1960. This is with title 42 in place. Just imagine if President Biden  kills it.   But the open-borders far left doesn't like title 42. So now,  according to public reports, the Biden administration is preparing to  cave to the radicals, end title 42, and effectively throw our borders  completely wide open.   Ending title 42 without any real border security plan in place would  spark a humanitarian and security crisis like we have never seen  before. But it is pretty obvious the far left doesn't care. Open  borders are their objective.   So at the same time Washington Democrats are pushing for more Federal  spending on the pandemic, they  [[Page S1877]]  want to declare the pandemic is finished at our southern border. This  doesn't add up.   Throwing the floodgates open for an historic spring and summer of  illegal immigration would be an unforced error of historic proportions.  It would be right up there with the administration's $2 trillion in  inflationary spending and their botched retreat from Afghanistan.   But this goes deeper than just title 42 and COVID. The fundamental  point is this: Today's Democrats need the pretext of the pandemic to  justify having national borders at all. The left feels they need the  pretext of COVID to have any--any--border enforcement whatsoever.   This is absolutely mind-boggling.   Republicans and the American people reject this false choice between  permanent COVID versus open borders. We can't only be a sovereign  nation during pandemics. Americans deserve secure borders all the time.   Functional open borders have pervaded the Biden agenda at literally  every level. The President chose a Supreme Court nominee, Judge  Jackson, who has displayed a major streak of judicial activism on this  very subject, illegal immigration.   In 2019, the judge sided with the leftwing activists and overlooked  plain statutory language that gave DHS ``sole and unreviewable  discretion'' over the speedy removal of illegal immigrants. Judge  Jackson literally just brushed aside the plain text of the law to reach  the policy outcome she wanted, and she went even further. She issued a  nationwide injunction--a nationwide injunction--to impose her radical  policy view on our entire country.   This was a blatant case of judicial activism. The ruling read like it  belonged on the opinion pages of the Washington Post. Even the very  liberal DC Circuit completely disagreed and overturned Judge Jackson,  with an Obama appointee writing the opinion.   It should not be this hard for an administration to understand that a  nation actually needs borders.   I strongly urge the President to keep title 42 in place and quickly  produce an actual strategy to do his job and secure our border.                                 The Economy    Madam President, on another matter, the American people know our  country is hurting. One national survey just found that only 22 percent  say our country is headed in the right direction. Seven in ten  Americans just told another poll that our Nation's economy is ``in poor  shape.''   The worst inflation in 40 years is fleecing American consumers from  the gas pump to the grocery store. American workers are earning raises,  but prices are climbing faster than their pay.   The Biden administration has tried to pass the buck for this mess.  They have tried to blame everything but their own radical policies.  They have claimed that a year of runaway inflation was actually--listen  to this--``Putin's price hike,'' because of a war in Europe that is  barely a month old. They have claimed the problem is evil profiteering  CEOs, because, apparently, the private sector was not seeking profits  back when the Republicans had the economy humming with low inflation  just a few years ago.   American families aren't buying the spin for one second. When asked  by another poll what they think is the main reason for rising gas  prices--listen to this--Americans' top answer was ``the Biden  administration's economic policies.''   An outright majority of the country agrees the President has made  inflation worse, but the administration isn't changing course. They are  actually doubling down.   The Biden administration began the week by proposing a budget that  would skyrocket domestic discretionary spending on liberal wish-list  items and smack the country with the biggest tax hike in American  history.   Just last night, Democrats tried to ram through another radical  nominee who would only have compounded the economic pain. President  Biden's choice of David Weil for a senior post at the Department of  Labor was a naked attempt to achieve through bureaucracy what the far- left cannot achieve through legislation. This nominee is famous in  Washington for hostility to small business. He has received tens of  thousands of dollars from Big Labor to do their bidding. He openly  sought to end both the franchise system and the gig economy as we know  them.    Fortunately--fortunately--last night, a bipartisan majority of  Senators rallied together. We saved the President and the Democratic  leader from digging themselves into an even deeper hole with this  nominee.   Also overnight, we learned President Biden is going to try to slap  another bandaid on gas prices by draining more oil out of the Strategic  Petroleum Reserve. The reserve is supposed to exist for giant  unforeseen crises, such as a war between great powers. It is not there  so that anti-energy politicians whose policies have raised gas prices  can try to hide that from the public.   It is also worth remembering that back in 2020, as oil prices were  cratering, Republicans tried to seize the opportunity to rebuild the  Strategic Reserve. It would have been a win-win-win to help stabilize  our energy industry in the early days of the crisis, gotten American  taxpayers an incredible deal with oil at bargain-basement prices, and  enhanced our readiness going forward.   But you know what happened. Senate Democrats blocked it. They said  buying oil at rock-bottom prices and building up our reserve would have  been--listen to this--``a bailout for Big Oil.'' So the Democratic  leader bragged about killing that proposal.   You can't make this stuff up.   Our colleagues misunderstand basic economics and basic national  security every chance they get. Taxing, spending, radical nominations,  and gimmicky half-measures--the American people already blame the  Democrats for the fix we are in, and, every week, our colleagues seek  new ways to prove them right.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
