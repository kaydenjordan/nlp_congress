 Mr. President, creating jobs, fostering economic  growth, maintaining sustainable development, and improving standards of  living of all Americans are central tasks for any administration, and  they are the mission of the Commerce Department.   Congress created the Department of Commerce and Labor in 1903, and  then renamed the Department of Commerce in 1913 as the offices working  on labor were transferred to the Department of Labor. Through 12  bureaus and nearly 47,000 employees, the Department runs programs that  affect broad swaths of the American economy.   The Department includes the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration, which warns of dangerous weather, charts seas, and  protects ocean and coastal resources. The Department includes the  Patent and Trademark Office, which fosters technology and innovation,  and the National Institute of Standards and Technology, headquartered  in Gaithersburg, MD, which promotes innovation and industrial  competitiveness. The Department includes the Census Bureau and Bureau  of Economic Analysis, which provide economic data to help business and  policymakers make intelligent decisions. The Department includes the  International Trade Administration, which ensures that Americans have  access to international markets and safeguards Americans from unfair  competition. And the Department includes the Economic Development  Administration to promote job growth in economically distressed  communities.   To run the Commerce Department, President Trump has nominated Wilbur  Ross, Jr., a 79-year-old private-equity billionaire with extensive  holdings and extensive potential conflicts of interest. I have real  questions about whether Mr. Ross is out of touch with ordinary  Americans. And I have real questions about whether Mr. Ross's personal  interests will conflict with his job as Commerce Secretary, if he is  confirmed.   The Commerce Secretary enforces our trade laws, including against  major trade competitors like China. Last year, Mr. Ross told Bloomberg  TV that he had extensive holdings in China. Mr. Ross said, ``We have-- various portfolio  [[Page S1436]]  companies have almost 20 factories doing one thing or another over  there.'' And the New York Times reported that Mr. Ross is vice chairman  of the Bank of Cyprus, making him a de facto business partner with  Viktor F. Vekselberg, one of Russia's most prominent businesspeople and  a person with ties to the Kremlin. Several newspapers have reported  that Mr. Ross plans to keep millions of dollars invested in offshore  entities whose values could be affected by policies that he implements  as Commerce Secretary. Mr. Ross reported plans to hold on to  investments in an oil-tanker company and 10 other entities that invest  in shipping and real estate financing, according to Federal financial- disclosure and ethics filings cited in the reports.   I have questions about Mr. Ross's ability to work for Americans.  Starting in the 1990s, Mr. Ross ran an investment firm that specialized  in distressed assets. The Securities and Exchange Commission said that  Mr. Ross's firm had failed to disclose how it calculates its fees for  some funds, which led to investors to pay roughly $10.4 million of  management fees that they should not have in the decade leading up to  2011.   The Commerce Secretary is a part of the President's economic team;  yet Mr. Ross appears all too willing to play fast and loose with fiscal  showdowns. When, in April 2011, Bloomberg's Mark Crumpton asked Mr.  Ross whether S&P's downgrade of America's credit rating is ``a step in  the right direction,'' Mr. Ross said it was. Ross said: ``Well I think  it's a step in the right direction in that it will put pressure on the  Democrats in the Senate and on the President to go along with some of  the Republican reviews about really cutting the budget deficit and  ultimately cutting the total indebtedness of the United States. So in  that limited sense I think it is a step in the right direction.''   Mr. Ross was all too quick to dismiss the strain that a furlough put  on Federal Government workers. In October 2013, CNBC's Betty Liu had  this exchange with Mr. Ross:         Ross: I think shutting down the government--so-called       shutting down the government, which it's not really shut       down--        Liu: What do you mean?        Ross: Well, many parts of it are still quite open. And it's       just at the fringe that it--that it really matters.        Liu: Yeah, but tell that to the government workers though       who are furloughed, right?        Ross: Yeah, but they're going to get their pay. They know       they'll get their back pay. So I don't see that that's a       permanent damage.    Mr. Ross was all too quick to dismiss the pain of homeowners who lost  their homes in the financial crisis. Bloomberg TV's Betty Liu had this  exchange with Mr. Ross:         Ross: I think you have to look far and wide to find a home       owner who's an actual victim. These are all theoretical       things. They're mostly technical problems that the banks did       wrong. To the best of my knowledge--        Liu: I think it'd be really hard to find, to pinpoint down       to individuals, right?        Ross: Well there's never been a case that I know of where       someone was dispossessed who didn't have a mortgage and       wasn't in default.        Liu: What do you mean?        Ross: Well all these claims that there was robo signing and       all these imperfections, that's true. Those were not what       should be. But the real question is was anyone actually       dispossessed wrongly.        Liu: Of their property.        Ross: Yeah, incorrectly. And I don't think you find a       single case.    The Commerce Secretary oversees the NOAA and the National Weather  Service. But in a conversation with Fox Business's Neil Cavuto, Mr.  Ross was dismissive of the reality of climate change. Mr. Ross said:  ``Well, I think unless the weatherman can tell me if it will rain  tomorrow why would I believe you can make a 100 year forecast. So, I'm  skeptical about the underlying basis.''   And so President Trump has nominated to be Commerce Secretary a  person who has so much wealth and so many foreign interests that it  appears that it will be difficult for him to work in the interests of  middle-class Americans. His extensive foreign business interests call  into question his ability to fight to enforce America's trade laws. Mr.  Ross has expressed cavalier attitudes toward economic brinksmanship and  shown little concern for the people laid off or who lose their homes as  a result. And Mr. Ross has expressed an open skepticism toward the  reality of climate change that calls into question his ability to run  the agency that does research into global climate. For these reasons, I  cannot support his nomination.
