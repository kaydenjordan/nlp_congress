 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize National Police Week.   Every day, from Tigard to Turner, McMinnville to Monmouth, tens of  thousands of courageous Oregonians answer the call to protect and  serve.   Law enforcement officers routinely step into harm's way to defend  community members in crisis and to protect the rule of law. For that,  we owe them  [[Page H2374]]  a debt of gratitude, but gratitude alone is not enough.   As the daughter of a police officer, I know what it is like to worry  about whether your loved one will return home safely, and I grieve for  the families of those who don't.   In their honor, I am committed to supporting police officers in  Oregon and across our Nation with the resources, funds, training, and  care they need. We also need to do more to support our officers once  they exit the force, from increasing mental health services to  expanding disability benefits.   Those who dedicate their lives to public safety deserve nothing less.                            ____________________
