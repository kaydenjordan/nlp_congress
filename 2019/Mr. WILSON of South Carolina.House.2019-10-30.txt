 Madam Speaker, the successful raid by  the United States Special Forces resulting in the death of the  murderous ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is a significant victory for  freedom.   Americans commend the military and intelligence communities for their  diligent work in tracking a murderous terrorist who committed  atrocities, leading to his cowardly suicide killing children in Syria.   I am thankful for the decisive leadership by President Donald Trump.  Our commitment to deny ISIS a safe haven where they can launch attacks  against American families sends a message that the U.S. and our allies  stand ready and determined to succeed in the fight against terrorism.   National radio commentator Buck Sexton, on Monday, correctly praised  our special operations success as ``a big deal.''   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism, just as, next week,  we will cherish the 30th anniversary of Ronald Reagan's liberation of  Europe from communist socialism.                            ____________________
