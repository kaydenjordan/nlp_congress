 Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank him for his work. This is probably one of the areas we work on  where his knowledge when it comes to the forest, healthy forests, and  making sure they are there for the future is so important.   I rise today in support of my amendment, which would simply establish  a program to incentivize larger communities to integrate nearby  smaller, rural communities into their drinking water systems when the  smaller communities' drinking water wells run dry.   In my district, the community of Tooleville has run out of water, as  the groundwater table drops, and aging infrastructure fails or becomes  obsolete. While the long-term solution is to connect Tooleville to the  city of Exeter's drinking water system, that can be expensive for both  Exeter and Tooleville.   This amendment would reduce connection costs for Tooleville residents  while also enabling Exeter to increase its water supply to meet  increased demands with its customers.   Tulare County advises me that if California's droughts continue, more  small and rural communities in my district with older infrastructure  could meet the exact same fate as groundwater tables drop, making this  amendment even more important. We cannot leave our Western communities  vulnerable to drought and aging infrastructure.   I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment.   Madam Chair, I include in the Record letters supporting my amendment  from the county of Tulare, county of Kern, and city of Exeter, all of  which are located in my congressional district.                                                County of Tulare,                                         Visalia, CA, July 26, 2022.      Re H.R. Conway/McCarthy Amendment to H.R. 5118, Wildfire           Response and Drought Resiliency Act--Support.       Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Connie Conway,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear House Minority Leader McCarthy and Representative       Conway: On behalf of the Tulare County Board of Supervisors,       I write in support of House Minority Leader McCarthy and       Congresswoman Conway's proposed amendment to H.R. 5118, the       Wildfire Response and Drought Resiliency Act. The proposed       amendment will address critical water supply challenges faced       by our County's most vulnerable and underserved populations.        Tulare County oversees more than 50 census designated       places and unincorporated communities across California's       Central Valley. The majority of these sparsely populated       districts rely upon groundwater to sustain daily life which       continues to be adversely affected by drought induced water       quality and quantity issues. Every community and municipality       in Tulare County depend upon a system of wells to guarantee       the water needs of their residents. As the California drought       persists, water service providers of our economically dis-      advantaged communities struggle to find the required funding       to excavate deeper wells or upgrade the infrastructure       required to connect with nearby water systems.        The proposed amendment to H.R. 5118 would authorize       significant grant funding that would fully fund water       projects for our small unincorporated communities eliminating       the current funding barriers in place that delay sustainable       water solutions for up to six years before any ground can be       broken. Our most vulnerable residents should not have to wait       that long to have access to clean and sufficient drinking       water.        For these reasons and more, the County of Tulare supports       this proposed amendment and urges its adoption by the House.                                                       Eddie Valero,      Chair, Tulare County Board of Supervisors.                                   ____                                             Board of Supervisors,                                     Kern County, CA, July 26, 2022.      Re Amendments to H.R. 5118, Rural Communities Drinking Water           Resiliency--Support.       Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman McCarthy: I am writing on behalf of the       Kern County Board of Supervisors to express our strong       support for the amendments to H.R. 5118 authored by you and       Congresswoman Conway. The proposed rural communities drinking       water resiliency appropriation of $50 million per year       through 2027 will provide desperately needed resources for       those in our community whose potable water wells run dry.        In 2021, the Board declared a local emergency due to severe       water shortages and conditions of extreme drought within Kern       County. State Water Project deliveries were reduced to only 5       percent of full contract amounts in water year 2021 and the       U.S. Department of Agriculture designated Kern, among 50       other California counties, as primary natural disaster areas       due to drought.        Since then, drought conditions have worsened. According to       the U.S. Department of Agriculture and National Oceanic and       Atmospheric Administration's US Drought Monitor released on       July 21, over 97 percent of California is now in a severe       drought and over 59 percent is considered to be in extreme       drought. With roughly four months of hot, dry weather likely       until the winter rainy season begins again next November,       precious groundwater resources will continue to decline.        California's water challenges are mounting as more intense       and prolonged droughts recur. Rural communities are most       susceptible to losing running water because they typically       rely on groundwater from small community or domestic wells,       which tend to run dry during these periods. Access to water       is a fundamental human right and every Californian should be       able turn on their tap and expect clean water to flow.        For these reasons, the Kern County Board of Supervisors       strongly supports your proposed amendments to H.R. 5118 and       urges the House to adopt them without delay.            Sincerely,                                                     Zack Scrivner,      Chairman, Kern County Board of Supervisors.                                   ____                                                     City of Exeter,                                Office of the City Administrator,                                          Exeter, CA, July 27, 2022.      Re McCarthy/Conway Amendment to the Wildfire Response and           Drought Resiliency Act (H.R. 5118).         To Rep. McCarthy and Rep. Conway: The City of Exeter       supports the McCarthy/Conway Amendment to the Wildfire       Response and Drought Resiliency Act (H.R. 5118). One of the       biggest stumbling blocks for an agency to supply water to an       adjacent rural community is funding for the improvements       needed not only to make the connection but also to the agency       system to be able to supply water outside their jurisdiction.       Most cities don't have the means to do this on their own,       especially since the agency rate payers cannot be burdened       with this additional cost, which is illegal to do in most       cases. This amendment would help cities like Exeter to fund       the needed improvements to make these connections a       possibility. Accordingly, we urge its adoption by the House.        If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.            Thank you,                                                        Adam Ennis,                                                City Administrator.     Madam Chair, now, why are we asking for this amendment?   The one thing you would have to see, there have been no major  reservoirs built in California since 1979. Think of the population  difference in between that time.   California is very blessed. We get snow in the north, we grow the  agriculture for the world in the Central Valley--my good friend from  the other side of the aisle, I believe that is where his family used to  be from--and in the  [[Page H7423]]  south, we have major population. But no new reservoirs.   Now we have got challenges where cities are actually running out of  water, but it is not that we don't have enough water. In those wet  years, we can save it. We can even pump it out of the ground to bring  it back out. But in California, at times they care more about a fish  and the water goes out to the ocean.   Now, we talk about desalinization. So we would spend billions of  dollars to create a desalinization plant for the freshwater we put into  the ocean to make it saltwater to bring it back into freshwater.   Why wouldn't we just store more water for those dry years?   We have worked on this issue for quite some time. We actually think  the greatest return on investment would be to just lift Shasta Dam, the  reservoir. If you simply enlarged it, it could store more.   We got to a bipartisan bill, the WIIN Act, working with Dianne  Feinstein. It passed this House with big numbers. It passed the Senate  with more than 70 votes.   But you know what happened after it passed?   Speaker Pelosi and other Democrats fought it, actually killed the  ability that California could determine their own destiny.   And now today we come down, and this is supposed to be a wildfire  bill. In my State, we have wildfires all the time. We have one raging  right now. We have a very large one in Yosemite.   Also in California, we are blessed to be the only State in the world  that grows giant sequoias. You all know that iconic tree. You all know  and have seen it before. It grows for 2,000 to 3,000 years. History  tells us that the only major time we have ever seen a giant sequoia die  was in 1297 from a fire. Normally they just die because they get so  large and they topple over.   But do you realize in the last 2 years we have lost 20 percent of all  the giant sequoias? There is a warning right now that we can lose them  all just in the next couple years. Firefighters right now are risking  their lives to protect them.   But you know what? This body can be very proud of the fact that there  is a bipartisan bill, Save Our Sequoias, with the same number of  Democrats and Republicans on that piece of legislation. They would go  into these groves, clean out, and protect them where firefighters  wouldn't have to risk their lives, or even when fires came, these giant  sequoias would continue to live.   It has been introduced. How did that bill get introduced?   Because a bipartisan group went to the giant sequoias, studied what  needed to happen, and came together. Everybody didn't get what they  want, but at the end of the day they could save the giant sequoias.   You know what is not in this bill?   Save Our Sequoias.   This is a wildfire bill that won't even save the sequoias, even  though the President talked about this just last week, that it was a  big concern to him.   Why wouldn't it get put in?   It is not that it hasn't been through committee because the committee  won't bring it up. But that is not the pattern of the Democrats. It  doesn't matter if a bill has been through committee or not; they will  drop anything in.   This is a bill that both sides agree upon. I have to give credit to  the Democrats--Congressmen Peters, Panetta, Costa, and others--who went  to the giant sequoias to study the issue to know what needs to happen,  to work toward it, and save them.   Why would we want to destroy them?   Why would we not use this opportunity and put it in this bill?   Is it because it is bipartisan?   Can you only bring bills to the floor that are partisan?   It is interesting when my constituents ask--all the challenges on  this floor, when my constituents were going to ask me about a  firefighter bill to help save our forests, but it would eliminate 610  firefighters?   Only a Democrat Congress could think that is a wildfire bill, that  you are going to eliminate 610 firefighters.   How is that going to protect them more?   It is only in this Congress that you could have a bill that is called  the American Rescue Plan that creates inflation.   It is only in the American Rescue Plan that you could tell the  American public, can you afford to lose a month's salary?   No one will say yes, but that is exactly what you took from them.  That is what inflation has done.   This bill is needed, not the bill you have written, but on this  issue. You have Save the Sequoias, it is a crisis before us, and you  will not even put it in the bill when it is bipartisan.   I cannot imagine that you would bring a bill forward that would  eliminate firefighters that we need when we are on fire.   And I cannot imagine that you wouldn't work to build more reservoirs  so people can store water in the wet years so it will be there in the  dry years.
