 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my  remarks, Senator Whitehouse of Rhode Island be recognized.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, the addiction epidemic is a national  emergency that takes far too many lives and destroys too many families  across the country. Unfortunately, my State, in some ways, leads the  way. Four thousand Ohioans died from drug overdoses last year, more  than any State in the United States. Four thousand families lost a  mother, a father, a daughter, a son, a sister, or brother.   We need to treat this epidemic like the public health emergency it  is. We asked the President to proclaim it a public health emergency. He  talked about it but still hasn't done it.   That is the same reason I can't support Representative Tom Marino's  nomination to head our country's drug control policy. First of all,  fundamentally, I don't want an elected official, a politician, in that  position. I want somebody from the treatment community. Congressman  Marino is a nominee who, in his time in Congress, showed he was too  cozy with the drug companies that helped create this epidemic.   Earlier today, President Trump responded to reports about Congressman  Marino and said he is looking at those reports very closely. I hope he  does. I hope he withdraws that nomination. Make no mistake, Congressman  Marino does not want to take us in the right direction in this fight.   Today I was in Austintown--a township on the edge of Youngstown, in  Mahoning County--talking to Officer Toth and Chief Gavalier at the  Austintown Police Department about the opioid crisis. It is coming up  on Drug Take Back Day, where on Saturday all over the country, the DEA  is asking police departments to allow people to bring their unused  drugs in to get them out of the medicine cabinets. We were talking  about much more than that. We were talking about how State governments  and the Federal Government haven't stepped up the way we should to  partner on prevention and education in medication-assisted therapy  treatment and all the things we should be doing.   Mr. Marino seems to think we arrest our way out of this problem, but  that is not what law enforcement officials across this country are  saying. Detective Toth and I didn't talk about arresting people's  children and arresting parents. We talked about how to promote the  Department's Drug Take Back Day.   Addiction isn't an individual problem or a character flaw; it is a  chronic disease. We need someone running our drug policy who  understands that, not someone who simply wants to pull patients out of  treatment in the middle of an epidemic. We know what that was about  when on this floor, not much more than a month ago, only by one vote  were we able to preserve the treatment that so many opioid-addicted  people are getting. Right now, in my State, 200,000 Ohioans are getting  opioid treatment because they have insurance under the Affordable Care  Act.   We need the enforcement piece. That is why I have introduced the  bipartisan INTERDICT Act and why I have worked with Senator Portman on  this to make sure we have resources for Customs and Border Protection  agents to screen packages effectively and safely before they reach our  neighborhood.   It has been more than 8 weeks since President Trump promised a  national disaster declaration. We have yet to see a strategy from the  White House. Other than a nominee who thinks one locks people up to  defeat the opioid epidemic, we have seen no strategy from the White  House to deal with the epidemic. Ohio families cannot afford to wait.    Let me close with this. A few months ago, I was in Cincinnati, at the  Talbert House, and I met with a father who was there with his 30-year- old daughter. He told me that his daughter would not be there right  now, that she would not still be alive, if it were not for Medicaid and  the treatment for addiction that she received because of it.   We know what we have to do to deal with this epidemic. I ask the  President to do the right thing, and I ask the Senate to do the right  thing and move forward. It is the biggest public health emergency in  our lifetimes. We need the people who are in charge of our drug control  policy to treat it that way.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.    Mr. President, today I wish to honor Mr. Ronald K.  Lorentzen, a dedicated public servant who has spent his career  advocating for American workers and businesses. Mr. Lorentzen retired  on June 30, 2017, after more than three decades of government service.   Born in the blue-collar town of Ashtabula, OH--a great hometown, as  my wife Connie can attest--Mr. Lorentzen's roots are evident in his  life's work. Too often, especially in trade policy, representatives and  policymakers fail to live up to the promises they have made to working  families, but not Mr. Lorentzen. He never forgot where he came from,  and he never forgot the workers who are too often left behind by our  trade policy.   In his roles at the International Trade Administration, he has been a  leader in our government's efforts to combat unfair trade practices and  hold countries that cheat the rules accountable. He served as lead  negotiator for the U.S. and chairman of the Steel Committee at the  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, where he worked  to address steel overcapacity within the U.S. Market. While we know we  have a lot more work to do to create a truly level playing field for  our steel industry, his work helped shape a more fair international  steel market for American companies.   In addition, Mr. Lorentzen led U.S. delegations before the North  American Steel Trade Committee, NASTC. He helped ensure the NASTC  fulfilled its mission as a forum for NAFTA steel countries to build  consensus and develop united positions on areas of common concern. A  firm grasp of the facts and diplomatic skill made him a strong and  effective advocate for U.S. manufacturers.   Through his many roles in government, Mr. Lorentzen has served this  country and its working families. He has stood up for workers in my  State, and his efforts have helped save jobs. When we enforce our trade  policies and hold accountable those who cheat the international trade  system, we are ensuring our workers and businesses have access to a  level playing field. Mr. Lorentzen has been a leader in that fight.   Mr. Lorentzen will be remembered for his compassion, work ethic, and  integrity. I ask my Senate colleges to join me in thanking him for his  service and wishing him all the best on his retirement.                            ____________________
