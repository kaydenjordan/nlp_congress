 Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank my colleague, Mr.  Levin, for his leadership on this amendment.   I have been invested in this issue throughout my time in Congress,  and earlier this year my Republican colleague, Chris Smith, and I  introduced the Atlantic Seismic Airgun Protection Act, a standalone  bill that would amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to prohibit  oil, gas, and methane hydrate-related seismic activities in the North  Atlantic, Mid-Atlantic, South Atlantic, and Straits of Florida. This  amendment would do just that.   Our coastal economy relies on healthy ocean ecosystems that generate  $95 billion in gross domestic product every year and support nearly 1.4  million jobs every year.   Seismic blasting poses a major threat to marine life, including the  critically endangered North Atlantic right whale, which is on the verge  of extinction. Because they are extremely loud, these dynamite-like  blasts are likely to have significant, long-lasting, widespread impacts  on the behavior and survival of fish and marine mammal populations. If  these are impacted, it is a serious danger to our coastal economies.   This amendment will protect our marine life and our coastal  economies, and I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this  amendment.
