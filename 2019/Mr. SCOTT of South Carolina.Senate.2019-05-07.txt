 Madam President, as a member of  the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, it is my  privilege to honor a South Carolina small business during the U.S.  Small Business Administration's National Small Business Week. In my  State, small business owners work hard to contribute to our local  economy and serve South Carolina communities. Today, it is my honor to  recognize VetFriends of Mount Pleasant, SC, as the Senate Small  Business of the Day.   Dale Sutcliffe, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran of Desert Storm, founded  VetFriends nearly 20 years ago with the mission of reuniting veterans.  Following his service, Dale realized the benefit that a national  registry of veterans could have and quickly set up a platform where  veterans can reconnect with their fellow servicemembers during their  time serving our country. The VetFriends platform has over 2.5 million  members and has brought together thousands of veterans with their  former associates. In the process, the platform has helped veterans  share stories and photos, as well as stay informed about upcoming  reunions and events. Currently, the business employs over 25 South  Carolinians, and almost all have a close relative or partner who is  enlisted or has served.   The team at VetFriends has a longstanding tradition of supporting the  veteran community and are regularly seen volunteering at the Ralph H.  Johnson VA Medical Center. Additionally, the business has taken an  active role working with the Wounded Warrior Project and the Patriots  Point Naval and Maritime Museum in Charleston. It is clear that  VetFriend's values and goals not only enhance their business plan but  also improve the community that they belong to.   As we highlight the role that small businesses play throughout this  week, it is my pleasure to honor the hard work that VetFriends is doing  in the great State of South Carolina. They are a tremendous example of  the way small businesses create innovative solutions, as well as give  back to the community; I wish them nothing but success in their future  endeavors.                            ____________________
