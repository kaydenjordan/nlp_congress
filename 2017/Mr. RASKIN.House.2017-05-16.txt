 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in strong support of H.R. 510, the Rapid DNA Act of 2017. I  also want to salute Mr. Sensenbrenner for his hard work on it.   This bipartisan legislation would integrate Rapid DNA technology into  the FBI's Combined DNA Index System, popularly known as CODIS, to  enable law enforcement to perform valuable investigative functions  faster and more efficiently.   DNA technology is a valuable, dynamic, and rapidly unfolding element  of our criminal justice system. DNA technology helps us to identify  suspects, eliminate false suspects, exonerate the innocent, and  ultimately to convict responsible perpetrators of crime. My State of  Maryland is home to the first capital prisoner in the United States who  was exonerated while in prison for a homicide with DNA technology.   CODIS and the National DNA Index System play a critical role across  the country in criminal investigations by Federal, State, and local law  enforcement agencies. Rapid DNA involves a fully automated, hands-free  process designed to produce a DNA profile within minutes at the booking  stage outside of a crime lab.   Existing law does not provide for the inclusion of Rapid DNA analyses  into CODIS. H.R. 510 would bridge the gap between Rapid DNA technology  and CODIS by authorizing law enforcement to conduct Rapid DNA analyses  and upload the results to the national index, as long as the Rapid DNA  machines that are used are accredited. This adds a real-time layer to  CODIS and saves us all significant time and resources, improving  efficiency in the criminal justice process.   H.R. 510 has significant practical and positive consequences for law  enforcement and for public safety. For example, Detroit, as of this  April, has tested approximately 10,000 backlogged sexual assault kits.  As a result, there have been more than 2,600 DNA matches, including  CODIS hits; the identification of nearly 800 potential serial rapists;  92 convictions obtained by the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office; and  DNA crimes linked to 40 other States and the District of Columbia.   The addition of Rapid DNA information to the CODIS database will help  identify serial rapists if matches are made to the lab analyses of the  sexual assault kit samples.   I hope that the use of Rapid DNA will allow other DNA labs to focus  more of their resources on reducing the backlog  [[Page H4205]]  of untested sexual assault kits across the country. My home State of  Maryland has 3,700 untested rape kits right now, according to a report  done last year.   Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to join the chairman and those of  us in the minority in supporting this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   The Rapid DNA Act is strongly supported by several organizations  which know that the expanded use and availability of Rapid DNA will  enhance public safety by reducing the DNA backlog, reducing violent  crime, and allowing law enforcement to investigate crimes and identify  suspects with greater efficiency and accuracy. The organizations  include the National Center for Victims of Crime; the Police  Foundation, which works to improve policing through innovation and  science; and the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association.                                time  1615    Mr. Speaker, in the case that I referred to before, the Bloodsworth  case from Maryland, this was a gentleman who was convicted of a grisly  rape and murder of a 9-year-old girl. He swore he hadn't done it. He  was convicted. In court he swore every day that he was the wrong guy.   When DNA technology was first unveiled, he read about it. He begged  his lawyer who is now the chief judge on the D.C. Superior Court, Judge  Morin, to get the DNA test done. That lawyer took $5,000 out of his own  pocket to do the DNA test, and it came back with greater than 99  percent certainty it could not have been Bloodsworth.   Then the DNA evidence provided an exact match to a prisoner who was a  floor below Bloodsworth at the time. So they found the right guy, and  he was about to get out of prison a few months later.   The DNA evidence establishes an extraordinary new era that we are in  in terms of criminal justice, and I am proud to be supporting this  legislation that Mr. Sensenbrenner has brought forward, which I think  will improve accuracy and efficiency all around. I applaud his efforts  and the efforts of our chairman to ensure the integrity and the quality  of the analysis that will be used in the criminal justice system.   I urge all of our colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 510 today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise in support of H.R. 1616, the Strengthening  State and Local Cyber Crime Fighting Act. This bill establishes the  National Computer Forensics Institute as an official Federal program to  be managed by the Department of Homeland Security and operated by the  U.S. Secret Service. I strongly support it because it addresses a  serious problem and advances a solution that is critically important to  the safety of our people.   Cybercrime poses an enormous threat to national security, economic  prosperity, and public safety. The range of threats and the challenges  that they present for law enforcement multiply just as rapidly as  technology evolves, causing serious insecurity in the personal lives,  the work lives, and the finances of our people.   Over the past decade, our law enforcement community has recorded a  significant increase in the quantity, quality, complexity, and danger  of sophisticated cybercrimes targeting private industry, including our  financial services sector and private individuals. These crimes include  intrusions; hacking attacks; the surreptitious installation of  malicious software; identity theft; and massive data breaches that have  compromised and exposed the personal, financial, business, medical, and  professional information of millions of U.S. citizens.   How many of our people have suffered the disruption, indignity, and  anxiety of identity theft, for example?   For Americans who have been victimized by cybercrime, especially our  seniors, it is a terrifying and demoralizing experience. For small  businesses affected, it is costly and enormously draining.   Just as cyber warfare has transformed the nature of war in this  century, cybercrime has transformed the nature of crime, adversely  affecting the members of our law enforcement and intelligence services.   To date, the National Computer Forensics Institute has risen to the  occasion, training more than 4,000 State and local law enforcement  officers and 1,600 prosecutors. With this legislation, the institute  will continue to educate State and local law enforcement officials,  prosecutors, and judges on current trends in cyber and electronic crime  investigations and best practices taken across the country. The  institute will train officers on proper procedures to conduct these  important investigations that are affecting more and more Americans  every year.   In addition, the National Computer Forensics Institute will continue  to work to protect our citizens' personal information from unwarranted  governmental intrusion by establishing national standards for  conducting these investigations. The institute will protect these  important privacy interests along with the security of our businesses,  our homes, our finances, and our personal effects.   For these reasons, I proudly support H.R. 1616.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me time.  Just to close, I want to echo Congressman Ratcliffe in observing it is  National Police Week, so we have the opportunity to highlight the  successful efforts that have already taken place to combat cybercrime.   As the operator of the National Computer Forensics Institute, the  Secret Service has demonstrated its excellence and diligence in  pursuing cybercrime both domestically and internationally. Its  investigations have produced more than 4,000 arrests, involving more  than a billion dollars in fraud, and saving the public billions of  dollars more in potential fraud that would have taken place absent  their intervention.   H.R. 1616 will strengthen these efforts in continuing to combat cyber  and electronic crime.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise also in support of H.R. 1892, the Honoring Hometown Heroes  Act. I want to begin by saluting the distinguished author of this  legislation, the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson), who has  navigated the twists and turns of the legislative process to bring this  legislation to the floor with the Committee on the Judiciary.   H.R. 1892 would bestow one of the highest honors that can be given in  America to our first responders who have died in the line of duty by  allowing the U.S. flag to be lowered in their respective jurisdictions.  The bill amends the U.S. Flag Code to allow the Governor of a State,  Territory or possession, and the Mayor of the District of Columbia to  order the flag be lowered to halfstaff if a first responder in the  jurisdiction dies while serving in the line of duty.   Our first responders put their lives on the line every day for the  greater good of the people that they have taken an oath to serve and  protect. Every year, some first responders make the ultimate sacrifice  and lose their lives while serving and protecting their communities in  the line of duty.   Currently, under the U.S. Flag Code, a Governor or the Mayor of the  District of Columbia can order that the flag be lowered to halfstaff  after the death of a President or former government official or after  the death of a member of the Armed Forces from the jurisdiction. It is  only fitting that, given the hard work and sacrifices and crucial role  of first responders, we honor these brave men and women in the same way  that we honor government officials and members of the Armed Forces when  they make the ultimate sacrifice. Accordingly, I urge all of my  colleagues to support H.R. 1892.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I encourage all of my colleagues to support this wonderful  legislation, and I take the occasion of National Police Week to restate  everyone in this body's appreciation for the hard work that our  responders and our officers do.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 1428, the American Law Enforcement  Heroes Act of 2017. I want to thank the author of the bill, Mr. Hurd,  for bringing it forward.   This measure has the laudable goal of recognizing our brave men and  women who have served in the armed services, but it also helps to  protect our communities through community-oriented policing.   I support H.R. 1428 for several reasons. To begin with, the Office of  Community Oriented Policing Services, also known as the COPS Office, is  responsible for advancing community policing by law enforcement  agencies through information and grant resources.   The COPS Office promotes community policing with a commitment to  building trust and mutual respect between police and the people in the  communities they serve by awarding grants to law enforcement agencies  for the hiring of law enforcement officers for community policing.   Through the COPS Hiring Program, funds are provided directly to law  enforcement agencies to hire or rehire career law enforcement officers  to increase their community policing capacity and crime prevention  activities. To date, more than 129,000 officers for over 13,000  agencies have been funded via the COPS Hiring Program, which was first  established 23 years ago under President Bill Clinton in 1994.   The COPS Office began supporting military veterans through the COPS  Hiring Program and currently gives additional consideration to law  enforcement agencies that commit to hiring our veterans. Although we  have not had hearings to discuss the import of providing incentives  through this program for the hiring of veterans as new law enforcement  officers by State and local law enforcement, we believe the bill is  well designed and well intentioned.   The bill prioritizes grant applications of law enforcement agencies  that will use grant funds from the COPS Office to hire veterans,  thereby giving preference to those agencies when applying for grant  funds. The intent is to assist law enforcement agencies in attracting  well-qualified, service-oriented people who have already served America  through their military service.   Another positive purpose of this legislation is to provide our brave  veterans the opportunity to continue to serve their country and  respective communities upon completion of their military service.  Military service provides vital leadership traits that can be valuable  in assisting military veterans in their effort to succeed in law  enforcement careers, and we need to take advantage of that.   Veterans with combat experience have obtained skill sets that relate  to law enforcement work, such as discipline, loyalty, ethical  standards, and integrity; physical fitness; firearms and tactical  skills; the ability to respond appropriately under stress; and  experience working with diverse populations.   Those who have served in the military often have a desire to continue  to serve others, and a career as a law enforcement officer allows  veterans to continue serving others through community policing, where  we need them so much. A career in law enforcement also provides  veterans with long-term stability, gives a sense of accomplishment and  pride, and offers a career where their dedication to protecting and  serving the public can be applied.   Finally, measures such as H.R. 1428 will help ensure our communities  are protected through community-oriented policing.   Accordingly, we support passage of H.R. 1428, the American Law  Enforcement Heroes Act.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I close by restating my support for this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
