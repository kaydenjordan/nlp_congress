 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and legacy of  Jeannette Rankin, whose groundbreaking career in Congress a century ago  paved the way for all of my female colleagues standing here today.   Jeannette Rankin was persistent, driven, and fearless.   She came to the House of Representatives before women even had the  right to vote in this country.   Jeannette Rankin's voice in Congress was instrumental for women's  suffrage. She knew how to get things done, opening the first House  floor debate on women's right to vote in 1918.   And she stayed true to her convictions throughout her life,  advocating for peace.   Today my fellow female Members of Congress and I stand together to  honor trailblazers like Jeannette Rankin, whose bravery and  determination opened the doors for women in the United States and  throughout the world.                            ____________________
