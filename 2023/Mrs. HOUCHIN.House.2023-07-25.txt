 Mr. Speaker, last month, back home in Sellersburg,  Indiana, Silver Creek High School's baseball team made history by  winning the program's first-ever class 3A State title.   It is truly an honor and a privilege to recognize Silver Creek High  School on the House floor. This is not only an impressive victory, but  a testament to the guidance and leadership of Coach Joe Decker and his  coaching staff who worked diligently to mold these young men not only  into State champions--but future leaders.   I hope Coach Decker enjoys this well-deserved retirement.   The players' countless hours of practice, preparation, and teamwork  has finally paid off and will, without a doubt, inspire future  generations of players and coaches to strive for both excellence and  good sportsmanship. They have not only made their school proud but the  entire community and their Congresswoman.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward with great anticipation to see what they  will accomplish next.   I congratulate them, once again, on their first-ever State  championship win. I am sure it won't be their last.                        Activist Proposals at the SEC     Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Financial  Services Committee, a member of the ESG Working Group, and the  Representative of the Ninth District of Indiana, I can say with  certainty that we need the Securities and Exchange Commission to be  transparent and accountable to the American people.   In my work with committee, one issue I have been particularly focused  on is the shareholder proposal process. In the current system,  activists can persistently resubmit similar far-left proposals year  after year despite those proposals being previously rejected by a  majority of shareholders.   This shift in focus toward advancing environmental, social, and  political policies distracts from the primary purpose of our public  markets which is to enable companies to raise capital, foster economic  growth, and provide a return on investment for everyday investors.   The SEC's recent proposals would make this problem worse by allowing  more and more politically motivated shareholder proposals to be  considered.   This busy work provides no benefit to business.   So why would we allow these already decided upon political topics to  plague our boardrooms?   It is simply not fair to companies, including the ones across my  district, to have to continuously invest resources in fighting or  litigating activist proposals that clearly do not benefit the company  or its shareholders, especially when similar proposals have already  been rejected.   The SEC proposals defy logic and sound investment strategy. That is  why last week I introduced the No Expensive, Stifling Governance Act,  or  [[Page H3904]]  the No ESG Act, as the very first bill of its kind to be introduced in  Congress.   The No ESG Act would stop this burdensome rule from being enacted and  help put an end to redundant and onerous shareholder proposals.   More specifically, for companies listening back home, this would  address the SEC's proposed amendments on rule 14a-8.   While the current system benefits a small group of activists over  everyday investors, this proposed rule would increase the burden on  shareholders and businesses and divert attention away from the issues  that actually matter.   The bottom line is that southern Indiana companies shouldn't be  forced to become political platforms where politics overshadow sound  financial decisionmaking.   When I said that my priority was to improve the financial landscape  for the Ninth District, I meant it. Accomplishing that depends heavily  on putting forth legislation that would make a real difference, and the  No ESG Act is that kind of legislation.   I am glad to be contending on behalf of the State of Indiana to solve  this problem that has been overlooked for far too long.                            ____________________
