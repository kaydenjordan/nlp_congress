 Mr. President, I wish to start by congratulating my  colleague from Wyoming on reporting out this legislation on water  infrastructure and, particularly, for the help he has given us with  regard to the Great Lakes. What the Senator has done to help us to  maintain and to protect the Great Lakes is very much appreciated. It is  the No. 1 tourist destination in Ohio, and there is a $6 billion  fishing industry in the Great Lakes, with Lake Erie being the No. 1  lake for fishing.   The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative the Senator supported is  incredibly important, as well as keeping the dredge material out of the  lake and helping us with the Army Corps. We thank the Senator. We also  hope to keep invasive species out of the lake, including bighead carp,  which would ruin that $6 billion fishing industry. We thank the Senator  for his support. We look forward to getting that bill to the floor soon  for a vote.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
