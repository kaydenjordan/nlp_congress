 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, the COVID-19 pandemic has hammered every section of  our economy. Small businesses have been hit the hardest; and among  small businesses, restaurants have been crushed. An estimated 90,000  restaurants have permanently closed.   These are cornerstones of our communities and the linchpin of our  economy. If more restaurants close, then more workers will be out of  work, and transitioning to a new job will be a challenge for many of  those workers. Now is not the time to abandon small businesses.  [[Page H4411]]    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
