 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to draw attention  to Puerto Rico Act 22 and echo the concerns of many, including my  constituents, about this tax loophole.   Because of Act 22, Puerto Rico is the only place in the world where a  mainland U.S. citizen can move and not pay a dime in Federal capital  gains or income tax without renouncing their citizenship.   Act 22 was sold as an economic boost in the shadow of a recession,  but that is not what has happened.   Millionaires and billionaires are flocking to the island to avoid  paying taxes. A cottage industry of tax professionals and CPAs has  emerged to support these tax evaders.   Crypto magnates, real estate speculators, and internet influencers,  like Logan Paul, are part of a new generation of gentrifiers driving up  costs and displacing Puerto Ricans.   I am pleased that the IRS is cracking down on related fraud. Thanks  to my colleagues' efforts, Federal investigations on the impacts of  these policies have begun. Act 22 is part of a larger story, and it  should be repealed.                            ____________________
