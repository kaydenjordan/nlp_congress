 Mr. President, I think it is important to understand what  just happened today that makes this debate on Scott Pruitt to lead the  EPA so critically important. We call ourselves the world's greatest  deliberative body, and that is actually a well-earned reputation.  Sometimes we move slowly. Sometimes we move so slowly that it is  maddening for both parties and for the American public. There is a  reason that the Senate moves slowly. It is because in a lot of  instances it has the weightiest decisions that any public official  could ever make. In this instance, we are deciding on the person to  comply with the Clean Air and the Clean Water Acts, the Endangered  Species Act, to discharge their duties as the leader of the EPA.   Something happened today that changes this whole debate. In Federal  law, there is something called FOIA, the public records law regarding  Federal officials. Most State laws have some kind of open records law,  and Oklahoma is no different. There was a lawsuit against the Oklahoma  attorney general, Scott Pruitt, and it basically said: Listen, you have  to disclose the emails between your office and a bunch of energy  industry companies. And the context here is absolutely important. Scott  Pruitt is not just a person who is bad on the issue of climate; this is  a person who is a professional climate denier. This is a person who has  made his bones, politically and professionally, trying to undermine all  the authorities the EPA possesses. This is a person who is a plaintiff  in multiple lawsuits, as the Oklahoma attorney general, against the  EPA. This is a person who has not promised to recuse himself when he is  running the EPA. So imagine that there are going to be pending lawsuits  where he was the plaintiff, and they are going to still be before the  EPA. He was asked in committee whether he would recuse himself, because  obviously it is preposterous to be both the plaintiff and the defendant  in a lawsuit. It just stands to reason. He did not promise to recuse  himself.   So this is a person who has an incredibly close, uncomfortably close  working relationship with the fossil fuel industry. He may have that as  a sincerely held belief, but the Oklahoma State law requires that he  disclose whom he is working with. Why is that relevant? Well, he  actually had a couple of instances where he has taken language given to  him, sent to him by email from oil companies, and he just copied it-- select all, copy, drop it, paste it--onto Oklahoma attorney general  letterhead, and then transmitted it to the EPA as if it were from the  AG's office in Oklahoma. So that is the context.   What did this Federal judge say today? An Oklahoma County district  court judge said that according to the Oklahoma Open Records Act-- Aletia Haynes Timmons from the district court of Oklahoma instructed  Pruitt's office to hand over the emails by close of business next  Tuesday.   So here we are, trying to jam through this nomination, and now it  makes perfect sense why they wanted to run the clock. They had  congressional delegation trips to Munich for the security conference.  There were Republicans who were planning to meet with NATO allies.  There was another overseas trip of great import. Yet they abandon all  other obligations, all other objectives, and they are bound and  determined to run this clock until 1 p.m. tomorrow because they need to  vote before these emails become disclosed. Tuesday is when we will see  these emails. Yet we seem to be in a  [[Page S1276]]  race to get this vote done tomorrow at 1 p.m. Something feels wrong  about this. Something feels like they are worried about the contents of  those emails.   Gosh, I hope I am wrong. I hope on Tuesday that these emails are  perfunctory, professional, proper. I hope I am wrong. I hope my fears  and suspicions about what may be in those emails are unfounded. But  here we are in the so-called world's greatest deliberative body, and we  decided we don't even need another 2 business days to deliberate or to  gather more information.   This is a decision that will stick for 4 years. This is a nominee who  will run one of the most important Federal agencies that there is, the  one in charge of clean air and clean water. The person in charge of  clean air and clean water has been corresponding with oil and gas and  coal companies--nothing necessarily illegal or untoward about that, but  he seems to not want people to know what the content of that  correspondence was.   The context here is very, very important, and that is why I am asking  that we delay this vote until every Member of the Senate can read and  review these emails. I think it is very important that we understand  what is in the contents of those emails because there are some things  we know about Mr. Pruitt. I am going to try really hard not to impugn  his personal motivation. I have no doubt he feels sincerely about the  issues we are arguing about. I don't have any reason to believe he has  personally done anything improper. But I think it is totally reasonable  for us to just see what is in those emails next Tuesday.   This isn't that we are trying to drag this out for 6 weeks or 6  months. This isn't that we are trying to cook up an issue. I didn't  know about these emails, actually, until Monday. I didn't know there  was a court case. I was perfectly ready to say: Look, it looks like  they have the votes. We will have our argument. Maybe we can persuade a  couple of people--certainly Susan Collins has been a profile in courage  here, and there are Members of the Senate on the Republican side who  have been on the right side of climate. But you know what, all that  gets washed away. All that gets washed away because you don't get to be  on the right side of climate and vote for a climate denier for the  Environmental Protection Agency.   And lest you think I am being a little bit overheated here in terms  of who Scott Pruitt is, this is what Scott Pruitt has said about  himself. He describes himself as a leading advocate against the EPA's  agenda. On the role of the EPA he says:         I believe that the EPA has a role to play in our Republican       form of government. Air and water quality issues can cross       State lines, and can sometimes require Federal intervention.       At the same time, the EPA was never intended to be our       Nation's frontline environmental regulator.    That is kind of a well-put-together statement, but I want you to  understand how radical of a statement that is, because the EPA was  designed to be the Nation's frontline environmental regulation.   The basic premise is that there are certain things that can be done  at the local level that ought to be done at the local level. When we  configured our governments, we decided we want police forces and  firehouses and other municipal services--sewer and water, and trash  pickup--certain things get done locally. Some things get done at the  county level. Some things get done at the State level. And what we have  decided as a nation is that because pollution doesn't recognize  municipal, State, or even Federal boundaries, that we actually need  Federal law to make sure that if one State is polluting, it doesn't  move over to the other State. So the idea that the EPA was never  intended to be our Nation's frontline environmental regulator, which is  what Mr. Pruitt says, is actually quite radical. It is an intentional  misunderstanding of what the EPA is for. It is intended to be our  frontline environmental regulator.   Here is Mr. Pruitt on climate change:         Global warming has inspired one of the major policy debates       of our time. That debate is far from settled. Scientists       continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global       warming and its connections to the actions of mankind. That       debate should be encouraged in classrooms, public forums and       the halls of Congress.    I have to hand it to Mr. Pruitt--he magnificently describes radical  policies as though they are not radical. He is very skillful at that.  He is very lawyerly at that.   He did very well, in my view, in the EPW Committee, but his views are  essentially that the EPA is not the frontline in terms of protecting  clean air and clean water, and that blows up the mission of the EPA.   I see the Senator from Rhode Island is here. I would be happy to  entertain any questions he may have in a moment.   A couple more quotes from Mr. Pruitt on the Clean Power Plan:         The president could announce the most ``state-friendly''       plan possible, but it would not change the fact that the       administration does not have the legal authority under the       Clean Air Act to regulate carbon emissions.    ``[T]hat the administration does not have the legal authority for  regulate carbon emissions.'' Wrong. Factually wrong. Legally wrong.  This has been settled. Massachusetts v. EPA. I left my law degree in my  apartment, but I know Massachusetts v. EPA, and I know this is flat  wrong. So what he says is totally radical. He is a skillful guy. I  assume he is a good guy, but he wants to undermine the basic  authorities of the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act.   I will finish with this quote before I yield for a question from the  Senator from Rhode Island on methane regulation.         My concern is that the EPA is employing its flawed       methodology in order to rationalize new and unjustified       federal regulations to solve a methane emissions problem that       simply does not exist.    That has no basis in fact.   I see the Senator from Rhode Island. Before I yield for his question,  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a colloquy with the  Senators from Rhode Island and Oregon.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Rhode  Island, if he is ready.    Well, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island. I think one  of the great challenges is that it is one thing to misunderstand the  EPA's role here; that is dangerous enough as the attorney general of a  State or the head of the Republican Attorneys General Association. But  when you are in the EPA and you have charge to administer the law, to  discharge your duties under Federal law, to the degree and extent that  you misunderstand the authorities in the Clean Air Act as either weaker  than they may be or sort of optional--I mean, this is the issue in  Massachusetts v. EPA.   For instance, the question around carbon was resolved. There were a  couple of questions. First of all, is carbon an airborne pollutant? The  Supreme Court and the EPA made their finding, and they determined that  it was an airborne pollutant.   Once you determine that something is an airborne pollutant, it is not  for the EPA, on a discretionary basis, to try to regulate that airborne  pollutant. They are then required under Federal law to regulate that  pollutant.   So part of the misunderstanding here is the question isn't, Is the  EPA authorized to regulate carbon? It is, Are they required to regulate  carbon? So he has it wrong doubly--first of all, on the law and second  of all, on the science.   I think the danger of putting someone like that in a position of  authority  [[Page S1277]]  is that they will preempt States, California and others--although  California has some pretty significant carve-outs--but they will at  least attempt to preempt the States from doing what they want to do to  protect their clean air and their clean water.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Well, I thank the Senator for that question. It is a  really important one because essentially what Scott Pruitt is saying  is: Hey, let's let the States handle this. But if you are to take him  at his word, I think it is not unreasonable to say: Well how did you  handle enforcement of either State or Federal environmental law as the  top cop in the State of Oklahoma? Right?   He did two things that would cause everybody to question his  commitment to even local environmental protection. The first thing he  did when he came in as Oklahoma AG--a lot of offices the attorney  general have environmental protection units. It is like a big law firm.  They have different units that handle different kinds of crime. They  have a civil division; they have a criminal division. They do lots of  things. One of the divisions is to enforce environmental law. He  disbanded it. He disbanded the State attorney general's division that  enforces environmental law. Then he beefed up this thing that did not  exist until he got there, which was essentially a division to undermine  Federal authorities.   So you are right. He has them coming and going. He is making an  argument that the State should be empowered to enforce environmental  law. At least we could take that as kind of on-the-level federalism. We  have some good Republican colleagues who just really believe that the  government that governs least governs best. They think that local  problems should be solved at the local level, even though, in my view,  when it comes to air pollution and water pollution, that is essentially  preposterous because pollution moves.   I really believe that for some of these Members it is a sincerely  held belief. It is hard to believe this attorney general when he says:  Hey, give us the authority to enforce our environmental laws, and then,  when the rubber hits the road--which is how many lawyers you put on the  job, how many cops you put on the beat--he basically eviscerates the  division that enforces environmental law, and he beefs up this division  that is basically a little shop that sues the EPA to undermine the  Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act federally.    Well, I think the Senator is right. You know, it is fair  to look at his record. It is also fair to look at his words. In 2016-- so this is not 10 years ago; this is less than a year ago--he said:  Legislation should not be ``we like clean air, so go make clean air.''  It is something that bothers me, that Congress then gives this general  grant of authority to EPA.   Congress has given a general grant of authority to the EPA. That is  what the law says. So, my concern, when it comes to Mr. Pruitt, is that  he understands, as a member of the bar, as an attorney general, what  the law says. He has been operating in a political context, I think it  is fair to say, as the head of the Republican Attorneys General  Association. Working with energy companies, he has been very aggressive  in cultivating friends across the country who are very enthusiastic  about his nomination and potential confirmation.   But he totally misunderstands the mission of the EPA. It is granted  by the Congress, a general authority to enforce clean air. That is what  the EPA is, really; it is clean air, and it is clean water. That is  what the EPA is about.   The thing I think is especially troubling for me when it comes to the  politics of this, is that there was a bipartisan consensus for many,  many, many years around the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. I  believe the reauthorization of the Clean Air Act came under President  George H.W. Bush. This used to be not very controversial because,  actually, we can fight about the Iran deal, we can fight about women's  reproductive health, we can fight about LGBT rights, we can fight about  civil rights, we can even fight about foreign policy and the size and  scope of the government, but even if you are an extremely conservative  individual, you ought to believe, to the extent that we have government  at all, that it should be responsible for keeping us safe and that it  is a Federal role to make sure our air is clean and our water is clean.   So this person who is very skillful in kind of eluding--you know, he  basically dodged punches in that EPW Committee. We have some very  skillful members on the EPW committee. They are very knowledgeable,  very passionate. It was rough, but he was able to avoid a sort of  knockout blow. The reason is that he is a professional climate denier.  This is what this guy has been training to do all of his life.   So, again: We like clean air, so go make clean air. That is something  that bothers me.   The Congress then gives a general grant of authority to EPA on the  Oklahoma environmental regulations. He said: Federal regional haze  standards--if you live in Oklahoma, I understand. You did not vote for  Barack Obama, but I don't think you thought you were voting to reduce  air quality. So he says that Federal regional haze standards threaten  the competitive edge Oklahomans have enjoyed for years with low-cost  and reliable electric generation.  [[Page S1278]]  This low-cost energy not only benefits Oklahoma manufacturers, but  gives the State a considerable edge in recruiting jobs. He is the  attorney general. He is supposed to enforce the law. I mean, that  sounds like a Member of Congress. That sounds like a Member of the  State legislature. But it does not sound to me like someone who is  prepared to discharge their duties under the Federal law.   Another space where Mr. Pruitt has some alarming views is on science  itself. I am deeply concerned about what is happening to science, to  scientists, to government research. We just confirmed the Director of  OMB who, in a Facebook post, wondered out loud--he had some questions  about the Zika virus. I am not sure he had any special expertise to be  raising these questions. We should all be researching and be as  scientifically literate as possible, but the OMB Director put on his  Facebook post: I have these questions. I am really interested in this,  but the real question is whether we should have publicly funded  research at all.   So there is a full-on attack on science and facts. There is a full-on  attack on reality. But when it comes to environmental science, it is so  consequential. I am looking at these pages sitting here. I think about  everybody's children and grandchildren. We just have an obligation to  get the data right, to really understand what is happening with air  quality and water quality.   Here is what Mr. Pruitt says about mercury. ``Human exposure to  methylmercury resulting from coal fired EGUs is exceedingly small.''    This is, again, the White Stallion Energy Center versus EPA.   This is what the scientists say: ``As a result of these long-term  mercury inputs, there are hotspots and whole regions, such as the  Adirondacks of New York, the Great Lakes region of the Midwest and  large portions of the Southeast where the fishery is contaminated with  mercury.''   There are more fish consumption advisories in the United States for  mercury than all other contaminants combined.   I can tell you, just on a personal level, to the Senator from Rhode  Island, that I like my ahi. I like my fresh sashimi. I like tuna, and  everybody in Hawaii likes fish. So you kind of watch how much marlin  you eat, how much ahi you eat because we understand that there is a  real mercury problem. This isn't made up. If you talk to ER doctors in  Honolulu, they have to deal with mercury poisoning on a weekly basis.  That is what the science shows, and that is what the reality shows.   Here is what Mr. Pruitt says: ``The record does not support EPA's  findings that mercury, non-mercury metals, and acid gas pose public  health hazards.''   And here is what the scientists say: ``There is no evidence  demonstrating a safe level of mercury exposure.''   So before yielding for a question, I think it is really important for  all of us to understand what is at stake here. We have a nominee who is  really unique in the history of the EPA because never before have we  had a person who has made it their life's mission to undermine the  Agency which they wish to lead.   You could probably argue that Mr. Puzder, who just withdrew his  nomination yesterday, had a similar kind of attitude about the  Department of Labor.   But even under Republican administrations, we have had Republican  Administrators of the EPA who understood: Hey, look, the law is the  Clean Air Act, the law is the Clean Water Act, the law is the  Endangered Species Act, and I have an obligation, as the EPA  Administrator, to accept those premises--right?--and to be the EPA  Administrator, to not sort of be on my crusade against Federal law.   If he wants to undermine Federal law, he can go litigate that. He can  be a private attorney or he could run for the Congress and try to be a  lawmaker. But to the degree and extent that he wants to run the Agency  with a specific statutory mission, he has to follow those statutes. And  I have seen no evidence that he has any respect for or understanding of  those statutes.   I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Rhode Island.    Well, I thank the Senator for the question.   This is what is happening today. It would be enough if we were in the  process of debating and confirming a climate-denier to the EPA. It  would be enough that this person is a plaintiff in 17 lawsuits against  the EPA. It would be enough that he is a plaintiff in these lawsuits  against the EPA and he refused to recuse himself if he is running the  EPA. As Senator Markey says, he is going to be plaintiff, defendant,  and judge in these lawsuits.   All of that would be enough, but today a judge is compelling him to  release around 3,000 emails that have squarely to do with the debate  that we are having, which is this: Is this person a little too close to  the industry that he is going to regulate?   As I said before, gosh, I hope these emails, as they are disclosed,  show nothing. I hope that my suspicions, my fears, my concerns are  without foundation. But I think about the Republicans, the good  Republicans on the other side of the aisle who are voting for this man  tomorrow.   Boy, they had better hope there is nothing in those emails. They had  better think very carefully about what is in those emails. They might  want to delay this vote themselves because, look, if there is nothing  in those emails, then we can vote two Mondays from now--no harm no  foul. You have career professionals at EPA doing their job. EPA will  run for another 5 or 6 business days. It is OK.   We are the world's greatest deliberative body. We go slow on almost  everything, and we are rushing on this. Why are we rushing?   Well, I was trying to figure out all week why we were rushing. Then I  understood that the court was going to rule today, and they are jamming  this. They are ramming this down the American people's throats.   I would just offer this to my Republican colleagues: These emails are  going to be disclosed, and maybe you guys and gals know that there is  nothing to be concerned about in terms of the content of these emails,  where the Oklahoma attorney general is corresponding with a bunch of  fossil fuel  [[Page S1279]]  companies. Maybe it is all good in those emails.   But the thing is, if that is the case, why did he refuse for 750 days  to offer the emails up? I mean, it literally takes more work to not  provide the emails than to provide the emails. You have to lawyer up to  not do something. You are going to lawyer up as the Oklahoma attorney  general to not comply with an Oklahoma statute. This takes a special  effort.   Why would somebody want to undertake such a special effort to not  comply with State law? I don't know. But I think we may find out on  Tuesday.   Gosh, I hope I am wrong. But I have a feeling that the people who are  most nervous right now about what is in those emails--in addition to  the American public who care about clean air and clean water--are the  Republicans who are being forced to vote at 1 o'clock without seeing  them. They are being forced to vote on this person to run the EPA that  they know is unpopular.   I mean, I understand that in some States this guy is tremendously  popular because it is very easy to blast the EPA. In some portion of  the Republican conference, Scott Pruitt is totally popular. I get that.   There is a nontrivial number of Members on the Republican side who  actually don't want to be on the wrong side of the public when it comes  to clean air and clean water, but they are going to be on the wrong  side of the public when it comes to clean air and clean water. And it  might get worse next Tuesday.   I really wonder why you would work so hard to not disclose the  contents of 3,000 emails over a 750-day period.   I want to quote from Mr. Pruitt again on climate change:         Global warming has inspired one of the major policy debates       of our time. That debate is far from settled.    Here is what the scientists say: ``The scientific understanding of  climate change is now sufficiently clear to justify taking steps to  reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.'' This is from  the U.S. National Academy of Sciences in 2005. This wasn't just some  sort of recently arrived at conclusion.   Here is Mr. Pruitt again on climate:         We've had ebb and flow. We've had obviously, climate       conditions change throughout our history. That's scientific       fact. It gets cooler, it gets hotter. We don't know the       trajectory, if it is on an unsustainable course. Nor do we       know the extent by which the burning of fossil fuels, man's       contribution to that, is making this far worse than it is.    I mean, sorry, this is not what the scientists say. This is what I  say. That is just bunk. There was a point at which that was a tenable  position, even if it was scientifically bunk, easily 15 years ago. It  was politically kind of workable 10 years ago--maybe even 8 years ago  and, depending on your community, 5 years ago. But there is a majority  of Republicans who understand the urgency of climate change.   The only place where the reality of climate change continues to be  debated fiercely is in the halls of Congress.   Local people in every community across the country understand that  this thing is settled fact. This thing is upon us. You don't have to be  some wonk. You don't have to understand ocean acidification. You don't  have to understand exactly what is going on. You just have to, A,  listen to experts who know about climate, who know about weather, who  know about atmospheric science. Even if you don't believe any of the  experts, you just have to believe your own experience. There is not a  person out there--whether they are a fisherman on the Big Island or a  farmer in the Midwest or a hunter in the Southwest--there is not a  person out there who isn't experiencing the weather getting strange.   Everybody understands that 1 day of weird weather does not climate  change make. But there is just no doubt that severe weather and odd  weather is getting more frequent and more odd and more severe.   Here is what the scientists say about climate change:         The scientific evidence is clear: Global climate change       caused by human activities is occurring now, and it is a       growing threat to society.    Here is Mr. Pruitt again:         Is it truly man-made and is this just simply another period       of time where the Earth is cooling, increasing in heat? Is it       just typical, natural type of occurrences as opposed to what       the administration says?''    I mean, this is so far out of the mainstream that it would be funny  if it weren't terrifying. It would be funny if it weren't terrifying to  think that the person who is going to run the Environmental Protection  Agency, the person who is going to be in charge of administering the  Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act is saying: Is it truly man-made and  is this just simply just another period of time where the Earth is  cooling, increasing in heat? I mean, is it just a natural type of  occurrence, as opposed to what the Obama administration says?   I would be happy to yield to the Senator for a question. I will note  that we have a joke where I am the good cop and he is the bad cop, but  I think over time, we are merging.    Well, I think----    Well, I think----    Well, I think----    Well, I think----    Well, I think----    You were asking about the willful blindness.    I want to make an observation that there are a couple of  kinds of willful blindness. One is willful blindness about climate  change in the first place, a desire not to hear the truth, a desire to  put blinders on when it comes to these issues. I will note that not  every time but almost every time we have a debate on climate, we have a  nice complement of Democrats on this side and a totally empty Chamber  on the other side. It is not that they don't know what is going on, it  is that they know exactly what is going on, and they don't want to deal  with it. They don't want to deal with it, and they are good people and  patriotic people, but there is a reason to believe this willful  blindness is not coincidental.   I would just implore the Senate Republicans who respect the Senate,  who understand our special role under the Constitution to give advice  and consent on nominations for Cabinet positions, that this isn't some  minor sub-Cabinet position. This isn't some matter of little import. I  understand both sides employ tactics to delay action on the Senate  floor. That is kind of part of the way this body works, right? The  minority slows the majority down, and we try to come to some kind of  consensus, sometimes a unanimous consent agreement or whatever it may  be, to try to make this place work a little better, and it is  maddeningly slow, but it forces bipartisanship, right?   I understand the accusation that sometimes gets made that we are just  trying to delay for delay's sake. At the beginning of this week--look,  I ran for the Senate because of climate. That is how passionately I  feel about this issue, but I understood how this thing was lining up,  and I said: Look, let's fight the fight. There is no magic between 28  hours and 30 hours. There is no magic between 29 hours of talking about  this and 26 hours of talking about this. I was prepared to fight the  fight and move this week. I didn't want to employ extraordinary delay  tactics. I was actually even arguing with some of my colleagues, with  whom I agree so much on climate, about the sort of efficacy just  delaying for another couple of hours, but we are not trying to delay  another couple of hours for no particular reason. There are 3,000  emails that a judge in Oklahoma is compelling Scott Pruitt to provide  to the public, and not 6 weeks from now or 6 months from now but 3  business days from now. On Tuesday morning, the public and, maybe in  this instance even more importantly, the Members of the U.S. Senate,  who are in a position to determine whether this is the right person to  run the Environmental Protection Agency, are going to see the contents  of these emails. Do you know what? It is probably nothing. These 3,000  emails that are correspondence between the Oklahoma attorney general,  the head of the Republican Attorneys General Association, and a bunch  of fossil fuel companies--this guy who has sued the EPA and tried to  undermine the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act 17 times, this guy who  refuses to recuse himself from running the EPA, from being both a  plaintiff and a defendant, I am sure the 3,000 emails he has delayed  releasing for 750 days--I am sure the 3,000 e-mails he has delayed  releasing for 750 days and is only going to have to provide them to the  public because a court is making him, I am sure there is nothing in  them. But just in case, why don't we just find out what is in them?  Because it seems to me that if they are awful, it would give pause to  Republicans.   I just don't get why the Republicans--I understand why people want to  jam this through before maybe something bad happens on Tuesday, but if  I were a rank-and-file Republican, I would be saying: This looks a  little goofy. We don't normally vote on Fridays at 1 p.m., we normally  vote on Thursdays at 2:15 so everybody can race off to the Reagan  airport and go home. If it is 2:15, I can't get home until Friday, but  most people can get home. We vote on Thursday afternoons, and in rare  instances do we vote on Fridays--debt ceiling, continuing resolutions,  big stuff. We have been moving on nominees kind of at a normal pace.  Listen, it has been tough. We have a lot of late nights here. We thank  the Senate staff for hanging in here with us. We apologize for the  difficulty that you have to undertake to make the Senate work and for  us to do our constitutional duties, but isn't it weird that we are just  jamming this through on a Friday afternoon?   If I were a rank-and-file Member, I would go to my leadership and  say: Hey, this is getting a little weird. I don't want this thing to  blow up when I am back home at a townhall.   I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Oregon. There is no  better climate champion than Jeff Merkley. It is probably a two-way tie  with the junior Senator from Oregon and the Senator from Rhode Island.  Before yielding to a question, thank you for your dedication on this  issue for the people of Oregon and for the people of this country, but  I am happy to yield for a question.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.    Yes, the Senator is correct.    Yes, the Senator is correct.    I thank the Senator for the question. I just want to ask  the Presiding Officer what the parliamentary situation is; has my 60  minutes expired?   The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has not.    How much time remains?   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 54 minutes.    I thank the Presiding Officer.   I don't know if it is disqualifying. I would say it is strange, in  the extreme, to have the chief law enforcement officer of a State and  the head of the Republican Attorneys General Association not comply  with his own State statute. This isn't trivial. Not that it would be OK  for the attorney general not to comply with any law, but this isn't a  nontrivial issue. This is letting the public know the nature of your  correspondence with industry--especially since I think it is fair to  say that I think even he would agree that he has  [[Page S1281]]  distinguished himself among attorneys general as a lead advocate  against the EPA and as an advocate for fossil fuel-generating  companies. So it is not unreasonable for the public to say: Well, let  me understand what the nature of your correspondence was.   My very basic question to the Members of the Senate on the Republican  side is, Why in the world would we vote at 1 o'clock before we get  these emails? I understand that if we had said, give us 6 months so we  can see these emails, that would be preposterous. That would be us  delaying for delay's sake. Listen, we feel so strongly, I think it is  fair to say about this nominee that we might have even tried that, but  then in that case the majority would be within their rights to say: We  are not going to let you delay for delay's sake.   But this is not delay for delay's sake. There is information that is  exactly on point.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for that question.  The Senator is right that he has been delaying because he wants to be  confirmed as the EPA Administrator before these emails become  public. There is no other reason that I can think of that is so  important that we get the EPA Administrator in. Remember, we have the  HUD nominee, we have the Department of Commerce nominee, we have the  Department of the Interior nominee, and we have the Department of  Energy nominee, who has responsibility and stewardship over our nuclear  arsenal. We have decided we are not going to run until Friday afternoon  getting a person in charge as the Secretary of Energy to take care of  our nuclear arsenal, but it is a really big hurry--and we have to  literally prevent Members from meeting with NATO allies--to get this  guy through. I really didn't understand earlier in the week what the  big rush was and why Pruitt and why now.    Listen, every Wednesday we are in some kind of negotiation about what  kind of legislation and what kind of matters come before the Senate,  and both sides sort of puff up their chests and make threats about  going through the weekend, and we usually come to some sort of  agreement. Yet this week there was no budging, and now I get it. They  were afraid this judge was going to do what this judge did. This judge  is requiring these emails to come out, and I think they are terrified  about what these emails say.   Do you know what? There is only one way to prove me wrong, which is  to call our bluff and delay. Let's go two Mondays from now. We have a  recess, and we will all read the emails. Then it will be great. We will  find out that there was nothing untoward, nothing improper, nothing  concerning about these 3,000 emails between the Republican attorney  general from Oklahoma and these oil and gas and coal companies. I think  maybe something is in those emails. Maybe I am wrong. I hope I am  wrong. For the country, for the planet, I hope I am wrong.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.    Yes.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Will the Senator from Oregon yield to a question?    Will the Senator from Oregon yield to a question?    Will the Senator from Oregon yield to a question?    I thank the Senator from Oregon.   I have been thinking a lot about the job of the EPA Administrator. It  is one of those things we have taken for granted over many, many years,  that we are going to get someone who is going to sort of play it right  down the middle of the fairway, but now we are forced to sort of  challenge all of our assumptions with respect to what we can expect in  an EPA Administrator.   When I think about the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts, they are very  important, especially for young people who are so passionate about the  environment, as they may not know what life was like and what the  environment was like before the Clean Water Act. The majority of  waterways in the United States were not swimmable. You had rivers  catching on fire.    I went to college in Southern California in, I guess, 1990 through  1994, and the success of the Clean Air Act is incredible. I mean, L.A.  still has its smog, but because of CAFE standards, because of the Clean  Air Act, because of other environmental regulations, you don't have  nearly the air quality problems that you had even 20, 25 years ago, and  this is a nationwide success story.   Kids had to stay home from school because of air pollution. I know  everybody understands that is happening in Shanghai and in Beijing,  parts of Africa, parts of the developing world, parts of the  industrializing world. But 10, 20 years ago, you would have smog  alerts, and kids would have to stay home from school in the United  States of America. You had kids who couldn't function because of their  asthma. So what is at stake is not a bird or a butterfly.   I got my start in politics because of conservation issues. I am  interested in forest ecology and reef ecology, but I understand a lot  of people live a different life than that, and they are not in a  position to be worrying about birds and butterflies. But everybody  worries about clean air and clean water.   So I was wondering if the Senator from Oregon could talk a little bit  about the foundation of this debate. I saw the Senator from Rhode  Island do this incredible exposition--as I have seen before, and nobody  is better at this--in describing the forces behind what is going on.  But I would like to talk about the premise that undergirds this debate,  which is not about fossil fuel companies versus conservationists; it is  about clean air versus dirty air, and it is about clean water versus  dirty water.   I know that is something that the Senator from Oregon is very  passionate about, and I wonder if he might comment on the basic idea of  a clean and healthy environment and the bipartisan consensus that we  ought to have related to that.    Will the Senator yield for a question?    Through the Chair, I would just like to ask the Senator a  question. It strikes me that Governor McCall, President Nixon, I am  thinking of Governor Schwarzenegger, I am thinking of Susan Collins,  although I am almost sheepish to continue to single her out; it may not  always be helpful to her to be singled out as the lone pro-climate  person on the Republican side of the fence on this issue--but it  strikes me that your beginning as an environmentalist was not based on  being liberal or progressive, but your community's values, your  family's values, your church's values, your Scout troop's values.   We had a really interesting lunch today with a preacher from North  Carolina talking about framing political issues as moral issues. It  really touched me because I am telling you, it breaks my heart to  think--I mean, look, for some of these arguments about the size and the  scope of the government, we just have different views on what the right  size and scope and role of the Federal Government is. Some of these  questions about geopolitics--tough stuff. You try to get it right. You  try to have a coherent world view. Tough stuff. If you serve in the  Senate long enough, you are going to get some stuff exactly right, and  you may be wrong a few times.   But what really breaks my heart is to see the once-bipartisan  consensus, which was based on common sense and morality that we just  don't pollute our oceans, our streams, our aquifers, the air we  breathe; that we try to preserve our environment for each other and for  posterity; and a basic understanding that people who own businesses-- especially once those businesses are incorporated and especially if  those businesses are publicly traded--have a different set of  imperatives. It is really hard to get each individual business that is  in the mining industry or the electricity generation industry or the  extraction industry or the transportation industry or the manufacturing  industry to voluntarily worry every day about clean air and clean  water. It is kind of like not their job. They are supposed to make  stuff. They are supposed to extract stuff. They are supposed to make  electronics. They are supposed to make this economy work.   So one of the ideas of the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act and  the Endangered Species Act is that we have an obligation to creation  itself for those of us who are religious and for those of us who are  not. That is a moral obligation, not a political obligation. We have a  duty that has nothing to do with us being Democrats, and that duty  doesn't stop because they decided to run for office as a Republican.    I am wondering if the Senator from Oregon could comment on the sort  of degradation of the bipartisan consensus around protecting our  environment, which used to be a sort of 90-percent issue, a bipartisan  issue. I am wondering how the Senator from Oregon feels about that.    Mr. President, in late October, people who lived in a  place called Donora shrugged off the thick, yellow smog that had  covered their small town. It was 1948. It wasn't unusual to see a smog  blanket the town, thanks to the zinc plant and the steel mill that  smoked endlessly into the Pennsylvania sky. It wasn't unusual to see  people coughing as they went about their day. As one reporter put it,  ``People are always coughing in Donora.''   What was unusual is that the smog did not clear as the day went on.  It lingered, hanging around the town, wreaking havoc for the next 5  days. At first, life seemed to go on. The Halloween parade went on as  planned, even though no one could really see the people marching. The  high school football game went on as planned, although the quarterbacks  avoided passing plays since the wide receivers couldn't see the ball.  But then someone died. People couldn't breathe. As the local hospital  started to fill, the town hotel set up beds for overflow patients. By  the fourth day, the hotel had to set up another emergency section--this  time, a temporary morgue. The town's three funeral homes were  overwhelmed. On the fifth day, the stacks of a zinc plant stopped their  endless streams of smoke, and the smog that would become known as the  Donora death fog finally lifted but not before nearly 7,000 people fell  ill and 20 died.   This is one of the many stories that show us what life was like in  the United States of America before the EPA was created. In the early  1960s, millions of freshwater fish and rivers around the country were  poisoned by insecticides--hurting consumer trust and the countless  fishermen and their families who relied on the fish to make a living.  Pollution was so bad that debris floating in the Cuyahoga River  actually caught on fire, causing thousands of dollars in property  damage. The water in Lake Superior, one of the most beautiful lakes in  the United States, became so toxic from companies dumping asbestos- laden waste that local communities had to start filtering their water.  Think about that. People could drink the water from local reservoirs,  unfiltered, until pollution came along. This was the path our country  was on.   Pollution was destroying some of the most beautiful places in this  country--on the planet, in fact--putting the health of the public and  the health of our economy at grave risk.   There was another event in the early 1960s that helped our country to  see clearly that the path we were on would only lead to destruction.  Rachel Carson, scientist, public servant, and author, published a book  called ``Silent Spring.'' This book laid out in simple, beautiful prose  the threats that pesticides and pollution posed to our environment or  what Carson called a ``Fable for Tomorrow.'' She wrote: ``The most  alarming of all man's assaults upon the environment is the  contamination of air, earth, rivers and sea, with dangerous and even  lethal materials.''   Carson's book made clear that we were contaminating the environment  and that this could not go on. Her book sounded a call for change, as  millions of Americans began demanding that the government take action,  but there was also a backlash. Here is what one industry spokesman said  as public opinion began to coalesce around addressing pollution:         The major claims of Miss Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring       are gross distortions of the actual facts, completely       unsupported by scientific experimental evidence and general,       practical experience in the field. Her suggestion that       pesticides are in fact biocides destroying all life is       obviously absurd in the light of the fact that without       selective biologicals, these compounds would be completely       useless.    This is how the controversy went on for the next few years. The  public, the science, and the reality all pointed toward the truth, but  a few loud voices persisted. They did not want the movement to go  forward. This continued even after Rachel Carson passed away,  tragically and prematurely, of cancer in the year 1964.   Here is what the New York Times published in her obituary:         The most recent flare-up in the continuing pesticide       controversy occurred early this month when the Public Health       Service announced that the periodic huge-scale deaths of fish       on the lower Mississippi River had been traced over the last       4 years to toxic ingredients and three kinds of pesticides.       Some persons believe that the pesticides drained into the       river from neighboring farm lands.        A hearing by the Agriculture Department of the Public       Health Service's charges ended a week ago with a spokesman       for one of the pesticide manufacturers saying that any       judgment should be delayed until more information was       obtained.    The line of argument captured in the New York Times is familiar to  anyone who has watched our Nation struggle to come to a shared set of  facts around a number of difficult issues, but even in the face of so  much controversy, the country did the right thing. In addressing the  threats to our environment, the U.S. Government--with substantial and  commendable support from Republicans--began to lay the foundation for a  new America, one that would preserve and protect our country and its  resources for the next generation.   I would like to highlight three of the critical cornerstones in the  foundation: the EPA, the Clean Air Act, and the Clean Water Act.   Let's start with the EPA itself. It was established in 1970 by  President Nixon. He united several offices and bureaus already in the  Federal Government into a single agency--one that  [[Page S1316]]  would oversee all of the laws, protections, research, and policies  about the Nation's environment. The mission of the EPA was clear from  the start, to protect human health and the environment. Almost  immediately, something really exciting happened. There was a feeling of  hope and anticipation for what this Agency could do for the country.  Within the first few months, tens of thousands of resumes came flooding  in from across the country as people clamored to work for the EPA.   Here is how one man who worked for the Agency described it:         There was a palpable sense of excitement that we were about       to do something big. We had to do things big because the       newspapers and news magazines were filled with stories about       Lake Erie dying. I think it was a year or two before that the       Cuyahoga had indeed caught on fire. I believe the Houston       Ship Channel had the same issue. We knew we were there to       really deal with substantial problems, and we were going to       meet with immediate pushback.    For the next 40 years, the EPA would build a legacy of preserving and  protecting the country's air, water, and natural resources, working to  make our country a better place to live.   I just want to say that whatever the final disposition of this  nomination ends up being--and I know we will push as hard as we  possibly can for the delay of this decision, until we are able to see  the contents of Mr. Pruitt's emails as directed by the court this  afternoon--but whatever the decision is of the Senate under advice and  consent, it is really important that this be said: EPA employees still  have an obligation under Federal law to do their job, to protect air  and water, to administer the Clean Air and Clean Water Act, to enforce  the Endangered Species Act. We are confirming a head of an Agency, but  this new head of an Agency is not the Emperor of the Agency.   This new head of an Agency has obligations under the statute to  enforce the laws on the books, and he has a current role as the lead of  the Republican Attorneys General Association and as a plaintiff in  multiple lawsuits against the EPA, and that is a reason many of us  object to his confirmation. If he is confirmed, every EPA employee has  rights. They have whistleblower rights, they have protections, and they  have obligations under the statute so that if this EPA tries to do  anything unlawful, anything that contravenes the Clean Air Act, the  Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, then all of the EPA  employees are dutybound under the law to follow the law.   No one in the Federal Government should be forced to do anything  unlawful, and we support the EPA employees, in particular, who we know  work so hard and are so dedicated to such an important cause. We know  they are under intense scrutiny and pressure, and I think it is worth  saying that we support them but also that the law supports them.   One of the first actions of the Agency was to ban DDT, a pesticide  used in World War II. At first, DDT seemed like a dream chemical. It  was used to protect soldiers from pests and then to protect crops like  cotton, but soon it became clear--thanks to Rachel Carson and others-- that this chemical was creating far more harm than good. Public health  was really in danger. The bald eagle and other wildlife were being  poisoned, and the pests that were supposed to be put off from bothering  the crops were adapting, becoming more resistant, even as the chemicals  became more potent and ultimately more dangerous.   Thanks to the EPA, the use of DDT came to an end. The health of  children, families, and wildlife immediately improved. The bald eagle  slowly recovered, to the point where it is no longer a threatened or an  endangered species.   The Agency also found a solution to acid rain, which was a major  problem that killed fish, hurt American farmers, and caused damage to  forests and infrastructure alike. After studies showed how high  concentrations of lead were hurting our kids, the EPA took action to  remove it from gasoline and from the air. Because of that action, lead  levels in both kids and adults have dropped by more than 80 percent  since the late 1970s. We have a lot more work to do on lead, but that  is one of the many EPA success stories.   The EPA then took on secondhand smoke, banning smoking in indoor  public places. It pushed the auto industry to design technology that  would reduce the amount of pollution created by cars, a step that would  reduce the amount of pollution per mile emitted by cars by up to 90  percent. It provides technical assistance to State and local  governments that otherwise don't have the resources or the know-how to  tackle problems on their own.   The Agency has also empowered the public through right-to-know laws  that give people access to information about chemicals, toxic  substances, and pollution in their own communities. After studies show  how low-income and minority communities face greater environmental  risks, the EPA formed an Office of Environmental Justice, dedicated to  making these communities as safe as any other in the country. As is so  often the case, this Federal Agency set the bar for the rest of the  world on how governments can protect and preserve the environment.   One leader of the EPA who served under President George H.W. Bush  recalled that the Agency worked with countries as varied as Morocco and  Mexico to battle fires or spills. After the EPA sent people to help  with a Russian spill that was impacting Estonia, the Prime Minister  wrote the EPA a letter, saying their visit was the most important visit  of any American's since Charles Lindbergh had flown from Russia to  Estonia in 1933.   So the EPA has had incredibly important impacts, from boosting  diplomacy around the world to protecting the lungs of little ones right  here at home.   The second cornerstone of our efforts to protect the environment is  the Clean Air Act. Before the EPA opened its doors, States set their  own standards for clean air, and most States had weak standards because  they were in a race to the bottom to attract companies that didn't want  to have to deal with the damage they caused. Imagine you are in a State  and have three or four adjacent States and someone wants to cite a  factory. Well, it is very difficult to have a strong environmental  standard because that factory is no doubt going to find the place where  they are allowed to pollute the most, which is why you have Federal  standards. Not surprisingly, these low standards were fueling air  pollution.    Every day, the average American takes between 17,000 and 23,000  breaths. If the air we are breathing is filled with toxic chemicals, we  are at risk for cancer, birth defects, and damage to our lungs, our  brain, and our nerves. That risk is even higher for people with asthma  and for senior citizens.   Remember, humans are not the only ones that rely on clean air. Trees,  crops, wildlife, lakes, fish are all at risk of damage when we have  dirty air. So eventually the American public demanded that something be  done to clean up our air.   In 1970, Congress on a bipartisan basis, passed the Clean Air Act.  This law, along with later amendments, makes up the complete Federal  response to air pollution. It is a beautifully written law. It gives  the EPA the authority to limit air pollutants and emissions from  industry plants. It empowers the Agency to research and fund different  approaches to keeping the air clean. It creates partnerships between  Federal, State, and local governments to reduce air pollution. Who  could argue with that?   As soon as it was passed, people knew that this law was a game  changer. President Nixon said: ``I think that 1970 will be known as the  year of the beginning, in which we really began to move on the problems  of clean air and clean water and open spaces for the future generations  of America.''   That is exactly what happened. The impact was actually felt very  quickly, starting with the auto industry. The Clean Air Act called on  the auto industry to drastically reduce the amount of nitrogen oxide,  carbon monoxide, and other harmful chemicals that came out of the  tailpipes across the country within 5 years.   Consider that today there are more than three times the amount of  cars on the road than they were in the 1970s. Now imagine that the  chemicals coming out of each of those car's tailpipes were 90 percent  more harmful. That is where we would be without the Clean Air Act.   It was not so long ago that communities would cancel high school for  kids because the air pollution was so bad, not in Beijing but in  California. That is no longer the case, not for numerous  [[Page S1317]]  reasons, not for a dozen or so causes but because of the Clean Air Act.  This law has literally saved millions of lives. It has improved the  health of millions of others.   Because the EPA has been there to enforce it, air pollution has  fallen by 70 percent since 1970. Smog levels in Los Angeles have fallen  from their peak by two-thirds. Nationwide, lead in our cars is down 98  percent, carbon monoxide is down 85 percent, sulphur dioxide is down 80  percent, acid rain is down 50 percent, and all at a fraction of  anticipated costs.   Let me make two points here. First of all, it is actually rare that a  law works this well. I mean, it is hard to make a good law. Everybody  talks about it as a sausage-making process; you don't want to see what  goes into it. But not all laws work over time.   This law actually worked. This law actually cleaned up our air. That  is a really important thing to remember. If you undermine this law, if  you undermine the agency that enforces it, the air does not clean up  itself. This is not an automatic thing. The air is clean because the  government protects the air.   I understand that, including the Presiding Officer and many Members  of the Republican Party, we have tough debates about how big the  government should be, what its responsibility should be. But if you go  from Bernie Sanders, a democratic socialist, to Rand Paul, the sort of  Republican libertarian--and I am not sure if you just sat down and had  a cup of coffee with either of them or everybody in between on the  political spectrum, in terms of their view of what the Federal  Government ought to do, gosh, I can't imagine that anybody--if you kind  of get them in a private moment--does not think that it is a Federal  role to keep the air clean.   There are moments where I see a program within a Federal agency and I  might love it, right, because of my political persuasion. But I can  understand how a Ben Sasse or a Rand Paul or a Marco Rubio might object  to it because they might say: Well, that sounds like a good idea, but  my goodness, if that is so important, why don't we let communities  decide whether or not to do that?   This is not one of those issues. Go and talk to your constituents  about whether they want clean air. I don't know that you are going to  find too many Republicans out there--I mean voters, not elected  officials--voters, who think clean air is, take it or leave it, not a  Federal role.   The truth is, that first of all, clean air is important enough to  make a Federal law about in the first place. But there is also a  technical reason, not a very complicated technical reason, but a  technical reason that you need a Federal law that is about clean air as  opposed to a State-by-State patchwork, and that is because the air  travels. You cannot pollute in one State and expect that it will not  impact the other State.   So one State having tough clean air standards doesn't really function  in terms of the ecology because pollution knows no boundaries. The same  study that I referred to found that air pollution has improved in the  United States, thanks to environmental protection. But our work is not  done. Nearly 90,000 people every year in the United States are at risk  of a premature death because of air pollution. That number will rise if  we chip away at this basic foundation.   The third and final cornerstone of that foundation is the Clean Water  Act. It is really important to remember how bad things were before the  Clean Water Act. I mean, we are not where we need to be in terms of  protecting our water resources. But it is kind of unfathomable how bad  it was before this law was passed.   Water in communities across the country was dirty. You could not swim  or fish in two-thirds of the lakes, rivers, and coastal waters in the  country. You couldn't swim or fish in two-thirds of the lakes, rivers,  and coastal waters in the country. That is a data point that you would  expect in a country that is still industrializing, that just doesn't  have the pollution controls.   When you go to certain parts of the planet and you see essentially a  very dirty environment, you would assume two-thirds, maybe more, of  those lakes and streams and waterways are too polluted to fish or swim.  But this is the United States. It was allowable to dump untreated  sewage into open water. You could dump untreated sewage into open water  before the Clean Water Act.   But that changed in 1972, when what is now known as the Clean Water  Act became law and cleared the way for the Federal Government to  restore and protect the health of our water.   According to a study by the Aspen Institute, the Clean Water Act  stopped billions of pounds of pollution from fouling the water and  dramatically increased the number of waterways that are safe for  swimming and fishing. Twenty years ago, you would have had to have a  death wish to go swimming in Boston Harbor. Today, you don't have to  think twice. That is because of the Clean Water Act.   But this is not just about enjoying the beauty of the water that it  provides to so many communities, although not is not a small thing.  Look, a lot of people--left, right, and center--people who are not  political, people on the progressive side, people on the conservative  side, people like lakes. People like the beach. People like the ocean.   It is not unreasonable, whoever you voted for, to think that there  are a few things that government should do: They should probably have  some kind of transportation infrastructure. There should probably be a  law enforcement function. Make sure that the water is clean, the air is  clean, and we have some national defense. Right? That is some basic  stuff. Even if you are a libertarian, if you are not nuts, you think  that the government should do a couple of very basic things, and among  them is to keep the water clean.   I wanted to share some interactions I have had with the craft beer  industry. They wrote a letter this week about how important clean water  is to them. Here is a section of it:         Beer is about 90 percent water, making local water supply       quality and its characteristics such as pH and mineral       content, critical to beer brewing and the flavor of many       classic brews.        Changes to our water supply--whether we draw directly from       a water source or from a municipal supply--threaten our       ability to consistently produce our great-tasting beer, and       thus, our bottom line.        Protecting clean water is central to our business and our       long-term success. Not only does great-tasting beer we brew       depend on it, but so do the communities in which we operate.    Some of the largest and best craft breweries in the country signed  onto this letter, from the Allagash Brewing Company in Maine to the New  Belgium Brewing Company in Colorado. They are right to be concerned  because it will not take much for our water to go back to where it was  in the 1970s. So it is in the interest of many industries for our  country to have clean water, but not all of them.   Publicly traded companies will do the minimum. In a lot of ways, the  way these companies are set up, they are actually obligated under the  law to do the minimum. They have to maximize shareholder profit. They  have boards of directors, they have earnings reports, they have  quarterly obligations. Whether you like it or not, that is the way our  system works. So, if you have a fiduciary obligation to maximize  profits, then you may give short shrift to environmental concerns.   Compliance costs money. So most companies will comply only if they  have to. If they are good companies, they feel that their obligation is  to sit down with their lawyers and have the lawyers explain to them  what they must do to comply.   But it is a rare company that says: Hey, I want to do much more than  that. I mean Patagonia is great. There are other companies that do good  work in the environmental space. But let's be very clear: There are a  handful of companies that are so motivated, either as a brand strategy  or a mission-driven approach, that they are going to exceed their  obligations under the law. Most companies are going to do what is  required under the law and not much more.   We can count on someone saying on a board of directors in some corner  office or someplace on Wall Street: Hey, we can save 3 percent here if  we don't clean the water. That is why we need a Clean Water Act. That  is why we need the EPA. It is not a matter of left or right; this is a  matter of right or wrong. This is a matter of clean or dirty.  [[Page S1318]]    This is especially important because our work is not done. We still  have a ways to go. We still can't swim or fish in about one-third of  our waterways. So these three cornerstones--this foundation of more  than 40 years of progress--have prepared us to tackle what is the  challenge of our lifetime, climate change. There was a time when this  was primarily the concern of the conservation minded among us, people  like me: hikers, swimmers, surfers green groups, bird and butterfly  people. Right? I understand that.   There was a time where this was mostly an ecological concern. You had  science people, you had hiking types who said: Hey, this thing is  happening. I read Al Gore's book. This is a big deal. They were 10  years ahead of the curve. But climate change is no longer just an  ecological issue; it is an economic issue. It is a quality of life  issue. It is an American way of life issue. It is causing real harm to  people and costing us billions of dollars now--not in the future, but  now.   In recent years, the United States has experienced a record number of  devastating storms, extreme temperatures, severe floods and lasting  droughts. It is not a coincidence. As the climate changes, normal  weather patterns are altered, and this affects our environment, our  health, and our economy by influencing everything from the price of  produce at the grocery store to our home insurance rates.   So we know that climate change is real. The science makes that clear.  In fact, our own personal experience makes that real. A lot of people  fish or hunt or hike or surf or snorkel or go to the lake or just go  outside and experience something that seems to be changing.   There is a difference between weather and climate. The weather is  tomorrow morning's temperature and whether it is raining or not and  whether it is windy or not. The climate is the conditions that create  the weather. It is not arguable anymore by anybody credible that the  climate has changed and, therefore, the weather is getting absolutely  more volatile.   Now we can, unfortunately, rely on our own experience and our own  eyes to confirm that the climate and the weather are getting weirder-- in some cases, more dangerous and certainly more unpredictable. Make no  mistake, this is caused by humans, and that means we can do something  about it.   Climate change deniers need to know that they are on the wrong side  of history. They can't just cite the cost of transitioning to a clean  energy economy--a cost that continues to decline, I should point out-- while ignoring the cost of doing nothing, because the cost of doing  nothing on climate change is absolutely astronomical, whether in storm  aid, infrastructure mitigation, private property loss, or disruption in  financial and insurance markets. It is much less expensive to move  toward a clean energy economy than to allow severe weather to drain our  economy as a whole.   As a Senator from the State of Hawaii who has led the way in building  a clean energy infrastructure--producing clean, renewable energy and  cutting our dependence on fossil fuels--I know that we can achieve  meaningful change across our Nation, but we need the EPA and an  Administrator to achieve this.   By law, the EPA has the authority to take steps to cut any pollution  that threatens human health and welfare, including carbon pollution.  Even the Supreme Court agreed that if EPA found carbon pollution to be  a danger, the Agency was obligated to act to reduce the threat. So EPA  has begun undertaking efforts to rein in those emissions.   Every protection that the EPA creates is the result of years of  scientific inquiry, stakeholder involvement, public comments, and  technological feasibility studies.   For all the talk of Federal overreach, EPA gives an enormous amount  of authority to the States. For instance, in the Clean Power Plan, EPA  sets emissions targets--that is true--but it was up to each State to  develop a plan that is best suited to its unique circumstances.   The State of Hawaii has a really unique situation because we have  lots of clean energy opportunities. But in terms of baseload power, we  get all of our fuel from Asia, and it is LSFO. It is low sulfur fuel  oil. So what we do is we bring in oil on tankers, which is costing  three and a half times the national average for electricity, and we  light it on fire, and that creates electrons. That is not smart. So we  are in a transition.   But there are other States that have geothermal resources or biofuel  resources. So the EPA said: Hey, carbon is a pollutant. You have to  reduce carbon pollution because, under the law, under the Clean Air  Act, any airborne pollutant must be regulated, right? You have to  reduce the airborne pollutants.   The EPA said: You have to do this over time, but we understand you  are going to have your own energy mix and your own challenges. All you  have to do is submit a plan that is kind of like thought through. So  West Virginia's plan is different from California's plan and is  different from Hawaii's plan. They empowered the States to endeavor to  come up with their own energy mix.   Here is the good news about EPA's rules. This news is on the Clean  Air Act. It is on the Clean Power Plan. This is always the case. It  always comes in below the estimated cost because what happens is, if  you tell industry to innovate, even if they don't want to, frankly,  even if they complain about it, even if they tell you that it is going  to crash the American economy, which they often say, they end up  driving innovation in the private sector.   In the case of electricity generation and transportation, the Clean  Power Plan and the CAFE standards, the fuel efficiency standards for  cars, accelerated the technological transition that was already  underway.   Here are a couple of examples. When the auto bailout came in,  President Obama negotiated very hard for an increase in fuel efficiency  standards. You can imagine that the American auto industry was  basically on the ropes. It was about to die without a major bailout. So  they got the bailout, but there were also some strings attached, which  were that they bring up fuel efficiency standards. They freaked out.  And you know what happened? They met the standards. And you know what  happened after that? The American auto industry has never been stronger  because people like fuel-efficient cars, right?   What has happened with the Clean Power Plan and with the Paris  climate accord and the investment tax credit and the production tax  credit is that the cost of solar and wind energy is declining. But when  utilities began thinking about long-term investments in a carbon- constrained world, the increased demand for clean energy drove down  these costs even further, which is good for both consumers and the  environment. In fact, more solar capacity was added in 2016 than any  other energy source, by far. Solar and wind combined to make up almost  two-thirds of the new capacity last year.   I want people to understand that the clean energy revolution is  underway. The only question is whether we are going to have to take a  4-year break from this clean energy revolution and give the keys to the  car to China and other countries, which would be pleased to let the  United States abdicate its role as the leader of the clean energy  revolution. We are going to lose all of those solar jobs, we are going  to lose the innovation opportunities, and we are going to lose all of  those wind energy opportunities.    The question is not whether we are going to make a transition to  clean energy. The question is how quickly and whether the United States  will drive it or not.   Consumers loved the first generation of hybrid vehicles so much that  there were waiting lists to buy them. CAFE standards, along with  similar fuel economy standards around the world, drove the automotive  industry to innovate even further. Now we have unprecedented numbers of  hybrid and hybrid electric vehicles on the road, and we stand at the  precipice of a new age of electric vehicles.   So we find ourselves at a crossroads. If we continue down the path  President Obama set us on, I have no doubt that American ingenuity and  innovation will allow us to continue to lead the world in the clean  energy economy, but if we turn back the clock and hand our future back  over to the dirty fuels of the past, we will cede economic leadership  to China, India, Germany, and the  [[Page S1319]]  rest of the world. Those countries are moving toward clean energy so  quickly that we may never catch up; we may never be able to take full  advantage of the economic opportunities that clean energy represents.  It is sad, but it is true, that this is the path that our country will  go on if Scott Pruitt is confirmed to lead the EPA.   I know for the public, after so many troubling nominees, that it is  hard to wake up outraged for yet another nominee. But the reason to  freak out about this one is very simple--clean air and clean water. Ask  anyone who lived in L.A. or in Boston since the 1970s, and they can  tell you that our country has clean air and clean water because of the  laws that were put in place and the Agency that has done its job to  implement them.   All of this will be in jeopardy with Scott Pruitt at the helm. He  made his political bones trying to shred the EPA's ability to enforce  the laws that protect clean air and clean water. Now this  administration wants to give Mr. Pruitt the ultimate opportunity to  lead the Agency that he has worked so hard to undermine. And he hasn't  hidden the fact that he is utterly opposed to the EPA.   Let me highlight four statements that he has made that illustrate  this point. He said: ``The EPA was never intended to be our Nation's  frontline environmental regulator.''   The reality is that the opposite is true. The EPA was created for  exactly that reason. Before the EPA existed, there were a number of  offices and bureaus across the Federal Government that worked on  protecting the environment, but the government saw--Congress saw--that  it wasn't enough. Our Nation's waters were polluted, and the air was  not clean. People were getting sick and even dying because there wasn't  enough being done to protect the environment. So the intention behind  the EPA was absolutely to put a single Agency on the frontlines of  protecting and preserving clean air and clean water.   Not only does Mr. Pruitt disagree with the very mission of the EPA,  but he also doesn't seem at all interested in the work being done by  this Agency. He was asked during the confirmation process to name a  single protection on the books at the EPA. Here is his answer:         I have not conducted a comprehensive review of existing EPA       regulations. As attorney general, I have brought legal       challenges involving EPA regulations out of concern that EPA       has exceeded its statutory authority based on the record and       the law in that matter.    I mean, just as a parent--forget my job as a Senator--as a parent and  as a citizen, this really concerns me. I don't want to see the EPA led  by someone who is basically given a softball question in the  confirmation hearing: Name something you like about the EPA. But he  declines to go on the record supporting clean air or clean water.   I mean, you would think that he could just say: Well, I like the  Clean Water Act; I like the Clean Air Act. He could even offer caveats,  saying: I think there has been overreach, and I think there needs to be  a recalibration. Say whatever you want, but he couldn't even bring  himself to say he supports the Clean Air Act or the Clean Water Act.  That was the second comment that he made that was disturbing.   The third one relates to a Federal standard that targets pollution  that decreases visibility. Mr. Pruitt had this to say about these  standards:         [They] threaten the competitive edge Oklahoma has enjoyed       for years with low-cost and reliable electric generation.       This low-cost energy not only benefits Oklahoma       manufacturers, but gives our State a considerable edge in       recruiting new jobs.    What Mr. Pruitt is referring to is actually another reason why the  EPA was created in the first place. When States were in charge of  environmental protections, it was often a race to the bottom. Everyone  would try to lower their standards so that companies would move plants  and factories to their State. And the result is exactly what you would  imagine. Companies were happy to meet the lowest standard possible,  leaving huge messes for the State to clean up, and that is not a good  use of our taxpayer dollars.   It isn't the government's job to allow companies to make a huge mess  and say: Hey, we will clean that up for you. There is no need to clean  it up. We have it.   Let's look at how this has worked out for Oklahoma. I would like to  read an article by journalist, author, and climate expert Eric Pooley,  which was published by Time magazine:         Mercury is a deadly neurotoxin that damages the brains of       the ``developing fetus and young children,'' according to the       American Academy of Pediatrics. It is spewed into the air       from coal-fired power plants and other industrial sources       before settling into lakes and waterways and contaminating       the fish we eat.        But Pruitt's challenges against the EPA's mercury standards       include a tidy piece of scientific denial, claiming ``the       record does not support the EPA's findings that mercury . . .       pose[s] public health hazards.''        After that legal challenge failed, Pruitt sued a second       time to block the mercury rules--even though virtually all       power plants had already complied with them at a fraction of       the expected cost.        Thanks in part to the EPA rules Pruitt opposed, mercury       levels in Atlantic Bluefin tuna are rapidly declining.    This isn't an abstract thing. If there are high mercury levels in  fish and people eat the fish, they actually get the mercury poisoning.  This happens in Honolulu all the time. We like our fish. And people go  to the ER all the time. They don't know what it is, and it turns out  that it is mercury poisoning.         But Oklahomans aren't so lucky. While Pruitt was busy       trying to kill national mercury rules, the number of Oklahoma       lakes listed for mercury contamination was climbing. This       year, the state lists 40 lakes with fish consumption       advisories due to mercury levels--up from 19 listed in 2010.       Eight lakes were added just this year.        Another Attorney General might have been trying to identify       the sources of the pollution. But Pruitt was apparently too       busy suing the EPA.        Pruitt also attacks limits on ground level ozone. The       ground level ozone--better known as smog--despite the fact       that ozone problems are huge and worsening in Oklahoma. The       latest American Lung Association report gave all Oklahoma       counties surveyed an ``F'' for ozone problems and found that       the number of high ozone days had increased in most counties       as compared to 2010 to 2012.    The argument in this article can be boiled down to a single phrase:  With Mr. Pruitt leading the EPA, we can bet that as goes Oklahoma, so  goes the Nation. I can't speak for the people of Oklahoma, but I can  say that when it comes to these kinds of statistics on polluted air and  water, we would like to pass. If you ask most people in this country,  they would agree that this is not the kind of environment they want  their kids to grow up in.   The fourth disturbing statement Mr. Pruitt has made is about lead.  Because of the EPA we have seen lead levels in both kids and adults  drop by more than 80 percent in the past few decades. This is one of  the legacy achievements of this Agency. This is something the next  leader of the EPA should understand, but the senior Senator from  Maryland, Mr. Cardin, raised this during a confirmation hearing. The  Senator asked Mr. Pruitt if ``there is any safe level of lead that can  be taken into the human body, particularly a young person.'' Another  softball question.   Here is how Mr. Pruitt answered him: ``Senator, that is something I  have not reviewed nor know about.'' This is pretty alarming because  clearly he does not understand that in just 30 years this is an issue  that the EPA has taken on as a high priority. This is an issue that we  need the next leader to take seriously so we don't see any kind of  backsliding. If you look at Mr. Pruitt's actions, they do, in fact,  speak loudly about his approach to the EPA. Here is another news  report:         The new administration is reportedly looking to close the       Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, and instead       let individual program offices handle enforcement. The outlet       inside EPA quoted ``a source familiar with the plan'' who       says the Trump administration intends to ``disassemble the       enforcement office . . . take it, break it up, and move it       back into the program offices.''        Environmental advocates were quick to point out that Scott       Pruitt--the Oklahoma Attorney General Trump picked to lead       the EPA--made almost the same move back home. Pruitt closed       his office's Environmental Protection Unit not long after he       took office in 2011.    Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 14 minutes remaining.    But Mr. Pruitt did more than close Oklahoma's  Environmental Protection Unit. He also started a new unit solely  dedicated to suing the EPA. He closed the Environmental  [[Page S1320]]  Protection Unit and set up a unit to sue the EPA. That is all they do-- the other unit that people in Oklahoma might count on to investigate  water contamination or illegal dumping. Mr. Pruitt's new unit has been  quite active. Their office has filed more than a dozen lawsuits against  the EPA. He has sued the EPA because of the way it tackles cross-state  air pollution and the Agency's limits to oil and gas pollution. He sued  to allow air pollution when facilities start up, shut down,  malfunction, and to stop plans to address air pollution in his home  State.   He sued the EPA because he disagrees with the Clean Power Plan, which  will prevent an estimated 90,000 asthma attacks every year while saving  American families money on their electric bill. He sued EPA to end  protections against carbon pollution from new powerplants, even though  these protections will cost companies very little to implement, and he  challenged the clean water rule, which the EPA says protects the  streams and wetlands that form the foundation of our water resources.   This is not a comprehensive list. I think there are 17 lawsuits he  has filed. Guess what. Some of them are still pending. Mr. Pruitt was  asked: Will you recuse yourself from the lawsuits in which you are the  plaintiff? And he refused. So he is going to be the plaintiff and the  defendant.   I am sure Mr. Pruitt is a good person, I am sure he is good to his  family, but he also needs to be good to the American people and  faithful to the law: the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and Endangered  Species Act. This is the foundation of what the EPA does. He doesn't  get to have an opinion about those laws. He gets to implement those  laws. If he wants to run for office, he can run for office and change  those laws. If he wants to referee what authorities exist on those  lawsuits, he can litigate, but if he is going to be the EPA  Administrator, he has to check his ideological baggage at the door, and  there is only one way we can be sure that he will not take his biases  to the EPA.   I don't understand why in his confirmation hearing he didn't say:  Look, anywhere I brought suit, anywhere I am a plaintiff, I am out. It  is not unusual for a nominee to say on certain issues: I will recuse.  There is ample precedent. It was done this year. It is also just plain  common sense. It is the moral thing to do, the ethical thing to do, and  it is politically smart because it is a problem that this person wants  to remain plaintiff and defendant.   So it is disappointing and it is worrying. The agenda needs to uphold  the Agency's mandate not to dismantle what the EPA has already done.   Senator Booker asked Mr. Pruitt how many kids in Oklahoma had asthma.  Fair question to ask when you consider how many lawsuits Mr. Pruitt has  filed against the EPA that if he wins will increase air pollution, and  you can bet that more air pollution will hurt those kids who already  have trouble breathing. Mr. Pruitt did not know how many kids in his  home State have asthma, but here is the answer: 1 in 10--1 in 10 kids  have asthma.   If Mr. Pruitt takes over the EPA, he is no longer responsible for  just the kids in Oklahoma who have asthma. He is also responsible for  the kids across the country and in my home State of Hawaii. There are  millions of people in the United States who suffer from asthma, and for  each and every one of them, not to mention the countless others at  risk, Scott Pruitt guarantees that it will become harder to breathe.  Scott Pruitt is going to guarantee that it becomes harder to breathe  because he has sued the EPA to end the regulations that keep our air  clean enough for us to breathe. Never before in the history of the  Environmental Protection Agency has a President nominated someone so  opposed to the mission of the EPA. Look, this administration has made  it very clear where it stands on climate, on science, on protecting  clean air and clean water.   We have seen climate change called the Chinese hoax. We have heard  rumors that scientists will be muzzled and research stopped. We have  seen the President sign a law that allows oil companies to hide what  kinds of payment it is making to foreign governments in exchange for  extracting oil. So there is no question that dirty energy is preferred  by the current administration, but that doesn't mean the Senate has to  be a rubberstamp here.   We are the Senate, and the United States Senate has a specific role  under our Constitution and in our history. There comes a time where  issues related to party have to be subsumed by issues related to the  health and welfare of the country, and we have strayed from the  bipartisan consensus that existed for decades and decades and decades,  the basic premise that it is an American value in every small town, in  every urban place from coast to coast, and everywhere in between,  everybody likes clean air and clean water. Everybody at some point on a  weekend wants to drive someplace or walk someplace and just be outside  and be able to take a deep breath, enjoy your family, enjoy your  friends, enjoy not having to work for 2 or 3 hours--go fishing, go  hunting, go hiking, go surfing, go snowboarding, go skiing, whatever it  is that people like to do to kind of restore themselves, that depends  on our commitment to a legacy, and it depends on a commitment to these  statutes. It really does. It depends on our commitment to the Clean Air  Act and to the Clean Water Act and to the Endangered Species Act.   I will just close with this. I have never seen the Senate in such a  rush when there is not an actual deadline. I mean, we hurry when the  government may shut down--and sometimes we screw that up too--but  usually when we are in a hurry like this, when we are doing all night,  there is a reason for it. I think it is just weird that congressional  delegation trips overseas were canceled, multiple Members on a  bipartisan basis were supposed to be meeting with NATO allies about 2  hours from now, but all of that got canceled.   Normally our vote is on a Thursday afternoon or a Friday morning, and  this vote is at 1 p.m. on Friday. That is because somebody is bound and  determined to get this vote done before those 3,000 emails between  Scott Pruitt and a bunch of energy companies are disclosed. It is not a  theoretical thing anymore. There was some talk about whether this was  going to be disclosed. Now a judge is ordering that these emails get  disclosed. Now everybody seems to be in an incredible hurry to make  sure that we conduct this vote before those emails are disclosed.   I was talking to Senator Whitehouse and Senator Murphy about the  content of those emails. I don't know what is in those emails, but here  is what I know. I know the attorney general spent 750 days trying not  to disclose those emails. I know they are between him and a bunch of  energy companies. I know there seems to be a strong motivation on the  Republican side to conduct the vote before we get the emails. And in  the world's greatest deliberative body, it seems absolutely reasonable  and consistent with our constitutional obligation to provide advice and  consent on nominees and especially for a Cabinet position as important  as this.   It just seems like we should probably wait to see what is in those  emails. If I were a Republican on the other side, I would be very  uncomfortable casting a ``yes'' vote, and I would be waking up Tuesday  morning, probably at 1 a.m., and checking on the Internet and hoping  there was nothing explosive in those emails. I hope there is nothing  explosive in those emails. I don't want to know that we just confirmed  someone who is inappropriate for the EPA, but we are going to know by  Tuesday.   If my concerns are not well-founded, great. We can vote two Mondays  from now, and we will have a new EPA nominee, but why not wait to find  out what is in the emails. So I urge a ``no'' vote tomorrow, but more  than that, I urge that we give ourselves the time to deliberate and to  be a Senate.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.
