 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call  up House Resolution 696 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 696         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 195)       to amend title 44, United States Code, to restrict the       distribution of free printed copies of the Federal Register       to Members of Congress and other officers and employees of       the United States, and for other purposes, with the Senate       amendment thereto, and to consider in the House, without       intervention of any point of order, a motion offered by the       chair of the Committee on Appropriations or his designee that       the House concur in the Senate amendment with an amendment       consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115-55. The       Senate amendment and the motion shall be considered as read.       The motion shall be debatable for one hour equally divided       and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of       the Committee on Appropriations. The previous question shall       be considered as ordered on the motion to its adoption       without intervening motion.        Sec. 2.  The requirement of clause 6(a) of rule XIII for a       two-thirds vote to consider a report from the Committee on       Rules on the same day it is presented to the House is waived       with respect to any resolution reported through the       legislative day of January 20, 2018.        Sec. 3.  It shall be in order at any time through the       legislative day of January 20, 2018, for the Speaker to       entertain motions that the House suspend the rules as though       under clause 1 of rule XV. The Speaker or his designee shall       consult with the Minority Leader or her designee on the       designation of any matter for consideration pursuant to this       section.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Oklahoma is recognized  for 1 hour.    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.

General Leave     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.  [[Page H504]]    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Oklahoma?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Rules Committee met and ordered  a rule for consideration of the Senate amendment to H.R. 195, the  Extension of Continuing Appropriations Act of 2018. The rule provides  for 1 hour of debate, equally divided and controlled by the chair and  the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee.   Mr. Speaker, the appropriations package in front of us represents the  fourth continuing resolution to fund the government for the fiscal year  2018. In bringing up this bill, the House is fulfilling its primary  obligation to the American people: to fund the government and keep the  government open and operating.   With the package under consideration today, Congress will fund the  government through February 16, 2018. We will provide crucial dollars  to keep the government functioning, to support our troops and the  military, and to ensure we are all working for the American people. We  will provide time to negotiate a larger agreement on funding the  government for the remainder of the fiscal year, as well as a badly  needed immigration reform measure.   In addition to funding the government, this bill also includes  several other important provisions. Most notably, it reauthorizes the  Children's Health Insurance Program--or CHIP, as it is popularly  known--for 6 years. It also implements critical delays in certain taxes  imposed by the Affordable Care Act, including a 2-year delay for the  medical device tax, a 2-year delay for the so-called Cadillac tax on  health insurance plans, and a 1-year delay on the health insurance tax.   As a supporter of repealing and replacing the entire Affordable Care  Act, I am gratified to see this delay in imposing these harmful taxes  on the American people.   Finally, I am also pleased that this bill provides additional funding  for ballistic missile defense, which is of crucial importance when  dealing with rogue states like North Korea.   Mr. Speaker, in 2017, Congress actually got a great deal done. The  House and the Senate have worked with President Trump to do more to  deregulate the economy and free small businesses from harmful  regulations than any previous Congress.   The Senate has been productive in overhauling the judicial branch,  confirming a new Supreme Court Justice and 12 judges for the courts of  appeals. The House and the Senate have approved and passed into law a  new National Defense Authorization Act, which will provide new tools to  rebuild and strengthen our military in the face of global threats.   We have passed two supplemental appropriations bills to deal with the  damage caused by multiple disasters across the country, and I am  confident we will pass a third in the days ahead.   Above all, the crown jewel in this first year of the 115th Congress  has been the passage of major tax reform legislation, which will boost  the economy, reduce the tax burden on workers, support working  families, and simplify and modernize our burdensome Tax Code. I am  particularly pleased this bill included the repeal of the ObamaCare  individual mandate.   The place where Congress has not gotten its job done is in the  appropriations process. This is not the fault of the House of  Representatives. Under the leadership of Chairman Black, the House  wrote and passed a budget for FY18--fiscal year '18--in April. Through  the efforts of Chairman Frelinghuysen and the other members of the  Appropriations Committee, the House wrote and passed all 12  appropriations bills prior to the start of the fiscal year.   However, our friends in the Senate have failed to act. We have been  waiting for over 120 days--4 months--for the Senate to either act on  our bills or write their own and send us passed appropriations  legislation to consider. The Senate has not done so. Given their  failure to act, we need yet another additional short-term CR to ensure  the government remains open.                                time  1345    It is my hope, in the interim, that the leaders of the two Chambers  and the President will be able to come together to determine what our  spending top lines will be for the fiscal year 2018. Once that happens,  all the interested parties can meet to put together a bipartisan and  bicameral full-year spending bill.   If the leadership of both Chambers come to an agreement, I am  confident that the appropriators can produce bills to fund the  government in fiscal year 2018 and begin the important task of  producing a budget for fiscal year 2019.   Let me be crystal clear about the consequences of voting against the  underlying legislation:   A vote against the underlying legislation is a vote against  reauthorizing the Children's Health Insurance Program.   A vote against the underlying legislation is a vote to tax the health  insurance plans of millions of Americans.   A vote against the underlying legislation is a vote to tax the  medical devices that millions of Americans rely on.   A vote against the underlying legislation is a vote against badly  needed funds to protect America against missile attacks from rogue  states like North Korea.   And a vote against the underlying legislation is a vote to shut down  the government of the United States.   I hope every Member on both sides of the aisle understands these  consequences and votes accordingly.   Mr. Speaker, today's CR accomplishes several important tasks and  keeps our government open and operating. But there is still more work  to be done. In the words of Winston Churchill: ``Give us the tools, and  we will finish the job.''   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the rule and the underlying  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, my good friend refers to the drama of the moment.  Frankly, there wouldn't be any drama if Democrats would simply vote to  keep the government open while good faith negotiations are going on on  the very topics they are most concerned about.   They are concerned about the immigration issue; there is a  negotiation under way. They are concerned about the appropriate balance  between military and nonmilitary spending in the budget; there is a  negotiation that is under way.   Now, I suspect this effort to threaten a government shutdown in order  to achieve policy aims that are unrelated to the funding and operation  of the government will not succeed in this House. Here, we have a  simple majority. But to my friend's point, and to be fair, that is not  the case in the United States Senate. There, Democratic votes will be  needed to keep the government open.    Now, this House's responsibility is to do everything we can to keep  the government functioning. In addition to that, there are important  policy objectives in here that my friends, I think, either agree with  or have even been demanding.   The reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program is  something both sides agree on. Actually, the 6-year extension is a year  beyond what the Democrats asked for when the legislation was originally  considered last fall. That is something I know they agree with, and I  would hope they would vote for it.   A couple of the unattractive parts of the Affordable Care Act, which  even  [[Page H506]]  my opponents who supported it en masse agree with:   It is not very smart to tax the health insurance plans of American  workers. We have got a delay of that for 2 years.   They also agree it is not wise to tax medical devices. Again, we have  a measure in here that would delay that for 2 years.   They also, I know, believe that we ought to protect the American  people against missile attacks from rogue states. There is a request  from the Pentagon in here, again, that is fully funded.                                time  1400    There is absolutely nothing in this bill that my friends on the other  side object to. There are many things that they support. Now, they are  perfectly free to say, well, I would like this, and this, and this, and  this added. But there is nothing in here to vote against.   If you want to raise the other issues, I suspect we can work out an  agreement. And I suspect those issues are being negotiated, literally,  right now in budget discussions and budget talks. So that is the  appropriate place to deal with them. But, again, there is no reason to  shut down the government or threaten a shutdown unless you are trying  to force some unrelated policy objective.   In this case, the immigration issue that my friend refers to,  actually things extend into March. There are talks underway there. I  don't see how shutting down the government moves us toward that  solution.   The same thing is true with the other functions of government. So I  would say we have a very reasonable prospect or proposal on the table  here. I suspect that we will achieve the majority in this Chamber. Then  we will go to the United States Senate, and we will see whether  Democrats there really do want to shut down the government, as opposed  to pass a number of items that they agree with: keep the government  running and keep negotiations going.   That is the responsible thing to do. That is what I think this House  will do. That is what I hope Members on both sides of the aisle choose  to do, both when they vote here and later when they take this matter up  for consideration in the United States Senate.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let's be crystal clear on something. The House of  Representatives never held up CHIP. It actually passed it in October.  We are still waiting for Democrats in the Senate to work with  Republicans in the Senate and send us something back. In the meantime,  in this bill, my friend said they want to reauthorize CHIP. We  reauthorized it for 6 years. There is nothing in it they object to.  They believe in the program. I believe in the program. It has had  bipartisan support.    When we passed it, it got almost every Republican vote, a couple of  dozen Democratic votes. We actually made the bill better in the  process, so if you want to fix CHIP, you just simply need to vote for  this bill.   And my friends, frankly, we wouldn't be racing Members back here, or  the President of the United States, if my friends weren't threatening  to block vote against funding the government while negotiations are  underway. What advantage do you have in shutting down the government of  the United States, which is precisely what my friends are threatening  to do? I think they will not succeed here but actually have the ability  to do it in the United States Senate, should they choose to do it under  the rules of that body.   While negotiations are going on, if you think shutting down the  government is a good idea, I beg to differ. If you are using it as a  negotiating tactic, then you ought to be ashamed, because that is no  way to treat the American people.   We are operating in good faith. There is not an item in this bill  that offends any Democrat. Nobody I know is against CHIP. We just heard  that. Nobody I know is against delaying the Cadillac tax or the medical  device tax in ObamaCare--two parts of that bill that even my friends  who supported it tend to disagree with. I know my friends are not  opposed to providing ballistic missile defense for the United States of  America. I know my friends surely don't want to handicap the American  military at a dangerous time by a government shutdown. There is nothing  in here that could possibly be offensive to them.  [[Page H507]]    And there are negotiations underway on the very items they are most  concerned about: immigration and the appropriate balance in funding  level. Shutting down the government while those negotiations are  underway isn't going to help us get DACA reform, isn't going to help us  actually get a budget that we can operate on. It will actually just  simply switch attention away from those and create a crisis, which I  assume my friends think will work, somehow, to their political benefit.   I don't think that is true, and I speak from some experience here. I  argued against it, but I watched my own side do something like this  when it came to defunding ObamaCare. It was not successful. It was not  the appropriate way to proceed, and there was a pretty harsh verdict by  the American people.   I suggest my friends are running the same risk today. Now, they have  every right to do this. I never question any Member's right to vote how  they think is appropriate, but, in this case, in this body, I think we  have the votes to make sure that they don't shut down the government as  they have threatened to do.   In the United States Senate, that is going to be up to them. Frankly,  if Democratic Senators want to shut down the government to achieve some  policy objective, that is their choice. But I think it will be crystal  clear at the end of the day who actually closed down the government for  some unrelated policy aim that was actually under negotiation at the  time.   So I would, again, just urge my friends to benefit from our  experience and sit down and keep negotiating while we keep the  government open. I think if we do that, we will arrive at a  constructive solution for the American people. I think if we don't, it  is going to be a political crisis that was unprovoked and unnecessary.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Just to be clear with my good friend from Texas, Democrats didn't  pass a budget. They proposed a budget. That is fair enough, but they  never passed a budget in this House. There was a budget that was passed  by the Republican majority. It is interesting, that budget actually  came into balance within 10 years. Our friends on the other side never  presented a budget that came into balance from any of their various  groups.   Frankly, the last administration never presented a budget that ever  came into balance. So it is hard to talk about a budget that never  comes into balance as if it is a responsible document. It is clearly  not.   In terms of my friend's concern about CHIP, it is an appropriate  concern. The answer is right in front of her. Simply vote for this  bill. You got a 6-year authorization that was longer than my friends  originally asked for in the negotiations that were last fall.                                time  1415    This House has actually, again, met all of its obligations. My  friends' counterparts in the other body, frankly, have used their votes  under the rules of that body to sabotage any appropriations process  whatsoever. It requires 60 votes in the United States Senate.  Unfortunately, we only have 51. So if Democrats won't sit down and  negotiate, nothing much gets done over there. That is why we are here  today. Frankly, we are here to make sure the government doesn't shut  down.   Now, again, my friends have every right to vote to shut down the  government. If they vote ``no'' on this measure, that is exactly what  they are doing. They are voting to shut down the government. They are  voting not to reauthorize CHIP. They are voting to tax the American  people by putting taxes on their healthcare plans and putting taxes on  medical devices. They are missing the opportunity to help us with  missile defense in a very dangerous era. And they are throwing away the  time while negotiations on the topics they are concerned about are  underway--negotiations on the budget and negotiations on DACA.   So why my friends want to do this at this particular point is beyond  me. But I would suggest it is not likely to work. It is likely to  backfire. If we end up in a government shutdown--something I would very  much advise against--I think my friends, all of whom will have voted to  shut down the government, will bear the responsibility. I think the  American people will understand.   Now, again, I don't think my friends will succeed in this House, but  they may well in the upper Chamber because, up there, they do have the  votes under the rules of that body to shut down the government. I would  urge them not to do that and to keep the government operational, to  take these victories--and they are victories where we agree--and keep  negotiating on the issues that most concern us. I think that is the  appropriate way to proceed, and I would urge my friends to adopt that  course.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a press release from--my friends  may have missed this--the Children's Hospital Association.                       [Press Release, Jan. 18, 2018]      Children's Hospitals to Congress: Kids Can't Wait, Fund CHIP Now         Washington, DC.-- The Children's Health Insurance Program       (CHIP) is vital to millions of children and families. These       families have been living with uncertainty since funding for       CHIP expired at the end of September. States are exhausting       all available program funds and have announced plans to       freeze enrollment and, in some cases, end their programs       altogether. Kids can't wait any longer.        Congress has a chance to pass a long-term extension of CHIP       that will provide security for millions of kids. The       continuing resolution being considered by Congress includes a       six-year extension of CHIP. Children's hospitals support a       long-term extension of CHIP and urge Congress to take this       opportunity to pass CHIP this week. The time is now to extend       funding for this lifeline millions of children and their       families count on every day.        About the Children's Hospital Association--the Children's       Hospital Association is the national voice of more than 220       children's hospitals, advancing child health through       innovation in the quality, cost and delivery of care.     Mr. Speaker, the Children's Hospital Association has  actually urged that this bill be adopted. They have urged that we, for  6 years, ensure the funding. They would like my friends--who I know  believe in the program--to actually vote for the measure in front of  them.   Now, we have heard a number of things about kicking the can down the  road. I confess, keeping the government open while negotiations are in  progress is something we are trying to do.  [[Page H509]]    But I also point out this is not simply a normal CR. It settles the  Children's Health Insurance Program for the next 6 years and  appropriately funds it. It delays tax increases, which my friends also  oppose, although they voted for them in ObamaCare on people's health  insurance programs and on medical devices. It provides badly needed  dollars for missile defense in an era of crisis with an irresponsible  state.   It doesn't have anything in it that offends my friends in any way.  There is nothing in this bill they are against. If they are, I would  like to know.   Is it CHIP that my friends are against? Is it delaying the Cadillac  tax that my friends are against? Is it, frankly, delaying the medical  device tax increase that my friends are against? Is it putting more  money in ballistic missile defense that my friends are against? Or is  it just continuing the government's operations that my friends are  against while negotiations are underway?   I am not sure which one my friends are for, but it suggests to me if  there is nothing in here they are against, then they ought to be voting  for the bill.   Finally, to my friend's point--and there is more to this than their  comments would suggest--to suggest that we simply can control the  universe around here isn't true. We don't write the Senate rules. I  wish we did. They would probably look a lot different and we probably  would have less of a problem. But my friends have not been able to shut  down the government here, although they tried to in December. I don't  think they will be able to shut down the government, although they will  try to again today.   But in the United States Senate, the Democrats will decide whether or  not the government continues to operate; whether or not CHIP is  reauthorized for 6 years, as the Children's Hospital Association urges;  whether or not millions of American families are spared from a tax  increase simply because they fought and worked for a decent insurance  plan; whether or not millions of Americans who depend on medical  devices for their survival have to pay more for them; and whether or  not we have a higher level of certainty that we can defend ourselves  against an unprovoked and dangerous attack that might occur at any  moment.   That will be a decision for Democrats in the Senate to make as long  as we vote here to move this legislation forward. I think we will, and  I would invite my friends to join us in that.   There is nothing in here that offends my friends. There are many  things that my friends like, and there are negotiations underway on the  things that are my friends' concerns.   I would suspect that is the course that we ought to take, and I would  urge my friends to reconsider and adopt that course.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am certainly prepared to close whenever my  good friend is.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to, as always, thank my good friend. We disagree  on this, but there is nobody that I enjoy serving with on the Rules  Committee more than my good friend, the ranking member. She is a wise  and able legislator.   There are a couple of things she said I am going to agree with. She  did say that facts matter. I actually agree with that. Facts do matter  here, and the fact of the matter is anyone who votes ``no'' on this  resolution is voting to shut down the government. Anyone--Republican or  Democrat--who votes ``no'' has said: I am not willing to keep the  government open while negotiations are underway.   Anyone who votes ``no'' is voting against a 6-year extension of the  Children's Health Insurance Program that we all agree on to say is  critical. Anyone who votes ``no'' is absolutely guaranteed a tax  increase or will be voting for a tax increase on American workers who  happen to have a fairly decent insurance program. Anybody who votes  ``no'' is going to raise taxes on Americans who are ill enough to  require medical devices.   Anyone who votes ``no'' is going to make sure we don't have the  resources we need to protect this country in a time of international  crisis against a potential rogue missile attack.                                time  1430    Anyone who votes ``no,'' to begin where I started, is voting to shut  down  [[Page H510]]  the government. It is that simple. My friends did that in December  because they thought, ``Well, they can't do it without us,'' but we  did. I suspect we will be able to do that again. But I regret that  anyone would vote ``no'' on those kinds of votes because I think they  will come back to haunt them.   My friend also--and I think this may actually be the key to the  issue--quoted polling data that said the Republicans are going to get  the blame anyway. That may be true. I don't doubt the accuracy of my  friend's numbers, but I suspect that, once they watch the process, the  American people are pretty smart and they will understand a ``no'' vote  is a vote to shut down the government.   Now, if my friends are gambling that Republicans will get the blame  for this because they have done this in the past, I think they are  running a terrible risk with their own credibility.   In this body, we will succeed. I don't serve in the United States  Senate, never served in the United States Senate, never worked for  anybody who served in the Senate. They have rules that will allow the  Democrats to shut down the government if they choose to do it. I don't  think they will. But if they do, I think they will regret it.  Certainly, many on my side regret some of the decisions they made in  the last crisis of this kind.   I hope we do the responsible thing in this body and count on cooler  heads in the United States Senate to do the same thing.   I also would point out that in this bill that my friends are going to  vote ``no'' on--probably in overwhelming numbers, I am sad to say-- there is nothing in it they disagree with. They don't disagree with the  CHIP reauthorization. They don't disagree with delaying taxes in the  Affordable Care Act. They don't disagree with providing additional  missile defense.   They tell us they want to keep the government operating, particularly  when there are negotiations underway on the matters that actually  concern them. That strikes me as incredibly disingenuous, shortsighted,  or both.   So I urge my friends: Do what you must on the rule. The rule is the  rule. That is always a partisan exercise, and I always respect my  friends for voting ``no'' on a rule. But the underlying legislation is  real: whether or not the government operates; whether or not we take  care of these knotty problems where we happen to agree; whether or not  we actually put the well-being of the country, in terms of its defense,  above the media partisan interests. Those things are all areas that  shouldn't be tough votes.   So I would hope my friends reconsider, come down and vote to keep the  government running instead of shutting it down, come down and vote to  keep taxes from being imposed on hardworking families through their  health insurance plan or medical devices, come down and vote to make  sure we have the strongest possible defense against any possible attack  on our country, and come down and vote to keep the government open  while negotiations are underway. I think the failure to do that is one  that my friends will look back on with deep regret in the years ahead.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I encourage all Members to support the rule.  Today's bill represents the next step toward fulfilling our primary  obligation as Members of Congress: to fund the government. Although not  perfect, the bill before us today will fund our government and keep it  open and operating through February 16, 2018.   We will also reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program for  6 years and achieve a delay in several harmful Obama taxes. While doing  so, we bolster the defense of our country at a dangerous time.   While I look forward to completing our work and passing a bipartisan,  bicameral full-year omnibus spending bill, for now, this legislation  will keep the government open and operating and give us time to  continue working toward a bipartisan agreement for the American people.   I applaud my colleagues for their work.   The material previously referred to by Ms. Slaughter is as follows            An Amendment to H. Res. 696 Offered by Ms. Slaughter         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 4. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       4820) to extend funding for certain public health programs,       and for other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall       be dispensed with. All points of order against consideration       of the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to       the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided among       and controlled by the respective chairs and ranking minority       members of the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee       on Energy and Commerce. After general debate the bill shall       be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At       the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the       Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with       such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and       amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit with or without       instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports       that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the       next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the       third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV,       resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 4820.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous  question.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.
