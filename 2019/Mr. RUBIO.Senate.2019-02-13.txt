 Mr. President, it is my privilege to honor a  Florida small business that exemplifies innovation and how thinking  outside of the box to solve problems can create technological  breakthroughs. As chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business  and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize a small business that  embodies the unique American entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is  my distinct privilege to honor JL Marine Systems, Inc., as the Senate  Small Business of the Week.   Located in Tampa, FL, JL Marine Systems is known in fishing  communities throughout the country as the manufacturer of the Power- Pole shallow water anchor. John Oliverio, the creator of the Power- Pole, has been an angler for all his life and used this experience to  create a more practical approach to shallow water fishing. As a flats  fisherman, he was frustrated that bringing his boat to a stop with a  push pole or an anchor required him to lose sight of fish. In 1998,  John devised the concept for an anchor that he could lower from  anywhere, allowing him to keep his eyes on fish. Today, the Power-Pole  is a premier shallow water anchor, featuring sophisticated technology  for more effective shallow water fishing.   JL Marine Systems' Power-Pole technology is available in five  different models, at more than 3,500 dealers, manufacturers, and  retailers. These quality products have helped JL Marine Systems to  build strong partnerships in the boating and fishing industries and has  earned accolades at professional fishing tournaments, in magazines, and  on television shows. The Power-Pole won Best New Boating Accessory at  the International Convention of Allied Sportsfishing Trades in 2011,  2012, and 2013 and won awards for its electronics at the International  Boatbuilders Exhibition and Conference in 2017.   JL Marine Systems' commitment to a higher standard is not only seen  in their innovative products and customer service, but also in how the  company gives back to its community. JL Marine Systems is a proud  supporter of the Florida Aquarium, the Coastal Conservation  Association, the National Pediatric Cancer Foundation, and numerous  other organizations. The company also supports its community by hosting  hurricane relief fundraisers and by sponsoring Tampa-area youth sports  teams and high school and college fishing teams.   John Oliverio's work to develop and produce the Power-Pole shallow  water anchor represents the innovation that Floridian entrepreneurs are  known so well for. Through hard work and perseverance, John and his  team at JL Marine Systems have revolutionized the shallow water anchor  and have set an excellent example of ingenuity. I would like to  congratulate John and the entire team at JL Marine Systems for being  named the Senate Small Business of the Week. I wish them good luck and  look forward to watching their continued growth and success.  [[Page S1324]]                                ____________________
