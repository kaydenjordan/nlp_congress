 I am former Congressman Joe DioGuardi. I would like to  introduce, in the spirit of bipartisanship and emerging democracies,  guests from Southeast Europe. If you don't mind, I would like to  welcome them.    From Albania, we have Monika Kryemadhi. She is the first female to  run a political party in Albania. She is joined here by her chairperson  for the Foreign Policy Committee of that group, Klajda Gjosha, and the  chief of staff, Eriol Braimllari.   We also have Faton Bislimi, a Harvard graduate. He is from Kosovo.   We have from Presevo, a part of southern Serbia that has 100,000  Albanians, we have the mayor of Bujanovac, a majority Albanian city,  one of the three in Presevo, in southern Serbia. We have Ragmi Mustafa  and Ardita Sinani.   I just wanted to be sure that they know they are welcome. I know  Shirley and I have been pushing, because we represent a nonprofit  called the Albanian American Civic League, an advocacy group. We are  volunteers; we don't get paid; but we are pushing for an Albanian study  group.   The Albanians are the least understood people in Europe, Southeast  Europe, and they were divided unfairly, after World War I, into six  different countries to, clearly, politically keep them weak.   By the way, the honoree today, we know, Connie Morella. What you  don't know and I found out through the Former Members Association, like  my dad, she comes from a family that has Albanian roots. My dad came  here in 1929 speaking only two languages--he was 15--Albanian and  Italian. He comes from the people who were driven out of Albania in the  15th century by the Ottoman Turks and occupying for 425 years until  World War I. Connie's family spoke Albanian, her grandparents, and so  did mine.
