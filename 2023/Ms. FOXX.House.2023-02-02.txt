 Mr. Speaker, I thank my great friend from Wisconsin, who  serves on the Education and the Workforce Committee, and is a very  valuable member of that committee, as well as the Oversight and  Accountability Committee.   Mr. Speaker, today, the House rightfully condemned and denounced  socialism in all forms and resolved to oppose socialist policies.   As the Bible says in Proverbs 14, ``All hard work brings a profit,  but mere talk leads only to poverty.''   Socialism is mere talk. Socialism is the idea that if you work hard,  your neighbor will enjoy the fruits of your labor.   Socialist regimes, in just the last 100 years, have impoverished,  enslaved, starved, and even killed over 100 million people. This is a  horrific cost borne by far, far too many.   Socialism, no matter its form, will never have a place in our  Republic.
