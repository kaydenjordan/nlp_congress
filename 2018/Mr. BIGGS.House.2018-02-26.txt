 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the extraordinary  work of Sally Harrison.   Sally is the president and CEO of the Mesa Chamber of Commerce. She  has worked in this role since 2013. Mesa's business environment is  thriving with her at the helm.   Mr. Speaker, earlier this month, Sally led the meeting at Arizona  State University Polytechnic campus with Congressman Jim Bridenstine  and the Mesa Industry and Defense Council. Under her leadership, this  unique council continues to highlight the tremendous technological and  manufacturing capabilities we have in my district. There have been  positive reports of the discussion she facilitated, and I am confident  that she will continue to create these opportunities for my  constituents.   These conversations between local officials, Federal office holders,  and business leaders are paramount to ensuring that our constituents  receive the best possible representation. Sally understands this and is  working every day to facilitate enduring success in Mesa and our  region.   I thank her for her service to our great city.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (S. 772) to amend the PROTECT Act to make Indian tribes eligible for  AMBER Alert grants, as amended.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on S. 772, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to be a sponsor of the AMBER Alert in  Indian Country Act, in memory of the life of Ashlynne Mike.   I want to thank the House leadership and Chairman Goodlatte for  bringing this bill before the House for consideration.   Eleven-year-old Ashlynne lived in the Navajo Nation, the largest  Indian reservation in the United States, located in four States:  Arizona, Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico. Her favorite color was yellow,  and she enjoyed playing music for her friends and family. She was a  kindhearted young girl who had enormous potential.   After school on Monday, May 2, 2016, while Ashlynne and her 9-year- old brother Ian waited and played near the local bus stop, a stranger  approached and lured them into his vehicle by offering them a ride  home.   He abducted the children and took them to a remote part of the  reservation, where he abused Ashlynne, slaughtered her, and left her  brother to fend for himself in the desert. Ashlynne died alone.   Ashlynne had been abducted around 4 p.m. Her father filed a missing  person report at 6:53 p.m., within 3 hours. Unfortunately, authorities  did not send an AMBER Alert until 2:30 a.m. on Tuesday, almost 10 hours  after Ashlynne went missing.   According to law enforcement records, Tom Begay, Jr., Ashlynne's  perpetrator, admitted that Ashlynne was alive when he left her stranded  in the desert.   Mr. Speaker, had Indian Country been included as partners in the  AMBER Alert plans, law enforcement might have rescued Ashlynne in time.  She might still be alive and with us today.   When a child is abducted, action in those first hours is crucial to  their safe return. The AMBER Alert program has proven effective at  instantly providing information to the public to assist in the effort.   According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children,  of the AMBER Alerts issued in 2016, 94 percent of the recovered  children were found within the first 72 hours, including 47 percent who  were found within the first 3 hours.   Between 1997 and February 2017, the AMBER Alert program has been  credited with the safe recovery of 868 children. AMBER Alerts save  lives.   Today, we have the opportunity to ensure all children may benefit  from the AMBER Alert program if necessary, no matter where they reside.   This bill will reauthorize the Department of Justice grant program  that assists State and local governments in developing and implementing  AMBER Alert communications plans. It will explicitly require the  Department of Justice to perform a needs assessment of AMBER Alert  capabilities on Indian reservations.   It will also, for the first time, require funds be used to integrate  Tribal AMBER Alert systems with those of neighboring jurisdictions to  ensure that AMBER Alerts reach as many people as swiftly as possible.   Mr. Speaker, I again thank House leadership and Chairman Goodlatte  for bringing this bill forward and acknowledging the importance of  filling a gap in our AMBER Alert system that might have prevented the  death of Ashlynne.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. If enacted,  this bill will help to build a truly national and cohesive network of  AMBER Alert.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague from across the aisle. This  bill is truly a bipartisan effort, worked on by Members of both  parties. It is because of its importance.   The particular case that both of us have cited today does focus the  attention on the massive hole where there are more than 500 Indian  Tribes that do not have access to the AMBER Alert system. It is the  only part of this Nation and its territories that is not covered by the  AMBER Alert system. This will solve that problem.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
