 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Walden, Ranking  Member Pallone, and the committee for their hard work on this  bipartisan bill.   This legislation includes my bill, H.R. 5007, the Tribal Broadband  Deployment Act, which will direct the FCC to improve broadband access  on Tribal lands within 30 months.   For the communities in my congressional district, California's 36th  District, and throughout our Nation, this will be a game changer.  Throughout the Coachella Valley, the San Jacinto Mountain communities,  and the Pass regions of California, rural, underdeveloped Tribal lands  are spread out among non-Tribal communities, both of which are often  lacking broadband internet and both of which will benefit.   My bill will bring real resources and opportunities to these areas,  improving connectivity and helping to close the digital divide in these  historically underserved communities. With expanding access to the  internet, families, students, workers, and businesses will be able to  harness the power of their ideas and information to achieve their  dreams and grow our local economies.   I want to thank Chairman Blackburn for honoring her commitment to  work with me on this issue.   I urge the House to pass this important bipartisan bill.
