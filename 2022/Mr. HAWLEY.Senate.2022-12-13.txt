 Mr. President, in reserving the right to object, I ask  for permission to hold up this shirt.    Mr. President, this is Jared Schmitz, Lance Corporal  Schmitz, from the State of Missouri, Wentzville, MO. His father made  this T-shirt and gave it to me just a couple of weeks ago, when I last  had the chance to visit with him.   Lance Corporal Schmitz was killed in action at Abbey Gate on August  22 of last year. On the back are the 12 other marines who were lost,  along with Lance Corporal Schmitz, on that day.   When I saw his father and he gave me the shirt, he told me about all  they are doing to honor Jared's memory. He asked me to continue to  fight to uphold that memory and to get answers, and I said: That is  exactly what I will do.   The truth is that this family and the families of the other lost  marines and every American citizen have been waiting too long for  answers about what happened at Abbey Gate, over a year ago, as the  Senator from Hawaii rightly notes. We are waiting for answers as to why  the commanders on the ground weren't heeded. We are waiting for answers  as to why the White House wasn't ready to do a proper evacuation. We  are waiting for answers about how the security situation so  deteriorated that 13 servicemembers were killed and hundreds of  American civilians were left behind to terrorists there in Afghanistan.  We are still waiting for answers.   No, I am not willing to pretend that everything is fine at the  Pentagon. Everything is not fine at the Pentagon. I am not willing to  say that business as usual should go on. No, I am not willing to waive  the rules of regular order and expedite nominations without even having  a vote on the floor of this Senate, but I understand my colleague's  sense of urgency here. I understand that he wants to move these  nominations.                    Unanimous Consent Request--S. Res. 763    Mr. President, in the spirit of trying to reach a compromise, as he  proposes, I would just say this: Why don't we agree to take a vote-- just a vote--on having a select committee to look into what happened at  Abbey Gate and get those answers and make them public--not a commission  that will take years and years to report, Vietnam-style, when everybody  who made the decisions are safely out of power and collecting their  pensions, but a select committee that will report and make it public to  the American people and get real accountability--because who has been  fired over what happened at Abbey Gate? Nobody. Who has been held  accountable? Nobody. Who has given answers? Nobody.   Here is what I propose: I ask that the Senator modify his request so  that following confirmation of the Rumbaugh nomination, the Senate  proceed to legislative session; that the Committee on Rules and  Administration be discharged from further consideration; that the  Senate now proceed to S. Res. 763; further, that the resolution be  agreed to and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table.    I object.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, it has now  been 16 months since President Biden's disastrous withdrawal from  Afghanistan; 16 months since Lance Corporal Schmitz from Missouri and  12 other marines lost their lives at Abbey Gate; 16 months since  hundreds of American civilians were left behind to the enemy; 16 months  and no one has been fired, no one has offered answers. There has been  zero accountability.   So for approximately the 200th time, we are here on the floor as I  continue to fulfill my pledge to seek accountability for what happened  at Abbey Gate, for the lives that were lost, including a life from my  own State, Lance Corporal Schmitz, and to press for answers. It is not  too much to ask that not just the families of the fallen but that the  people of this country not be lied to about what happened at Abbey Gate  and that we be given the answers the American people deserve.   In that time, in those 16 months, Central Command has done an  exhaustive investigation and report. Here it is right here. It is  thousands of pages long. I can't seem to convince my friend from Rhode  Island to hold a hearing on it, so I have been entering it into the  Congressional Record page by page. We are about--I don't know--100  pages in. We have many hundreds more to go. But when we are finished,  everyone will be able to read this report in full. There have been  other reports since then. The Special IG for Afghanistan recently  issued his own report, that office's own report, about the collapse of  the Afghan Government. And what these reports have in common is a  consistent theme that commanders on the ground repeatedly  [[Page S7122]]  warned the administration, repeatedly warned the National Security  Council, repeatedly warned the State Department as early as the spring  of 2021 that the security situation was deteriorating rapidly, that the  Taliban was gaining ground rapidly, and that there needed be to be an  evacuation.   Yet what did the White House do? Well, according to the findings in  this report, nothing. Did they plan? No. Did they take action  necessary? No. And so on August 26, there was a terrorist explosion at  Abbey Gate. We lose those 13 marines. Hundreds of American civilians  are left behind in a botched evacuation. And here we are. Yet we are  asked to act as if nothing has happened, as if we should just go on,  business as usual. Keep the conveyor belt of nominees to this Pentagon  running with no votes, no votes on this floor, no debate on this floor;  just wave them through; waive regular order; move it right along;  nothing to see here. I am not willing to do that. I haven't been  willing to do it for over a year.    I hope my colleagues see now, a year on, that I was serious in August  of 2021 when I said I would not consent to waiving the rules to send  more nominees to this Pentagon until something is done to get answers  and, frankly, to change the culture because the truth is, we have a  cultural problem in the whole military-industrial complex.   This is an entity, an organization, that has lied to the American  people repeatedly over the years. They lied about Vietnam for a decade.  They lied about Iraq. They lied about the true state of the war in  Afghanistan. And now we are getting the same lies again, to the point  that we can't even hold a hearing in public because the White House  won't consent to it.   I don't really blame Chairman Reed. He can't get witnesses to come  testify in public because this White House doesn't want to say another  word about what happened at Abbey Gate. We have a word for that. It is  called a coverup, and it is time for it to stop.   Listen, much has been said about my blocking nominees. The truth is,  I can't block any nominee. All of these nominees can be brought to the  floor. They can't even be filibustered. It is just a matter of what the  Senate majority leader wants to do. Sadly my side is not in the  majority, and we are not going to be for the next 2 years. So if the  Senate majority leader sees fit to vote on these nominees, he can at  any time. But as to whether or not I will consent to waiving the rules  and allowing these nominees to the Pentagon in leadership positions to  be confirmed without even a vote--I will not until something changes at  the Pentagon, until something is done about what happened at Abbey  Gate.   I know that my colleague the chairman is acting in good faith. It is  a privilege to serve with him on the committee. I know he is in a tough  spot here because he has a White House that doesn't want to give an  inch and doesn't want to say a word. I would just say that I hope, with  real oversight coming soon in the House of Representatives, that the  Senate will see fit and see its way to doing its part and holding open  hearings on this report, on this tragedy, and making sure it does not  happen again.   With that, I object.
