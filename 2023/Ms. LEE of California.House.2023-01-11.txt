 Madam Speaker, as co-chair of the Pro-Choice  Caucus, I rise in opposition to H. Con. Res. 3.   Of course, we condemn all political violence, whether it is aimed at  those we agree with or disagree with.   These acts are all unacceptable, full stop. Hate speech quickly  becomes hate violence. In a democracy, violence is particularly awful  when it is designed to silence or intimidate.   Where were my colleagues every single time a doctor, a patient, a  nurse, or a security officer was threatened, assaulted, or murdered  just for providing, accessing, and safeguarding reproductive  healthcare?   Congresswoman DeGette, Congresswoman Pressley, and I have drafted a  resolution that condemns all attacks upon healthcare facilities,  healthcare personnel, and patients.   Every act of hate-fueled violence is worthy of condemnation,  including those against Planned Parenthood clinics, abortion providers  and patients, and other care providers.   We stand with survivors of those attacks. We condemn all of them, and  our GOP colleagues should do so, as well.
