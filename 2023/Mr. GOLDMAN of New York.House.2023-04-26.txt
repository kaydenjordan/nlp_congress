 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for  yielding.   Last week, Speaker McCarthy came to my district to speak at the New  York Stock Exchange to give a speech about this proposed default on  America act.   He threatened the Nation with economic catastrophe if we do not bend  to the draconian cuts to spending for services that are essential to  lifting up working and middle-class Americans.   The DOA doesn't touch the Trump tax cuts for the wealthy. It doesn't  touch defense spending. Instead, it solely targets domestic spending  that hundreds of millions of Americans depend on, with an average cut  of about 22 percent on those programs.   In my district alone, which is in New York City, there are more than  200,000 people who rely on Medicaid who will be at risk of losing their  coverage.   In my district, there are 31 public housing NYCHA complexes that are  crumbling that rely on funds from HUD just to maintain their poor  condition, and those funds would be slashed.   This is not a theoretical discussion. This will do real and  devastating harm to people in my district and around the country. We  must not pass this bill.
