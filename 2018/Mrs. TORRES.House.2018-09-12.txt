 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the House Amendment to  S. 2497, the Ileana Ros-Lehtinen Israel Security Assistance  Authorization Act. As Israel faces growing threats from Iran,  Hezbollah, and Hamas, this bill reaffirms the United States' strong  belief that Israel has the right to defend herself and ensures that  Israel has the means to do so. Passage of this bill will send a  powerful message to Israel's adversaries: the United States will  continue to stand with Israel. I will note that this bill is  appropriately named for my good friend, Congresswoman Ileana Ros- Lehtinen, who as we all know is departing at the end of this Congress.  Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen has been a strong supporter of Israel, a  champion of democracy across the world, and one of this chamber's true  believers in the ideal of bipartisan foreign policy. So I thank  Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen for her leadership, and I urge all my  colleagues to support this important measure.
