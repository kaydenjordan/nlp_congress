 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado, my  friend, for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the sacrifices of America's Gold  Star Mothers and families and to further the cause of building a  monument to acknowledge their contributions to our country.   One of these Gold Star Mothers is Judith Young, a neighbor of mine  down the street in Morristown, New Jersey. In October 1983, Judith lost  her son, Jeffrey, in the bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut.                                time  1330    Judith said that Jeffrey always wanted to be a soldier. He graduated  from high school in 1980 and went right into the Marines. He was proud  to be a Marine. He was proud to serve his country.  [[Page H1208]]    In the more than three decades since his death, Judith has been a  fierce advocate for her fellow Gold Star Mothers and Families. She  represents thousands of loved ones and family members who have  sacrificed so much for the freedoms we enjoy today.   It is that sacrifice that we seek to honor in the Gold Star Families  National Monument Extension Act. By passing this bill, we can give Gold  Star Families, like Judith's, the time they need to complete a monument  acknowledging that sacrifices aren't just made by those in uniform, but  by the loved ones left behind.   This is a monument that has a site selected; that won't cost  taxpayers a single dime; and that has truly bipartisan support. If we  don't pass this bill, the authorization for this monument will expire.   Our Gold Star Families have already been through so much. They have  already endured and sacrificed beyond what so many of us here can  understand; the least we can do is support them by giving them the time  to remember and honor those lost.   The futility in finding the words and actions to thank loved ones  like Judith isn't new. In a letter to Lydia Bixby of Massachusetts in  1864, President Lincoln wrote: ``I feel how weak and fruitless must be  any words of mine which should attempt to beguile you from the grief of  a loss so overwhelming.''   Lincoln understood that there is nothing we can ever do to truly  repay patriots like Judith. But he continued: ``But I cannot refrain  from tendering to you the consolation that may be found in the thanks  of the Republic they died to save.''   Let us show the thanks of the Republic that so many brave men and  women have given all to save. Let us show the thanks of the Republic  that so many Gold Star Families have given so much to keep free. We can  do that by passing this bipartisan bill and allowing the completion of  this monument.   I hope you will support me, my co-lead, Congressman Ratcliffe, and  the Gold Star Mothers and Families across the country in this effort.
