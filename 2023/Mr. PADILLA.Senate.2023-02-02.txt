 Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the  bipartisan American Music Fairness Act, which I have reintroduced with  Senator Blackburn today.   Artists pour their heart and soul into the music we enjoy.  Unfortunately, our current copyright laws do not adequately reflect the  value of what they have produced.   Currently, the United States is the only democratic country in the  world in which artists are not compensated for the use of their music  on AM/FM radio.   By requiring broadcast radio corporations to pay performance  royalties to creators for AM/FM radio plays, the American Music  Fairness Act would close an antiquated loophole in our copyright law  which has prevented artists from receiving compensation for the use of  their music for far too long.   This royalty stream would be particularly meaningful for the  thousands of working-class artists who are a critical part of our  country's vibrant music industry.   Additionally, when American-made music is played overseas, other  countries collect royalties for American artists and producers but  never pay those royalties to our artists because we do not reciprocate.  This inequity costs the American economy and artists more than $200  million each year. This is a serious injustice considering that America  is the origin of so much of the music listened to around the world.   So it is time, once and for all, to create a regime that is platform  neutral and which respects the hard work and dignity of our artists.   But I also want to be clear about something. I am a huge fan of and  true believer in the importance of local radio to the music industry  and to communities all across the United States that rely on radio to  receive timely and relevant news, entertainment, and emergency response  information. The American Music Fairness Act recognizes and  acknowledges the important role that locally owned radio stations play  by including protections for small, college, and noncommercial  stations.   I want to thank Senator Blackburn for introducing this bill with me,  and I hope our colleagues will join us in supporting the thousands of  artists across this country who create the music that contributes to  the soundtrack of our lives.                                  ______                                         By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Ms. Sinema, and Mr. King):   S. 255. A bill to authorize certain aliens seeking asylum to be  employed in the United States while their applications are being  adjudicated; to the Committee on the Judiciary.
