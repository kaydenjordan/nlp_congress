 Madam Speaker, six years ago this month, I heard the  phrase triple-negative breast cancer for the first time in my life. I  was in the oncologist's office with my newly diagnosed 29-year-old  daughter, Lauren, a day forever etched in my memory.   In the weeks that followed, I learned a great deal about this very  aggressive, rare form of breast cancer. Roughly 12 percent of breast  cancer survivors are designated as triple-negative.   It is the only form of breast cancer that doesn't respond to hormone  therapy, often requiring chemotherapy instead. And it claims the lives  of thousands of women and men each year. It stole Lauren from our  family in August of 2017.   Tomorrow, March 3, is Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Awareness Day. I  am humbled to sponsor a resolution to call attention to this awful  disease and to let the thousands of victims of triple-negative breast  cancer know they are not alone.                            ____________________
