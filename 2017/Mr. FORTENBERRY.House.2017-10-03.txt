 Madam Speaker, Maddie Brinckerhoff was an early  feminist author and lecturer from the Midwest, where I live, and she  had this to say about abortion: ``It is evidence that either by  education or circumstances that she''--the woman--``has been greatly  wronged.''   In this spirit, Madam Speaker, I think there is an opportunity here  to perhaps bring Congress together around a humane proposition that  requires thoughtful but necessary reflection on the deepest meanings of  pain.   We all know pain. But pain teaches us profound lessons about  suffering, sacrifice, patience, and the redemptive healing  possibilities of encountering one another in our vulnerability as  humans living in the interdependency of community. Pain is something  from which we naturally recoil, but it also enables us to build  compassion toward those who are weak, or dependent, or alone.   Madam Speaker, in letting our natural impulse to respond to another  who is in pain, we can grasp what it means to be truly ourselves, to be  truly human, and to care deeply about everyone, and to really  internalize what is at issue here.
