 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor U.S. Army veteran  James Ring.   After graduating high school, James enlisted in the Army and served  in both Iraq and Afghanistan. He later joined the Reserve Forces and,  at the same time, began a 13-year career as a City of Lakeland police  officer.   Now, in addition to serving as CEO for his own small business, James  is active with the Lakeland Chamber, promoting issues important to the  small business community.   Very soon, James will be returning to Active Duty and deploying  again. Now, that is commitment.   People like James make me proud not only to be an American, but proud  of my district. The spirit and the drive that propel him to serve our  community as a small business owner and our Nation as a uniformed  servicemember are unique and invaluable.   From the bottom of my heart, thank you, James. And thank you Ring  family for your service and your sacrifice. I know I speak on behalf of  the entire district when I say that we are so very proud of you.                            ____________________
