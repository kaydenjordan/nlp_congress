 Madam Speaker, as we recognize Black History  Month, I rise to celebrate the life and contributions of a remarkable  Detroit community activist.   While I was at the Macomb County Celebration of Black Excellence last  Saturday, the Michigan activist community received news of the loss of  Mama Lila Cabbil.   A close friend of Rosa Parks for 30 years, Ms. Cabbil was a national  leader in the fight against racism and a powerful Detroit activist,  particularly in the struggle for clean and accessible water.   At Rosa Parks' funeral service in 2005, Ms. Cabbil invoked Matthew  7:16: ``You shall know them by their fruits.'' When I read those words  today, I think of Mama Lila's commitment to Michigan's Black community  and to all communities that have suffered the theft of their voting  rights and the unjust loss of their homes and their water.   During Black History Month, it is my honor to highlight Mama Lila's  contribution to Detroit and our region and the example she sets for all  of us as a passionate servant leader.                            ____________________
