 Mr. President, I thank my colleague and good friend,  Chairman Hatch, for his courtesies. We have worked very closely  together on this nomination. This was a challenging task, and I thank  Chairman Hatch for his cooperation.   Mr. Lighthizer needed a waiver because he had represented foreign  interests. It was extremely important that we work with Senator Manchin  and other colleagues to address the enormous needs of the miners, and  we had a whole host of Members with a variety of extremely important  trade issues--matters like steel, aluminum, and digital goods in our  part of the world; we also care about softwood lumber tremendously.   Chairman Hatch and I worked with all the members of the Finance  Committee. It was a unanimous vote, and I thank him for his  cooperation.   We have talked a little bit about trade and what a modern trade  policy is going to look like. The Lighthizer discussion is the  beginning of the debate on trade in this Congress, and I have tried to  be clear about my agenda. My agenda is to create more red, white, and  blue jobs in America--high-skilled, high-waged jobs. Very often, the  trade jobs pay better than do the nontrade jobs because there is more  value added in them; there is a higher level of productivity. So my  view is, as we set out on this journey to get more high-skilled, high- waged jobs, look to Asia where there are going to be 1 billion middle- class people there in a few years. What we ought to do is focus on  growing them in the United States, making them in the United States,  adding value to them in the United States, and then shipping them  somewhere. That is my idea of a modern trade agenda.   So far, the administration's trade agenda amounts to a muddle of 140- character tweets, mixed messages, and overhyped announcements that seem  to be backed by not much substance. I think we are going to have to put  together a coherent strategy quickly to promote our exports and fight  back against trade cheats. That is not exactly what we have seen from  the administration to date.   We can almost suffer whiplash from the reports about what happens  with various trade deals. Late at night, it was reported that the  President is about to pull the United States out of NAFTA; then  suddenly there is another  [[Page S2905]]  report saying he has changed his mind after a conversation with the  Canadians. Next, at a moment of extreme tension on the Korean  Peninsula, it is reported that the President is threatening to pull out  of the U.S.-Korea trade agreement. Then suddenly that threat is walked  back. So the President has made some major statements with respect to  trade deals on the books, but he has yet to give us much in the way of  specifics on how he would like to bring that about.   If one is trying to run a business in Oregon or around the United  States that exports to foreign markets, it is pretty hard not to feel  rattled and confused by some of the President's statements and tweets  about trade. One might even make the decision not to invest and not to  hire additional workers. I hope the President will soon see that some  of the uncertainty and confusion that has been stoked as a negotiating  tactic is not a recipe for creating red, white, and blue jobs.   I do think Robert Lighthizer knows what the challenge is really all  about, and I want to tell him I have appreciated our conversations. He  is a real pro at this. I have appreciated his views, particularly on  digital goods, which I think are so important to our burgeoning  technology sector, and his views on Canadian lumber.   I would also like to state at this time that I think very highly of  Secretary Ross. He has been very constructive in our conversations,  particularly on Canadian softwood lumber.   Obviously, the U.S. Trade Representative will lead our country in  trade negotiations, and that will be Mr. Lighthizer's role. The bulk of  the expertise of trade does reside within his office. When Mr.  Lighthizer is confirmed, as I hope he will be and expect he will be,  this expertise will no longer be silent.   I will wrap up simply by way of saying that the United States may be  the world's largest economy, but it represents only 4 percent of the  world's consumers. Red, white, and blue jobs in the United States  depend on our ability to sell to the other 96 percent. The number of  middle-class households around the world is going to double over the  next decade. This represents a lot of potential buying power for the  American brand, the Oregon brand. The fact is, people all over the  world love buying the goods and the services we make. It is going to  take a lot of hard work to smash through the barriers that block  American-made goods and fight back against trade cheats.   Lastly, the trade rules in many particulars are out of date, so we  have a lot of work to do to promote labor rights, combat human  trafficking, crack down on trade in illegally taking wildlife and  endangered species, and get the trade system updated so it includes  things like digital goods and small businesses that now have an  international reach, which is especially important. The trading system  has to respond more quickly to countries that break the rules or are  unfairly producing basic commodities, such as steel and aluminum. This  is especially true with respect to China.   As policymakers, we must continue to take an honest look at the trade  rules and fix what doesn't work so that American workers aren't left  behind. It is long past time to invest more resources in monitoring,  litigating, and enforcing our trading partners' obligations, including  China's. The United States must respond more aggressively and more  rapidly to threats to U.S. workers and businesses.   There was a recent example of how this is done right when the  Commerce Department said ``enough'' to Canada's unfairly traded  softwood lumber. The steps the Commerce Department took were undeniably  warranted after mill towns in Oregon and many other States have been  clobbered over the last few decades. My first preference is a long-term  agreement with Canada, but if they are not going to come to the table,  I will keep fighting for our mills and mill jobs, and I will insist the  administration do the same.   The U.S. needs to carry that same steadfast approach across the  board--getting trade enforcement right is not just a lumber issue. That  means more resources for boots on the ground: investigators and  enforcers. Not just at the office of the USTR but also at Customs and  Border Protection and the Departments of Commerce, Agriculture, Labor,  State, and Interior, where investigators are tasked with stopping trade  in illegally taken wildlife. Bottom line, trade enforcement requires  all hands on deck. If you boost trade enforcers at one agency only to  wipe out the trade enforcers at another, you will fail to protect  American workers from unfair or illegal imports.   So I will be looking closely at the budget that the President submits  to determine whether he is serious about delivering real results on  trade enforcement or whether the campaign rhetoric and dramatic tweets  are just a bunch of hot air,   In recognition of the need for a new approach on trade enforcement,  Congress recently passed new laws that give the President better tools  to respond when trading partners don't follow the rules. It also passed  legislation to strengthen domestic laws that enable the U.S. to  unilaterally respond when American jobs are under threat, and it  provided new direction should the President wish to negotiate new trade  agreements or renegotiate past ones. In the coming months, I expect  that those tools will not just sit and gather dust while the  administration talks tough with respect to trade.   It takes consistency, strategy and a lot of hard work to get trade  done right. I have confidence that Robert Lighthizer will work to  pursue a trade agenda that is coherent, constructive, and will deliver  for American workers, and I will support his nomination.   However, I want to express reservation on one issue pertaining to  this nominee. During his confirmation hearing, Senator Stabenow asked  Mr. Lighthizer how he would deal with situations in which he was  conducting trade negotiations with a country in which the President has  business interests. Senator Stabenow wanted to make sure that the  President's personal financial interests wouldn't take precedence over  the public interest. Mr. Lighthizer seemed surprised by the question,  saying, quote, ``the idea that this President would do anything  untoward is . . . far out of the realm of possibility.''   I would like to put Mr. Lighthizer on notice. This is a legitimate  issue, and I share Senator Stabenow's concern. Never before has this  country faced a circumstance in which our trade representative will be  negotiating trade agreements with countries in which the President or  his family have active business interests, whether it is trademarks,  golf courses, or construction deals. I have introduced a bill requiring  the President, when initiating trade negotiations, to disclose whether  he has business interests in the country that we will be negotiating  with. I intend to press this issue as trade negotiations move forward.  Trade should be about fighting on behalf of American workers and  businesses. It is not about the President's bottom line.   Finally, on an issue that has been closely related to this  nomination, I want to commend several of my colleagues for working  together to provide relief to retired mineworkers regarding their  healthcare costs. Senator Manchin has been a crusader on behalf of the  mineworkers. Hardly a week went by over the last several months when I  didn't hear from Joe Manchin about how important it was to get the  mineworkers the healthcare benefits they have earned. And he has worked  hand-in-hand with Senators Brown, Casey, and Warner, all of whom serve  on the Finance Committee. Chairman Hatch deserves thanks for working  with us to get this across the finish line as well.   I see that my good friend, Chairman Hatch, is here to make his  remarks. I thank him for the cooperation he has shown. I think the  interests of both sides in processing this nomination have been  advanced.   A lot could have gone awry here. We had challenges with getting the  waiver Mr. Lighthizer needed. We needed the space to make sure the  miners were protected. Members had strong views.   I thank Chairman Hatch for the diplomacy and cooperation he showed me  and our side. I think that is why there was a very large vote for Mr.  Lighthizer in the committee.   I will be voting aye this afternoon and look forward to the  Chairman's wrap-up remarks.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.  [[Page S2906]]         Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 50th  anniversary of the Hells Canyon Preservation Council. Without the  council and its courageous work, there might be multiple dams  despoiling one of the deepest gorges in North America rather than the  wondrous Snake Wild and Scenic River flowing through the Hells Canyon  National Recreation Area and Hells Canyon Wilderness.   The story of the creation of the council begins in 1967 as a conflict  simmered for a long time over damming Hells Canyon, an 85-mile gorge on  the Oregon-Idaho border. That fight appeared to solely turn on the  question of who would get to build the dam in Hells Canyon, not whether  to build the dam on what is often called the Grand Canyon of the Snake  River. Washington Public Power Supply System, WPPSS, delivered public  power and Idaho Power Company was a private power supplier. In 1964,  the Federal Power Commission ruled in favor of the private power, WPPSS  appealed, and their dispute went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.   On June 5, 1967, Justice William O. Douglas read the Court's majority  opinion from the bench. The Supreme Court ruled neither for public  power nor for private power. Instead, it remanded the entire case back  to the Federal Power Commission with instructions to consider whether  the best dam in Hells Canyon might be no dam at all. The Supreme Court  ruled that the case wasn't about public versus private power. Instead,  Justice Douglas said: ``Nor is the test solely whether the region will  be able to use the additional power. The test is whether the project  will be in the public interest. And that determination can be made only  after an exploration of all issues relevant to the `public interest,'  including future power demand and supply, alternate sources of power,  the public interest in preserving reaches of wild rivers and wilderness  areas, the preservation of anadromous fish for commercial and  recreational purposes, and the protection of wildlife.''   Within 2 months, the debate over the best use of Hells Canyon shifted  from what entity would dam it, to the core question of whether to dam  it. Six members of the Idaho Alpine Club met in a Boise living room and  formed the Hells Canyon Preservation Council. Joining that group was a  young Seattle lawyer and Sierra Club attorney named Brock Evans.   Brock soon fell in love with Hells Canyon and northeastern Oregon and  vowed that the Snake River would not be dammed. The Hells Canyon  Preservation Council soon grew to have more than 2,000 members in all  50 States. Its chapters included one in the little town of Enterprise  in Wallowa County, home to half of Hells Canyon. The national attention  attracted media personality Arthur Godfrey and folk singer Pete Seeger,  along with national environmental groups who wanted to save the great  gorge.   Their efforts also attracted the attention of Oregon Senator Bob  Packwood. From his first day in office, Senator Packwood championed the  preservation of Hells Canyon.   It took 8 years of hard work by Brock, assisted by Doug Scott, a  native Oregonian who replaced Brock as the Sierra Club's Northwest  Representative--and so many others inside and outside of Congress; yet  that sweat equity paid off in 1975 when Congress passed the Hells  Canyon National Recreation Area Act.   I am proud to say that Brock and his wife, Linda, have recently  returned to Oregon, having moved to La Grande, near his beloved Hells  Canyon.   Oregonians and all Americans are indebted to the Hells Canyon  Preservation Council and its allies, including Senator Packwood and  many other fine Oregonians, for their tireless advocacy for preserving  wild nature for the benefit of all of us today as well as future  generations.   Thanks to their work, we Oregonians today consider the Hells Canyon  National Recreation Area, the Hells Canyon Wilderness, and the Snake  Wild and Scenic River to be an irreplaceable part of our priceless  natural legacy, and we would no more think of damming Hells Canyon than  of draining Crater Lake.                            ____________________
