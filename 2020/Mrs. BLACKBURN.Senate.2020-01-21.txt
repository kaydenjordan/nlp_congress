 Mr. President, today the Senate begins in earnest our  efforts to determine if our colleagues in the House of Representatives  have compiled sufficient evidence to justify removing a sitting  President from office. This is no small task, and it will be made more  difficult by the swirl of commentary that has engulfed the impeachment  inquiry since well before it was officially initiated.   Much has been made of our debate over the inclusion of additional  witness testimony into the prosecution's case against President Donald  John Trump--so much, in fact, that many of my colleagues are inclined  to allow that testimony in the name of bipartisan compromise. How  misguided of them. Such a move would open the floodgates to a parade of  politically-motivated testimony, a protracted legal battle, and  ultimately unjustified impeachment proceedings in the U.S. Senate.   The Democratic Members of the House of Representatives spent a great  deal of their time and energy holding hearings, interviewing witnesses,  and putting together what they have insisted is their best, ironclad  case against President Trump. I encourage my colleagues to resist  allowing an additional, cathartic airing of grievances and instead  accept that it is now the Senate's turn to listen to the facts as they  are presented, deliberate, and cast a final vote.                            ____________________
