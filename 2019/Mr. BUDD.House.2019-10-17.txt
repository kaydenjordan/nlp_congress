 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss second chances.   Across our Nation, one in three adults have an arrest or conviction  that makes it difficult to find a job.   Take Kevin Miller, for example, who was incarcerated for 8 months in  1992 after a minor altercation with police officers.   Kevin was only 19 at the time, but more than a quarter century later,  Kevin hasn't been able to get a steady job because he must disclose his  arrest on every job application.   Michael Mirsky faced similar hardships. He lost his job as a Verizon  technician in 2012 after he pled guilty to resisting arrest during a  disagreement over child support payments. In the years following the  incident, he faced foreclosure of his home, and even as the economy  improved and more and more jobs became available, Mr. Mirsky was unable  to find a permanent job and start rebuilding his life.   Mr. Speaker, stories like Kevin's and Michael's are all too common.  In fact, more than 70 million Americans have minor criminal records  that they must disclose on job applications. As a result, millions of  Americans have been turned down from countless jobs for mistakes made  decades ago.   The reluctance of employers to hire people with criminal records,  combined with job applications that contain check-the-box measures, has  detrimental effects on the economy and prevents millions of Americans  from becoming productive members of society.   In addition, excluding people with minor criminal records from the  workforce, often results in their return to crime and to drugs.   That is why I am proud to cosponsor the Fair Chance Act, which  prohibits the Federal Government and Federal contractors from asking  about a job applicant's prior criminal record before a conditional  offer of employment. This process humanizes applicants and gives them a  chance to meet employers face to face and explain their past before  employers make a sweeping judgment based on one checked box.   Mr. Speaker, America is a land of second chances. Barriers to  employment should not follow a person long after they have served time,  paid their debt to society, and started a new life. People deserve the  freedom to redeem themselves.   As my colleagues go to conference over the NDAA, I urge them to  include this legislation as part of any final deal.
