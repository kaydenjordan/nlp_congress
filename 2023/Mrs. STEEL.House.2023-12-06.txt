 Mr. Chair, I thank the chairwoman, Dr. Foxx, for yielding  time.   Actually, this has nothing to do with an anti-Asian bill. This is my  bill, and we want to protect our children from this propaganda.   Yesterday, before the Committee on Education and the Workforce and  the entire world, leaders of three of our Nation's most prestigious  universities failed to demonstrate the most basic levels of humanity  when discussing anti-Semitism on campus.   Make no mistake: Their lack of moral clarity shows exactly what  happens when we permit hostile foreign actors like Qatar, Iran, and  Communist China to buy influence on our college campuses.   When they give money without return, actually, there is no such thing  as a free lunch. That is why today I am offering a legislative solution  to crack down on this crisis in our higher education system. That is  why I rise today to urge support and passage of the DETERRENT Act.   Justice Brandeis once said: Sunlight is the best disinfectant. As we  saw yesterday, our college campuses are infected.   The DETERRENT Act brings desperately needed sunlight by strengthening  transparency and disclosure requirements under section 117 of the  Higher Education Act of 1965.  [[Page H6168]]    While the previous administration reinvigorated the use of this tool,  the current administration has repeatedly downplayed the threat of  foreign actors and failed to take meaningful steps to protect our  students, research, and national security. If the President will not  act, Congress must.   The DETERRENT Act has three pillars to strengthen section 117. The  first pillar brings much-needed transparency.   Foreign adversaries look for any loophole to hide their intentions.  This is especially true for states that pose the greatest threats to  our Nation, like Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea.   The DETERRENT Act eliminates these loopholes by lowering the foreign  gifts reporting threshold from $250,000 to $50,000 for all foreign  donors and eliminating the threshold entirely for those from countries  of concern.   The bill also requires the disclosures include detailed information  about the foreign source, the intent of the gift, and the complete text  of any contracts with the concerned entities.   The second pillar of my bill establishes accountability. For too  long, schools have adopted a take the money first, ask questions later  approach to billions of dollars of foreign funds.   As reporting and congressional oversight revealed in the case of UC  Berkeley in my home State of California, these problematic  relationships are often discovered years after the fact when the damage  has already been done.   Requiring timely transparency for institutions receiving foreign  funds means ensuring the penalties for nonreporting are more than a  slap on the wrist.                                time  1400    The DETERRENT Act institutes a progressive fine schedule, culminating  in the loss of title IV funding for noncompliant universities. The bill  also sets up an institutional point of contact so institutions cannot  use the faceless bureaucracy to claim ignorance of unreported foreign  funds on their campuses.   The third and final pillar of the DETERRENT Act is clarity. The  DETERRENT Act streamlines the bureaucratic reporting process and aligns  section 117 with other laws. It shifts the reporting schedule from a  biannual to an annual basis, using reporting thresholds from existing  law to avoid confusion.   It improves communication between the Department of Education and  institutions by mandating a point of contact on section 117 for  institutions to utilize at the Department. It also requires periodic  meetings between the Department and institutions to discuss  improvements to online reporting.   Section 117 has not been updated in more than 30 years. These reforms  are long overdue.   The DETERRENT Act is a commonsense bill that adds transparency,  accountability, and clarity to section 117. That is why it passed the  Education and the Workforce Committee in a bipartisan vote.   Let's protect our students from this propaganda. Mr. Chair, I urge  every Member of this body to vote ``yes'' on the DETERRENT Act.
