 Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to honor Mahina `Olelo  Hawaii, or Hawaiian Language Month.   Colleagues, I have the wonderful privilege of being native Hawaiian.  My culture has served as a guiding light throughout my entire life, a  light that has survived because of the many kupuna, our elders, who  protected this  [[Page H626]]  light and who protected our Native indigenous language.   For Native Hawaiians and so many other indigenous peoples, our  language is essential for our people to live and thrive. In fact, we  have an `Olelo No'eau, a proverb, that says: ``I ka `olelo no ke ola; I  ka `olelo no ka make.'' ``In the language rests life; in the language  rests death.''   Established in 1840, Hawaii's public education system is the oldest  west of the Mississippi. In fact, in the 19th century, Hawaii was one  of the most literate nations in the world, with over 90 percent of the  population able to read and write.   January 17, 1893, is a date that is etched in the consciousness of  almost every Hawaiian, the day the Hawaiian Kingdom was overthrown. At  the time of the overthrow, our language was used in all sectors of  society by all of the kingdom's citizens, from our homes and schools to  businesses and government, and even the halls of justice.   In 1896, just 3 years after the overthrow, a law was enacted that  stated: ``The English language shall be the medium and basis of  instruction in all public and private schools.''   That one sentence dealt a smothering blow to our language. If you  want to extinguish a people, you extinguish their language by taking it  from the ears and mouths of future generations. You take it away from  their children.   Piece by piece, action by action, the racist provisional and republic  government and others with influence attempted to stem the flow of  oxygen to our `olelo Hawaii. But they could not extinguish our fire.   While Hawaiian was relegated to use in isolated spaces, even perhaps  to whispers in private, we spoke, and we spoke in Hawaiian. We kept the  embers burning for nearly a century.   How do you revive a language? The same way they tried to extinguish  it. We share it with our children. Fire-keepers started private  preschool language nests, or Punana Leo, and in 1978, Hawaiian became  an official language of the State. But it would take 100 years to  change that 1896 law banning Hawaiian in schools when, in 1986, K-12  Hawaiian language immersion was reestablished in Hawaii's Department of  Education.   These early language pioneers continued to rebuild the fire, step by  step, action by action. By the 1980s, we graduated our first bachelor's  degrees in Hawaiian language. From less than 50 Native speakers under  the age of 18 to more than 25,000 now self-identifying as Hawaiian  language speakers today, our fire still burns, and it is growing.   It is no longer novel to hear Hawaiian spoken in our local coffee  shops and our grocery stores, and my family proudly joins along fellow  fire-keepers to stoke the `olelo Hawaii flame, as my daughters attend  Hawaiian language schools Punana Leo `O Hilo and Ke Kula `o  Nawahiokalani'opu'u.   While I am filled with pride, Mr. Speaker, it comes with a mix of  other emotions: disappointment at underfunding; frustration at the lack  of equity in government use of Hawaiian as an official language; and  trepidation, knowing how close we came to having our language snuffed  out.   While I am encouraged by our progress, I know there is more work  ahead. We must continue to raise up the languages of all of America's  first peoples.   UNESCO states that a third of the world languages have fewer than  1,000 speakers left. Language is essential to cultural diversity, and  diversity is essential to our shared humanity.   While Mahina `Olelo Hawaii, or our month of celebrating Hawaiian  language, is coming to a close, we will continue to stoke the flames of  `olelo Hawaii month by month, year by year, generation to generation  because, Mr. Speaker, ``I ka `olelo no ke ola; I ka `olelo no ka  make.'' ``In the language rests life; in the language rests death,''  and our resolve is greater than ever to ensure that our languages will  live on.   ``E Ola Mau Ka `Olelo Hawaii a me na `Olelo `Oiwi A Pau Loa.'' ``The  Hawaiian language, and all indigenous languages, shall live.'' Mahalo.                            ____________________
