 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 221) to reauthorize the Hydrographic Services  Improvement Act of 1998, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 221         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Hydrographic Services       Improvement Amendments Act''.       SEC. 2. REAUTHORIZATION OF HYDROGRAPHIC SERVICES IMPROVEMENT                     ACT OF 1998.         (a) Reauthorizations.--Section 306 of the Hydrographic       Services Improvement Act of 1998 (33 U.S.C. 892d) is       amended--        (1) by inserting before ``There are authorized'' the       following: ``(a) In General.--'';        (2) in subsection (a) (as designated by paragraph (1))--        (A) in paragraph (1), by striking ``surveys--'' and all       that follows through the end of the paragraph and inserting       ``surveys, $70,814,000 for each of fiscal years 2019 through       2023.'';        (B) in paragraph (2), by striking ``vessels--'' and all       that follows through the end of the paragraph and inserting       ``vessels, $25,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2019 through       2023.'';        (C) in paragraph (3), by striking ``Administration--'' and       all that follows through the end of the paragraph and       inserting ``Administration, $29,932,000 for each of fiscal       years 2019 through 2023.'';        (D) in paragraph (4), by striking       ``title--'' and all that follows through the end of the       paragraph and inserting ``title, $26,800,000 for each of       fiscal years 2019 through 2023.''; and        (E) in paragraph (5), by striking       ``title--'' and all that follows through the end of the       paragraph and inserting ``title, $30,564,000 for each of       fiscal years 2019 through 2023.''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following new subsection:        ``(b) Arctic Programs.--Of the amount authorized by this       section for each fiscal year--        ``(1) $10,000,000 is authorized for use to acquire       hydrographic data, provide hydrographic services, conduct       coastal change analyses necessary to ensure safe navigation,       and improve the management of coastal change in the Arctic;       and        ``(2) $2,000,000 is authorized for use to acquire       hydrographic data and provide hydrographic services in the       Arctic necessary to delineate the United States extended       Continental Shelf.''.        (b) Limitation on Administrative Expenses for Surveys.--      Section 306 of such Act (33  [[Page H5591]]       U.S.C. 892d) is further amended by adding at the end the       following:        ``(c) Limitation on Administrative Expenses for Surveys.--      Of amounts authorized by this section for each fiscal year       for hydrographic surveys, not more than 5 percent is       authorized for administrative costs.''.       SEC. 3. GAO STUDY.         The Comptroller General of the United States shall, by not       later than 18 months after the date of enactment of this       Act--        (1) conduct a study comparing the unit costs of       hydrographic surveys conducted by the National Oceanic and       Atmospheric Administration and the unit costs of procuring       performance of such surveys; and        (2) report to the Congress on the findings of such study.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material for the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 221, the  Hydrographic Services Improvement Amendments Act.   I was an original cosponsor and chairman of the House Natural  Resources Committee when Representative Jim Saxton of New Jersey  introduced the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998. My  legislation will reauthorize the act through 2022 and will allow NOAA  to conduct and contract for hydrographic surveys around the U.S., with  specific focus on the Arctic.   Alaska is what makes the United States an Arctic Nation. My State has  more coastline than any other State in this country, and we don't know  what is under the surface. We are seeing a significant increase in  vessel traffic, exploration, and resource development in our Arctic  waters.   While hydrographic surveys are a critical part of the maritime  safety, economic, and environmental efforts nationwide, they are  especially important in the Arctic.   Mr. Speaker, there are more than 550,000 square nautical miles in the  U.S. Arctic exclusive economic zone, otherwise a 200-mile limit. It  would take decades to survey even half of that space.   NOAA has designated 38,000 miles as survey priority areas, and  estimates a range up to 25 years to survey just those priority areas,  if resources remain at their current level.   Alaskan waters are incredibly under-surveyed. Before this year, the  last time the entrances and mouth to the Yukon River were surveyed was  1899. The river is the most effective route to deliver food and goods  to coastal and inland villages in western Alaska, and the last on-the- ground surveys were completed the same year that gold was discovered in  Nome.   Mr. Speaker, there are other areas around the Nation that have the  same problem. This is a very important piece of legislation. If we are  to continue to utilize the ocean onshore and offshore, I urge the  passage of this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.
