 DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  support of my bill, H.R. 5794.  [[Page H5962]]    This bill would rename the post office located in my district at 850  Walnut Street in McKeesport, Pennsylvania, after First Sergeant Leonard  A. Funk, Jr.   Leonard was a lifelong resident of the Pittsburgh area. First  Sergeant Funk enlisted in the Army months before the U.S. entered World  War II, where he volunteered to be a paratrooper.   His time in the military was notable. After jumping into Normandy on  D-day with the 82nd Airborne Division, he earned the Distinguished  Service Cross during Operation Market Garden, and on August 23, 1945,  President Truman awarded First Sergeant Funk the Medal of Honor for his  actions during the Battle of the Bulge.   During this pivotal battle, First Sergeant Funk took charge of his  company when his company's officer went down. Despite being  outnumbered, First Sergeant Funk led a makeshift group of clerks and  soldiers to capture a town held by the enemy and then nearly  singlehandedly killed or captured 100 enemy soldiers.   First Sergeant Funk is also one of the most-decorated paratroopers of  World War II, having also earned the Bronze Star and Purple Heart with  two oak leaf clusters.   First Sergeant Funk passed away in 1992 after a civilian career with  the U.S. Veterans Administration. I commend him for his heroics and  dedication to our Nation.   I am proud to be able to make this small gesture of our Nation's  gratitude, spearheaded by the McKeesport community, come to fruition.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill to ensure that  First Sergeant Funk's legacy is not forgotten.                                time  1530
