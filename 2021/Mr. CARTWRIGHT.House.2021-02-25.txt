 Madam Speaker, in December, this House passed a  COVID-19 relief compromise, during which time we pledged to the  American people that we would do more. Now is the time for us to  deliver on that promise.   The American Rescue Plan is that promise delivered. It is something  that enables us to put people back to work; put kids back in schools;  to put $1,400  [[Page H631]]  checks in people's hands, the people who are struggling to keep body  and soul together, to make ends meet, the people who really need this  money.   No American economist of repute disagrees that this kind of relief is  necessary. Now is the time for us to do it. Let's come together and  enact the American Rescue Plan.                            ____________________
