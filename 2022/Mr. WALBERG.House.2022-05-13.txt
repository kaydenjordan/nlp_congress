 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, at the appropriate time I will offer an amendment to  recommit H.R. 5129 and ask to have my amendment to restore current law  protections for faith-based organizations included in the Record.   Madam Speaker, religious liberty is foundational to America. It is  enshrined as the First Amendment to our Constitution. Given this  Nation's dedication to religious liberty, it is so appalling that H.R.  5129 strikes current law protections for faith-based organizations that  participate in the CSBG program.   Faith-based providers have a history of leading America's fight to  help those in need. From the Salvation Army to Catholic Charities,  religious organizations formed the front line in assisting people in  poverty. They did so not out of a desire for selfish gain or  recognition but because they truly believe it is a calling.                                time  0945    That faith allows them to help those in need in unique ways that the  government cannot. But instead of honoring these organizations for  their long history of service, this bill suggests that religious  organizations should leave their faith behind when they want to serve  those in need.   This is ridiculous. More than that, it is un-American. I would also  argue it directly contradicts our Constitution.   Madam Speaker, we must give faith-based organizations and providers  the same opportunity to serve low-income Americans through the CSBG  program that we would give any other organization. We must also  guarantee faith-based providers' rights to live out and express their  faith through their work.   I include in the Record a letter from a coalition of religious  providers, led by the Institutional Religious Freedom Alliance, which  discusses the importance of maintaining current law protections for  faith-based organizations--protections, I might add, that President  Biden himself supported when he was a Member of the Senate.                                                       May 10, 2022.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: As leaders of faith-based service       organizations, religious freedom advocates, and people of       faith, we strongly implore you and your colleagues to retain       the Charitable Choice provisions when reauthorizing the       Community Services Block Grant [CSBG]. The current language       of H.R. 5129, the Community Services Block Grant       Modernization Act of 2021, would replace the detailed       Charitable Choice provisions with a bare sentence. This would       be a negative change that creates a harmful precedent. We ask       the House instead to reaffirm Charitable Choice in the CSBG       program by retaining the Charitable Choice provisions       currently in the CSBG statute.        The Charitable Choice provisions (42 U.S. Code 9920) give       faith-based organizations an equal opportunity to compete for       CSBG funding and safeguard their religious character while       also protecting beneficiary rights by prohibiting the use of       CSBG grant funds for explicitly religious activities. The       presence of this detailed language in the statute is a       billboard announcing a welcome for faith-based organizations       to compete for funding.        The provisions were added to the CSBG program in 1998 in a       reauthorization bill co-sponsored by Republican Senators Dan       Coats (IN) and Jim Jeffords (VT) and Democratic Senators Ted       Kennedy (MA) and Christopher Dodd (CT). They sought to       improve the effectiveness of CSBG spending by prohibiting       local governments and Community Action Agencies [CAAs] from       marginalizing faith-based organizations. Protecting       participation in CSBG funding by faith-based providers and       houses of worship ensures that the procurement process is       competitive and that CAAs utilize the most effective and       accountable service providers.        The Charitable Choice provisions extend to faith-based       organizations no novel or unconstitutional rights. Its       principles are codified in the Equal Treatment regulations       that apply to Department of Health and Human Services funding       programs (45 CFR 87), but only partially to CSBG. CSBG has       its own regulations, similar but distinct. If Charitable       Choice is taken out of the CSBG statute, CAAs would have no       guarantee that they will be afforded the same rights and       protections due to other faith-based organizations under the       Equal Treatment regulations. It would be better to retain the       CSBG statutory language and the accompanying regulations.       Statutory language provides more certainty over time to       Community Action Agencies and to faith-based organizations       interested in partnering with them in service.        Some in the CAA movement claim that the Charitable Choice       language is dispensable because, despite its presence, few       faith-based organizations receive CSBG funding. If       participation is truly low, then the remedy is action by       Congress and the Office of Community Services in HHS to       remove the non-statutory barriers that inhibit more extensive       partnerships, not to remove the protections that enable the       participation of those few.  [[Page H4939]]         The addition of Charitable Choice in 1998 to the CSBG       program was the second time that Congress and the Clinton       administration added such language to a federal program       (Charitable Choice was first added to the TANF program in       1996). These actions launched the faith-based or partnership       initiative. The four succeeding administrations of both       parties (Bush, Obama, Trump, and Biden) have worked with       energy to ensure that federal social programs are maximally       effective because they partner with the best non-government       organizations, including faith-based organizations, with full       protection for the religious freedom of the ultimate       beneficiaries.        Senators Coats, Jeffords, Kennedy, and Dodd were right to       add Charitable Choice to the CSBG program. Removing it will       be detrimental to the participation of faith-based       organizations, when it is their greater involvement that will       most benefit the communities that CSBG funding is intended to       serve. Removing it will create a terrible precedent by       signaling that Congress is no longer as boldly committed to       equal opportunity for service organizations of every faith or       none.        We ask the House to reaffirm Charitable Choice in the CSBG       program by amending H.R. 5129 to restore this language before       the reauthorization moves forward.        Thank you for your consideration of this important matter.            Signed,        [University professors sign in their personal capacities       only.

Madam Speaker, I offered an amendment during a markup  that would have protected faith-based providers, making sure they don't  have to leave their faith at the door when they work to serve America's  families in need. This is not only good for the religious organizations  serving these families but also for the neediest among us.   Unfortunately, my Democrat colleagues rejected this commonsense  amendment. I was further disappointed when they did not make my  amendment in order for floor consideration. This is a forthright attack  on religious liberty by the Democrats, and we cannot stand for it.   Madam Speaker, if we adopt this motion to recommit, we will instruct  the Committee on Education and Labor to reconsider my amendment to  restore these current law provisions.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of this  amendment in the Record immediately prior to the vote on the motion to  recommit.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
