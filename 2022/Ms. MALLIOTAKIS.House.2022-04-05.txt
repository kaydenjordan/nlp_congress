 Mr. Speaker, I hereby remove my name as cosponsor of  H.R. 3807.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to tell the Nation about the  service of a World War II veteran, someone who became a friend of mine,  Isidore Bertone, who on Staten Island we know as Teddy.   He was born on September 13, 1925, in Castiglione, a small village in  Sicily. Teddy came to the United States with his mother in 1937 to  escape the fascist regime of Mussolini, who was recruiting teenagers  into service.   In October 1943, at the age of 18, Bertone volunteered for the U.S.  Navy during World War II. He served with distinction for 2\1/2\ years  aboard the USS Zircon as part of the crew that rescued American sailors  in the accidental sinking of an ammo ship off Boston Harbor during the  D-day invasion of Normandy.   I first met Teddy after he wrote a letter to the editor on August 21,  2020, pleading for assistance after his request for help with proving  his U.S. citizenship went unanswered. Having his citizenship paper was  the most important thing to him because he loved this country so much.   I called President Trump's office, and within 4 days, on August 25,  2020, the citizenship office was in his backyard, swearing him in just  weeks shy of his 95th birthday. To me, seeing this World War II veteran  at the age of 95 being sworn in as an American citizen, was the most  beautiful thing I ever witnessed.   Sadly, Teddy passed away on March 19, 2022, at the age of 96.   We miss you, Teddy. We all remember your service, and you are a hero  to so many of us on Staten Island and across the United States.                            ____________________
