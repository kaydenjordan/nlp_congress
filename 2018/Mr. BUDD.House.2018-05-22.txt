 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas.   Today is a great day for North Carolina's community financial  institutions, small business innovators, and, most importantly, our  economy. I rise today in strong support of this rule that will bring a  much-needed regulatory relief bill, S. 2155, to the House floor.   The most damaging aspect of the Dodd-Frank bill was the additional  and unnecessary regulatory burden placed on community financial  institutions, and because of this, we have seen American consumers and  small businesses struggle to get the credit and the support that they  need. Economic growth is held back because of Dodd-Frank, but I am  happy to report that relief is on the way with the passage of S. 2155.   Madam Speaker, while I urge adoption of this rule and urge passage of  this bill, I also look forward to working with our chairman and our  leader, Jeb Hensarling, Senator Mike Crapo, and Senate Democrats to  craft a package of bills that focuses on capital formation. I offer any  support I can to help bring that collection of bills across the finish  line as well. I urge adoption of the rule, Madam Speaker.
