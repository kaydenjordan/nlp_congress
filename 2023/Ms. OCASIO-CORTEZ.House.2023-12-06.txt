 Mr. Speaker, I think the Republican side of the  aisle made the case quite clearly today as to why we should not vote  for censure. Right now, you can tell how weak their arguments are  because they are grasping for straws, trying to do their best ``My  Cousin Vinny'' impersonation as to breaking down what happened here  with a fire alarm.   Jamaal Bowman has more courage in his pinkie finger than the entire  Republican Party put together and more integrity than the entire  Republican Party put together. That is exactly why they are moving to  censure him today.   Mr. Speaker, let me tell you what is actually going on. New York  Republicans are so embarrassed that they propped up George Santos, got  him elected to office, and then had to turn around and vote to expel  him that they want to distract the entire world from their massive  embarrassment.   New York Republicans are so embarrassed that they have not  accomplished a damn thing for New Yorkers this entire year that they  have to find a distraction, so they have decided to target one of the  first Black men to ever represent Westchester County in the United  States Congress for censure. That is what today is about.   Moreover, New York Republicans are so unfocused and so unable to make  [[Page H6194]]  people's lives better that they have decided to bully their colleague.  That is what today is about.   They are wasting our time, and they are wasting the country's time  over some petty--what rises to censure? I mean, truly, these arguments  that are being made here, what is next? Jaywalking? Do you want to get  us for jaywalking and for not crossing the street correctly? Is that  what you are going to raise for censure next?   This is truly ridiculous. It is beneath the character of the House,  and it is beneath the stature and the status of what rises to  consideration before this body.
