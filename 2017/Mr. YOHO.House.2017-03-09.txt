 Mr. Speaker, had I been present, I would have voted ``Nay''  on rollcall No. 143, the Hank Johnson Amendment No. 5.                    Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mr. Conyers     Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to spend time  here with my colleagues. We just heard a diatribe from our colleagues.  It is interesting to me to note how they say the American people don't  want us to change this, but I have to remind my colleagues that I think  the American people spoke very loudly on November 8. We have run  multiple times to repeal this bill. I heard one of my other colleagues  say that we voted over 60 times, and we are going to vote one more time  to get rid of the Affordable Care Act because the American people have  delivered that message to us, and we have a President that says that we  will do this.   I think, as we go through this, we are going to have some interesting  conversations. Considering all the bickering and posturing you see in  the media by partisans on the left and the right, it is time for  Members of this body to step back for a moment and take stock of where  we are in the healthcare debate.   I was not a Member of Congress when the Affordable Care Act was  passed. I was a practicing large animal veterinarian in private  practice plying my trade and not a political animal, if you will.  However, I was concerned to see the way the law was passed. My  colleagues on the other side were talking about how this was rammed  through Congress and how it was passed in the shadows--or how we are  doing that now. But I have to remind them that in 2009 it was passed in  the dark of night--no Republican input, no debate, and no discussion.  It was just passed and rammed down the American people's throat.   I want to go on here, and I want to yield to a couple of my  colleagues before I do.  [[Page H2012]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa)  because he has to go tend to some other business. I would like to have  his input on this. Doug LaMalfa is my good friend and a great leader up  here.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from California.   Mr. Speaker, as I was saying, I was concerned to see the way the law  was passed. It was passed in the middle of the night. I thought it was  passed through hastily and without transparency. I did not think that  boded well for the law's success. Unfortunately, I was proven right.   If you remember the words of the then-Speaker of the House, it was  passed without reading it, and the words were: We have to pass it to  see what is in it. We have to pass it to see how it is going to work.   Talk about legislative malpractice that was poured on to the American  people to get a bill they didn't want, that nobody read. Yet my  colleagues on the other side are talking about how we are running this  through without anybody's input. It has had 6 years of input, it  is coming together now, and our goal is to fix health care for the  American people.    As someone who has practiced medicine, I believe that, despite all  the good intentions behind the Affordable Care Act, it was doomed to  fail, as most Big Government programs are. In fact, one of the main  reasons I ran was on behalf of patient-centered, free-market oriented  health care. I supported and still support healthcare reform that  allows us in Congress to keep our promises when we talk about what we  want to achieve.   I was one of the Members that came up here who lost my health care  because of the Affordable Care Act. My premiums have gone up over  $11,000 since I have been here. My deductibles have gone up and my  coverage has gone down. It is a disaster. I have to remind my colleague  from Minnesota who was talking about how bad the Republican bill is  that his own Governor from the State of Minnesota said that this bill  is a disaster, the Affordable Care Act in its present form, and his  premiums have gone up 45 percent in his own State.   I want to remind this body that many people lost health care they had  before ObamaCare was passed with the promise that if you like your  plan, you can keep it. It was broken by our own President of the United  States. If you like your plan, if you like your doctor, and if you like  your insurance company, your premiums will go down $2,500 on an  average. Lie after lie after lie. The American people answered that by  electing a majority in Congress to the Republican Party to fix that,  and that is what we aim to do.   Supporters of the ACA also told us that the premiums wouldn't  increase. It turned out that was false. Premiums in the individual  markets have increased partly because ObamaCare has forced insurers to  leave the exchange. For example, benchmark silver-level plan premiums  have increased by an average of 25 percent from 2016 to 2017, according  to the Department of Health. If you like the State of Arizona, the  premium this year is going up an astounding 116 percent. They worry  about us, and then they blame us for raising the cost of health care.  Sophistry, pure sophistry.   Many families have been forced to pay drastically higher out-of- pocket costs, which hits their pocketbooks hard even though they are  not wealthy people by any stretch of the imagination. As my friend, Mr.  LaMalfa, was talking about the cost, at the end of the month people are  finding out they are running out of money before they run out of the  month.   I am reminded of one family in my district whom I met with personally  many times over my tenure in Congress. They had to deal with the  intense treatments and frequent hospitalizations for an illness that  has hit two generations of their family very hard. They had coverage  through an employer that they started out with, and it was a $350-a- month premium right before the ACA passed in 2010. However, around the  time the ACA mandates kicked in, their plan went up over $100 a month.  Today their premium is a staggering $680 a month. That is over $8,000 a  year in premiums, nearly double what they were paying before the ACA.  These are the people that sent us up here to fix health care. Unless  you are making six figures a year, this is an absolutely painful sum.   Mr. Speaker, I may not generally be a supporter of government  benefits, but I do believe very strongly that our government should  make every effort in protecting our Nation's vulnerable population,  especially the chronically ill. My concern is the ACA has resulted in  those groups being harmed more than anybody else. Particularly for  those who had employer-provided insurance prior to the ACA, the law's  effect has been hurtful, especially if their coverage was for families  afflicted by long-term illness. Simply put, no healthcare law should  ever make things worse for people who were responsible and had health  care to treat a medical condition. If anything, that is the opposite of  health care.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin), who is  a good friend of mine. Dr. Babin has practiced dentistry in our  military and in the private sector. Right after graduating dental  school, he was commissioned in the Air Force as an officer and was  stationed overseas. I thank the gentleman  [[Page H2013]]  for his service. He later returned to his native east Texas to open his  own dental practice, which he operated for over three decades. He has  served on the Texas State Board of Dental Examiners and as a member of  the American Dental Association.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Dr. Babin's comments. He is very  astute. He has been around health care. You know how this thing is not  working and the strain it has put on people in your district, as it has  in mine, and people around the country.   I am relieved that Congress is moving forward on legislation to right  these wrongs. It feels so good to be a Member of Congress today to live  up to a campaign promise that everyone in the majority in the House,  Senate, and executive branch says: We are going to fix this; trust us.  I have the complete confidence in that. I look forward to engaging with  my colleagues.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Newhouse).  He is a farmer, small-business man, and good conservative who  understands the importance of keeping government out of our healthcare  system.   Our country's farmers have been hit hard, just as much as others, by  ObamaCare. Congressman Newhouse is, no doubt, well aware of these  issues.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my good colleague from Washington  State. I appreciate his words, his thoughtfulness, and the stories. You  learn more from a story than you do facts and figures.   I want to go over a couple of things here. As we have heard, the  average increase of health plans in the United States rose by over 35  percent. I already talked about Arizona: 116 percent this year alone.   The insurance exchanges that were set up--the 26 in the beginning-- are down to 5, with some counties not even having exchanges to purchase  insurance.   I think for the people that are watching this at home, whether they  are Members of Congress, the American citizens, I want you to listen to  this, and I want to take you back to the information that came out when  the Speaker of the House then talked about, we have to pass it to see  what is in it, how it is going to work. Then I want you to picture the  words of the architect of this bill, Jonathan Gruber: The lack of  transparency and the stupidity of the American voter helped ObamaCare  pass.   The Democrats want to blame this body, the Republicans, for wrecking  health care. This is what they passed on us and the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter), who  is the only pharmacist serving in Congress. As a healthcare  professional, he knows these issues very well.   He is the co-chair of the Community Pharmacy Caucus and sits on one  of the main healthcare committees in Congress, the Committee on Energy  and Commerce. He ran his own business, like me, and witnessed firsthand  the problems that government regulations and red tape cause on job  creators, large and small.   I want to remind folks, too, that there were over 22,000 pages of  rules and regulations that came out of the Affordable Care Act.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Carter. I appreciate his being  here. The effort he has put in, working diligently to help us right  this wrong that  [[Page H2015]]  has been instilled upon the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney  Davis), a great colleague of mine who is the chairman of the  Subcommittee on Biotechnology, Horticulture, and Research of the  Committee on Agriculture; a member of the Committee on Transportation  and Infrastructure; and the Committee on House Administration.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Rodney Davis). He brought up a very astute point. This is collapsing on  itself. If we were to do nothing, this would collapse, and the American  people would be left without any coverage. We have heard other people  on the other side say: Leave it alone.   That is irresponsible, and we will not do that. We will repeal and  replace the Affordable Care Act, and we remove it from Washington  bureaucrats and government mandates. If government can tell you what  kind of insurance to buy, you have to buy it, and if you don't, they  penalize you, what else can they force you to do?   Our Constitution is not a function of the government. Government is a  function of the Constitution. Yet when government steps beyond the  boundaries of the Constitution, it is up to us, we, the people--and we  are the representatives of we, the people--to change how government  works. That is what we are doing with the repeal and the replacement of  the Affordable Care Act. We have heard about the nightmare this has  caused to the American people, to our economy, the loss of jobs, the  depression of job growth, wage growth. We can go on and on for hours,  but it is not going to fix this problem.   What I want to focus on for the next few minutes is what the  replacement does do. We have heard about the mandates that are going  away, the taxes that are going away, the expansion of Medicaid. The  reality in America, our country is in financial dire straits. It is  unsustainable. It would be imprudent for us to sit by and do nothing  while the country goes into default.   So with the direction we are going, this will bend the cost curve to  Medicaid to make it solvent for a longer period of time. This will  empower the individual to have health care and make those decisions  between the doctor and the patient, the way it should be, instead of a  government-controlled mandate.   This empowers individuals to be more responsible for themselves, to  incentivize them to go out and buy health care by the use of health  savings accounts, where they can buy over-the-counter medications to  share with family members the benefit of the health savings account.   Republicans, Democrats, and Independents all want preexisting  conditions covered, so that is something we all are in agreement with.  There is the argument about should children be able to stay on their  parents' policies until the age of 26. Personally, I don't think they  should have to--I think they should be out on their own, but I have  heard from enough people in my district that I am willing to compromise  and go along with that. Truth be known, children could already stay on  their parents' health plan until the age of 26 if they were actively  enrolled in college or disabled. So we are compromising.   This will make health care better. It puts health care into the hands  of the American people and their doctors and drives government out of  it. Let them oversee the process.   We have heard over and over again that we need to open up the market  across State lines. There is legislation coming out that will free up  the insurance companies. We are introducing legislation to hold  harmless insurance companies now, before we get through with this  process, so that insurance companies are not held to the standards of  the Affordable Care Act, so that they can start writing policies today  when this legislation passes, so they can write their policies and  start marketing now so that the American people will have time to  research these products.   There will be a transition period. I can't guarantee it is going to  be smooth. I can guarantee you it will be smoother than the last one.   I think the last thing I want to leave the American people with is we  don't want to pull the rug out from anybody. We will do everything  possible, and I know on both sides of this. I would think the  Democrats, with the debacle that they created, the legislative  malpractice that they passed in the dark hours of the night in December  of 2009 or 2010, that they would want to come to the aid to fix health  care for the American people instead of chastising us and telling us  how bad and how wrong we are to interfere.  [[Page H2016]]    This plan is going to collapse on its own. We invite them to come to  the table to help us fix this because this is for all Americans, not  just Republicans. It is for all Americans--Republicans, Democrats,  Independents, everybody. I would hope they would come and help us do  this.   I think the last thing, Mr. Speaker, is this is a historic  opportunity. The Wall Street Journal said never before has there been a  chance to change a program as significant as what we are getting ready  to do. We are the ones who are going to lead this effort to bring  healthcare stability to the American people.   I look forward to the discussions in the future. I ask the American  people to believe in the people you sent up here to fix this. We are  going to get it right.   One last thing. I will guarantee you that this bill will be read  before it is passed, and we will know how it is going to work.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 9 o'clock and 14 minutes  p.m.), the House adjourned until tomorrow, Friday, March 10, 2017, at 9  a.m.                            ____________________
