 Mr. Speaker, what a mess we have here on  our hands. Make no mistake, our country was facing numerous crises when  we all left here for the August district work period, and now it has  only gotten worse.   Because of the backwards Biden policies, we have a number of crises,  unprecedented crises like our country has never faced, all at one time.   We have an economic crisis where jobs remain stalled and consumer  prices continue to soar at their highest rate in 40 years.   We have a border crisis. Everybody can see that. It is impossible to  overstate what a disaster it has become. We all see these horrific  videos showing over 10,000 illegal migrants being housed under a bridge  in the hot Texas sun.   In August alone over 208,000 illegal aliens were encountered at our  border by our law enforcement, what is left of it, the Border Patrol,  Customs agents. Our border security is overwhelmed, and they can't do  the job that they are hired to do.   We have a national security crisis. On Friday, of course, tragically  we learned that President Biden's disastrous Afghanistan exit was  topped off by a drone strike that killed 10 civilians, including 7  children and zero terrorists.   After nearly two months of district work away from Washington,  instead of coming back here early to deal with all these unprecedented  crises, the Democrat leadership waited, and so now here we are.   What do they have for us now? What do they have on the docket to  handle all these crises? Well, we have a bill to legalize abortion on  demand until birth, we have a bill to spend another $3.5 trillion, and  they are pushing one of the largest tax increases in our Nation's  history.   Their answer for the American people, their answer to us, their  answer to stalled jobs and rising inflation and a humanitarian crisis  and a foreign policy crisis and all the rest is more abortion,  trillions more in spending, and more tax hikes.   This is not what was advertised. This is not what the American people  want or need.   You will hear a lot tonight about the Democrats' abortion on demand  until birth legislation. We are talking about it tonight. My colleagues  who will be joining me here tonight, many will speak to this issue  because it is one of the darkest, most brazen, most extreme bills ever  brought to this floor. It would legalize on-demand abortion until  birth. It would remove nearly all pro-life protections for the unborn,  and it would abolish laws that prevent even late-term abortion. It is  barbaric, and it must be stopped.   I am so fortunate to be joined tonight by so many colleagues who  share my concerns about this to discuss all these monstrous proposals  and these terrible disasters that we are facing and to offer our  competing vision for the future of this country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. It is  time to wake up, Mr. Speaker. I yield to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly), who is equally passionate.    Mr. Speaker, I always appreciate Mr.  Kelly's clarity and conviction.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin), another  man with great conviction.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman  from Indiana (Mrs. Walorski), another strong voice on the issues.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  that compelling testimony. And this legislation would formalize,  legalize the very industry that allowed that monster to continue his  practices in Indiana and elsewhere.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Hice), a  former pastor and great lawmaker.    Thank you so much for that, my brother.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs.  Hartzler), one of the great pro-life champions in the congress.    Thank you, Ms. Hartzler, for your  leadership on all these things.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. LaTurner).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman  from Illinois (Mrs. Miller), one of the most compassionate voices in  the Congress.    I thank the gentlewoman for that stark  reminder. It is certainly what the Founders of this country believed,  as she noted.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 90 seconds to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Clyde).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend. He is  exactly right. Creating that humanitarian disaster on the southern  border also shows a callous disregard for the sanctity of human life.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 90 seconds to the gentlewoman from Colorado  (Mrs. Boebert).    Amen. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 90 seconds to the gentleman from Utah (Mr.  Owens).    Mr. Speaker, it is pure evil. I thank the  gentleman for stating it so clearly.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 90 seconds to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr.  Carl).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Carl) so much.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 90 seconds to the gentleman from Utah (Mr.  Moore).    Mr. Speaker, it should break our hearts. I  thank my friend for that authenticity.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs.  Harshbarger). We began the morning in a prayer group, and now we end  with this.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Pfluger), who has made a career out of defending the defenseless.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Pfluger.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Keller).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Palmer),  [[Page H5085]]  who is the policy chairman of the Republican Conference.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Alabama.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Mrs.  Fischbach).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  her leadership on the issue.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Arrington).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend. Well said.  God bless Texas.   Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Cline).    Mr. Speaker, Mr. Cline has done that,  indeed, and I am grateful for his leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Cawthorn).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  those comments.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson).    Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the  leadership of my friend.   Mr. Speaker, I am running out of time here, but in the very short few  seconds I have remaining, I just want to reiterate what all my  colleagues shared with such compassion, conviction, and clarity here on  the floor tonight. H.R. 3755, the abortion on demand until birth  legislation, is, as we said, brazen. It is dark, and it is one of the  most extreme bills imaginable, certainly ever presented on this floor.  We pray that it is defeated, and we will work to defeat it, we owe that  to the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I know my time has expired, and I yield back the balance  of my time.                            ____________________
