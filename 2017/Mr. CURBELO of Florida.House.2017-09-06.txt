 Mr. Chair, on August 26, 2015, several  Oriental Fruit Flies were found in South Miami-Dade County, Florida.  The discovery of this pest was cause for serious concern, as the very  destructive Oriental Fruit Fly has been known to infest over 430 kinds  of fruits and vegetables, including main crops grown in Florida like  avocado, mango, tomato, squash, and peppers. Unlike other states,  Florida's farm production provides essential produce during, and  immediately following, each winter season, and the spread of this pest  can have a devastating impact on our nation's food supply.   In coordination with state and federal officials, a quarantine was  implemented in October 2015 to cover 98 square-miles in South Miami- Dade County. Through the dedicated work of officials at USDA and  Florida Department of Agriculture, there have been no new discoveries  of flies. The quarantine was lifted in February 2016.   While the quarantine was absolutely necessary to ensure complete  eradication of the Fly, it had a devastating effect on the farmers  located in the designated area. We cannot let an outbreak like this  happen again.   A better understanding of how this pest spreads in our region would  help lessen the impact of this threat. The $1.5 million my amendment  provides to the USDA's Agricultural Research Service would go towards  studying inspection breakdowns at ports of entry, how weather patterns  influence the migration of Oriental Fruit Flies, and other factors are  essential in discerning effective mitigation strategies. This is a  small, but smart investment to help protect Florida's $120 billion  agriculture industry.   I urge all my colleagues to support my amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered  by the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Aderholt).   The en bloc amendments were agreed to.                  Amendment No. 10 Offered by Mr. Cicilline    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10  printed in part B of House Report 115-295.
