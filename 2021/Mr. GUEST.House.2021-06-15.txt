 Madam Speaker, I want to first thank Chairman DeFazio and  Ranking Member Graves for bringing this important bipartisan  legislation to the floor.   H.R. 2016 would begin the critical process in working to consolidate  the overlapping disaster response programs that delay disaster  assistance for citizens in Miss Gonzalez-Colon's district, as well as  in my district.   Mississippi has withstood flooding, hurricanes, and tornadoes over  the last 2 years, and many of these response efforts are still underway  today. This is no fault of the Federal agencies that are tasked with  responding, but it is, instead, the product of overlapping programs  that result in duplicative assessments that delay the recovery process.   This bill would establish a Federal working group to help identify a  more streamlined approach to helping Americans respond to natural  disasters.  [[Page H2771]]    This commonsense approach to solving delays in Federal disaster  response would help expedite recovery and give Americans confidence in  the Federal response.   I appreciate Congresswoman Gonzalez-Colon's leadership on this issue,  and I ask my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation.    Madam Speaker, first, I would like to thank Chairman  DeFazio and Ranking Member Graves for bringing this bipartisan  legislation to the floor.   H.R. 1262 would create a task force to recommend reforms and  improvements to the notice to airmen system, a crucial domestic and  international flight safety notification to pilots that has become both  inefficient and outdated over the years.   The current state of the notice to airmen system has the potential to  create life-threatening situations for both pilots and their  passengers. This reform would provide the needed steps to provide  important safety information to our Nation's pilots in a timely and  concise manner.   In the most recent FAA reauthorization, Congress made it a priority  that the agency delivers a new and modernized notice to airmen system,  yet we have seen few results to date. This legislation would make that  priority a reality within 1 year from this bill's enactment.   I would like to thank Congressman Stauber for his leadership on this  issue and for prioritizing aviation safety within this bill.                                time  1400
