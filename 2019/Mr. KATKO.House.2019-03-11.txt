 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the role  of fentanyl and other synthetic analogs in the ongoing opioid crisis  facing our Nation.   Thousands of Americans die each year as a result of overdoses caused  by these dangerous substances, which mimic the effects of street drugs,  but are significantly more powerful and more dangerous.   During last week's Homeland Security hearing, I asked Secretary  Nielsen about any recent significant seizures of fentanyl at America's  borders. Secretary Nielsen's response was absolutely frightening, as  she informed the committee that the amount of fentanyl seized by ICE in  the last year alone was enough to kill every living American twice.   This statistic should trouble each and every one of my colleagues.  Congress must take immediate action to ensure law enforcement has all  the necessary tools to prevent illicit synthetic opioids from entering  the country.   My bill last Congress, the Stop the Importation and Trafficking of  Synthetic Analogues Act, would have addressed these issues, and I  intend to reintroduce that bill in a similar legislation form in the  coming months.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in the critical effort  to combat substance abuse and save American lives.                            ____________________
