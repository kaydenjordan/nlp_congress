 Mr. Chairman, I rise today to urge all of my colleagues to  join me in supporting H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of  2018.   I have the great honor of representing Georgia's 12th District where  agriculture is the number one industry. As a member of the House  Agriculture Committee, my colleagues and I have worked diligently to  craft a farm bill that works for our farmers and provides them the  ability to provide a safe, secure, and economic food supply to this  Nation.   H.R. 2 improves the current farm safety net structure and offers  farmers the choice between PLC and ARC for each covered commodity under  title I to combat the downturn in the farm economy. It also makes  strides in getting Americans back to work by helping those on  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance.   I am the son of a farmer. I spent 35 years in the business community  creating jobs. The greatest joy of my life is to give folks the dignity  and respect they deserve to have a good job.   How could we deny folks this opportunity?   This bill gives them that opportunity.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote  ``yes'' for this important bill. Our farmers and our people need us.
