 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 minutes.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I want to support what my colleagues  have been saying on this floor. The reason we haven't seen a bill, the  reason we have no idea what is coming is that this is a political  exercise by the Republicans. It is about winning and losing. But for  people in the country, for people in Michigan, it is personal. This is  not a political game. This is personal. For everyone who cares about  their children and wants to make sure they can take them to the doctor;  if you have a mom with Alzheimer's and you might lose the ability to  have nursing home care; if you have cancer and know you may not be able  to get the full treatments that you need, this is personal. And, as has  been said, every single proposal of theirs is higher costs and less  coverage.   So we voted on what was behind door No. 1, which would gut Medicaid  healthcare. Three out of five Michigan  [[Page S4398]]  seniors get their nursing home care from Medicaid. Half of the people  we see with Medicaid healthcare are children. All of the funds in the  first proposal would go to tax cuts for the wealthy few and  pharmaceutical companies and destabilize and undermine and raise costs  for everybody else. So that is door No. 1: higher costs, less coverage.   Then, when that didn't go forward, it was door No. 2. Door No. 2:  Repeal everything that was passed under the Affordable Care Act and  then say to folks somewhere down the road, we will figure out how to  replace it. That is higher costs and less coverage.   Now we are at door No. 3, and we don't know what is behind door No.  3. All we know for sure is that it will be higher costs and less  coverage.   Now, we as Democrats want just the opposite. We want to work together  with our Republican colleagues to lower costs--by the way, starting  with the outrageous increases in prescription drug costs. And we want  to increase coverage options, increase health insurance. That is what  we are all about. I believe--I know in Michigan--that is what people  want me to be focused on.   Are there problems in the current system? Of course, and we should  fix those, but we don't have to rip away healthcare and raise  everybody's costs 20 percent a year as is being talked about now in  order to fix the problems that are there.   I want to quote Senator McCain, who said that it is time to ``return  to regular order,'' work to reduce ``out-of-pocket costs,'' and learn  to ``trust each other'' again.   It is pretty tough to trust colleagues, to trust the majority, when  we aren't even given the respect of knowing what we are going to be  voting on. And it is not just--it is not about us. It is not about us  as individuals; it is about the fact that every person who is getting  cancer treatments right now needs to know what the U.S. Senate is going  to be voting on and have a chance to respond. Every person who cares  about their child, who cares about their parent in a nursing home, who  cares about their future has the right to know and to read a bill and  know what is going on.   I want to say in conclusion--I want to close with the words of Margo,  who manages a health clinic in Kent County in the western part of  Michigan. Margo knows the benefits of increased access to healthcare  because she sees it every day. She knows it is not political; it is  personal. There is nothing more personal than being able to take your  child to the doctor and get the healthcare you need or care for your  parents.   Margo wrote:         Seeing working people who have struggled all of their adult       lives to manage their chronic health conditions finally have       access to regular doctor visits, health education, and       prescription medications has been a tremendous relief. It is       amazing how different the lives of our patients are today       compared to what they were a few years ago.    She added: ``You can't imagine the sense of dignity the people I see  feel.''   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.    It is time to bring back some dignity to the U.S.  Senate.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.
