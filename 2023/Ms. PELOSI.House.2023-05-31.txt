 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for  his leadership. I also thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Boyle), the ranking member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I associate myself with the great remarks of our  distinguished leader, Mr. Hakeem Jeffries, who spoke earlier and  captured so much of what is so important here today.   Mr. Speaker, our Constitution makes perfectly clear the validity of  the public debt of the United States shall not be questioned. In the  bipartisan budget agreement, we honor our sworn oaths as lawmakers to  uphold this constitutional duty.   While I find this legislation objectionable, it will avert an  unprecedented default, which would bring devastation to America's  families: millions of jobs eliminated, trillions in savings erased,  higher costs on loans, mortgages, car payments, credit card bills, and  more.   Let us commend President Biden for his responsible leadership to  prevent this unconscionable outcome while protecting Social Security,  Medicare, Medicaid; protecting healthcare for our veterans as our  Commander in Chief; protecting our progress on climate and  infrastructure; and protecting our economy.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, reaffirming to  Americans that the full faith and credit of the United States shall not  be questioned.
