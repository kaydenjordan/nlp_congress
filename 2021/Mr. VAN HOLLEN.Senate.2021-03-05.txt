 Mr. President, I share my colleague's interest in  supporting the men and women at Customs and Border Protection, but this  amendment does the opposite. In fact, what it does is strip them of  critical emergency support to them and other frontline Federal  employees who are working to protect our country. In fact, 8,000 of the  Federal employees at CBP have tested positive for COVID-19. Twenty- seven have died.   Your amendment would strip away emergency medical leave for these men  and women who are protecting us while keeping the provisions in the  bill that provide a 100-percent tax credit to private employers to  provide up to $511 a day in sick leave, a provision I support.   So here you are targeting the men and women who are protecting our  country at the border and other places by stripping them of their  ability to take sick leave and keeping in the provision that allows our  private sector neighbors to provide sick leave. This is, unfortunately,  just aimed at undermining the folks who are helping protect this  country on the frontline. I ask my colleagues to oppose the amendment.    Mr. President, I ask for 15 seconds.    I just want to point out that if we want to prevent  the spread of the virus, we need to make sure those who get it have a  chance to stay home and not spread it among their colleagues around the  country.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1383
