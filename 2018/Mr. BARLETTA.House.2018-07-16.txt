 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5772) to designate the J. Marvin Jones Federal Building and  Courthouse in Amarillo, Texas, as the ``J. Marvin Jones Federal  Building and Mary Lou Robinson United States Courthouse''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5772         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. DESIGNATION.         The J. Marvin Jones Federal Building and Courthouse located       at 205 SE 5th Ave., Amarillo, Texas, shall be known and       designated as the ``J. Marvin Jones Federal Building and Mary       Lou Robinson United States Courthouse''.       SEC. 2. REFERENCES.         Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper,       or other record of the United States to the Federal building       and United States courthouse referred to in section 1 shall       be deemed to be a reference to the ``J. Marvin Jones Federal       Building and Mary Lou Robinson United States Courthouse''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 5772.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5772 would designate the J. Marvin Jones Federal  Building and Courthouse in Amarillo, Texas, as the J. Marvin Jones  Federal Building and Mary Lou Robinson United States Courthouse.   Judge Robinson was a legal pioneer, paving the way for women in what  was once a male-dominated profession.   In 1973, Judge Robinson was appointed justice of the Seventh Court of  Appeals in Amarillo, Texas, making her the first female appellate judge  in Texas. Four years later, she was appointed to chief justice of the  same court. Five years later, President Carter appointed Robinson to a  Federal judgeship as the second woman to serve as a United States  district judge in Texas.   For over 60 years, Judge Robinson was a pioneer, a scholar, and,  above all, a judge of fairness and integrity. I support naming this  Federal building and courthouse after her.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Thornberry).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3460) to designate the United States courthouse located at  323 East Chapel Hill Street in Durham, North Carolina, as the ``John  Hervey Wheeler United States Courthouse'', as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3460         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. JOHN HERVEY WHEELER UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE.         (a) Designation.--The United States courthouse located at       323 East Chapel Hill Street in Durham, North Carolina, shall       be known and designated as the ``John Hervey Wheeler United       States Courthouse'' during the period in which the facility       is used as a Federal courthouse.        (b) References.--During the period in which the facility       referred to in subsection (a) is used as a Federal       courthouse, any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       United States courthouse referred to in subsection (a) shall       be deemed to be a reference to the ``John Hervey Wheeler       United States Courthouse''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous materials on H.R. 3460, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  H.R. 3460 would designate the United States courthouse located in  Durham, North Carolina, as the John Hervey Wheeler United States  Courthouse.   Mr. Wheeler played a pivotal role in the civil rights movement. John  Wheeler was a respected civil rights leader in Durham, North Carolina,  successfully litigating school segregation cases in the 1940s.   In 1961, President Kennedy appointed Mr. Wheeler to the United States  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission where he worked alongside Vice  President Johnson in drafting civil rights legislation.   Mr. Wheeler also served as president of the Mechanics & Farmers Bank  where he was able to continue his work on civil rights issues, making  possible the purchase of homes, the acquisition of Federal loans, and a  relaxation of racial barriers in North Carolina.   Mr. Speaker, I think it is fitting to name the courthouse in Durham  after him. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 2734) to designate the Federal building and United States  courthouse located at 1300 Victoria Street in Laredo, Texas, as the  ``George P. Kazen Federal Building and United States Courthouse''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2734         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. GEORGE P. KAZEN FEDERAL BUILDING AND UNITED STATES                     COURTHOUSE.         (a) Designation.--The Federal building and United States       courthouse located at 1300 Victoria Street in Laredo, Texas,       shall be known and designated as the ``George P. Kazen       Federal Building and United States Courthouse''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       Federal building and United States courthouse referred to in       subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the       ``George P. Kazen Federal Building and United States       Courthouse''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on S. 2734.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 2734 would designate the Federal building and the  United States courthouse located in Laredo, Texas, as the George P.  Kazen Federal Building and United States Courthouse.   Judge Kazen was appointed to the United States District Court for the  Southern District of Texas by President Carter in 1979. He served as  chief judge from 1996 to 2003, and assumed senior status in 2009. In  March of this year, he retired from the bench.   Prior to his appointment as a Federal judge, Judge Kazen was in  private practice for 14 years. Earlier in his career, he served in the  United States Air Force as a captain and judge advocate. In addition,  Judge Kazen has been an adjunct professor of law at St. Mary's  University School of Law and served as judge on the Foreign  Intelligence Surveillance Court.   Given Judge Kazen's service, I think it is more than fit to name this  Federal building and courthouse after him.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R 5846) to require the Comptroller General of the United States  to conduct a study regarding the buyout practices of the Federal  Emergency Management Agency, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5846         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Promoting Flood Risk       Mitigation Act''.       SEC. 2. GAO STUDY REGARDING BUYOUT PRACTICES.

Stafford       Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C.       5170c(b)(2));        (4) the term ``eligible property owner'' means a       policyholder under the National Flood Insurance Program with       a household income that is not more than 120 percent of the       mean household income for the community in which the primary       residence of the policyholder is located;        (5) the term ``National Flood Insurance Program'' means the       program established under the National Flood Insurance Act of       1968 (42 U.S.C. 4001 et seq.);        (6) the term ``repetitive loss structure'' has the meaning       given the term in section 1370(a) of the National Flood       Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4121(a)); and        (7) the term ``severe repetitive loss structure'' has the       meaning given the term in section 1366(h) of the National       Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4104c(h)).        (b) Study Required.--The Comptroller General of the United       States shall conduct a study to assess--  [[Page H6225]]         (1) the efficacy of buyout practices, as in effect on the       date on which the study is conducted; and        (2) ways to streamline the buyout practices described in       paragraph (1) in order to provide more timely assistance to a       larger number of State and local governments.        (c) Considerations and Analysis.--The study conducted under       subsection (b) shall consider and analyze the following:        (1) To the extent possible, current (as of the date on       which the study is conducted) and future trends with respect       to repetitive loss structures and severe repetitive loss       structures that are insured under the National Flood       Insurance Program, including, with respect to both inland and       coastal areas--        (A) changes in flood risk, flood frequency, and flood       magnitude since the inception of the National Flood Insurance       Program; and        (B) projections for changes in flood risk, flood frequency,       and flood magnitude by 2025, 2050, and 2075.        (2) To the extent possible, buyout practices (as of the       date on which the study is conducted), including--        (A) the availability of funding sources for buyout programs       through various grant programs;        (B) the total number of properties acquired though buyout       programs;        (C) the average length of time for a State or local       government to acquire a flood-damaged property under a buyout       program, with that period beginning on the date on which the       State or local government, as applicable, begins       participating in the buyout program;        (D) an estimate of the number of flood-damaged properties       that could be acquired from willing property owners under       buyout programs with the full cooperation of State and local       governments;        (E) the socioeconomic status of recipients of buyouts under       buyout programs; and        (F) examples of successful buyout programs, including best       practices employed.        (3) Administrative, financial, or temporal constraints that       may impede the timely acquisition of properties under a       buyout program, including--        (A) a lack of communication or cooperation between the       Administrator and the State and local governments that       purchase properties under a buyout program;        (B) pressures to redevelop a property after acquiring a       property through a buyout program; and        (C) a lack of adequate funding.        (4) Potential options, methods, and strategies to address       the constraints identified under paragraph (3), including       evaluating the feasibility of--        (A) a pilot program under which--        (i) an eligible property owner may agree, before a flood       event occurs, to have the primary single-family residence of       the eligible property owner purchased after the residence has       been substantially damaged by a flood;        (ii) the Administrator may provide--         (I) financial assistance to State and local governments       that are willing to participate in the program to purchase       and acquire the properties of owners that have incurred       substantial damage from a flood event; and        (II) a premium credit as an incentive to eligible property       owners to agree to participate in the program;         (iii) properties that are acquired--         (I) shall be maintained as open space in accordance with       section 404(b)(2) of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief       and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5170c(b)(2)); and        (II) may be used for non-structural mitigation,       conservation, and recreational purposes; and         (iv) not fewer than 5 and not more than 10 State and local       governments shall participate; and        (B) the role that nonprofit organizations could play in       making buyouts more readily available or more efficient,       similar to the role that those organizations play in the       acquisition of properties for conservation purposes.        (5) The ecological, financial, and flood risk reduction       benefits that buyout practices, as in effect on the date on       which the study is conducted, provide, which shall--        (A) take into account the differences between inland and       coastal areas; and        (B) include--        (i) examples in which ecosystem restoration and other       nature-based approaches have enhanced the reduction of flood       risk; and        (ii) recommendations for best practices.        (6) To the extent possible, an assessment of how the       Administrator may use buyout programs to reduce future flood       disaster recovery costs that are attributable to future       projections of flood risk as a result of sea level rise,       population changes, subsidence, and other factors.        (7) A cost-benefit analysis of mitigation and buy-out       projects and programs, including an assessment of       opportunities and challenges for leveraging different Federal       resources and funding to maximize the value of Federal       investment in disaster mitigation.        (d) Report.--        (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United       States shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress       and the Administrator a report that sets forth the analysis,       conclusions, and recommendations resulting from the study       conducted under subsection (b).        (2) Contents.--The report submitted under paragraph (1)       shall detail the feasibility of the Administrator       establishing, and the processes required for the       Administrator to establish, an alternative buyout program,       such as the pilot program described in subsection (c)(4)(A).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on H.R. 5846, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5846, as amended, the Promoting Flood Risk  Mitigation Act, requires the Government Accountability Office to  conduct a study and issue a report to Congress regarding the flood  buyout practices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.   The removal of homes and buildings that have been repeatedly flooded  to avoid future disaster damages and losses is a critical mitigation  technique.   These mitigation measures not only save lives but also reduce  disaster costs by minimizing the risk of future damage from disasters.  Studies have shown that for every $1 invested in mitigation, there is a  potential savings of $4 to $8, because of damages avoided.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Sanford).    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on  H.R. 5846, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.
