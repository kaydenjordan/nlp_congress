 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the class of  2023 graduates from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and the 23  exemplary graduates from the State of Michigan.   From plebes to firsties, and now second lieutenants in the U.S. Army,  the class of 2023 has come through one of the most challenging and  rewarding experiences of their lives to join ``The Long Gray Line.''  The class motto, ``Freedom is not Free,'' reflects the class of 2023's  commitment and moral, mental, and physical strength necessary to  graduate from West Point and serve as commissioned officers in the U.S.  Army. I commend the graduates for their dedication to support and  defend the American Constitution and uphold the ethical standards of  the Army and United States of America.   I am honored to ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating, from  Michigan: Zachary C. Hellebuyck, Jack Fish, Zenon Stepien, Audra Bloch,  Madison Tolston, Elle Bennett, Colin J. Day, Daniel Reimchen, Henry J.  Janeway, Jr., Alma Cooper, Michael J. Erickson, Jr., Luke Doyle, Daniel  Chung, Margaret Neumeyer, Henry Carroll, Michael Lance, Tyler Prichard,  Benjamin Buia, Levi D. Hren, Erika Rapp.While their service to our  Nation has just begun, I am confident these new officers will embody  the values of ``Duty, Honor, Country.''                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to honor the McFarlan  Veterans Memorial Park located in Flint, MI, in Genesee County. The  stewards of this historic landmark, ``The Friends of McFarlan Park,''  incorporated in 2011 and forged a formal agreement with the city of  Flint authorizing the organization to preserve and manage the park.  Developing a master plan to renovate and update the facility,  volunteers spent years fundraising, reaching their goal in 2022  allowing the park's renovation to begin. It is a privilege and honor to  recognize the completion of this historic project and commemorate the  formal rededication of the park on Thursday, July 13, 2023.   In 1875, the park was purchased for $3,700, becoming the first park  owned by the city of Flint and named for lumber baron, farmer, and  Flint mayor Alexander McFarlan who donated and oversaw the installation  of a water fountain on the property. In 1951, the park was designated  as Genesee County's official war memorial, erecting a historical stone  marker with the following inscription, ``FOREVER HONORING ALL THE MEN  AND WOMEN OF GENESEE COUNTY WHO SERVED IN THE ARMED FORCES OF THE  UNITED STATES IN TIME OF WAR DEDICATED MAY 30, 1951.''   In 1968, the park erected memorial columns which now contain the  names of thousands of Genesee County military veterans who paid the  ultimate sacrifice to our country from the Civil War to present day. In  1969, the Flint Council of the American Legion installed and dedicated  a key landmark known within the park, an eternal burning flame which  features a commemorative plaque signifying it as a ``Flame of  Freedom.'' On July 21, 1975, the McFarlan Veterans Memorial Park  celebrated its centennial, adding a new marker in place of the  ornamental fountain that once stood in the park gifted by its namesake,  Alexander McFarlan. The marker now serves as a celebration of the  park's 100 years of existence and the community growth throughout this  time. On the back side, a commemorative plaque was installed in 2005  noting its sesquicentennial celebration and funding provided by the  Ruth Mott Foundation, which provided new landscaping. The most recent  commemorative addition features recognition of K9 service dogs who  serve in the U.S. military and was gifted by Roberta Gramer in honor of  her son, Navy veteran and Friend of McFarlan Park board member William  Dennis Gramer, 1944-2023.   Located in the heart of downtown Flint, the McFarlan Veteran Memorial  Park has continued to thoughtfully remind us that our freedom is not  free, recognize our Armed Service members, is home to annual Veterans  Day and Memorial Day ceremonies, and inspires community pride through  Earth Day cleanups and more.   I cannot understate the impact that McFarlan Veterans Memorial Park  has had on the generations of citizens who call the city of Flint and  Genesee County home. A pillar of strength and a solemn place to honor  and mourn the loss of a loved one, this historical monument is the  embodiment of the leadership throughout this community and the  generosity of ongoing monetary support to honor our history. I ask you  to join me in recognizing and celebrating the rededication of this 148- year-old historic memorial and the Friends of McFarlan Park for  renewing their commitment to ``Remember all those who have fallen,  remember those who are no longer with us, and never forget that freedom  is not free.''                            ____________________
