 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong  support of the nearly 2.5 million children whose lives have been saved  by the Hyde amendment.   This landmark legislation has been a part of every budget in Congress  that we have passed since 1976. Now, this amendment is threatened by  liberals in Congress who want to force taxpayers to pay for abortions.  This is wrong.   As a doctor, I know that the dignity of life is a fundamental truth.  To turn our backs on this amendment would not only subvert the will of  the American people, it will cost lives.   By eliminating the Hyde amendment, Democrats want to expand unlimited  access to abortion services at taxpayers' expense. Any budget that we  pass must include the Hyde amendment.                            ____________________
