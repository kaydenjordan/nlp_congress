 Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania for  yielding.   I rise in support of this amendment, which is being sponsored by my  colleague and friend from Pennsylvania.   The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act, VAWA, responds to our  Nation's crisis of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault,  and stalking. VAWA expired in September of last year, and it is long  past time for Congress to reauthorize this legislation.   Representative Dean's amendment will increase interagency cooperation  efforts to prevent violence and provide critical services to survivors.  No one solution can stop every act of violence, but this amendment  recognizes that more coordination among agencies over best practices,  resources, and technology will lead to better results for those in need  of urgent assistance.   As survivors transition out of crisis, they need access to housing,  healthcare, and other vital resources to rebuild their lives. In my  home district, organizations like Turning Point of Lehigh Valley assist  survivors of abuse and their families. This amendment and VAWA overall  will enable  [[Page H3032]]  shelters like Turning Point to better serve people in need.   Madam Chair, I am proud to stand with survivors.
