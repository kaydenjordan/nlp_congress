 Madam Speaker, today, thousands of air traffic  controllers, who we know are essential to our safety and work in one of  the most stressful work environments, have had to work without being  paid for 34 days.   Unions for air traffic controllers, pilots, and flight attendants  released a letter today describing the impact of this shutdown. This is  what they wrote: ``We have a growing concern for the safety and  security of our members, our airlines, and the traveling public due to  the government shutdown. This is already the longest government  shutdown in the history of the United States, and there is no end in  sight. In our risk-averse industry, we cannot even calculate the level  of risk currently at play nor predict the point at which the entire  system will break. It is unprecedented.''   This is unconscionable.   Mr. President, you took credit for this shutdown. You said you would  accept the responsibility. You said you own this shutdown. Are you  going to own and take responsibility for the loss of lives for a  catastrophe that will be caused in the sky because you are holding the  American people hostage for a political agenda that has no credibility  whatsoever?                            ____________________
