 Mr. Speaker, it is frustrating to hear the  political games being played, when a piece of legislation isn't really  about what it is intended to be about or what the title says that it  is.   My colleague, whom I have respect for, and have watched him argue  cogently on some issues, is actually incorrect on this. Suggesting that  because I voted ``no'' on this bill I somehow don't support NATO, it is  really, quite frankly, absurd.   I remember being in Iraq in 2003 when British SAS soldiers were  wounded, and my Tier One task force went in, and we pulled those guys  off the battlefield wounded. I took care of them in the back of the  helicopter. I am fully supportive of NATO.   Quite frankly, it angers me that the suggestion because I voted on a  piece of legislation that had a clause in it that didn't make sense to  me that I am somehow not supportive of NATO. No one has been more  supportive of NATO.   Yes, many of us voted ``no'' on that bill, but it was because it  created this extra body to discuss democracy when we are at war trying  to save a democracy.   How about we focus NATO on what is going on in Ukraine and not  forming some new discussion group about democracy?   So, yeah, several of us voted no. But I assure you, Mr. Speaker, and  my colleague from Maryland, that has nothing to do with a lack of  support for NATO. Because when I was on that battlefield helping that  British SAS warrior and they are supporting us, I didn't see a lot of  other people who might be pointing a finger at us for not supporting  NATO on that battlefield that day. There was nobody in this room in  that helicopter flying into Baghdad with me.
