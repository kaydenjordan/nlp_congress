 Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago we reached another troublesome  milestone for Puget Sound's magnificent, but endangered, orca  population.   We lost yet another southern resident orca, this time a 23-year-old  male known as L-92. This is the third death just in the past year, and  the sixth in the past 2 years.   There are now just 75 southern resident orcas left, the lowest number  in 34 years. In fact, that is 13 fewer whales than when the population  was initially listed in 2005 under the Endangered Species Act.   I am sad about this loss and frustrated about this loss. Indeed, I am  beyond frustrated. I am beyond frustrated because we know what needs to  be done to save this iconic species in the Pacific Northwest. But,  quite frankly, the Federal Government isn't living up to its  partnership responsibility.   Back home in Washington State, the State government and local  partners are stepping up. Governor Inslee earlier this year created the  Southern Resident Orca Task Force, and he charged two terrific public  servants, my friends, Stephanie Solien and Les Purce, with leading it.  But these partners can't do it alone; nor should they.   We all have to fully invest in the Puget Sound in orca recovery  programs. Mr. Speaker, I remind you Puget Sound is the largest estuary  in the United States of America.   The good news is we know where our efforts need to go. Eighty percent  of the southern resident orcas' diet is Chinook salmon, and these  salmon populations are in just as much danger of extinction as our  orcas. Most of those salmon are gone. They are being eaten by sea lions  and seals; and where they swim in Puget Sound it is simply too  polluted.   The pollution killing them is from storm water runoff--toxic metals,  chemicals, and oils. It kills literally in a matter of hours, and we  have the film to prove it. Storm water runoff remains the largest  source of pollution in Puget Sound, and we cannot save our beloved  orcas and our salmon if we do not stop that. Period.   So we will fight for funding to tackle these problems. But I also  believe we have to raise awareness. That is why last week I introduced  H. Res. 959, which would designate June 2018 as National Orca  Protection Month. In Washington State, we gather every June to  celebrate our southern resident orcas. We join Native American Tribes  who have always recognized and honored the spiritual and cultural  significance of that which they call the Blackfish.   But as the orca population has declined, these celebrations have  turned into calls for action. National Orca Protection Month serves as  a reminder of work that requires a year-round focus. It is vital that  the Federal Government play its vital partnership role.   So, Mr. Speaker, I ask Members to please support this resolution to  designate National Orca Protection Month. Let's give our Federal  agencies the resources they need to prevent the extinction of this  beautiful and magnificent species and ensure that orcas survive for  generations yet to come.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I want to ask for the chairwoman's assistance  on an impending threat to our national security.   Roads surrounding military installations play an important role in  preserving military readiness. Our Armed Forces need to mobilize  quickly, and we need functional roads in order to do that. The same is  true for other infrastructure supporting defense communities where our  soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines live and raise their families.   This is a problem all over this country and a severe one, but it is  especially acute right outside Joint Base Lewis-McChord in the 10th  Congressional District of Washington, which I have the privilege to  represent and is the largest force projection base in the Western  United States. More than 50,000 people report to work there every day.  It is the second most requested location in the Army, second to Hawaii.  Still, I am thrilled when they get new things like, recently, the C-17  Weapons Instructor Course and a Security Force Assistance Brigade.   What I am not thrilled about is the frustratingly long wait times at  the front gate for JBLM or the heavy traffic diverting through  neighborhoods to avoid traffic jams.   My very first term in Congress, I introduced the COMMUTE Act to help  address these issues. I have been working on the problem every year  since. This year, both the House and Senate authorizing committees  acknowledged this need by creating the Defense Community Infrastructure  Program, or DCIP. This program builds off the COMMUTE Act and  encourages infrastructure projects near military installations that are  caused by their presence.   I know being stuck in traffic is not something unknown to most  Americans. We are all too familiar with the horrible feeling of  approaching an unexpected slow crawl on the road. But when this affects  our military's ability to get to the base to do the job and be ready  for anything, that is when we can't just sit and sit and wait and wait,  as I have, year in and year out, for it to get better.   If servicemembers cannot get on and off base, they may decide to  never leave the base. But military bases are not islands in our  districts. They are integral parts of the community. Expecting  servicemembers to stay behind the force protection of their bases  exacerbates the civil-military divide.   It is shortsighted and foolhardy not to consider the infrastructure  surrounding and supporting our installations. The Federal Government  must play a role in addressing military community infrastructure  projects.     Mr. Chair, I thank the chairwoman very much for  acknowledging this problem and for her commitment to work to address  it.   Over the summer, I will work with relevant stakeholders, including  the authorizing committees, the Secretary of Defense, and the  Association of Defense Communities, which strongly supports this  proposal, to get the gentlewoman and her staff a sense of the scope of  this problem.   I look forward to working with the Defense Subcommittee on tackling  the problem and finding the resources to update and repair  infrastructure around military bases.
