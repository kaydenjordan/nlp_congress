 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Latinos became the largest ethnic group in the United States in 2008  and, well before 2060, will make up 25 percent of the American  population. In spite of their essential relevance to our country's  intellectual and cultural life, the task force that the gentleman from  California spoke about that was commissioned in 1994 by the secretary  of the Smithsonian Institution found that, ``U.S. Latinos and Latinas  are the only major contributor to American civilization still  uncelebrated by any specific, systemic, permanent effort in this  country's major cultural institution.'' We are rectifying this  situation today.   The National Mall is America's front yard, and it draws millions of  visitors every year to some of the best museums and monuments that  honor our most revered citizens. Half of all Americans will visit the  National Mall in their lifetime, but there is nothing to the American  Latino. To fully understand American history, we need a museum for the  American Latino and Latina.    Historian Dr. Peter Stearns has said: ``History helps us understand  people and societies, helps us understand change and how the society we  live in came to be. History contributes to moral understanding,  provides identity, and studying it is essential for good citizenship.''  At a time of intense public debate about whitewashing history, we  should jump at the chance to collect, present, and protect in one place  artifacts, stories, and collections that reflect our entire history.   The National Museum of African American History and Culture had one  million visitors in its first 4 months. If this is any indication of  the potential success for a museum of the American Latino, this  investment will be well worth it.   Many incredible people have fought to bring to life the idea of a  national museum for the American Latino.   Robert McCormick Adams, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution,  commissioned the 1994 task force.   Raul Yzaguirre chaired the task force, with his vice chair Mari  Carmen, and they have been fighting for this museum for 25 years.   In 2004, my friend and former colleague, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, along  with another former colleague, Xavier Becerra, first introduced  legislation to establish the museum.   Henry Munoz, a fellow San Antonian, served faithfully as chairman for  the National Museum of the American Latino Commission with his vice  chair, Susan Gonzales from California. They authored a report on how to  achieve this vision.   And another organization critical to the success of this initiative,  Friends of the American Latino, whose chair, Danny Vargas, vice chair,  Ivette Fernandez, and CEO, Estuardo Rodriguez, have toiled to make this  a reality.   Today, Congress gets to fulfill the work of these folks and many  more. If we want to understand this experiment we call America, then we  must understand ourselves, and we can't do that unless we understand  all of our Nation's history.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this landmark piece of  legislation. I am proud to associate my name with Ranking Member Davis,  who has been a champion of this, to see this go to fruition, and the  distinguished gentlemen from California (Mr. Aguilar), my good friend,  and the gentleman from California (Mr. Cardenas), and, of course, the  distinguished gentleman from New York (Mr. Serrano).                                time  1030     Madam Speaker, at a time with incredibly divisive  politics, we are showing that we can actually come together for the  betterment of our society as a whole.   The fact that there have been folks from well over a quarter of a  century fighting and toiling to make this a reality is an example for  all of us. And the fact that everybody here today in this Chamber has  an opportunity to play a small part in that is quite exciting.   I think, 10 years from now, when there is a 6-year-old kid walking in  the new Smithsonian museum for the American Latino, and they see  something about Pete Aguilar, it is going to be an exciting opportunity  for me in the future, and I am glad to play a small part.   Again, I urge my colleagues to vote ``aye'' on this landmark piece of  legislation.
