 I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 3, line 17, strike ``; and'' and insert ``, other than       an excepted consent decree or settlement agreement;''.        Page 4, line 4, strike the period and insert ``; and''.        Page 4, insert after line 4 the following:        (6) the term ``excepted consent decree or settlement       agreement'' means a covered consent decree or covered       settlement agreement pertaining to a deadline established by       Congress through the enactment of a Federal statute to--        (A) significantly improve access to affordable, high-speed       broadband internet in under-served markets, such as low-      income and rural communities; and        (B) facilitate economic development in locations without       sufficient access to such service.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 577, the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Johnson) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to support my amendment  to H.R. 469, and to advocate for rural Georgians and Americans across  the country who don't have dependable access to broadband internet  services.   We are here today debating H.R. 469, a bill that would require  burdensome and unnecessary processes that would delay the enforcement  of Federal regulations. H.R. 469 undermines the ability of government  agencies to protect public health and safety by prohibiting them from  using consent decrees and settlements to enforce the law that we pass  by allowing private industry to intervene in opposition to regulations  that they deem unfavorable to them. It requires the publishing of the  personal data of those who bring complaints against the government,  thus deterring complaints.   My amendment would ensure that future actions taken by Congress to  increase broadband access in rural areas are not stymied by these  excessive regulatory burdens. My amendment would exempt any future  legislation, or any future rules that may be enacted to bring this  technology to underserved areas from the requirements put in place by  H.R. 469.   It shouldn't be groundbreaking news that, in many of our districts, a  gap exists between urban and rural communities insofar as broadband  connectivity is concerned. The Fourth District of Georgia has some  rural pockets that are facing this challenge today.   According to a study done by the Pew Research Center in 2016, rural  Americans are still 10 percentage points less likely than average  citizens to have broadband access at home. Although we have seen  improvements since the 16-point gap in 2007, we have much work to do to  ensure that all families have access to what is now a modern necessity.   My home State of Georgia ranks 21st in the Nation in terms of access  to 25 megabit per second broadband, according to a report put together  by the Georgia House and Senate Study Committee on High Speed Broadband  Communications Access for all Georgians. In rural counties where this  problem persists, we have seen local development stall without access  to telehealth services, educational materials, and other digital  resources.   Broadband connectivity brings with it countless learning  opportunities and exchanges of information that are not possible in  isolated communities without broadband. The issue of broadband access  is inextricably linked to the vitality of these rural areas, and it is  in our best interest as a Congress to give rural communities all of the  modern tools they need to succeed.  [[Page H8204]]    The FCC's 2016 Broadband Progress Report identified 24 million rural  Americans throughout the country who don't have a broadband  connection--24 million Americans whose access would be delayed even  further by the implementation of H.R. 469's elimination of consent  decrees.   I hope Congress can agree on the importance of achieving full  broadband access, and I hope that this amendment will begin removing  this hurdle that is being put in place by my friends on the other side  of the aisle who support business as opposed to people.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  commonsense amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I just enjoyed the contrast  between our different styles. The Congressman, my friend from Georgia,  is very upbeat and passionate. I am more laid back and kind of  reserved. But we both agree on the fact that we want more broadband to  be accessible to rural customers. We both agree on that.   We just simply disagree on whether or not we should allow a process  whereby a third-party corporation can come in and gum up the regulatory  scheme that has been laid out in the rulings that have been made and,  thus, delay the availability of broadband to rural customers.   Mr. Chair, I would ask respectfully that my colleagues support my  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia will  be postponed.   The Committee will rise informally.   The Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Johnson of Louisiana) assumed the chair.                            ____________________
