 Madam Speaker, how free are we as Americans  if we are holed up in our homes, shell-shocked by gun violence? We  should not have to live like that. We shouldn't have to live tormented  by the need to buy yet another gun more powerful than the one our  neighbor purchased last week. That is not freedom. Our kids deserve  better.   The old and tired NRA Republican Party philosophy, which is the only  way to stop a bad guy is a good guy with a gun, has not and will not  work. In Uvalde, 19 good guys with guns didn't stop the killer of 19  school kids and two teachers.   We have done it the Republican way for far too long now, and for the  sake of the kids, it is time to do something different.   Today, the good guys in the House will stand up to the NRA and pass  the commonsense Protecting Our Kids Act.                                time  1515
