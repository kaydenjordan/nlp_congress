 Madam President, Idaho is known for its rolling  foothills, crystal clear rivers and streams, and of course some  exquisite mountains. Idahoans embrace these treasures across our State  and are committed to keeping these natural resources pristine for the  next generation. This commitment to maintaining our public lands  contributes to an abundance of innovation and creativity in the natural  resources space in my home State. As chairman of the Senate Committee  on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, it is my distinct pleasure to  recognize Sundance Consulting, Inc., as the Small Business of the Month  for May 2018. Sundance Consulting, Inc.'s work on important  environmental and natural resource-related issues exemplifies Idaho's  entrepreneurial spirit and stewardship of our environment.   After 19 years of working for the Native American Lands Environmental  Mitigation Program as a consultant focused on addressing environmental  problems related to previous Department of Defense activities,  September Myres founded Sundance Consulting, Inc., in 2005. She founded  Sundance with a vision to provide solutions to the environmental  challenges faced by Native Americans and Native Alaskans alike. Raised  on the Fort Hall Indian Reservation in Idaho, Ms. Myres has a keen  understanding of the unique environmental issues that tribes face. With  her background and experience in Tribal lands, Ms. Myres is uniquely  positioned to implement innovative solutions to ongoing environmental  problems in these communities. Among the solutions that September  provides are general consulting services, environmental site  assessments, site investigations, radioactive waste retrieval, process  optimization, and soil and water sampling, all of which help clients  understand the environment they are working in and ways to mitigate any  potentially harmful activities.   Under Ms. Myres' exceptional leadership, Sundance Consulting has  grown from a sole proprietorship to a firm of more than 50 employees.  The company is headquartered in Pocatello, ID, with eight satellite  offices across the Nation. From 2011 to 2016, Sundance increased their  revenue by $10 million and hired an additional 50 employees. The firm's  continued growth has been a product of its growing client base. From  its original focus on tribal clients to today's diverse portfolio of  Federal, State, and commercial clients, Sundance prides itself on  delivering quality advice and planning services on-time and under  budget, while protecting the environment. Over time, the company has  expanded its offerings to include public outreach and liaison services  that help to build consensus and increase public participation in the  planning of client projects. Over its 13 years in business Sundance has  earned a reputation of excellence in their field by bringing diverse  organizations together to create environmental solutions.   In 2008, Sundance began utilizing the SBA 8(a) Business Development  Program, a 9-year certification program that helps small, disadvantaged  businesses compete for government contracts. The program provided Ms.  Myres with the tools and knowledge required to grow her business.  Sundance's success has allowed the company to give back to their local  community in Idaho. Every year, the company provides school supplies  and backpacks to children in need, through a charity drive in Chubbuck,  ID. Additionally, Sundance provides scholarships to Native American  students going in to the science, technology, engineering, or  mathematics fields.   The company's high standards and good reputation have led to  recognition from the environmental and small business communities. The  Environmental Business Journal noted Sundance's incredible growth and  economic success in environmental consulting. In 2016, the Journal  awarded Sundance the 19th Annual Small Firms Award for Achievement. Due  to her success as an entrepreneur and her commitment to environmental  preservation, the Small Business Administration honored Ms. Myres as  the 2018 Idaho Small Business Person of the Year during National Small  Business Week for demonstrating growth, innovation, and perseverance in  the face of adversity.   Innovation, growth, and commitment to quality are the hallmarks of  Sundance Consulting's success. The company's continual commitment to  helping communities exemplifies how small businesses are in a unique  position to make a profit and make a difference. Sundance is a true  inspiration to innovators and small businesses across the Nation for  their incredible success. I would like to extend my sincerest  congratulations to September Myres and all of the employees at Sundance  Consulting, Inc., for being selected as the May 2018 Small Business of  the Month. You make our great State of Idaho proud, and I look forward  to watching your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
