 Madam Speaker, the armed insurrectionists who stormed the  Capitol did not emerge out of a vacuum. They were lied to by Republican  Senators and Republican Congressmen and -women. But they were incited  to violence by one man above all else: Donald J. Trump, who tried to be  the ultimate ruler of our democracy.   The world is watching. Our allies are watching, and our adversaries  are watching. We must show them that no one will rule this country and  be above the law. The cameras of history are rolling. We must act. We  must impeach Donald J. Trump and show the world what we stand for.
