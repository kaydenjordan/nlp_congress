 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to  conclude my remarks before the scheduled rollcall vote.    Mr. President, I rise today to continue the discussion that  we have been having about the harms of Nord Stream 2.   I will discuss in this speech one of the administration's legal  responsibilities, in particular to impose sanctions in a way that they  are now defying those legal responsibilities.   I do want to note that every day brings new evidence of the  incoherence of President Biden's sellout and surrender to Vladimir  Putin. Since we last discussed this, elections have occurred in Germany  and the government of Angela Merkel, on whose behalf the Biden  administration claims to be acting, will now be replaced. So the entire  surrender to Russia by Joe Biden and Kamala Harris was for nothing. I  will discuss that further throughout the day and throughout the week.   We have heard repeatedly from my Democratic colleagues that my  actions to block some of President Biden's nominees are unprecedented.  That accusation doesn't stand up to scrutiny. Senators routinely use  their prerogatives, and, indeed, Democrats regularly engaged in massive  obstruction over months and years of President Trump's nominations.  What isn't unprecedented, however, is Joe Biden's open defiance and  literal lawlessness in not imposing the sanctions mandated by multiple  laws passed overwhelmingly by Congress.   Right now, I would like to talk about one of the laws that the  President is violating: CAATSA--the Countering America's Adversaries  Through Sanctions Act. Before getting into the details of Nord Stream  2, I would like to note a couple of things about CAATSA.   First, CAATSA was explicitly designed for the purpose of taking away  the President's discretion whether or not to impose sanctions on Russia  in cases where Congress had deemed it necessary to mandate them. And  secondly, on that basis, CAATSA passed Congress with nearly unanimous  support: 419 to 3 in the House, and 98 to 2 in the Senate.   As for the purpose of CAATSA, I would like to quote some of my  colleagues from the other side of the aisle who were both clear and  celebratory about the bill.   Senator Murphy, who has been particularly loquacious in opposition to  these holes, said about CAATSA: ``It is not often that Congress takes  away, from the president, discretionary powers on foreign policy.''   Worth remembering.   Senator Schumer, who has also had more than a little bit to say on  these holes, said that CAATSA was necessary because of what he  described as the President's ``seeming inability to deal with the many  transgressions of Russia.''   Gosh, Senator Schumer was right. We now have a President unwilling  and unable to deal with, as he put it, the ``many transgressions of  Russia.''   What about Senator Menendez?   Senator Menendez has stood on this floor, including at 4:00 and 5:00  and 6:00 in the morning, railing about these blocks.   Well, what did he say about CAATSA?   He said that CAATSA sent ``the most powerful message in the world,  that the United States--Democrats, Republicans, and Independents--stand  together.''   Those were really fine sentiments. I wish they held true when there  was a Democratic President as much as Senator Menendez believed them  when there was a Republican President.   And how about Senator Durbin?   Senator Durbin is never lacking an opinion on any topic. Here is what  he said: ``We had to tell them enough is enough, and when it came to  the sanctions and trusting the president, we basically said we want to  make sure the president will not lift these sanctions.''   Well, do you know what? Senator Murphy was right. Senator Schumer was  right. Senator Menendez was right. Senator Durbin was right. That is  why Congress came together to pass CAATSA, tough legislation to prevent  a President from doing what Joe Biden is doing right now: surrendering  to Putin, surrendering to Russia, ignoring U.S. law, and giving Putin a  multibillion-dollar gift.   And, when my Democratic colleagues didn't believe the Trump  administration was implementing the full breadth of mandatory sanctions  under CAATSA, they made the purpose of CAATSA even clearer.   On January 30, 2018, Senator Cardin led a letter about CAATSA to  then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, cosigned by 21 other Democrats-- almost half of the caucus. They said that the Trump administration's  failure to impose mandatory sanctions ``do not fully reflect the clear  congressional intent described in the legislation . . . We expect the  administration to provide a full explanation as to why it has not  imposed mandatory sanctions'' under several provisions of CAATSA.   Then, on May 18, 2018, Senator Menendez led a letter about CAATSA to  several inspectors general, cosigned by two other Democrats. They said  that ``[s]everal mandatory provisions of the law have not been  implemented . . . despite strong evidence that actions taken by or on  behalf of the Russian government are in violation of the CAATSA  sanctions law.''   In fact, I would like to read more of that letter because it is so  abundantly clear about the purpose of CAATSA:         In light of the apparent violations and the lack of       corresponding sanctions actions, we are concerned about       whether the sanctions implementation process within the       administration is fulfilling CAATSA's mandate and intent. In       general, with respect to mandatory measures, the President is       required to make determinations in the event he has       established that sanctions behavior has taken place, and then       either impose sanctions or exercise a waiver.    So a binary choice: One or the other. That is what of a President is  required.   And do you know what? Senator Cardin and Senator Menendez, well, they  might have meant it, but they didn't say it: Only Republican Presidents  are required to do this.   They didn't write that in their letters because, of course, CAATSA  doesn't say that. What they said is a President is required to make  that choice. The law requires the President to make that choice.   Senator Cardin was right. Senator Menendez was right. And Joe Biden  is telling them: Go jump in a lake.   He is telling the U.S. Congress: Go jump in a lake.   He is telling the American people: Go jump in a lake.   He is cutting a deal with Putin, and don't bring no stinkin' laws to  get in his way.   That brings to us Nord Stream 2. One of the provisions that my  Democratic colleagues cited in both of those letters was section 228:  ``Sanctions with respect to certain transactions with foreign sanctions  evaders and serious  [[Page S6717]]  human rights abusers in the Russian federation.''   Section 228 mandates the imposition of sanctions on any company that  conducts any ``significant transactions,'' including ``deceptive  transactions,'' for Russian companies that are already sanctioned.   There is no doubt--zero--that the company Nord Stream 2 AG, which is  the company responsible for the planning, the construction, and the  eventual operation of Putin's Nord Stream 2 Pipeline, has committed  acts that require the implementation and the imposition of those  mandated sanctions under CAATSA 228.   Indeed, that is one of the many reasons the pipeline was halted for a  year, and Putin only began building it again on January 24 of this  year--4 days after Joe Biden was sworn in. Because Joe Biden has been  so weak on this issue, because the pipeline exists only as a gift from  Biden to Putin, this pipeline is, in a very real sense, the Biden-Putin  pipeline.   We know that the Biden administration is defying the law, because the  Biden administration told us so in May. The Biden administration sent a  report to Congress describing how Nord Stream 2 AG had conducted  deceptive transactions for sanctioned Russian companies. That is the  explicit trigger in CAATSA for sanctions, and yet the Biden  administration has refused to meet its obligations under CAATSA, and  that leads to the reasonable compromise that I have offered.   For several months, I have had in place a hold on all State  Department nominees and on several Treasury Department nominees as  well. The reason for the hold has been simple--because Joe Biden is  defying the law and is giving Vladimir Putin a multibillion-dollar gift  that constitutes a generational geopolitical blunder that puts billions  of dollars into the Russian coffers every year that Putin will use for  military aggression against America and our allies. Biden's surrender  to Putin weakens Europe profoundly. It makes Europe dependent on Russia  even more so for energy and subject to Russia's energy blackmail. And  it also, on top of that, destroys jobs here in the United States.   For months, I have had in place the blanket hold that has caused  increasing cries of pain and dismay from our Democratic colleagues.  Interestingly, these same Democratic colleagues all agree that what  Biden is doing with the Biden-Putin pipeline is terrible. Almost to a  person, the Democrats who are complaining about this have denounced Joe  Biden for giving Putin this multibillion-dollar gift, but they say they  want to confirm his nominees anyway.   So what I have said is: All right. Fine. If the Biden administration  wants to defy the sanctions law that I drafted--the Cruz-Shaheen  sanctions law, it is two different bills that I drafted with Senator  Shaheen, Democrat from New Hampshire. We passed into law, overwhelming  bipartisan support from both Houses of Congress. If Joe Biden wants to  ignore those laws, then there is another avenue to resolve much of this  dispute, which is simply to follow the law under CAATSA.   So I extended an offer to Secretary Blinken, to Secretary Yellen, to  the White House that I would lift my holds on every career State  nominee and on the Treasury nominees where I placed holds in exchange  for one of two things: No. 1, the best outcome would be for the Biden  administration to actually implement CAATSA and sanction Nord Stream 2  AG, to follow the law, to do what is mandatory.   That would be the best outcome. If they did so, I would immediately  lift my holds.   But, secondly, I get that the White House politically has decided  they want to surrender to Putin on this. My understanding is there is  an interagency process--the State Department argued to do the right  thing. The State Department argued: Impose the sanctions on Nord Stream  2 AG, stop this pipeline, which, by the way, is what Tony Blinken sat  in my office and promised State would do. It is what just about every  senior nominee to the State Department has promised they would do.   State argued to do the right thing, but according to public reports,  the political operatives at the White House overruled their own State  Department. They said: Never mind the national security interests of  the United States. Never mind protecting America. Never mind stopping  Putin and Russia. Never mind protecting Europe's energy security. Never  mind protecting Europe from blackmail by Putin. We want to surrender  because Angela Merkel wants us to.   I talked last week about how a friend of mine jokes that the White  House political team sleeps with votive candles of Angela Merkel under  their beds. There is a view in the White House that what Merkel wants,  Merkel gets, even if it is bad for America, bad for Germany, bad for  Europe, but good for Russia.   Of course, Merkel is on her way out now, but they still want to do  this surrender. And this surrender, by the way, if it is completed,  will hurt America for generations to come--10 years, 20 years, 30 years  from now.   The next Russian dictator will be enriched by Joe Biden's surrender  to Putin on the Biden-Putin pipeline.   The two options: First, after imposing sanctions, they could leave  them in place. But, secondly, recognizing that they don't want to do  it, there is a second option I gave them, which is that they could  impose sanctions under CAATSA, but then they could delist Nord Stream 2  AG.   In other words, they could exercise the political decision not to  impose the sanctions. That gives them their policy--preferred policy  outcome.   What it also does under CAATSA is it triggers an automatic  congressional override vote.   So I told Secretary Blinken, I told Secretary Yellen: It is very  easy. If you believe in this foolhardy policy of surrendering to Putin,  then put your money where your mouth is. Follow the law, which is  clear, unequivocal, black letter law. Impose the sanctions. And you do  have a vehicle. You can delist it. The President can make a  determination that even though the sanctions are mandatory, he wants to  delist it.   But here is what Congress did. In CAATSA, it triggered an automatic  congressional override vote. And what I have told the administration  is: You know what. Whether I win or lose that override vote, if you  actually follow the law in such a way that it triggers that vote, I  will lift my holds--my holds on the career State nominees, my holds on  the Treasury nominees. You have a path. Simply subject yourself to  congressional oversight.   Now, it is very clear why they haven't taken this offer, which has  been in writing for months now. Because Joe Biden thinks if we had a  vote in this Senate, he would lose. He thinks if we had a vote in the  House, he would lose. He knows that Republicans would vote against him.   And if Democrats had a modicum of consistency, virtually every  Democrat in this Chamber and the House has been unequivocal that the  Nord Stream 2 Pipeline is devastating to U.S. national security. And so  the Biden White House doesn't want to risk members of his own party  voting against his surrender to Russia. So, instead, they defy the law.  That is an irresponsible course of action.   There is a very reasonable compromise on the table, and all of the  perils the Democrats are lamenting about these holds can be avoided if,  if, if Joe Biden will simply follow the law, follow CAATSA. The  mandatory sanctions that Democrats explained were designed to prevent a  President from doing what Joe Biden is doing right now, which is  surrendering to Russia. There is a reasonable compromise on the table.  All that is required is for Joe Biden to take it.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, over the last several weeks, I have talked  at length about the damage that President Biden and his administration  are doing to the national security of the United States and to the  security of our allies in Europe by giving Vladimir Putin a  multibillion-dollar gift in the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline.   Today, I am going to talk about the staggering diplomatic damage that  the President is doing by allowing and, indeed, facilitating this  project proceeding. It is well known that Nord Stream 2 is opposed  across Europe as an enabler of and, indeed, an example of and a weapon  of Russian expansionism and aggression.   Europeans have good reasons for their opposition. They know firsthand  what the costs are. They know that completing Nord Stream 2 will leave  the entire continent vulnerable to Putin's blackmail and aggression,  and that NATO's ability to act will be severely constrained while  billions will flow into the Kremlin's coffers.   What is sometimes underappreciated, however, even by the people who  are familiar with this issue, is the all-but-complete unanimity of the  opposition in Europe.   In 2018, the European Parliament voted by a vote of 403 to 105 to  oppose the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline. The pipeline proceeded, nonetheless,  until it was halted by the bipartisan sanctions passed by this Congress  in December of 2019--sanctions that I authored along with Democrat  Jeanne Shaheen. The pipeline was halted the very day those sanctions  were signed into law.   Then, in January of 2021, after Vladimir Putin tried to murder Alexei  Navalny, the European Parliament voted again to oppose Nord Stream 2,  this time by a vote of 581 to 50.   So I want you to pause for a second and reflect on the fact that Joe  Biden looked at that vote and said the President of the United States  is with the 50--never mind the 581--in the European Parliament. The  Biden administration was going to side with Russia on a 90-percent  issue, where the Biden White House is on the losing side.   Throughout all this process, there were plenty of voices in Germany  who were opposed, especially after this vicious attempt on Navalny's  life. The Parliamentary leader of the Greens, Katrin Goering-Eckardt,  said:         The blatant assassination attempt by the mafia-like       structures of the Kremlin can no longer leave us merely       concerned, it must have real consequences.    Stating, ``We need a clear answer'' that will ``make clear, Nord  Stream 2 is no longer something we can complete with Russia.''   Mr. President, my request to Senate Democrats, my request to  President Biden, my request to Kamala Harris is listen to the Greens.  That is not a sentence I have uttered on the floor of the Senate  before, nor is it one I anticipate saying frequently in the future. But  the Greens in Germany are telling you this is a bad idea; yet today's  Democratic Party that exalts climate change as the greatest issue in  the cosmos, when it comes to kissing up and surrendering to Putin,  decided to tell the Greens to go jump in the lake.   Former NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen issued a  statement that:         Germany is asking for European and NATO solidarity in       response to the despicable Navalny poisoning. They will get       it, but an honest answer from Putin is unlikely. Time has       come for Germany to halt Nord Stream 2 construction, before       it's too late.    If Senate Democrats mean what they have said for years on Nord Stream  2, then listen to the former Secretary General of NATO; listen to the  Greens in Germany.   But now, bizarrely, after Joe Biden has ignored the Greens, after Joe  Biden has ignored NATO, after Joe Biden has ignored our Central  European allies, all  [[Page S6724]]  of this was done in the hopes of getting goodwill and support from  Angela Merkel.   The Biden White House--the political geniuses that presided over the  surrender and failure in Afghanistan, the greatest foreign policy  catastrophe in a generation--their plan was, let's piss the whole rest  of the world off so that we can make friends with Angela Merkel. By  making friends with Angela Merkel, let's let Putin complete his  pipeline.   Perversely, President Biden and Merkel issued their statement as a  declaration for support of our Eastern European allies.   Boy, with support like that, who needs enemies?   I would like to read a joint statement from our Polish and Ukrainian  allies in response to the laughable statement that Biden and Merkel put  out. Here is what our Polish and Ukrainian allies said:         The decision to build Nord Stream 2 made in 2015 mere       months after Russia's invasion and illegal annexation of       Ukrainian territory, created security, credibility, and       political crisis in Europe.    This crisis is significantly deepened by the resignation from  attempts to stop the launch of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.   By the way, as an aside, that resignation would be Joe Biden's  abandoning of U.S. law sanctioning Russia.   The letter continued:         This decision has created political, military, and energy       threat for Ukraine and Central Europe, while increasing       Russia's potential to destabilize the security situation in       Europe, perpetuating divisions among NATO and European Union       member states.    Let me read that again:         This decision--    Joe Biden's political genius, surrendering to Russia--       has created political, military, and energy threat for       Ukraine and Central Europe--    That sounds bad. It is bad--       while increasing Russia's potential to destabilize the       security situation in Europe, perpetuating divisions among       NATO and European Union member states.    The letter continued:         Ukraine and Poland will work together with their allies and       partners to oppose Nord Stream 2 until solutions are       developed to address the security crisis created by Nord       Stream 2, to provide support to countries aspiring to       membership in Western democratic institutions, and to reduce       threats to peace and energy security.    Mr. President, what do our friends in Ukraine and Poland tell us?   That Joe Biden's decision has created a ``threat to peace and energy  security.''   But even then, Biden-Harris officials insisted that they had worked  out security arrangements; it was all perfectly taken care of. They  would ensure that Russia would never, ever, ever use Nord Stream 2 for  blackmail.   Mr. President, that is their promise. That is Joe Biden's promise.  Fear not, they have it figured out and they have commitments that  Russia will never use Nord Stream 2 for energy blackmail.   How long do you think those commitments lasted?   If you have a stopwatch, I am not sure the stopwatch could measure  increments of time that small because Russia didn't even give a decent  interval, didn't let the ink dry on the Biden White House press release  before they immediately began doing the thing that Biden promised  Russia would never do. Biden White House said: We have an agreement to  make sure Russia never uses it for energy blackmail.   What did Putin say? Excuse me, we are in the middle of energy  blackmail.   So we don't even have to wait a year, 2 years, 5 years. We don't have  to wait a month. We don't have to wait a week. We don't have to wait a  day to know if the Biden promise was true or false that Russia would  never engage in energy blackmail over Nord Stream 2. Why? Because they  are doing it right now, this instant, as we stand here.   Just one week ago, the Kremlin and its gas barons, the oligarchs--the  corrupt mafia oligarchs that run Russia--said that if Europe wants  reliable gas as we approach winter--and, gosh, did we mention it gets  cold in Europe, that having gas to heat your homes and prevent your  grandmother from freezing to death might be a nice thing?   Well, the Kremlin and the gas oligarchs said it is very simple: If  they want to have heat, all they need to do is rush through the  activation of Nord Stream 2.   They said: ``Undoubtedly, the earliest possible commission of Nord  Stream 2 will help balance the natural gas crisis in Europe.''   Undoubtedly.   Russia is literally reducing the supply right now, today, exercising  its blackmail in September.   The Presiding Officer lives in the Northeast United States. September  is a beautiful time of year. The autumn leaves are turning. The breeze  is crisp. You are not right yet shivering to turn on the heat at night.  The same is true in Europe. But fast forward to November, fast forward  to December, to January, to February, when the bitter cold starts  setting in, when having gas or not, and having heat or not, is the  difference between living and dying.   What are the Russian oligarchs saying?   They say, very simply: ``Undoubtedly, the earliest possible  commissioning of Nord Stream 2 will help balance the natural gas crisis  in Europe.''   And, of course, the response from Biden and from Germany has been  crickets. Remember, Biden and Merkel said, if they try that--those  dastardly Russians--we will stand up boldly to them, we will hold them  to account.   Where is Joe Biden? No, I mean that seriously. Where is Joe Biden?   Nowhere. Maybe in the White House basement. I don't know. But he is  not doing anything to stand up to the Russian energy blackmail  happening right now. By the way, neither is Merkel. Their promises just  weeks ago have already been demonstrated to be completely hollow and  empty. The protections of their bogus deal were, on their face, a  bluff; were, on their face, empty.   But how often is it in politics that such an empty promise gets  revealed as a lie minutes after it is made?   In this case, Putin was only too happy to oblige. That is why we call  the pipeline the Biden-Putin pipeline.   But, of course, the punch line of all of this--so the Biden  administration has managed to tick off Europe, to tick off the European  Union. They managed to tick off Ukraine. They managed to tick off  Poland. They managed to tick off the Eastern Europeans. They have also  independently managed to tick off the French so much that they pulled  their Ambassador home from the United States.   But they did all of this, they said, in the deep gravelly tones of  the Foggy Bottom establishment. They did all of this to build lasting  relationships with Angela Merkel. And that would pay dividends. Never  mind a generation of billions for Putin and Russia; never mind a  generation of energy captivity for Europe; never mind thousands of  high-paying jobs in America--union jobs, good union jobs--destroyed by  Biden; never mind that. The benefit of making Angela Merkel is worth  it.   Mr. President, you know, there is an old saying that God has a sense  of humor. That was illustrated this weekend because, this weekend,  there was an election in Germany. The people went to vote.   And what happened?   The German voters went to vote, and Merkel's party didn't win the  election. Now the Social Democrats will be looking to form a coalition  with the Greens.   Which Greens?   Oh, the very same Greens that are passionately opposed to Nord Stream  2, that cried vociferously to kill the pipeline, and Joe Biden and  Kamala Harris said: Go jump in a lake.   The new coalition.   By the way, just about every electoral scenario that comes out of  this election will empower the Greens in Germany, and the political  geniuses in the White House have just alienated and antagonized the  Greens.   Biden's supine giveaway. Isn't that a good word--supine? It describes  the Biden foreign policy for every enemy of America: Be flat on your  belly, and give our enemies what they want. Biden's supine giveaway to  Putin was all for nothing. It literally produced nothing for the United  States. It alienated our friends, and it emboldened our enemies.   If you are Xi in China and you see Joe Biden rolling over and  surrendering to Vladimir Putin, giving him everything he wants--giving  him a pipeline that will enrich him for generations to come--what do  you think  [[Page S6725]]  Xi is thinking? I can tell you what Xi is thinking. Xi is thinking this  is a President who is weak who will surrender to me too. We saw that  demonstrated just in recent days, where the Biden administration  surrendered on a senior executive from Huawei in allowing her to go  back to China, giving Communist China exactly what it wanted. And, once  again, what does Xi take and what do the Chinese Communist leaders take  from that? That this President will roll over, will surrender.   And, you know, there is a striking irony. These catastrophic  decisions and failures are particularly jaw-dropping given that  President Biden ran on a platform of restoring diplomacy. Do you  remember the refrain ``the adults are back''? It was said with this  moral superiority--that the Biden guys were going to come in, and no  more of this American strength. Huh-uh. The adults know better.   Here is what Joe Biden said on February 4:         I want the world to hear today: America is back. America is       back. Diplomacy is back at the center of our foreign policy.       . . . We will repair our alliances and engage with the world       once again, not to meet yesterday's challenges but today's       and tomorrow's.    Biden spoke specifically about Russia. He said:         American leadership must meet this new moment of advancing       authoritarianism, including . . . the determination of Russia       to damage and disrupt our democracy.    Biden added that ``we must start with diplomacy rooted in America's  most cherished democratic values: defending freedom [and] championing  opportunity.''   You know, if irony had ever been alive, that speech killed irony. If  irony were dead and buried, that speech made irony roll over in her  grave. Literally every word of that speech, every syllable of every  word down to ``and'' and ``the,'' has been proven false.   ``America is back,'' Biden told us. ``Diplomacy is back.'' ``We will  repair our alliances.'' Mr. President, how has that gone? Have we, in  fact, repaired our alliances? With Nord Stream 2, Biden has pissed off  the French, the Polish, the Ukrainians, the European Union. Has Biden  repaired our alliances?   Has Biden engaged with the world once again? Well, if ``engaged with  the world'' means to surrender to Putin and give him everything he  wants, then I guess so.   To meet not yesterday's challenges but today's and tomorrow's--how is  giving Putin a massive natural gas pipeline meeting tomorrow's  challenges unless the challenges are how to fund Russia's military? If  those are the challenges he is talking about, then congratulations, Joe  Biden; you actually lived up to that.   He spoke about Russia. ``American leadership must meet this new  moment of advancing authoritarianism.'' How did Joe Biden and Kamala  Harris meet this new moment of advancing authoritarianism? By funding  it. Every year, Putin will cash a check of a couple billion dollars,  courtesy of Joseph Biden. What should we use this couple of billion  dollars for? How about for advancing authoritarianism.   Biden said:        We must start with diplomacy rooted in America's most       cherished democratic values: defending freedom.    Mr. President, let me ask you something. Whose freedom did Joe Biden  defend with this pipeline? He certainly didn't defend the freedom of  the Ukrainians. He didn't defend the freedom of the Poles. He didn't  defend the freedom of Europe. He didn't defend the freedom of France.  He didn't defend even the freedom of Germany. Merkel wants this, but  the voters in Germany have made clear that they don't want it. He  didn't defend the freedom of the men and women of Georgia, of the  Baltics--of all the former Soviet Republics whose safety and security  is now jeopardized because Biden has decided to be a principal funder  of the Russian military. That is not defending freedom.   He certainly didn't defend America's freedom. On his first day in  office, Joe Biden shut down the Keystone Pipeline. He killed 11,000  jobs, including 8,000 union jobs. John Kerry helpfully told those union  members: Learn to code. You silly, dirty worker who wants to work on a  pipeline, no, no, no. Sit down at a MacBook instead.   How is it that the same President who kills American jobs on an  American pipeline creates Russian jobs on a Russian pipeline? I don't  know what you call that, but you don't call it defending freedom. You  don't call it championing opportunity.   You know, I have to say, some years ago, I traveled to Europe. I was  in Ukraine. I was in Poland. I was in Estonia. When I was there, I met  with the leaders there, and I asked them about Russian aggression. This  was years ago. I asked them about standing up to Russian aggression. To  a person, when I asked them that, the blood drained out of their face,  because, for the Poles, for the Ukrainians, for the Estonians, Russian  tanks in the streets is not a hypothetical. That is not a scenario they  are wondering what that would be like. Those of us old enough to  remember it, as they sat at the table with me, they remembered. They  remembered those Russian tanks.   Vladimir Putin has said, in perhaps the most candid moment of his  life, that he considers the greatest geopolitical disaster of the 20th  century to be the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The natural  corollary of that is that his foreign policy objective is to recreate  the Soviet Union and to subjugate the former Soviet Republics.   One of the most dangerous consequences of this pipeline, of the  Biden-Putin pipeline, is that if this pipeline is allowed to go online,  I fear we will see Russian tanks again on the ground in Ukraine.   Mr. President, you and I both serve on the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee. If and when that happens--in 6 months, in a year, in 2  years--I am going to ask you to remember these remarks, if and when we  see Russian tanks on the streets in Ukraine, because Putin is no longer  afraid that Ukraine is needed to transit energy. Putin now has his own  pipeline--the Biden-Putin pipeline--to circumvent Ukraine.   If we see that subjugation of our ally, if we see that subjugation of  liberty, Mr. President, I hope you and I hope every Member of this body  and I hope the American people remember right now that Joe Biden, in  February, said: ``We must start with diplomacy rooted in America's most  cherished democratic values: defending freedom [and] championing  opportunity.'' He has an opportunity to do so.   By the way, let me point out something. The Biden administration has  a fantastic opportunity for a reset. Let's assume somebody in the  administration realizes they screwed up on this pipeline. When they are  losing votes in the European Parliament by a vote of 500 to 50, that  ought to be a signal, particularly for people who pride themselves on  their foreign policy prowess, on the adults being back. Losing a 10-to- 1 vote in the European Parliament is not indicative of diplomacy being  back.   By the way, when they lose the vote in this body--in both the House  and Senate--when we have addressed Nord Stream 2, every time we have  done it, it has been virtually unanimous. The margins of the U.S.  Congress have been bigger than 500 to 50.   So let's say somebody in the Biden White House is having second  thoughts. I don't know if they are. Maybe they are so committed to  their policy that facts be damned; no second thoughts on that. But  let's say someone is. Then Joe Biden has been given a gift. He has been  given a gift of the recent German election.   There has been only one argument that the Biden White House has put  forward for surrendering to Putin on this pipeline, and that is to make  the German Government happy. It is a bad argument. It is an argument  the Presiding Officer has rejected, that I have rejected. Virtually  every Senator in this body, Democrat and Republican, has rejected it as  a bad argument that hurts America, that hurts Europe, that helps Putin.   But, for sake of argument, let's give the Biden White House the  benefit of the doubt. Let's assume they really believe that. Well, this  weekend gave him a gift. If the lone benefit they achieved was this  will make the German Government happy, what do we know now? This makes  the German Government unhappy.    As we stand here today, the ledger of cost and benefits is very  simple: There is one winner on the Biden-Putin pipeline, and that is  Vladimir Putin; that  [[Page S6726]]  is Russia; that is the Russian Army. Everybody else is a loser. So I  would say to the Biden White House they have an easy gift: Reverse  course.   By the way, the Biden State Department, Secretary Blinken, fought to  impose these sanctions, and political operatives in the Biden White  House overruled the Secretary of State.   Secretary Blinken, you have a fabulous opportunity.   The Secretary of State is unhappy that I have holds on nominees to  the Department of State. The Presiding Officer is unhappy as he sends  repeated tweets, expressing his dismay that I am using the leverage of  a Senator to try to stop this pipeline.   Well, I have good news: The German electorate has given you an answer  to this problem.   The Biden White House has an easy excuse. The German Government is  changing. So their only benefit--to make the German Government happy-- has disappeared. If all they care about is making the German Government  happy--if they don't care about the rest of Europe; if they don't care  about Ukraine; if they don't care about the European Union; if they  don't care about American jobs; if they don't care about Putin getting  richer and stronger--if the only criterion is to make the German  Government happy, do you know what they should do today? Sanction Nord  Stream 2 AG. Follow the law. If they do that, I will lift the holds,  and these nominations can proceed very, very quickly.   The German voters have given Joe Biden a gift. The only question is  if anyone in the White House is paying attention, if anyone wants to  accept the gift, or are they too stubborn? They have picked their  course, dammit, and they are going to go down with the ship even if it  hurts America forever.   There is still time to stop this pipeline. The question is, Does  anyone in the White House care? I hope and pray that they do because if  Joe Biden and Kamala Harris persist in their decision to completely and  totally surrender to Vladimir Putin, that will harm the United States  not for a year, not for 10 years, but for 30, 40, 50 years going  forward.   Mr. President, the German voters have given you a gift. You should  take it.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I have spoken throughout these last several  days about how the Nord Stream 2 pipeline--the Biden-Putin pipeline-- runs counter to everything that the Biden administration professes to  stand for, and, indeed, what much of the Democratic Party has been  insisting for the last half decade are the most important issues of the  country.   We, of course, spent 4 years, during the Trump Presidency, listening  to Democrats say, ``Russia, Russia, Russia,'' over and over and over  again. It was a newfound discovery. Some of us are old enough to  remember Barack Obama turning to Mitt Romney in the 2012 Presidential  election when Mitt Romney was advocating for strength in dealing with  Russia and for taking on Putin, and some of us remember Obama looking  at Mitt Romney and saying:         [Mitt], the 1980s called. They want their foreign policy       back.    That was in 2012, when the Democrats thought it was passe to stand up  to Russia.   Then 2016 happened, and Donald Trump was elected President. Suddenly,  the Democratic Party got religion. Suddenly, Russia was bad. Now, I  thought Russia was bad before. I thought Russia was bad when Trump was  President. And I think Russia is bad now. I don't like dictatorial  thugs like Vladimir Putin, who is a KGB thug.   But, interestingly, for our friends on the Democratic side of the  aisle, their outrage against Russia is situational. It applies only in  the situation that a Republican is in the White House. When a Democrat  is in the White House--when Joe Biden is there--suddenly, Putin is  hunky-dory. Suddenly, Democrats don't have much of a problem with Joe  Biden defying Federal law, ignoring Federal law, and giving a  multibillion-dollar gift to Putin.   Suddenly, the Democrats have given all of these speeches on Russia,  who passed CAATSA. I talked earlier about CAATSA, the legislation that  imposes mandatory sanctions on Russia to stop a President who refuses  to impose those sanctions. Well, Joe Biden is in defiance of CAATSA. Do  you see a single Democrat standing up, saying: Mr. President, obey  CAATSA? No. They are whining that the deputy assistant under secretary  of whatchamacallit has not been confirmed yesterday, and, clearly, the  world is going to come to an end without a deputy assistant of  whatchamacallit.   If our Democratic colleagues believed their rhetoric of the last 4  years, we would see Democrats stand up with me and say, ``Joe Biden's  multibillion-dollar gift to Putin is a mistake,'' but they are not.   One of the ironies, in addition to the ``Russia, Russia, Russia''  thing--and the truth of the matter--is most of the Democrats never  believed Russia, Russia, Russia. If you go back to the Soviet Union, if  you go back to the Reagan administration, the Democrats had spent  decades as apologists for Soviet Communists, as apologists for Russian  dictators. But for 4 years, I have got to say that our Democratic  colleagues can give a good speech. They sure sounded genuine when they  said, ``Russia, Russia, Russia.'' But if they believed those words,  then they would look at Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, and they would  say, ``Russia, Russia, Russia.''   By the way, they didn't like Donald Trump's rhetoric on Russia, and  by the way, I didn't like a lot of the things President Trump said on  Russia. I wish his rhetoric had been stronger, but it is worth noting  that Trump had the courage to call out Germany for Nord Stream 2. Trump  had the courage to impose sanctions under the bipartisan sanctions  legislation we passed into law. The Cruz-Shaheen legislation passed in  2019, and the second wave of the Cruz-Shaheen bipartisan legislation  passed in 2020. President Trump imposed. What did Joe Biden do? Waived  it. What did Joe Biden do? Ignored the law. What did Joe Biden do? He  gave a multibillion-dollar gift to Putin.   So, if any Democrat meant a word they said about Russia, we have got  to see them standing here. You will note the Democratic side of the  floor is largely empty.   But not only is Joe Biden's rhetoric and the Democrats' rhetoric on  Russia not matched by their action, but we also know that Biden's  actions don't meet the Democrats' rhetoric on climate.
