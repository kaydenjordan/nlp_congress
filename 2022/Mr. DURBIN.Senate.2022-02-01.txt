I want to notify all Senators that they should expect  four rollcall votes beginning at 5 p.m.    Mr. President, there is a photograph that we have all  seen: six battle-weary victorious marines raising the American flag on  Iwo Jima. It is one of the most iconic photos of World War II.   It was taken 77 years ago this month. Among those six brave marines  was a coal miner's son from western Pennsylvania. His name was Sgt  Michael Strank. At 25 years of age, he was the oldest of the six flag  raisers. The men in his rifle squad idolized him. One of them said:  ``He was the kind of Marine you read about, the kind they make movies  about.''   Sergeant Strank used to tell his men: ``Follow me and I'll try to  bring you all home safely to your mothers.''   One week after he raised the American flag atop Mount Suribachi,  Michael Strank was killed in the Battle of Iwo Jima. He was the first  of the six flag raisers to die.   Today, he is buried among America's heroes in Arlington National  Cemetery, but that is not the end of the story.   In 2008, a Marine security guard based at the U.S. Embassy in  Slovakia discovered that Michael Strank was not a natural-born U.S.  citizen; he had received his citizenship through his father when his  father became a U.S. citizen in 1935. So where was this marine's marine  born? He was the first child born into an ethnic Ukrainian family in  what is now Slovakia. Like my own mother, who was born in Lithuania,  Michael Strank came to America with his mother as a toddler, as soon as  his father could save the money for their passage.   Those who were there that day on Iwo Jima will remember that a loud  cheer went up from thousands of marines when they saw, finally, that  red, white, and blue of the U.S. flag flying over the highest peak on  that island. They knew that that day, in the war between freedom and  tyranny, freedom had won.   Today, almost 80 years later, the battle between freedom and tyranny  continues, and one of its new flash points is Ukraine. The Ukrainian  people have made it clear: They want to be free and independent. They  want to chart their own future. They want to choose their own leaders  through elections that they conduct.   This is the future that more than 92 percent of Ukrainians chose in a  referendum in 1991, after Ukraine declared its independence from the  crumbling and corrupt Soviet Union, but Russian President Vladimir  Putin--the old KGB agent--refuses to acknowledge Ukraine's right to  exist, its right to independence, and its right to self-determination.   For almost 100 days, from November 2013 to January 2014, the  Ukrainian people waged a ``Revolution of Dignity'' to force from office  a corrupt, Russian-backed, puppet President--and they won. In  retaliation, Russia invaded and annexed the Crimean Peninsula and parts  of eastern Ukraine and installed a Russian-friendly government. This  forceful occupation of parts of Ukraine by Russia marked the first  time, the first time since World War II ended, that one nation had  redrawn the map of Europe by force.   For the last 8 years, Russia has tried relentlessly to destabilize  the democratically elected Government in Ukraine. This is part of the  reason that President Trump's efforts to withhold congressionally  approved military aid for Ukraine in order to extract political favors  was egregious. Now, Putin has amassed more than 120,000 Russian  soldiers on the borders of Ukraine. Whether Putin is driven by  megalomaniacal delusions of restoring the Soviet Union or is simply  seeking to create chaos and sow dissension among NATO allies is  unclear, but here is what is clear: A Russian invasion of Ukraine would  constitute a grave assault not only on Ukraine, but on the institutions  and agreements that have kept peace in Europe for almost 75 years.   A Russian invasion of Ukraine also could be seen as a danger to our  NATO allies in Poland and in the courageous young Baltic democracies in  Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. It would be a catastrophic mistake on  Putin's part, and President Biden has made that point over and over.   Chicago is home to one of the largest Polish communities outside of  Warsaw, the largest Lithuanian community outside of Vilnius, and one of  the largest Ukrainian communities outside of Kyiv. More than 46,000  Ukrainian Americans live in the Chicago area, the third largest  Ukrainian community in the United States.   A week ago, I attended a celebration at the Cultural Center in  Chicago, on Chicago Avenue in Ukrainian Village. Also speaking at that  gathering was Oksana Markarova, Ukraine's Ambassador to the United  States. I can tell you, the Polish and Lithuanian communities in  Chicago were there standing in solidarity with the people of Ukraine-- and with the people of Poland, Lithuania, and the Baltic to decide  their own futures.   Vladimir Putin and his henchmen should know that the United States,  NATO, and the entire community of democracies also believe that it is  the right exclusively of Ukraine and other young democracies to protect  their territorial boundaries and decide their own fate. The United  States made its position clear yesterday in the U.N. Security Council.  Ukraine, the United States, NATO, and the entire community of  democracies all want a diplomatic solution to Russia's threats on  Ukraine. That is what we seek. If Vladimir Putin wants to avoid a  debacle that will cost his nation dearly in lives and treasure, he will  agree to this solution.   I commend President Biden, Secretary of State Blinken, and their  teams for their strong support of Ukrainian independence and against  Russian aggression. The Biden administration has provided significant  military equipment for our Ukrainian friends to ensure that President  Putin knows the price that a further invasion will cost. The  administration has also bolstered the defense capabilities of our NATO  partners in Poland and the Baltics. And if Putin is counting on  partisan division in the Senate to weaken America's resolve to defend  Ukraine and its neighbors, he is mistaken.   Yesterday, Senator Grassley and I introduced a bipartisan  resolution celebrating 100 years of diplomatic relations between the  United States and the Baltic States and reaffirming our close  relationship with these young democracies. Later this week, Senator  Shaheen and I and several of our colleagues, from both parties, will  meet with the Baltic and Polish Ambassadors to reaffirm U.S. support  for their nations.    I hope that we will also see strong, bipartisan support for  legislation that is being drafted by Senators Menendez and Risch, the  chair and ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  That bill will impose severe, crippling economic sanctions on  [[Page S431]]  Russia for any further invasion of Ukraine. It would bolster similar  bruising sanctions drawn up by the Biden administration. It will ensure  that any Russian aggression against Ukraine or its neighbors will be  felt in Russia by their economy and their people.   I mentioned that my mom came to this country when she was 2 years  old, from Lithuania, in 1911. Her boat landed in Baltimore. At the  time, Lithuania was under the control of Tsarist Russia. It was a  brutal, repressive place.   After World War II, Lithuania became part of the USSR against its  will, another brutal and repressive regime. But in 1991, Lithuania  became the first Soviet Republic to declare its independence. In  response, Soviet tanks under control of Gorbachev rolled in to crush  the new Lithuanian democracy. I was there before those tanks arrived.  Their Parliament is called the Seimas. They had put sandbags around the  outside of it to try to stop the Soviets and their tanks. They took me  in the back, in a small room off to the side, and showed me their  arsenal. It consisted of about 10 rifles that had been borrowed from  farmers in the countryside to try to defend their capital, Vilnius.   Kids were assembled outside, praying the Rosary in the snow, lighting  little candles by the sandbags to show the solidarity of the people of  Lithuania, their determination to survive.   Soviet tanks rolled in, killed 13 innocent people, and injured dozens  more. But then, to the world's astonishment--and mine too--Prime  Minister Mikhail Gorbachev ordered the tanks to withdraw.   Later, another Russian President, Boris Yeltsin, supported Lithuanian  independence. Years after his death, Lithuania honored him with an  award for his commitment to Lithuanian statehood and bilateral  relations between Lithuania and Russia.   Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin understood that you can brutalize  a people who are determined to be free, but you can never defeat them.  Ultimately, freedom will win. It is a tragedy that Russian President  Putin cannot or will not learn that same lesson of history today when  it comes to Ukraine.   Seventy-seven years ago, an American marine born in Ukraine raised  the American flag on Iwo Jima. Today, a generation of young Ukrainians  raised in freedom are holding high the yellow-and-blue flag of their  own nation and saying: We too want to be free. Our message to them is  very simple and straightforward: You are not alone.   Like the shipyard workers in Gdansk and the other members of the  Polish Solidarity movement who helped bring an end to the decrepit and  brutal Soviet Union--like the 2 million Estonians, Latvians, and  Lithuanians who actually physically joined hands to defend freedom  across their nations--history and the free world will stand with you.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Lujan),  is necessarily absent.
