 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say in the strongest  possible terms that this body must do what the majority of the American  people want and pass the Dream Act. The Dream Act is smart policy that  combines American values of compassion and humanity with what is best  for our economy and our society. This bill will protect 1.5 million  undocumented Americans from deportation.   Every day that we fail to act is another day that 800,000 DACAmented  young people live with an unshakable fear that they will lose their  ability to live without fear of deportation, be able to support  themselves and their families, to know that they can plan for the  future, whether that be attending school or buying a home, or a car, or  starting a new business.   Mr. Speaker, make no mistake, this bill will help all Americans  regardless of legal status. Nationally, the cruel end of this program  will cost $460 billion in GDP over the next 10 years; whereas passing  the Dream Act would actually bring $22 billion in income to our country  every year.   Mr. Speaker, this is about more than economics. It is about human  lives, and I urge my colleagues to do what is right. Pass the Dream  Act. Let's help these young people.
