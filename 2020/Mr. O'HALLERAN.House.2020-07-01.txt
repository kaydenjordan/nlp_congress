 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2, the  Moving Forward Act, legislation to repair and rebuild our Nation's  crumbling infrastructure.   I am pleased to see this bill make significant capital investments in  our rural roads, schools, broadband expansion programs, and much more.   I also want to note that outdated infrastructure disproportionately  affects rural and Tribal communities, which too often lack access to  quality electricity, water, and sanitation systems.   To that end, I was pleased to see two bills I have sponsored included  in the package.   First, the Tribal Power Act, which ensures that Tribal communities  get access to affordable energy sources by increasing funding for the  Department of Energy's Indian energy education planning and management  assistance program.   Second is my bill for the planning, construction, and renovation of  water, wastewater, and sanitation facilities across all of Indian  Country.   These much-needed updates to our infrastructure have been on  Congress' back burner for decades, putting the health, safety, and  growth of our communities at risk.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to voting in favor of this important bill  and ask that you also do that.                            ____________________
