 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the  retirement of Arlan D. Melendez, Chairman of the Reno-Sparks Indian  Colony. Arlan Melendez, who has been Chair of the Reno-Sparks Indian  Colony for over 30 years--one of the longest-serving Tribal Chairs in  the country--is no stranger to public service. He has spent his life  devoted to causes bigger than himself. His service to his country, his  State, and his people deserves to be recognized. I have had the honor  and pleasure of working with Chairman Melendez in advancing Tribal  priorities, and his leadership and partnership will be missed.   Born and raised in Northern Nevada, Chairman Melendez began his  career of service in the U.S. Marine Corps during the Vietnam era.  After serving his country, Chairman Melendez took up leadership  positions within his Tribal community. First elected to the Tribal  Council in 1987, Melendez served as treasurer and vice-chairman before  being elected Chairman of the Reno-Sparks Indian Colony in 1991. Under  Chairman Melendez's leadership, the Reno-Sparks Indian Colony has  partnered with the State of Nevada, Washoe County, the cities of Reno  and Sparks, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs to expand the Colony's  total land base to over 2,000 acres. In his over 30 years as Tribal  Chairman, the Reno-Sparks Indian Colony has thrived and proven to be an  economic force in Northern Nevada. Additionally, Chairman Melendez has  served on the Inter-Tribal Council of Nevada, including as president,  helping to support the 28 Tribal communities in Nevada.   Chairman Melendez's work has spread far beyond the Reno-Sparks Indian  Colony and Nevada. In 2005, he was appointed to a 6-year term on the  U.S. Commission on Civil Rights by then-Senate Minority Leader Harry  Reid. There, he worked to further the Commission's mission to champion  the development of national civil rights policy and enhance enforcement  of Federal civil rights laws. Chairman Melendez has also been active in  the National Congress of American Indians--NCAI--an organization  dedicated to serving the broad interests of Tribal governments and  communities across this country. At NCAI, he served as the western  region vice president and chaired the taxation subcommittee. Chairman  Melendez has distinguished himself as a member of the Leadership  Council for the Center for Indian County Development at the Federal  Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, where he contributes to strategies for  building stronger Indian Country economies. Chairman Melendez also  served on the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Tribal  Advisory Committee advocating for better access to healthcare for  Tribal communities and played an important role supporting Indian  Country through the pandemic. Additionally, the Chairman has received  awards for his lifetime of achievements from the Native American  Finance Officers Association and the National Indian Health Service.   As Chairman Melendez retires, it is important that we call attention  to his distinguished career of public service. The communities that he  touched in Nevada and around the country are better for his leadership,  hard work, and dedication.                            ____________________
