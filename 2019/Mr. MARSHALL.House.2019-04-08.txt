 Mr. Speaker, enough. Enough.   I finished my 16th, 17th, and 18th townhall this weekend, and  everywhere I went across Kansas, my people told me, ``Enough of this.''   We have had enough of the Mueller investigation.   We have had enough on the tax return issues.   We have had enough Russia mania.   Mr. Speaker, it is time to move on; we have all had enough.   There are great things that we can move on to:   We can fix healthcare; we can secure our southern borders; we can  overhaul our immigration system; we can come up with a nationwide  infrastructure plan.   Mr. Speaker, this country is doing good. Our economy is strong, wages  are up, unemployment is down, but we can go from good to great if you  take this stranglehold off of this Congress and let us get back to  work.   Mr. Speaker, I am embarrassed by the performance of the Congress this  far.   We came from the most productive Congress, perhaps in history, to  maybe the least productive.   I have only been here a short while, but I have learned that this  little bubble we live in has a very finite amount of oxygen. And right  now, politics is taking up all the oxygen.   Mr. Speaker, it is time to move from politics to policy. We have all  had enough. It is time to move on.                            ____________________
