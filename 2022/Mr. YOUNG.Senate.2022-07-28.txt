 Madam President, I rise today to formally express  my gratitude for the heroic actions of Nicholas Bostic in Lafayette,  IN, on July 11, 2022.   Just after midnight on Monday, July 11, Nicholas Bostic ran into a  burning home and rescued five children inside. Nicholas was driving and  observed a home engulfed in flames. He stopped to make sure the  residents had left the building, and he saw a teenager and three  younger children stuck inside. Nicholas ran into the building to help  the four children exit safely. When he discovered one child was still  missing, Nicholas immediately reentered the home to find the missing  child. By the time he found her, the fire had spread, making it unsafe  to exit through the downstairs door. Nicholas broke the second story  window and jumped out, sheltering the girl from the fall by landing on  his side. Thanks to Nicholas, the child escaped with only minor  injuries, and the other four children were unharmed.   In helping shield the children from injury, Nicholas developed first- degree burns and suffered from smoke inhalation. I pray for Nicholas as  he recuperates from his injuries and wish him a full and swift  recovery. I also want to recognize and thank the first responders who  helped put out the fire and treat Nicholas and the children.   Despite the danger, Nicholas did not hesitate to run into the burning  building--twice--to make sure everyone safely escaped. I share the view  of Lafayette Police Department who noted, ``Nicholas Bostic's heroic  actions saved lives.'' I join the Lafayette community in commending  Nicholas for the selflessness he displayed. Today, I thank Nicholas for  his heroism and am proud to call him a fellow Hoosier.                            ____________________
