 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise to discuss the confirmation  process for Judge Brett Kavanaugh. For the last few weeks, Democrats  have complained endlessly about documents. First, they said there  weren't enough documents. Then, when the Judiciary Committee released a  recordbreaking number of documents, Democrats complained there wasn't  enough time to review them all. They then complained that the documents  were not public. When we made the documents public, the Democrats were  disappointed to find they contained no smoking gun. There has been much  ado about documents, but in the end it is much ado about nothing.   One thing I have heard many of my colleagues say is, because we  reviewed all of Justice Elena Kagan's records from her time in the  executive branch, we must review every last scrap of paper that crossed  Judge Kavanaugh's desk while he was in the executive branch. That just  isn't so.   When Justice Kagan was nominated, the Senate did not ask for, nor did  it receive, all of her records from her time in the Obama  administration. In fact, the Senate never requested, and the Obama  administration never provided, any of Justice Kagan's records from her  time as Solicitor General.  [[Page S5675]]  They certainly didn't ask for every document from the Solicitor  General's Office that contained a mere reference to Justice Kagan ``by  name, initials, or title.''   Producing sensitive internal deliberations and other documents from  the Solicitor General's Office would have been extraordinarily  inappropriate and even damaging to the executive branch, which is  exactly why the Senate did not ask for Justice Kagan's records. This  decision was especially difficult because Justice Kagan had no judicial  records to review.   By contrast, we have over 12 years of Judge Kavanaugh's rulings on  the DC Circuit. These rulings, which my Democratic colleagues are  reluctant to even acknowledge, let alone talk about, are the most  relevant documents for evaluating what type of Justice Judge Kavanaugh  will be.   Judge Kavanaugh's court decisions are highly relevant to  understanding his legal reasoning. The same can't be said of his White  House documents, which more accurately reflect the conveyor belt  process for Presidential decision making.   Those who argue they need every document that even mentions Judge  Kavanaugh are only now realizing the absurdity of this argument. At  this point, Democrats are simply stalling for time. They made no effort  to make their proposals any less unreasonable, and Senator Grassley  rightly rejected them.   By now, Americans are starting to see through the ruse. The real  objective of these ridiculous demands is to delay--delay Judge  Kavanaugh's hearing to delay his inevitable confirmation.   Last week, Senator Grassley announced that the hearing for Judge  Kavanaugh would start on September 4. Immediately, Democrats insisted  that the committee is rushing to hold Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation  hearing, but the hearings for the last three nominees--Justices Sonia  Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Neil Gorsuch--were all held 48 or 49 days  after the President announced their nominations. By comparison, Judge  Kavanaugh's hearing will start 57 days after his nomination was  announced. Apparently, the Judiciary Committee is in such a rush that  it has given Senators an extra week to review the nominee's record. The  left is pushing a false narrative that Republicans are rushing to hold  Judge Kavanaugh's hearing. Progressives are doing this in an attempt to  muddy the waters. They are hoping people will focus on spurious process  arguments rather than diving into Kavanaugh's judicial record, which is  all but unassailable.   Last week, a number of my colleagues tried to make hay out of the  fact that the Judiciary Committee received some documents about Judge  Kavanaugh on a confidential basis. These colleagues said it was a  travesty that they were not being made public, but they knew then that  these documents were being reviewed so important information like  Social Security numbers and other similar personal information could be  redacted and removed. In the meantime, the Senators and their staff  were given access to the documents right away so they could review them  for the upcoming hearing. In any event, the criticism that documents  were being kept confidential was quickly blown apart.   Chairman Grassley recently made public more than 103,000 pages of  materials from Judge Kavanaugh's time in the executive branch, and more  materials are on the way. Most laughable of all, some on the left are  now claiming that because there is no smoking gun in the documents,  surely the production process must be nefarious.   Maybe the huge number of documents is just too boring for Judge  Kavanaugh's opponents to sift through or maybe they have looked through  the documents already and know the American people have nothing to  complain about.   Consider the damning evidence already uncovered in these documents:  Judge Kavanaugh goes to church on Sunday morning. He appreciates pizza  when he is working late. He thought the last play of the Redskins game  was ``a total disgrace.'' If these mendacities aren't grounds for  disqualification, then what is? What more do we have to learn about  Judge Kavanaugh before we can see him for what he truly is: Joseph  Stalin without the moustache or, as one of my colleagues so calmly put  it, a man who will ``pave the path to tyranny.''   If I could tell the American people one thing today, it would be  this: Judge Kavanaugh may seem like the human incarnation of a vanilla  ice cream cone, but he is actually something far more sinister. Judging  by the rhetoric from the left, I am convinced that this minivan-driving  carpool dad is actually the second coming of Genghis Khan. Now, I have  no evidence for this assertion--not right now, anyway, but if Chairman  Grassley will just give us a few more years to read over each and every  one of Judge Kavanaugh's work emails and maybe even every handwritten  note he passed in grade school, I am sure they will find something  because there is no way Democrats are just making this stuff up. I hope  this isn't too much to ask.   Naturally, I am being facetious only to prove a point. We have more  than we need to determine Judge Kavanaugh's fitness for the Supreme  Court. Based on the number of documents alone, this will be the most  thorough vetting of a Supreme Court nominee in our Nation's history. I  have only been here for 42 years, but I can tell you this is the most  thorough vetting of a Supreme Court nominee in our Nation's history.   We should call this hubbub about documents for what it really is--a  naked partisan ploy, a red herring meant to distract the American  people from Judge Kavanaugh's indisputable credentials. Watching this  confirmation unfold is like watching the tortured last moments of a  blowout basketball game. Democrats are down 30 with 10 seconds left,  but they keep fouling to stop the shot clock in an attempt to avoid  their inevitable defeat. Enough already.   It is time Democrats come home from their fishing trip. We could  spend eons angling for scandal in the river of documents the Judiciary  Committee provided us, but nothing will bite because there is nothing  there. Democrats know this by now, and it is time they admit it to the  American people. The longer they wait, the more desperate they look.   To my progressive colleagues--and I have to laugh at the word  ``progressive.'' They are anything but progressive; they are  regressive, but I will call them progressives today. To my progressive  colleagues, I will say this: Let's not waste any more time. By now, it  is evident to even the most committed partisans that Judge Kavanaugh is  supremely qualified for the Supreme Court. So stop playing politics and  join us in supporting his confirmation.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, I would like to thank  those who have worked with me on the important issue of mental health  and suicide prevention. This week, President Trump signed into law my  National Suicide Hotline Improvement Act, a bill that stands to save  thousands of lives.   This legislation becoming law is the high point of an effort that  began in December 2016, when I held a roundtable discussion at East  High School in Salt Lake about the growing issue of teen suicide. A  theme from that roundtable, and many other subsequent conversations,  was the need for greater access to help--simply finding someone to talk  to.   Too many Americans who are struggling with mental illness or see  their friends or family members suffering do not know where to turn for  help. By making resources like the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline  system more accessible and user-friendly, we can truly save thousands  of lives.   I thank all of those who helped get this bill across the finish line,  including Utah State Senator Daniel Thatcher and Representative Steve  Eliason, and of course Congressman Chris Stewart, who introduced the  bill in the House. Most important, though, were the voices of so many  Utahns who have felt the tragic effects of the suicide epidemic. I am  heartbroken by their loss, but hopeful this law and their continued  advocacy will turn the tide in the campaign against this epidemic. This  is important, and I hope we will all get behind this and do what is  right.  [[Page S5676]]
