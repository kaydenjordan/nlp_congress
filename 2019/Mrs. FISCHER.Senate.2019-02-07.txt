 I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today to announce the  reintroduction of the bipartisan, bicameral Building Up Independent  Lives and Dreams Act, more commonly known as the BUILD Act.   After the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010, the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau was tasked with creating a single set of  integrated disclosure forms for mortgage loans. This set of forms,  created by the TRID rule, was designed to provide a more consumer- friendly approach to traditional mortgage lenders. Its aim was to  streamline disclosure requirements in the Truth in Lending Act and the  Real Estate Settlements Procedures Act into a single set of forms.   The measure works for most traditional mortgage lenders; however, it  buried not-for-profit, charitable organizations in mountains of  paperwork. The weight of the nearly 2,000-page TRID rule is not only  burdensome but confusing--especially for small lenders and housing  charities that do not have the funding to hire financial experts.   The forms present a variety of unnecessary obstacles, including the  requirement for expensive software with a cost calculator. These costly  and complex forms are expected of large banks and institutions, and  they can better afford to hire experts who are well versed on the TRID  rule, but smaller community-based organizations, like Habitat for  Humanity, they simply cannot. The overwhelming majority of the more  than 1,200 Habitat for Humanity organizations across our country are  faced with limited resources.    Historically, Habitat for Humanity has built homes for struggling  families and provided a low- or no-interest loan. The loan amounts are  typically lower due to the free labor of thousands of volunteers in  Habitat projects around the world. These loans give Habitat homeowners  a chance to establish themselves as creditworthy and a fresh start for  their future.   There are currently 15 Habitat for Humanity affiliates in Nebraska.  The chapters in Omaha, Lincoln, Fremont, Grand Island, and Columbus, as  well as the Sarpy County and Scotts Bluff County chapters have voiced  their full support for the BUILD Act. I thank them for that.   These organizations are a constant source of hope for our communities  across the State, and they make significant contributions to provide a  hand up for struggling families. The executive director of Habitat's  Lincoln chapter recently sent my office the story of a local couple who  became a Habitat homeowner.   Abdelkarim and Sailwa worked hard to provide for their five sons.  With help from Habitat for Humanity, the couple was approved for a 30- year, zero-interest mortgage on their new home. Payments are capped at  30 percent of their combined monthly income. Now Sailwa can work part  time, and Abdelkarim pursues his degree from Southeast Community  College. He is helping to secure his family's future. Their children  are comfortable in their neighborhood, where they have made new friends  and attend a local school.   The executive director of the Lincoln chapter continued, saying:  ``With the ability to focus on our mission, instead of burdensome  regulatory requirements and expenses, we can help more families build  strength, stability, and self-reliance through homeownership.   The BUILD Act will do exactly that. This bill will allow nonprofits  to use the simpler Truth in Lending, good-faith estimate and HUD-1  forms, instead of that overbearing, nearly 2,000-page TRID rule. These  forms were previously used for years.   Habitat for Humanity's volunteers with financial expertise were once  able to sit down with the borrower and review each section of the forms  together. This gave the volunteer an opportunity to teach the new  homeowner about personal finance and the critical steps he or she could  take to grow as a financially responsible citizen. With the passage of  the BUILD Act, volunteers will be able to provide this prudent advice  once again.   My office has also been informed that some Habitat chapters lack the  staffing capacity to comply with the TRID rule. What is more, these  chapters do not possess the adequate funding needed to purchase the  required software.   In Habitat for Humanity chapters in Lincoln, Grand Island, and  Fremont, they are going to benefit from the passage of the BUILD Act,  and I think all of us in this body can agree that charitable  organizations like Habitat for Humanity are a constant source of hope  for families in need. They should not be hurt because of a preventable  oversight.   By working together and finding commonsense solutions, we can fix  this. The BUILD Act gained momentum last year and passed the House  unanimously, but we can push this legislation over the finish line  during the 116th Congress.   I thank the junior Senator from Maryland for partnering with me and  helping to reintroduce this bipartisan legislation. I thank our lead  sponsors in the House who spearheaded this effort last Congress.   The BUILD Act would provide that commonsense reform to ensure all  housing charities are able to provide much needed stability to  communities without being harmed by overly burdensome regulations.   The President highlighted a variety of different ways we can work  together during his State of the Union speech this week, and I believe  the passage of a bipartisan, bicameral BUILD Act would be an  encouraging start.                                  ______                                         By Mr. BARRASSO (for himself, Mr. Bennet, Mr. Jones, Ms. Baldwin,          Mr. Boozman, Mrs. Capito, Ms. Collins, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Cramer,          Mr. Enzi, Mrs. Fischer, Mr. Gardner, Ms. Hassan, Mr. Hoeven,          Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Johnson, Mr. King, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Manchin,          Mr. Peters, Ms. Smith, Mr. Thune, Mr. Udall, Mr. Wicker, and          Mr. Wyden):   S. 382.
