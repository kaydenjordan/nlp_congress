 Madam Speaker, I thank my dear friend, the chair of the  Committee on Appropriations.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment to block funding the  DeVos title IX rule.   Just imagine: You have endured the horror of campus sexual assault,  and now you are asked to relive your trauma with live hearings and  direct cross-  [[Page H4061]]  examination. You are told where you must be assaulted and how much you  must suffer before you can avail yourself of your civil rights. God  forbid you are assaulted while studying abroad or an off-campus frat  party--title IX may be closed off to you. Or you are among the one in  three survivors who drop out of college, so now your school is  forbidden from investigating the complaint.   It is cruel. It is inhumane. It undermines student safety and equal  access to education.   Madam Speaker, title IX should prevent sex discrimination, not enable  it. That is why I appreciate this amendment being taken up.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair of the Appropriations  Committee whom I deeply adore.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment which highlights the  Defense Department's abject failure to maintain its child development  centers and its barracks and the need for a $15 billion investment.   Our associates in the department and the generals all talk about how  important it is to take care of the whole servicemember. I always say  that when a servicemember serves, so does his or her family.   Now, we know by their own admission that there are 135 childcare  centers that are in either poor or failing condition, and we have more  than 9,000 families with children on waiting lists in the military.   But having all that knowledge, Mr. Speaker, you would think that they  would elevate this issue. But only one childcare center has been  considered in their budget request. There are 135 that are poor or  failing, and they chose to only fund one.   While the Army announced with great fanfare some time ago a $10  billion, 10-year project to replace substandard barracks, that would  require $1 billion a year in which they would invest in barracks, but  they have only committed and requested $262 million--they are clearly,  not on track to complete this $10 billion project over 10 years.                                time  1915    I thank the Appropriations Committee for adding $300 million for  barracks and child care centers over the Department's request, but this  does not excuse the military from its responsible. Talk is cheap.  Action is what we want to see.   Mr. Speaker, I call on the Department to do a better job in the next  year's budget. I urge my colleagues to  [[Page H4079]]  include $15 billion for these quality of life matters for our military  families in the forthcoming reconciliation package.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from  California, the chair, for the opportunity to speak on behalf of this  amendment.   This would increase the funding for the San Francisco Bay restoration  from $25 million to $30 million, a small sum in the scheme of things  but huge in terms of its impact.   Over the last 200 years, 90 percent of the San Francisco Bay wetlands  have disappeared. If we don't act now, the damage will be irreversible  by 2030.   The San Francisco Bay estuary is the largest estuary west of the  Mississippi, yet it has been shortchanged in terms of resources.  Between 2008 and 2016, the Environmental Protection Agency invested  only $45 million in the San Francisco Bay. Conversely, Puget Sound  received $260 million and Chesapeake Bay $490 million. As you can see,  it has been shortchanged.   The funding wouldn't just benefit San Francisco. The bay supports 4  million jobs, supplying drinking water for 25 million people, and  provides irrigation for about one-half of the Nation's fruit and  vegetable production.   It is critical to all of us. We must invest now to save this  ecological treasure.
