 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend President Trump for  withdrawing the U.S. from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal.   Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons--and ballistic missiles capable of  delivering them--is a serious threat to its neighbors in the Middle  East, as well as eventually the U.S. But the 2015 Iran nuclear deal,  hatched by John Kerry and the Obama administration, does little to curb  that pursuit.   The fact is, there aren't nearly strong enough measures in place to  actually hold Iran accountable for compliance with the deal. It is too  bad the Obama administration has already traded billions of U.S. and  foreign dollars in exchange for promises Iran clearly has no intention  of keeping. We can't get those dollars back either.   Of course, now Iran isn't even using this money for its economy, as  reported. Much of it is being funneled directly to active terrorist  organizations around the Middle East.   This deal was a danger from the start, and it lets Iran off the hook.  We must do better. We must negotiate better than has been done.                            ____________________
