 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, it is unfortunate that Congress cannot have a serious  conversation about immigration because we do actually have a real  problem. We have a real crisis at the border. It is a humanitarian  crisis, the Wild West. We are a country of laws.   We have a problem with illegal immigration. It needs to be  streamlined to better serve our national interests. We have problems  with visa processes, and we can do better.   But, unfortunately, we are passing a lot of bills that probably will  not see the light of day in the Senate, that are not going to become  legislation. We do grandstanding drama and constant rhetoric, and it is  very unfortunate for me because the American people are tired of our  institution not doing its work, because we are policymakers and we are  legislators and we have to work on policy, not on political drama.   So as a member of the Subcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship, I  encourage my colleagues to actually start working in committees on  legislation, not sending legislation from the Speaker's office to the  floor, but actually have reforms and work at it because our people  deserve it and our people deserve to have a branch that works for the  people, not having the executive and judicial branches doing our  functions.   So I hope we will have some very constructive and serious  conversation on immigration, and I would be happy to help with it, but  these piecemeal approaches are not going to work and are not good for  our country.
