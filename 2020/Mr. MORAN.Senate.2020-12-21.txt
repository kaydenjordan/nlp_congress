 Mr. President, I rise out of respect and in memory of Gove  County Sheriff Allan Weber, who served his community faithfully over  the last two decades.   Allan was born and raised on his family's farm near Park, KS, and he  went on to marry Connie, his high school sweetheart. The couple has  three children--Andrea, Brandon, and Cory. To those who know Allan, it  was always clear that his family meant everything to him. His many  grandchildren were his pride and joy.   In 1996, he ran for Gove County sheriff and served his community  faithfully for over two decades since first elected. Gove County is out  in Western Kansas. It is flat. It is the prairie. It is windy. It is  hot in the summer and cold in the winter. It is farmers and ranchers.  It is often a struggle to earn a living in Gove County. I know the  county well. Despite those challenges, it is made up of people who work  hard, care for each other, and try to make good lives for themselves  and their families.   In rural areas like Gove County, the sheriff oftentimes wears  multiple hats, and Sheriff Weber was no different. In addition to  serving as sheriff, he was also the public information officer and the  emergency operations center community liaison.   Kansans also never fail to step up to help their neighbors in hard  times, and Allan did the same. After the tragic death of a neighboring  county's sheriff, he stepped up to serve as the interim sheriff in  Sheridan County, making him the first person ever to serve two counties  as sheriff at the same time--a first in Kansas's history. He saw his  brothers and sisters in blue as an extended part of his family, and he  held them in the highest regard.   His colleague in law enforcement, Sheriff Tim Morse of Jackson  County, which is on the other side of the State, wrote this:         Kansas has lost a great sheriff. Gove County Sheriff Allan       Weber has spent the last couple of months fighting COVID-19       in a Denver hospital. Today, Sheriff Weber was escorted back       to Gove County by Colorado and Kansas Highway Patrols along       with countless Kansas Sheriffs and law enforcement officers       for one last time . . . Sheriff Weber was an honorable man       who was respected by all. He will be greatly missed.    He respected those in blue, and those in blue respected him.   He was a dedicated public servant both in his home community and at  the State level. He served the Kansas Sheriffs' Association on its  board and as its president. I talked to the Kansas Sheriffs'  Association today, and they wanted me to recognize Sheriff Weber's  professionalism and his dedication and that he served as president of  the Association for two consecutive terms, which is a rare circumstance  and speaks to his effectiveness in the role and the admiration that his  colleagues held for him.   His community also loved and respected him. They came together to  welcome him home one last time with an honor parade down Highway 212,  in Quinter, this past Saturday night, with hundreds of cars and people  lined up to recognize his service and sacrifice over a lifetime.   Connie, his wife, said:         It was such a beautiful homecoming. I know he was bursting       with pride and love. After the November election, when he       woke up in the intensive care unit, I told him he was sheriff       for the next 4 years, and he gave me a small smile and nodded       his head. He loved the Gove County community's mind and was       always ready to give the ultimate sacrifice if he had to.       There were times that his heart broke doing his job, but he       did what was right. He lived life day-to-day and enjoyed it       and everyone. He worked hard and loved gently. He will be       missed by many.    The outpouring of love, support, and shared memories on their Quinter  Community Facebook page has been constant and speaks to the  interconnectedness of a small community.   I should tell you that the population of Gove County is about 2,612,  and the county seat of Gove has a population of 70. It is in places  like Quinter, like Gove, and like Gove County where the sheriff is  known by everyone, and the sheriff is interwoven into the life of the  community and the county.   So many of his friends and family have remarked on Allan's contagious  smile, how ornery he was, but, most importantly, as to the selfless way  he served people. Those of us in public service ought to look to Allan  as a role model in that selfless service of others. Sheriff Allan Weber  embodied so many values in Kansas--faith, family, fellowship, service,  and good old-fashioned hard work. He will be missed by many.   Robba and I extend our deepest sympathies to his family--both his  loved ones, which includes one of my staff members, Chelsey Ladd, his  cousin, and his brothers and sisters in blue.   May God bless Allan Weber. May we praise him for the life he lived,  and may we look to him as a role model to try to do what he has done.   I offer my condolences and respect, on behalf of the U.S. Senate, to  the family of Sheriff Allan Weber.   I yield the floor.
