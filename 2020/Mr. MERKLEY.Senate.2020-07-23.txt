 Mr. President, I ask for the opportunity to address the  issue before us.    Mr. President, across America, crowds have been  assembling, saying: This is a moment in which we must not only have a  national conversation about public safety and racism, but we need  action. We need to change the scenario that exists in so many places  where public safety departments have seen one group of citizens in a  community as their clients and another group of citizens as the threat,  which leads to systemic racism, differences in approach depending on  the color of the skin of the person that you are dealing with. It may  be as simple as saying: Let's stop that person. They have dark skin,  and they are driving through this neighborhood, and maybe they don't  belong here. Let's stop that person because they have dark skin, and  maybe they are dealing drugs.    That is systemic racism and profiling.   This is a discussion about what value we should aim for here in  America. That value is that every member of the community is a client;  that there is the goal of providing equal public safety services to all  and treating each and every person the same regardless of the color of  their skin; and to have each public safety officer say ``How would I  respond differently if I saw three young teenagers running toward a  house and they were Black rather than White?'' and taking that into  account and saying ``Would it change that? Would I respond the same?''   They are all our clients. We are here to serve everyone. That is the  national discussion. People come into the streets and protest.   This is a group of African-American, Black American protesters in  Oregon. One of them is wearing a T-shirt saying ``We March, we sit  down, we speak up, we die.''   When I read that, I was thinking about the experience I had a number  of years ago when a Black American was working with me rebuilding a  house, helping me out for a few weeks. We went out into suburban  Maryland. This was back in the 1980s. We were trying to find a  particular part or piece of equipment. We didn't know where that  speciality store was. We pulled up next to a sheriff. The sheriff's car  had two White sheriffs in it and a shotgun propped up between the  seats.   I said to my friend: Hey, roll down your window and ask those  sheriffs where this place is.   He started to roll down the window. He looked over and saw the two  White sheriffs with the gun between them, and he never said a word. He  just turned back. He looked straight ahead, and he looked terrified.   I saw those sheriffs as people who work for me--who should work for  everyone--and we could ask them for their help. He saw them as people  who--if he started a dialogue with them, he might end up in deep  trouble, in physical harm. That is what this conversation is about.  That is what we are seeking to change in America.   This idea of protesting for change is as American as apple pie. This  is as American as the American Revolution, people standing up and  saying: This is not right. Freedom of speech and freedom of assembly  are core values of what it means to be a ``we the people'' republic.   These protesters--often African American, often of many races--have  been coming together. There have been some folks--often younger folks-- who have come to cause a bit of trouble that goes beyond simple  protesting.   We had a challenge in Portland of White extremists--often dressing in  camouflage, antifa members who are looking for a fight--conflicting,  often late at night. Portland has worked very hard to deescalate that  situation--to deescalate it, to empower the message that the protesters  are bringing about restructuring systemic racism, ending systemic  racism. These acts, these conflicts, take away from that message.   As they worked so hard to deescalate, along came President Trump.  Trump had a different objective: He wanted to escalate violence on the  [[Page S4436]]  streets of Portland. I can tell you, there is a huge difference between  protesting and making your message known and respecting that and having  a government that respects it. It is our government, our ``we the  people'' government. And this a government--an Executive in the Oval  Office who deploys Federal forces to create chaos and violence and to  attack peaceful protesters.   I have come to the floor twice in the last 2 days to go through and  show the camouflaged, battle-ready troops deployed by Trump who are  coming in a secret fashion, eliminating any indication of whom they  work for. Are they Customs and Border Protection? Are they Federal  Protective Service? Are they U.S. Marshals? They have no identity and  have stripped all their unique identifiers, which means they can club a  peaceful protester, they can shoot them in the head, and nobody knows  who did it because there is no ID on their uniform. There is no  accountability and no discipline and outrageous attacks on peaceful  protesters.   I was here speaking yesterday, and I asked for consideration be given  on this floor for my amendment to end secret policing. It is a very  simple amendment that says: You wear identification of your agency. You  wear a unique identifier. You don't go outside your mission of  protecting a Federal building unless you are in partnership with a  Governor or a mayor. It is that simple. So simple.   But my Republican colleague came down and objected to consideration  of this amendment. I think, in essence, he didn't believe the story I  am presenting. He didn't believe the story I am telling you about  peaceful protesters being attacked. Maybe because it is so outside the  conception of what a President would do, the thought is just hard to  acknowledge, that we have a President who embraces this secret police  strategy of assaulting peaceful protesters and grabbing people out of  the crowd and throwing them into unmarked vans. It is hard to imagine.   It is hard to imagine a President of the United States admiring  authoritarian dictators across the planet, but we have a President who  admires the authoritarian dictator-style tactics of Duterte in the  Philippines and who admires the Crown Prince, who assassinated and  dismembered an American-based reporter for the Washington Post. We have  a President who admires Putin, who crushes the civil rights of his  people. We have a President who admires the strong-arm tactics Erdogan  is employing in Turkey. That is what we have. Until now, he didn't  bring the secret police to the streets of America; now he has.   I am going to try a different way of conveying what is going on and  do it in the voices of women who were there at the protests 2 nights  ago to try to convey what is happening on the streets of Portland and  how terribly, terribly wrong it is.    The message ``All Mothers Were Summoned When He Called Out to His  Mama'' is a reference to George Floyd dying with a policeman's knee on  his neck, cutting off either his air or his carotid artery, blood  supply to his brain or both, killing him. So mamas have responded. They  said: Let's go join the protesters as well. Surely this is not the  case, that they are attacking peaceful protesters.   They formed a group who went down, and they did things like dancing  and chanting and handing out flowers, like this woman here. Isn't she  beautiful? She is coming down, holding a sunflower. Others were holding  mums.   It is unimaginable that a President of the United States would send  Federal troops to attack women like this, holding peaceful flowers and  dancing and singing in the streets. But they were scared because they  knew that peaceful protesters had been attacked previously, so some of  them wore goggles, and some of them wore bike helmets.   But let's hear from the women in their own words. Two of these women  work on my team. I didn't know they were going to go down. I didn't  know until last night that they had gone down the previous night, that  they had been there. They had experiences, and they chose to share  their experiences. I have maybe another five or six things that women  wrote up about their experiences and posted them. I will try to share  those, reading it in their voice.   The first one is from Stacey Jochimsen:         I joined the Wall of Moms in Portland on Tuesday night to       support black and brown Americans and voice my concerns about       police violence in our city. I showed up in cut off shorts       and a yellow shirt--the identifier for the Portland Wall of       Moms--I was wearing sneakers and carrying yellow mums and       sunflowers that other moms had gifted me on my way in.        We participated in hours of dancing, chanting, and singing.       It was a beautiful protest on a warm Oregon night. I saw no       violence, I felt safe. We were demanding change. We were       standing up for our black and brown brothers and sisters; we       were there to amplify their voices. Was there graffiti? Sure       there was. Graffiti is not violence.        At around 11 p.m., the Wall of Moms was called to the front       of the federal courthouse. We went. We stood--arms linked--      facing the building, creating a wall of protection between       protesters and the building. We were moms called to use our       privilege to keep others safe, and we tried.        While we stood, arms linked, officers in fatigues and gas       masks (we assume were federal, they were unidentified) rushed       from the building and from behind us. There was no warning.       They took a woman to the ground and hog-tied her on the steps       of the Courthouse. They swiped at cell phones and yelled at       us from behind gas masks. They pointed weapons at us. Us. We       were non-violent, peaceful demonstrators. We were moms in       Converse sneakers holding flowers. I am still trembling at       the sight of their weapons pointed at us. I have never felt       so threatened and unsafe as I did at that moment. I had the       realization that these officers really are not here to       protect, they are here to harm. Were we going to be shot?       Would I be struck in the head by a canister? Am I going to       make it home to my children?        We held our line as they threw flashbangs and shot tear gas       canisters at us. I was peaceful, I was standing still and       holding hands with women around me--surely they would not       shoot at me. I could feel the women on both sides of me       trembling. The officers pointed their weapons at us. I put my       hands in the air and begged them not to hurt us. They shot       more tear gas. The tear gas overwhelmed us--the pain was       unimaginable. It burned my eyes, my throat, my skin. I did       not bring goggles or a helmet to this protest. I wore a tank       top and shorts. Why would I need a helmet and goggles at a       peaceful protest?        I coughed to the point of vomiting. We ran. Fellow       protesters came to us with water bottles and helped clean our       eyes. Another brought wipes to clean our skin. We coughed, we       vomited, and we cried.        Today, I am still shaking. I cannot focus. I am scared. I       am jumping at loud noises. My heart is racing simply       recalling the events of last night. I am worried about what       the federal officers are going to do to my fellow Oregonians       tonight.        Let me be clear: there was violence on Tuesday night, but       none of it was from protesters. The only violence I       encountered that night was from federal police officers.        I am grateful that I made it home to my kids last night.       Others were not so fortunate.    Thank you, Stacey, for sharing your firsthand account of the night  before last--Tuesday night--on the streets of Portland, when Federal  officers attacked peaceful demonstrators, where there was no violence  except the violence of the officers on the protesters.   This next recounting is from Amy Bacher.   She writes:         Pre-protest normalcy. There are people hanging out in a       downtown park by the Justice Center. They are wearing masks,       playing music, and, thanks to Riot Ribs, eating free food.       The Wall of Moms gathers a short distance from there, where       they hand out sunflowers and yellow carnations. Protective       gear is also distributed, like helmets, due to issues with       the Federal police firing ammunition. Medics hand out water       and other safety gear to everyone to try to keep protesters       safe.        Usually, about a few hours into the protests, the secret       police come out. It is unclear who they are now because there       are no markings for what unit--who they are with--and they       fire at the protesters. When it was the Portland Police       Bureau, they were allowed to have their badges covered.        My experience yesterday included the following: About 2,000       people gathered, chanted, gave speeches, and danced in the       blocks in front of the Justice Center and Federal Building in       the name of Black Lives Matter. People were serious about       wearing masks. A small, white plane circled the protest area       repeatedly. It appeared to be the same or similar aircraft of       the plane that circled earlier protests around Revolution       Hall. There were a few protesters trying to block a door of       the Federal Building and post graffiti. One of the chants we       shouted in front of the Federal Building was, ``Tell me what       democracy looks like.'' Then ``this is what democracy looks       like.'' We were all using our voices.        The next moment, though, about 15 to 20 large men in       camouflage and military gear appeared like they were ready       for war. They had no name tags or identifiers. We had no idea       if they were soldiers, what branch they were from, or why       they were there. Almost all of them were holding pepper spray       guns  [[Page S4437]]       and looked like they had customized sidearms. They stood       under the eaves of the Federal Building. The Wall of Moms       were there in yellow T-shirts, stretch pants, and sneakers,       basically. There was a long line--more than a block long--      facing the Federal Building. We were trying to stand in front       of all the other protesters who had already been gassed for       some 50-plus days, thinking that Trump's military would not       fire on moms. We were wrong. There was no ask by officers in       front of us to step back, move, or do anything at all. The       officers started kicking tear gas directly at us, shoving a       nearby mom in the neck, and pepper-spraying another mom in       the face at close range.        I had not been tear-gassed before and can't believe that       it's allowed, especially with such frequency. It produces       violent and immediate bodily reactions and should not be used       on peaceful protesters. There is a near-immediate reaction.       You can't see without pain of blinking. It feels like you are       inhaling fire into your lungs and like your skin is being       burned. My lungs are still burning 24 hours later. These are       weapons of war that should not be used on Portlanders       exercising their constitutional right to freedom or assembly.       If, after 54 days, officers are still using these weapons of       war and it is not working, we should be asking why--why they       are still deemed effective or legal. Just before the first       tear gas was thrown, three to four of the other officers       tackled a woman to the ground and hog-tied her. We didn't see       where she was taken. At least four women were arrested from       that group.    Then she gives a reference to the story on the web and how to find  it. She also notes that Federal agents pepper-sprayed the first aid  tent, which could be a crime when done in war.         Federal agents went by the Riot Ribs free food cart in the       park and pepper-sprayed the food and the grilles.    That is where she ends her commentary.   Thank you very much, Amy, for sharing your story of what happened the  night before last.   I hope that all of America is recognizing that what we would never  conceive of happening in America is happening--Federal agents, Federal  officers, being deployed to attack peaceful protests. As these two  women point out, there was graffiti, but it was not violent.   From one of the other letters I am about to read, I note:         There were young folks pounding on the plywood that covers       the doors of the Federal Building, but that, too, wasn't       violent. The only violence came from the Federal officers.    This next story was posted by Krista.   She writes:         So the nonviolent Wall of Moms just got gassed for       absolutely no reason.    Then she puts in the tags ``PDX protest'' and ``Black Lives Matter.''         I don't need cookies for being there. Please. I have the       privilege of taking the night off to let my lungs rest. Black       and Brown people don't get to change their skin color to take       a break from systemic and personal racism. Also, Black women       have been on the frontlines for decades. The Wall of Moms is       getting a lot of attention, but we are not the story.       Abolishing racist systems and ending police brutality against       people of color is the real story.        If you want to get involved but aren't able to go downtown,       please consider making a donation to ``Don't Shoot       Portland.''        Honestly, the leaf blowers helped so much on Monday. I was       wishing that the dads would come out in force again Tuesday       because the moms got gassed bad. It was brutal. I am still       coughing and burning 4 hours later.        Come on, dads. Until we have meaningful change, the       protests will continue. Don't give up yet.    Krista makes a point that I want to accentuate time and again: Black  Americans have been protesting, putting their lives at risk night after  night after night--all kinds of protesters coming together and all  kinds of skin color coming together in order to say Black lives matter  and that we have to end systemic racism   My colleague is here to speak.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam President, I thank my colleague from Connecticut  for bringing his experience in the legal world to bear on this  extraordinary development of secret police being deployed on the  streets of America.   As we heard from the President, he wants to expand this model. It was  first in DC. Then it was Portland. Now he is talking about Philadelphia  and Baltimore, Chicago and Detroit, Oakland. In other words, all across  America, as the President says, where there happens to be Democratic  mayors, he wants to go create that same mayhem.   Thank you for bringing your expertise to bear on this.   I had just read the story from Krista about the moms and the  protesters all getting, as she put, it ``GASSED BAD.'' She said, ``It  was brutal. . . . coughing and burning 4 hours later.'' Then she closes  with, ``C'mon dads . . . we have [to have] meaningful change. Don't  give up. . . . `'   I was thinking about what I am describing, as I read these stories,  or what these women are describing is the transition from this setting,  where women are dancing; they are holding flowers; they are singing;  they are chanting; they are eating ribs; and what unfolded a few  moments later. And what unfolded?   Two of these stories, so far, have described the sudden appearance of  large men in camouflage, armed with sidearms, who shortly started to  shoot them, gas them, spray them, throw flashbang grenades, tackle  them--in one case, hogtie a woman who was a few feet away.   And you can see how terrifying--these are men dressed for war against  women dancing and holding flowers. This is beyond wrong. This is  inconceivable. These unmarked, no agency, no unique identifier secret  police--what my colleague just referred to like the little green men in  Russia, coming to sweep people off the streets and throw them into  unmarked vans.   These pictures, I understand, are from 2 nights ago, and people were  describing to me how batons were brought down--one on the neck of a  woman--how they were thrown to the ground. This is showing maybe some  of that right there. I can't imagine how terrified this woman was.   Think about this: Within this week where we are recognizing John  Lewis passing away--here is John Lewis on the Edmund Pettus Bridge  being beaten by so-called public safety officers; I think they were  Alabama police, but I am not sure who they were; they have badges; at  least they weren't secret police--and this scene from 2 nights ago in  Portland, these women being assaulted by these men ready for war with  every armament you can think about, including impact projectiles; that  is, rubber bullets and gas and flashbang grenades and batons,  assaulting these women dressed in yellow T-shirts.   I want to stress, as this last letter did, that for weeks and weeks  and weeks before there was a ``wall of moms,'' protesters of every race  were coming down to say we must reform systemic racism in America, and  they, too, were peacefully protesting, and they, too, were standing,  often with arms linked.   The outrage over the Federal troops being deployed with these secret  police tactics has swelled the numbers, including this most recent  protest, but let's not think for a moment there haven't been people of  great courage week after week, many of them organized and led by the  Black population and Black leaders of Portland.   How is it possible--Edmund Pettus Bridge, where a little over a year  ago I was standing with my daughter and John Lewis, remembering what  happened back when, when out-of-control leaders sent well-armed men to  brutally assault peaceful protesters, and now, once again, we have out- of-control men, the President of the United States, sending well-armed  men to brutally beat peaceful protesters. How is this conceivable?   Protesters of all kinds have been working hard to basically say let's  have public safety that works for all. But what is the President doing?  While he is sending these forces to brutally beat peaceful protesters,  he is running campaign ads, and here it is: ``You won't be safe in Joe  Biden's America. Paid for by Donald J. Trump for President.''   He is deliberately assaulting peaceful protesters in order to run  campaign commercials that say he is a strong man who can reduce  violence in America.   Let us all beware how twisted this is, how evil this is, how wrong  this is, how much of an assault on the civil liberties of Americans  this is, and how much we have a responsibility, having taken an oath to  the Constitution, to put an end to it, which is why I am down here for  the third day in a row saying: Let's insist that Federal officers be  identified by whom they represent, the agency. Let's insist Federal  officers have a unique identifier. Let's insist that if their mission  is to protect a Federal building, they are on the perimeter of the  Federal building, not sweeping through the streets of Portland,  throwing people into unmarked vans   That is my amendment. That is the amendment I am asking to be  considered on this floor. Isn't it our responsibility to debate when  egregious things happen in America, like a strongman, authoritarian  President trampling on the Constitution by assaulting peaceful  protestors with Federal forces? Isn't it our responsibility to debate  it and vote on whether secret police are allowed in the United States  of America?   I have been reading these letters from the women who were down there.  I will read one or two more, and then I am going to yield to my  colleague from Oregon.   As the two Senators from Oregon, we have heard from hundreds of  people who have been protesting peacefully over these weeks and how  hard local leaders have worked to deescalate, and how Trump, sending in  these Federal forces to beat protestors--peaceful protestors--has  completely escalated the situation, rather than deescalating it, all so  Donald Trump can run a campaign commercial and try to persuade you he  should be President.   This story recounting is written by Joy, and she was down there with  Krista, so she starts out:         I don't know how my friend, Krista, managed to take a       picture during the madness of this moment. I could not see       anything and was struggling to breathe through the mass of       foamy snot provoked by teargas that filled my mask.    And she had posted a picture that Krista had taken of her right after  she had been gassed. I don't think I have the--do I have the picture? I  might have. Let me see if we can--no. If I find it, I will put it up.         Getting gassed was painful and scary, yet still I felt       secure and cared for by the several helpers that aided us       with water and saline eye washes. Several people checked in       to see if we were ok and help. That is the beautiful part of       this otherwise unpleasant image. This is me on my knees,       being helped by strangers. The ugly part of this moment is       what happened before this . . . the moment when federal       agents blasted us with teargas and rubber bullets despite       ZERO provocation from our line of moms . . . we were simply       standing side by side with linked arms. That's it. For no       apparent reason they shot at a bunch of moms without giving a       single warning. Nope, no warning. No request to move. They       just blasted away at us like they were playing a video game.    I yield to my colleague from Oregon and reserve the balance of my  time.    I thank the Senator for asking for my thoughts on this.   Just before he spoke, I had described the story of Joy, who talked  about the hit that her friend Krista had taken during this chaos after  she had been gassed. I did check, and here is the picture of her. You  can see her whole face is inflamed. There are so many people who can't  see. They are dazed, and their lungs are on fire, and Patrick  Hovakimian is sending best wishes to the people of Oregon.   It reminds me of a cartoon I saw when I was young in which Lucy goes  out after it is observed how cold Snoopy is, out shivering on top of  his doghouse during a snowstorm, and Lucy goes out and says ``Hope you  stay warm,'' and goes back into her house. Yeah--``Best wishes, but I  am not doing a thing to help you out.''   I would love for Mr. Hovakimian to say: I will come and stand there.  I will see what is really going on, and if peaceful protesters are  being attacked, that is simply unacceptable, and as a leader I will  take it to President Trump and tell President Trump that we don't do  secret police in America. We don't sweep people into vans, and if you  really want me to take this position, that is what I am going to change  the policy to because that is what you do in a republic. We are not a  dictatorship.   That is what I would like to hear him say in response to your  question to him.   You asked about martial law. Secret police operating as rogue  operators outside the framework of law, outside of the cooperation of  the Governor or the mayor sound like the equivalent of martial law to  me.    Madam President, I thank my colleague from Oregon for  his intense representation of these legal issues and the role of the  Intelligence Committee, noting that this has all the trappings of a  President bent on the equivalent of martial law, operating in this  rogue fashion, shredding the constitutional rights of people, sending  Federal officers to attack peaceful protesters.   I was reading the stories of women who were down at the protests the  night before last. The next one is from Stephanie.   She says:         I went downtown again last night to peacefully protest. To       use my voice and my 1st Amendment rights. To feel safe--      repeat: TO FEEL SAFE--against these anonymous federal agents.       I wore:        --A bike helmet        --Goggles        --A double mask        --Ear plugs        And I was still terrified. The #WallofMoms stood locked,       arm in arm, right up against the fence line at the federal       courthouse. We stood between these federal agents dressed in       war gear and unarmed protesters shouting behind us. Sweat       poured down my back. The Moms stood for hours. On my bike       ride home I texted [an individual] Geoff [not me] each time I       stopped and called Amy . . . to have a ``buddy'' on the phone       with me. Every time I heard a car, my heart skipped a beat.       Is it a crew of federal kidnappers, ready to throw me into a       van? This administration has been chipping away at our rights       since day 1, but this past week in Portland has been an       acceleration. Wake up, especially those supporting them. We       are in a crisis of great magnitude and we are about to lose       control.    Candace Jimenez, member of the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs,  said she came out to protest after the deployment of Federal agents,  and said:         We have been dealing with that for 500 years. We understand       the trauma, the terrorism, and the harm it causes.    Bev writes:         In less than eight hours, a group of moms helped me put       together this #WallofMoms.        We tried in earnest to give the kids a break by shifting       the pervasive narrative that protesters are rioters.        Case and point, we wore our whitest whites to show we       weren't there to make trouble, we showed up to prove that the       feds are the violent ones. . . . And we were right. Kids took       down fences and did some skateboarding, two or three kids       [banged] on walls, but the other people were peaceful.        I want to tell you that I didn't vomit or pee my pants       after being gassed, but I did. I guess I lost control . . .       and soon after I couldn't open my eyes.        To be clear, we moms weren't armed, [we weren't] throwing       rocks, [we weren't] throwing water. That didn't happen.        We were gassed for chanting ``Leave the kids alone.''        I want you to think about what's happening in this country       and ask yourself how you're going to help change it.    Heather was down at the protests, and I don't have her picture, her  larger picture, but I can tell you that she posted a picture. She is  very pregnant. How gutsy I think that is that she was there, even as  she is about to give birth.  [[Page S4440]]    She writes:         I am . . . 9mo pregnant . . . and I stood between the       police and the rest of the protesters last night with about       40 other moms. My unborn baby is the topic of many Twitter       debates right now and symbolizes a thousand year old debate       among those who want to stifle women's freedom. Right now I       have even more power than usual and I am here to use it.        I am SAFE. Thanks everybody for your concern. But we are       NOT OK.        Until all women can carry a pregnancy to term . . . and       birth without worrying about unnecessary trauma and death we       are not OK.        I show up for all of the pregnant women who have lost their       babies or their lives at the hands of racist and sexist       systems and people. I show up for the women who have had a       hard time getting pregnant because of the everyday stress       caused by racism. I march for all of the Black mothers who       rightfully agonize about their children's safety outside of       their homes. I march for anyone who has been injured       physically or mentally by police brutality, citizen       brutality, systemic inequity, intergenerational trauma and       poverty. I march for the White people finally waking up--see       me and get [me], get out, pay up, and listen! I march for all       of us because this is a problem for ALL of us. When you say       ALL lives matter take into account what you are doing in your       life to improve the world for ALL people. . . . Are you       worried about my unborn child? (please answer these questions       in your hearts.) Get the hell out there and stand up for a       better world for my baby and his generation.    Madam President, I reserve the balance of my time and yield to my  colleague from Oregon.    Madam President.    Madam President, my colleague described how his family  was affected by fascism in Germany and how his family members died for  fascism--attacking them, imprisoning them in concentration camps, and  putting them to death. Don't we all believe that every German citizen  should have stood up to that fascism and said: Not here; not by our  government; not by our people.   That is exactly why we are on the floor right now to say: Secret  police--not here, not by our government, and not allowed in our  Republic. Sweeping people off the street into unmarked vans--not  allowed, not here, not our government, and we will put an end to it.  Gassing, assaulting, and batoning peaceful protesters on the streets of  our city--not here, not allowed, and we will put an end to it.   I yield to my colleague, who I believe wishes to speak.    To my colleague from Illinois, that is exactly right, as  seen in this picture and the testimony of all those who are present.   Mark Morgan, the Customs and Border Protection Commissioner, said  that is not the case, and he said: ``Our personnel are clearly marked  as federal [law enforcement officers] & have unique identifiers.'' They  were not. They are operating, as you say, like little green men, secret  police.    That is the case.    They have.    Well, they have been present in the streets. I don't  know just how many blocks from the Federal building but certainly not  just in the perimeter of the Federal property. They have swept through  streets. They have vans that have gone through the streets. They have  grabbed protesters and thrown them into vans. So they have departed  significantly from, if you will, the mission of defending the Federal  building.    Madam President, I request unanimous consent that our  dialogue be credited to my colleague's 1 hour because I am afraid my  minutes will run out.    You asked about coordination. My understanding is that  there was not an invitation from the mayor to come, and there was not a  conversation with the Governor. There certainly was no conversation  with Senator Wyden and me and the other members of the delegation. The  Portland police have indicated that they have not worked in cooperation  with these Federal forces. They may have been engaged in what they call  deconfliction, and I don't know the full extent of that.    Madam President, I thank my colleague so much for coming  down to stand up for the people of  [[Page S4443]]  his home State and say that ``secret police don't belong in my State,  in my city of Chicago, or anywhere in the United States'' and that we  should act on this floor to make sure that is not the case.   We must work and fight for the citizens all across this country. It  would be the right thing for us to debate my simple amendment that  says: ID, and you stay in the near vicinity of a Federal property, and  you don't engage in these attacks on peaceful protesters.   We should debate it. If people disagree with it, they should stand up  and explain why. Maybe we can come to a common understanding. Do you  know how rare it is for Senators to come down and actually have  dialogue and debate? It just doesn't happen. On something as important  as this, shouldn't every Member be here weighing in and considering it?   How much time do I have left?    I am going to read another story from a woman who was at  the protest 2 nights ago. Her name is Tiffany. She says:         I was there. Let it be known that police fired on peaceful       protesters. The Feds are here. This is really happening in       #portland. . . . knowing the risks, in the middle of a       pandemic, mothers of our city formed a chain to protect the       peaceful protesters. We stood united with flowers, yellow       shirts . . . and peace signs.    I thought I would put up again the picture of this protester with her  flowers.   She continues:         Behind the safety of their fence, the police fired upon a       small number of us with their ``non-lethal'' bullets. As a       symbol, I used my baby's blanket to attempt to shield myself.       They therefore knew exactly what they were doing. They heard       our peaceful calls and fired anyway.        When the fence fell, and the mothers continued to protest       peacefully from the side, the police threw tear gas at us. We       had to [scatter] into the streets, stumbling, trying to keep       our masks on, trying to avoid more gas and cars.        When we attempted to regroup, the Feds had arrived. Some of       us just trying to make our way to our cars, found our way       blocked by federal agents in full combat gear.    Full combat gear.         They too fired gas at unarmed protesters, including myself.       I yelled ``You are in violation of the US Constitution. You       are in violation of the Bill of Rights. I own my home in       Portland, Oregon. I pay my taxes in Portland, Oregon. I have       a right to walk on my own street without being assaulted by       my government. I have a right to be here''. . . . They       silenced us with more gas.        See the images for yourself.        When the government attempts to take your liberty, that is       when it is appropriate to risk your life. Nonetheless, you       will notice we took every precaution to stop the spread.       Every single one of us wore a mask. We had people spraying       hand sanitizer from spray bottles. But you know, once you got       gassed, it is very hard not to spread water droplets. Gas       makes your nose and eyes pour water like a faucet! Not       necessarily nonlethal force when we are in the middle of a       Pandemic.    I reserve the balance of my time, and yield to my colleague from  Connecticut.    Would my colleague from Connecticut yield for a  question?    For clarification, will my question be credited to my  colleague's time, and can I ask unanimous consent that that it be  credited to his time?    Thank you.   You made the point about lack of identification. I have here the  picture of how these have been deployed. I will make sure you can see  it as well.   Many are in camouflage--the generic police, with no sense of what  agency they are part of, no unique identifier, even as the head of  their organization--it was later clarified, and we found out, that they  were CBP, Customs and Border Protection.   He said: Of course, they have unique identifiers and, of course, they  are marked as Federal law enforcement--which they are not. But if one  of these individuals, in the course of attacking protesters, shoots  them with a rubber bullet that fractures their forehead and puts them  in critical condition in the hospital, would we have any idea how to  hold that officer accountable if they have no ID?    Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Connecticut for  his intense effort to defend the civil rights of citizens--not only of  his State but all Americans--and for the truth he speaks that, when you  have anonymous officers in war gear attacking peaceful crowds and  committing, really, disturbing acts of violence against them, it is an  unacceptable thing in our democracy.   He has noted that there was this conversation about the triumph of  democracy as a strategy and it was going to spread and where we were  going to find ourselves by this time was a world ruled by ``we the  people'' governments across the land and how that is not the case.   He mentioned several countries that have been backsliding, and I  think we could add to that those places like Poland and Hungary. I  believe he mentioned Turkey.   It is tempting to be a strongman, and we have heard the President of  the United States convey his admiration for these strongmen across the  planet. But then he starts to bring their secret police, fascist  tactics to the streets of America, and we have an obligation--under our  oaths of office and simply as citizens of this Nation--to stand up and  say no.   I have been reading letters from women who were on the frontline down  in the peaceful protests, clarifying that there was no violence except  the violence of the Federal agents against them.   Here is another such letter:         I am a mom. I am a nurse. I live in Portland. I was       peacefully protesting police brutality and racism tonight       alongside other moms as part of the protests in downtown       Portland. I had my arms linked with my own mom and my close       friend when Federal agents in camo rushed us with guns       pointed. They paused for a split second (as if to consider if       they were really going to enact violence on a group of       unarmed moms) then they pushed people down to my left. We       were [chanting] ``don't hurt our kids.'' They threw flash-      bangs at our feet. They tear gassed the crowd.        I will not be silent. This is not ok. Don't just consume       the line that it is a bunch of anarchists the police and feds       are attacking. That is not ok. Black lives matter.    I have many more letters of people explaining what happened. They all  are basically the same: There were some kids doing some graffiti; there  was some pounding on the door of the Federal courthouse, but there was  no violence. The only violence came from the Feds attacking the  peaceful protesters.   I am going to reserve the balance of my time. I see my colleague is  here from the State of Utah.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I would inquire how much time I have  remaining, please.    Mr. President, I have been using this time to share  stories from women who have been down at the peaceful protests in  Portland and then as they relay that they are attacked even though  there is no violence in the protest. And they are attacked in an  incredibly violent way.   This is not, of course, the story the administration is telling the  world, the President is telling the world. He says: There is violence,  and we stopped it.   The truth is, it was a peaceful protest, and Trump's Federal agents,  dressed in war outfits, assaulted those protesters, as you heard in  letter after letter after letter.   It is almost like acts in a play. You have women holding flowers,  like this sunflower, and some had mums. They are dancing. They are  singing.   Act 2, the camouflaged secret police, Trump's secret police, come  onto the street--no agency identifier, no unique identifier--and then  they start assaulting the women. That is act 3, the assault.   These women are describing that assault in graphic terms. It is tear  gas. It is flashbang grenades. It is pepper spray. It is batons. It is  a woman a few feet away being hogtied. It is a woman a few feet away  being knocked to the ground. That is act 3.   And why is this happening? Because the President likes the  authoritarian, secret-police tactics of dictators around the world and  wants them to  [[Page S4445]]  bring them to the United States of America and is bringing them to the  United States of America.   Maybe the moment he is doing it--right now--is because he is running  campaign ads about what a good person he is to stop violence in  America.   Let's understand that the President of the United States is creating  violence in the streets so he can run campaign ads to say that he will  stop the violence. That is this play.   It feels like a Greek tragedy. It feels like something that would  never happen in America--but it is.   I have been relaying these letters that describe it in so much better  terms than anyone can. This letter is from Karen--or this Facebook post  is from Karen.   She says:         Mixed feelings this morning, waking up eyes still stinging       and a metallic taste in my mouth after ending the night of       nonviolent protest with the #WallofMoms being gassed, shot       at, and manhandled to the ground without provocation. Here's       what happened.        The majority of the night was a calm gathering spent       listening to speakers, chanting, singing, and marching.       Toward 11:30ish, folks gathered on the steps of the Justice       Center. I intentionally positioned at the front line with the       Moms to see for myself the truth.        There were definitely some idiot kids yelling stupid and       unproductive things, but mainly we gathered calmly, sweating       in the heat, holding signs and chanting in solidarity with       BlackLivesMatter. More experienced protesters told the Moms       without gas masks to get a few layers of people back since       they knew to expect CS gas again tonight. The only physical       actions taken before all hell broke loose is that some of the       protesters were banging and kicking loudly on the thick       plywood wall that had been constructed to block the entrance       to the Justice Center.        We waited and then suddenly some kind of bullets . . .       started shooting out of a small hole cut in the plywood, I       felt a few stings like small pebbles or sand, it didn't       really hurt but it scared me. Then some kind of smoky stuff       (tear gas in hindsight) was in the air. I already couldn't       see very well since my swim goggles had fogged up, but I       didn't feel any burning etc. Those without respirators       started leaving when they couldn't see or breathe. Huge       loud noises and explosions (?''flashbangs'') were going       off in front and behind us. Some of us linked arms and       stood together as there were (?where they came from) all       these big officers in black riot gear with batons starting       to push us off the steps of the Justice Center. We tried       to hold our ground but then one Mom a few down the row       from me was grabbed pulled back toward the group of       officers and they started to drag her away. She must have       said something inflammatory, but she was linked arms and       could not have hit them, thrown objects, or resisted       anything. We tried to pull her back to us for her safety       and then suddenly I was grabbed by 3-4 officers who were       shouting to each other to ``pull her down, get her on the       ground'' etc. (indeed they shoved and pulled me to the       ground, grabbing both arms and my backpack to do so).       Someone from the Moms said, ``let's go, they are       surrounding us, we can't do anything now.'' By then the       swim goggles had leaked and my eyes were burning and       tearing and I . . . couldn't see, and I just crouched on       the ground in a ball and put both hands up. Then--I heard       the officers asking if I was ok. Asking if I could stand       (I couldn't since I couldn't see). At least one of them       said ``I'm trying to help you.'' The crowd was yelling       ``leave her alone'' and came from behind me and were       coaching me to keep my hands up and stay still. Sat there       awhile shaking, getting my bearings, and finally I asked       if I was being detained or if I could leave. Heard several       back and forth conversations between the officers about       ``she resisted us'' and ``she tried to help her friend get       away.'' [And then someone else said] ``if she's willing to       leave, just let her go.'' I kind of scootched back on my       butt into the crowd and then some kind soul asked if he       could help me up and get away from the gas, took my arm       and we walked up the block back into the park. Some other       kind soul asked if we needed Maalox for our eyes (that       helped a little) and then we were out of the bitter cloud.        I felt sorry for the officers actually, who were only doing       what they were told by some pretty evil higher-ups (to       disperse nonviolent crowds by force), and as far as my       experience last night, actually seemed to try to do their       best not to truly hurt me (possibly because I am white,       female, and was wearing yellow to identify as a Mom).        I got away with some scraped knees and a sore hip, plus the       stinging eyes and metallic taste which will soon pass. But       also--worst--a heavy heart. It really is senseless out there.       I don't have answers and am no longer convinced that showing       up is helping anything. However, I am pretty sure if the Feds       hadn't been called in this would have continued to fade as       hopefully productive real change and progress were made       involving the city government and PD about the actual       issues--concern about police brutality and social inequities       for POC [people of color]--but now look at us.    We should look at these protesters who are calling for justice, for  policing that treats everyone equally, and it doesn't profile, doesn't  provide public safety protection to some and ignore others. It doesn't  view some citizens as the clients and other citizens as the threat. It  doesn't change their actions when they see a group with white skin  versus black skin or dark skin.   That conversation is being destroyed by the President of America. He  is trying to replace that argument for a better America that treats  people with respect and honors the civil rights of all with a different  America where secret police are deployed to beat the hell out of  peaceful protesters and then put up campaign ads to say that he will  fix it.   We cannot let this story go unanswered. At a minimum, collectively,  all 100 of us should say: No secret police--they wear identifiers for  agencies. They wear unique identifiers, and they don't go marching  through the streets of our city. They stay to protect the Federal  property they are charged to protect. They don't attack peaceful  protesters with flashbangs and tear gas and pepper spray and rubber  bullets and batons. We don't do that here in America.   I hope all 100 Senators will stand up and say: Yes, let's have a  debate on a very simple amendment that says yes to ID on uniforms-- there are no secret police--and yes to staying on your Federal property  or the near vicinity if that is your mission, so we don't have folks on  an unrestricted mission of sweeping through our streets, grabbing  people, and throwing them into vans as we have seen on the streets of  Portland.   I am asking that this Senate do its job to address this issue, to  hold a debate--long or short, as my colleagues would prefer--and vote.  It is important we raise our voice. It is important we vote. It is  important we have accountability. It is important that we defend the  Constitution of the United States and the citizens of the United  States.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, would my  colleague from Oklahoma modify the request to include unanimous consent  to call up amendment No. 2457, an amendment to limit Federal law  enforcement officers from operating in a secret fashion on the streets  of America without identification; that there be 2 hours for debate,  equally divided between opponents and proponents; that upon the use or  yielding back of time, the Senate vote in relation to the amendment  with no intervening action or debate?
