 Mr. Chairman, free speech is under attack here in  America, the free United States of America. Putin is a thug, yes. China  is a threat. But nothing--and I mean nothing--will bring America to its  knees like the removal of our free speech, the cornerstone for our  constitutional Republic.   America without free speech is like a phone without a charger. It is  only a matter of time before it dies.                                time  1530    Attacks on free speech should not be seen with a partisan lens. Any  attack on free speech is an attack on every American who gave their  life so that you and I could live freely, so that you and I could  express our thoughts, beliefs, and opinions without fear of retribution  or persecution.   Mr. Chair, the sad reality is the Biden administration has decided to  collude with Big Tech to silence the voice of the American people under  the guise of misinformation.   We saw in our committee hearings it was demonstrated that the FBI  colluded with Big Tech to silence Americans' free speech. The gentleman  from New York says, well, it is Russia and China who are going to  interfere with our elections. No, no, Democrats are doing just fine  with that on their own. When they have the Federal Government working  for them and their agenda to push that forward and silence Americans'  free speech, they are doing just fine with election interference.   We have seen the polls that said if Americans knew about the Hunter  Biden laptop from hell, the election outcome would have been different,  and you all wanted that silenced so greatly.   Now let me ask you--we certainly have the Constitution; I would love  to get my colleagues on the other side of the aisle a copy--who decides  what is true or false? I certainly don't trust the Federal Government  to make that distinction.   They were wrong about the Hunter Biden laptop. They were wrong about  the vaccine mandates, about masks, about the Wuhan lab leak, wrong  about shutting down churches and schools and businesses, and they are  dead wrong to use their positions to attack Americans' free speech.   For the current resident of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the only thing  harder than climbing a flight of stairs, riding a bicycle, or reading a  teleprompter seems to be telling the truth.   Free speech isn't just for kind speech or true speech or widely  accepted speech, it is for all speech, and it is worth fighting for. I  thank my friend, colleague, and chairman of the Oversight and  Accountability Committee, Mr. Comer, for his work to preserve free  speech in America.
