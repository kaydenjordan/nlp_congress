 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I come to talk about a topic that is  near and dear to my heart. Although I don't serve on the committee of  jurisdiction, I will tell some stories today that will demonstrate to  you about why I feel so strongly about this nominee and so strongly  about this position.   I want to start with my dad's story. My dad grew up on a small family  farm outside the town of Barney, ND, not that you would know where that  is. When he became an eighth grader--when he graduated with an eighth- grade education, he wanted to go to high school in Wyndmere, but as was  the custom at the time, the oldest son was expected to stay on the farm  and not get an education beyond the eighth grade and help support the  family. That is not unusual. There is probably a number of people in  this body whose parents have a similar experience, but this story  really came home to me when my dad was diagnosed with melanoma.   Unfortunately, with part of that disease, the cancer moved to his  brain and something remarkable happened for all of us, and that was  that he would relive parts of his life. He would believe--as the cancer  took over his brain, that part would activate his memory, and he would  be doing things like calling bingo in the middle of the night during  this time when he was in hospice care. It would alarm us, and maybe  sometimes even amuse us, but he would  [[Page S671]]  truly believe he was calling bingo at the Mandan VFW Hall.   I remember taking care of him one night, when he started reliving the  experience of not going to high school and started really talking about  how that affected his life, begging his father. I would never have  known that without the cancer, but that education experience was so  critical to his future and the future of his children. That experience  that he had taught us and informed us and mandated that we appreciate  public school education and the opportunity that came with it.   That leads to our story, the seven children of Ray Heitkamp who had a  great public school education in Mantador, went to high school in  Hankinson. Some of my siblings were fortunate enough to go to parochial  school before St. Francis closed down, but we all graduated from  Hankinson High School. Then something truly remarkable happened in this  country--truly remarkable because we had a chance to go to college.  From the time we were just children, my mother would tell us we were  going to college. We would wonder, back in the sixties, how that was  ever possible.   Then the Federal Government did something truly remarkable. It said  our most important asset and our greatest future lies in the education  of our children, and we want to help our children advance with that  education. We saw what happened with the GI bill when GIs came home  from World War II and went to college and became doctors and lawyers,  became bankers, became businessmen, and worked to build their  communities. We saw that.   We said: Wouldn't it be great if every kid had that opportunity, not  just returning veterans but every kid.   So I remember coming here, my first day that I presided in the U.S.  Senate after I was elected in 2012, and I was so busy getting ready to  serve that I hadn't really gotten to that spot where I realized: Wow. I  am standing in the most deliberative body in the world, and I am a U.S.  Senator. I remember gaveling in, asking Pastor Black to come forward  and give the prayer, and then we turned--as the pages know, we turned  to say the Pledge of Allegiance. It was at that moment when I asked  myself, ``In what country can the daughter of a school cook and a  construction worker serve in the U.S. Senate?''   We are blessed in this country to have opportunity, but that  opportunity is diminished if we don't support public school education.  That opportunity will not be available to future generations. We will  continue to divide this country in ways that will destroy our  democracy.   So where do we go today and how does this have anything to do with  today?   This is our Nation's story. Public school education, which began in  Massachusetts, and every step and every development of public school  education has expanded the opportunity for children with disabilities  to achieve their highest calling through public school education.  Children of a school cook and a construction worker can become a U.S.  Senator. Any achievement we all have is because someone cared about our  education and cared about our opportunities.   I was fortunate, I had parents who believed in education. Way too  many children today are in homes where education isn't a priority.  Maybe that home is racked with poverty, addiction, huge challenges.  Even homeless children deserve a public school education, deserve  access to education.   We are the envy of the world. Children in other countries die for the  opportunity for public school education. This is foundational, not just  to the individual development but to the future of our country.   So where are we today? Sure, we have challenges in education. No one  is denying that. No one is saying our public school education, our  entire education system is perfect. The challenge I have in North  Dakota is achieving quality education in a rural setting. How do we do  that when maybe there are only two high school seniors, and if they are  going to go to the next school, they are going to drive at least an  hour and a half a day. That is not unheard of. I can only imagine what  that looks like in Alaska.   There are parts in our State where we are challenged every day to  deliver high-quality education. We have a technology barrier.  Fortunately, in North Dakota, we have technology and broadband in many  of our schools. That is not true across this country. We need to do  more in broadband, bringing high-quality education tools to schools. We  need to recruit the best teachers for our rural schools, the best  teachers for our urban schools--the best people.   During my time as Attorney General, I did a project involving  juvenile justice. We went around to all of the schools, mainly talking  to junior high kids because we believed that was the point at which  they were making choices that may change the trajectory of their life.  We were going around high schools talking to junior high kids. One of  the things that kids told us over and over again is, they did not want  their teachers to know when they had done something illegal. Why is  that? It is not because they didn't trust their teachers with that  information. The other group they didn't want to know was their parents  because they didn't want to disappoint the heroes in their lives.  Contrary to what people think--because they think children's heroes are  some sports hero or some rapper or some performer, and that is  absolutely not true. Do you know who kids' heroes are? First, they will  say their grandparents or parents or a sister or a brother, one of  their family members. Next what we hear is their third grade teacher,  their seventh grade math teacher, their high school coach who maybe  made their life a little bit easier when they were in school. Those are  their heroes. These are the people who are doing the critical work all  too often of helping to raise our kids in very challenging  circumstances.   So when we do not support public school education with highly  qualified nominees for the highest education job in the country, what  does that say to people who may choose an opportunity in education? It  says we don't think very much of them because we are just willing to go  ahead with a D-minus applicant because maybe that applicant had a big  checkbook.   I want to talk a little bit about my colleague who is on the floor  today, Patty Murray, and a colleague who is not, and that is Senator  Alexander. I can state that I was in State office when No Child Left  Behind was passed. It was so apparent to me and everyone at that level  that this was not a public policy that was going to achieve the  intended results, but yet we maintained that public policy for  decades--through gridlock, through the inability to sit down and  compromise, through the inability to put politics aside and put  children first.   Then something remarkable happened in the last Congress. In a highly  contentious partisan environment, two great leaders, Senator Murray and  Senator Alexander, sat down, and they knew the time had come to reverse  the No Child Left Behind Act and replace it with something that was  going to be much more successful so the Every Student Succeeds Act was  passed, and we are now on the path of implementation. We set a new  policy for public school education.   We need a leader in the Department of Education who believes in  public school education and who can administer that policy, who can  leave policy to the local and State school boards, to parents, to PTAs,  and to local folks. We want policy. We need someone who can collaborate  and implement and work with schools across our country to make this  policy work and then report fairly back to us when something is not  working to tell us that wasn't a good idea. We need more afterschool  programs. We need a hot lunch program that actually serves more kids in  the morning so kids are ready to learn. That is what we need.   So what did we get with this nominee? In my opinion, we got a highly  unqualified nominee for one of the most significant positions in  government for our most precious resource, our children. That is what  we got.   So I am standing today, explaining my belief that we need to do  something different than approve this nominee. We need to send the  right message to all of those educators, all of those State officials,  and all of those parents who came together and worked with Senator  Murray and Senator Alexander to form a policy. Dissent was hardly  anywhere. If it was, it was whispered on the edges. We need somebody  [[Page S672]]  who appreciates that work, who understands that work, and who would  never say public schools are a dead end.    Public schools are not a dead end. They are the beginning of  opportunity. We have to work hard to make sure that happens, but we  have to start from a foundational belief that public school education  is critically important and needs to be protected, supported, and  advocated for. We have to start there, and I think we are not there  with this nominee.   I wish to say it is not just my judgment that I bring to the floor of  the Senate today. I bring to the floor the judgment of thousands of  North Dakotans who have called me.   Hopefully, I did something to give people greater access to my  advocacy in the Senate for them. I opened a portal on my Web page and  asked people to tell us what they wanted to have done with these  nominees. I have received thousands--in fact, 4,600. It may not sound  like a lot to other offices, but that is a lot from a State of only  730,000 or 740,000 people. Of those 4,600, over half were on this  nomination. Of those who called this office or sent a message to the  portal, 92 percent of them said: Please, do not vote to approve Betsy  DeVos. These are incredible statistics, very telling statistics.   I wish to read some of the comments I received from North Dakotans. I  received a comment from Amber of Burleigh County, who said:         My husband and I are both public educators and we know how       critical a good public school education is for students all       across North Dakota, including our two daughters. We need a       leader at the U.S. Department of Education who supports       students, teachers, and public schools. Unfortunately, Betsy       DeVos wants to dismantle public schools.    Judith from Cass County said:         DeVos has no public education experience or training of any       kind; she has never been a teacher or school administrator,       served on any public board of education, or even attended a       public school. It is clear DeVos is not qualified to be the       head of the U.S. Department of Education.    Patricia from Bottineau County told me:         As a former public school teacher and grandmother of 6, I       do not support Betsy DeVos for Secretary of Education. She       should not get this job with no experience in education other       than trying to get rid of public schools.    An editorial today in the Fargo Forum, a very conservative newspaper  in my State--I might say, it is not known for its liberal bias--said:         Of Trump's Cabinet nominees, DeVos is among the least       qualified for the intended job because of her uninformed and       ideologically skewed views of public education. Her ignorance       was on display during her Senate committee hearing during       which she was unable to answer even softball questions about       long-standing education policies.    If we were inclined to support Ms. DeVos, I felt it was my job to  watch the hearings. By anyone's measure, I think the hearings were  clearly a disaster for this nominee. But I think it also represented-- more than the lack of knowledge and qualifications--an attitude. That  attitude is that it is clear she doesn't understand the importance of  public schools and refused to rule out taking Federal investments away  from public schools. In fact, I think it was very clever in not  revealing the true agenda, which is to privatize--not just charter  schools. In fact, some of the greatest charter school advocates in this  country do not support her nomination.   She doesn't understand basic education policy, yet she wants to lead  the Federal agency overseeing education in our country. She doesn't  understand or know of current Federal laws that support and protect  students with disabilities. She has shown her severe lack of knowledge  about rural schools, which represent about one-third of the public  schools nationwide. She never attended or taught in a public school or  had any of her children in a public school.   Students, parents, and teachers across North Dakota have stood up to  say no to Betsy DeVos. In the Senate, only one more vote is needed to  stop this nomination from proceeding.   I ask my colleagues who have not made up their mind, my colleagues  whom I know care deeply about children to think about the great history  of our country and think about the enormous privilege we had as  children and as young adults to access that public school education. I  ask them to think about how else someone who is the daughter of a  school cook and a janitor and a seasonal construction worker could be  in the Senate if it weren't for public school education.   Please, we can find someone so much better--someone who understands  the new Federal policy, who has the ability to collaborate with public  officials and not criticize, someone who hasn't said the work of these  people who have dedicated their lives is a dead end, and someone who  has respect for public school education.   We can do so much better. Our kids need it and deserve it. Children  in the most precarious and difficult situations need a champion,  whether it is because they have disabilities or whether they come from  poverty and don't have a parent who really cares about their education  or is too busy trying to put food on the table to worry about whether  the homework gets done. We can make a difference here. We can send a  message out to all of those school teachers who have dedicated their  lives, who are our kids' heroes, that their life work matters. We are  going to send them the best this country has to offer to be their  leader.   Madam President, with that, I yield the floor, and I yield my time to  Senator Murray.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I yield the remainder of my  postcloture debate time to Senator Murray.    Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
