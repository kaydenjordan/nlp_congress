 Mr. President, later today, I will be leaving with many  other Senators on an official trip to Normandy, France, to celebrate  the 75th anniversary of the D-day invasion, also known as Operation  Overlord. I consider it a high honor to be part of a congressional  delegation commemorating one of the most important days in the history  of human civilization. It is especially important to make this trip at  a time when relations with our traditional trans-Atlantic allies are  under undue and unnecessary stress.   On June 6, 1944, the largest single amphibious assault in history  crossed the English Channel and stormed the beaches of Normandy, code- named ``Utah,'' ``Omaha,'' ``Gold,'' ``Juno,'' and ``Sword,'' names  that will be forever associated with acts of uncommon valor and self- sacrifice in defense of human freedom and dignity. The Allied armada  involved over 156,000 U.S., British, and Canadian troops traveling  aboard almost 7,000 naval ships and landing vessels.   Even before the amphibious assault, in the darkened skies of that  early morning, 13,100 American paratroopers of the 82nd and 10lst  Airborne Divisions made parachute drops near Carentan from over 2,000  Allied aircraft, followed by 3,937 troops flown in by day on 867  gliders as the opening maneuver of Operation Neptune, the assault  operation for Overlord.   Three of the six Allied divisions involved in D-day were American,  including the 29th Infantry Division. The 29th Infantry Division was  activated on February 3, 1941, and based at Fort Meade, MD. It  consisted of soldiers from Maryland and Virginia. In September 1942,  the 29th deployed to England, where it made final preparations for the  D-day invasion.   Operation Overlord called for Allied troops to storm ashore five  landing areas along the 50-mile stretch of Normandy's shore. U.S.  forces were responsible for taking Utah and Omaha. Securing Omaha was  critical to the Allies' success and would be the site of the heaviest  German resistance. The 29th and the 1st Infantry Division were  responsible for taking Omaha. Nearly 10,000 men of the 29th formed the  first assault wave on Omaha. At approximately 6:30 in the morning on  June 6th, Allied forces encountered stormy seas, a low tide, reinforced  obstacles, and a force of 50,000 German troops awaiting them on  Normandy's 50-mile shoreline.   George ``Billy'' Forbes, Jr., of Bryantown, MD, was a radio operator  in the 29th Infantry Division. Mr. Forbes described his feelings before  the D-day invasion as ``very anxious and very scared.'' He said that  even though he did not know what to expect, he had a job to do, and he  was going to do it to the best of his ability.   Lester Lease of Cumberland, MD, was only 16 years old when he lied  about his age to join the Army. He was a sergeant in the 29th when he  landed at Omaha Beach. Mr. Lease stressed the difficulty of the  amphibious assault. The ``Higgins boats'' could not get close enough to  shore for the soldiers to get off on the land, so they had to swim  through deep water before they could wade or crawl ashore. Many of  [[Page S3247]]  them perished in the onslaught of withering German machine gun and  artillery fire before they even made it to shore. Those who did make it  to the beaches encountered thick shell smoke that obstructed their  visibility, and they heard the cries for help from their fellow  soldiers lying wounded nearby as German machine gun fire relentlessly  rained down on them.   Charles ``Harry'' Heinlein, a 22-year-old Army private from  Baltimore, MD, described the scene as total confusion, recalling, ``It  seemed like hours to get off the beach. At this point, the only orders  being yelled to those still able to fight was, `Get off the beach! Get  off the beach!' ''   William Bladen of College Park, MD, was a 19-year-old paratrooper in  the 82nd Airborne Division. In the dark, early hours of that morning,  Private First Class Bladen parachuted into Normandy with two 20-pound  satchels of TNT attached to him and unable to see where he would land.  Mr. Bladen said, ``War is hell--in fact, it's worse than hell.'' But he  had a mission and he did it.   Joe Heinlein of Parkville, MD, provided context to the American  casualties suffered. He pointed out that before D-day, Bravo Company,  175th Regiment, of the 29th Infantry Division, had about 200 men; by  June 19 about a dozen men remained. Mr. Bladen added, ``I hope people  remember that a lot of men gave their lives for others.''   Freedom is not free. The Normandy American Cemetery serves as the  final resting place for 9,380 American military dead, most of whom lost  their lives in the D-day landings. On the Walls of the Missing are  inscribed another 1,557 names of soldiers whose remains were never  recovered or identified. We must never forget those who, in Abraham  Lincoln's immortal words, ``have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the  altar of freedom.'' The Americans who died on the beaches and in the  fields of Normandy made the ultimate sacrifice, but they did not die in  vain. They helped to defeat fascism, totalitarianism, and the Nazi  regime. They helped to liberate Europe and the concentration camps. In  GEN Dwight Eisenhower's D-day address, he declared to Allied troops,  ``The eyes of the world are upon you. The hopes and prayers of liberty- loving people everywhere march with you . . . The free men of the world  are marching together to victory.   We remember and we honor the intrepid heroes of the 29th Infantry  Division and all the other members of the ``Greatest generation'' who  marched together into battle and demonstrated remarkable acts of valor  and sacrifice 75 years ago tomorrow.   As the poet Archibald MacLeish wrote, ``There are those who will say  that the liberation of humanity, the freedom of man and mind is nothing  but a dream. They are right. It is the American Dream.'' But it is a  dream that we Americans share with all people who cherish freedom and  human dignity now, just as we did on June 6th, 1944.                            ____________________
