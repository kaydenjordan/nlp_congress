 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, there are days and events that are almost  unspeakable, and October 7, 2023, is one of them. The slaughter of  hundreds of innocent Israelis--men, women, and, unthinkably, children-- at the hands of Hamas terrorists was a terrible witness to the evil of  which mankind is capable. The stories and images that have emerged are  searing: a bloodied infant seat, parents tucking their 10-month-old  twins into hiding before being murdered by the attackers, a mom and dad  killed with their three young children.   As a father and a grandfather, I cannot imagine the terror those  parents must have felt as they realized Hamas gunmen had moved into  their villages. It is a terrible fact of war that the innocent are  often drawn into the crossfire, but to make war on the innocent, to  target the innocent deliberately, is perhaps the greatest evil of which  man is capable.   Mr. President, it is nearly unimaginable to think that someone could  look at Hamas's attack and find any cause for joy or celebration, and  yet in the days following the attacks, we have seen far too many people  right here at home--including at our so-called top universities-- attempt to defend or even celebrate the indefensible. And while the  First Amendment protects their right to speak, I hope that we as a  society can categorically reject the view that anything can justify or  excuse the deliberate murder of babies and children.   Mr. President, Israel is currently working to bring a swift end to  Hamas's reign of terror, and it should have the full support of the  United States in this mission. The United States has long provided  security assistance to Israel, including an ongoing memorandum of  understanding that supports foreign military financing and missile  defense assistance through fiscal year 2028.   In 2021, we passed supplemental funding to restock the Iron Dome  system in response to rocket attacks from Hamas, and I anticipate  Congress will soon consider a supplemental in response to this attack.  We must also use every resource available to prevent escalation and  expansion of this war and ensure that Israel does not end up fighting  on multiple fronts.   We can already see that other hostile actors are angling to enter the  fray. Iran is actively threatening Israel. Hezbollah, which is backed  by Iran, has fired rockets and artillery across Israel's northern  border with Lebanon. And we need to band together with our allies to  make it clear that any attempts to escalate this war would be a grave  miscalculation.   It is also past time to hold Iran--a long-time funder of Hamas,  Hezbollah, and other terrorist organizations--to account for its role  in fomenting unrest and destabilizing the Middle East. I have not been  shy about calling out the Biden administration's poor track record on  being tough on Iran, in particular, the administration's misguided goal  of re-signing a flawed nuclear deal and attempting to appease the  country's leaders with billions of dollars in sanctions relief.   Just over a month ago--on September 11 of all days--the  administration lifted a freeze on $6 billion in Iranian assets, which  would likely have resulted in the freeing up of additional funds for  Iran's hostile activities. I am glad that the President listened to  calls from Senator Blackburn, me, and others to block Iran's access to  these funds, and I hope that the Senate can soon pass legislation to  permanently freeze these assets. We need to make it very clear to  Iran--and to any other country that would seek to imitate the  Iranians--that there will be consequences for aiding and abetting  terror.   Mr. President, 30 Americans have now been confirmed to have died in  [[Page S5026]]  Israel. As I speak, we have 13 possible American hostages being held by  Hamas. We also have an estimated up to 600 Americans in Gaza in harm's  way, including a family that my office is working with. We must get  them out.   Mr. President, in the midst of war and Hamas's brutality, it is  important to remember our own sense of humanity and innocence on both  sides. Hamas's utter indifference to human life was on full display on  its rampage through Israeli villages, and that indifference extends,  unfortunately, to the lives of its own people. Hamas has tangled its  terrorist infrastructure throughout and under an incredibly dense urban  population center, ensuring that innocent lives will always be in  harm's way in attacks on legitimate terrorist targets.   And as Israel prepares to go after targets in Gaza, Hamas is now  discouraging--and, it appears, actively trying to prevent--civilians  from heeding Israel's calls to evacuate. Apparently, Hamas believes  that dead Palestinians will advance its cause and keep the focus on  Israel's response, not the abject brutality that Hamas unleashed on  October 7. And we must be resolute in exposing and condemning this  callousness.   We must also work to ensure that the response of free countries  conveys the respect for human life that is so woefully lacking in the  terrorists and that we do everything we can to ensure that innocent  civilians on both sides in this conflict are protected as much as  possible and that humanitarian aid reaches innocent Palestinians and is  not intercepted by Hamas terrorists.   Mr. President, the Jewish people have suffered much, but their  story--and the story of Israel--is one of resilience, and the United  States stands with Israel at this most challenging time. My prayers  this week are with the grieving families in Israel and all the  suffering and for the permanent defeat of Hamas and a just and lasting  peace.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from Kentucky (Mr. Paul) and the Senator from South Carolina (Mr.  Scott).
