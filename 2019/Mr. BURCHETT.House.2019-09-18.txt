 Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of my good friend,  Bill Dunn, a colleague of mine from my time in the Tennessee General  Assembly.   Representative Dunn and I served together in the State house starting  when we were members of the same freshman class in 1995. Since that  time, he has remained a strong champion for fiscal conservatism and the  rights of the unborn.   Upon completing his current term, Representative Dunn will retire  from his house seat after 26 years. Representative Dunn has been a  diligent public servant, an excellent representative for his community,  and, most importantly, an honorable family man.   He and his wife, Stacy, have raised a wonderful family of five  children; and I have not checked lately to see how many grandchildren  there are, but there are a bunch of them, I am sure. I am sure his  retirement includes quality time with his family.   I wish Representative Dunn the best of luck in the next chapter of  his life and thank him for his commitment to our home State of  Tennessee.   Bill Dunn is a good guy.                            ____________________
