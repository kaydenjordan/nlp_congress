 Mr. Speaker, after the conclusion of the last shutdown, I  was hopeful that we would work together in good faith to find a  commonsense approach to secure our border. However, it appears that the  Democrats are more concerned with releasing illegal aliens than  addressing border security.   Recently, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have suggested  that we reduce the adult detention beds for illegal detainees in  exchange for border security. This is unacceptable. As we in this body  are all aware, adult detention beds are an essential aspect of  enforcing our immigration laws. Reducing the amount of beds would  further exacerbate our problems with interior enforcement, thus relying  on an ineffective catch and release policy. Only 4 percent of those  released ever show up for their court date. That means that they have a  96 percent chance of staying in this country.   Our primary role of government is security. Border security is  national security, and our national security should not be a bargaining  chip for the Democrats' political games. I urge my colleagues across  the aisle to take this issue seriously.   Please stop playing political games with our Nation's security and  the brave men and women of our Coast Guard, TSA, CBP, and ICE agents.  We must work together as Americans and fix our broken immigration  system which starts with a secure border.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's yielding and  putting this together. It is such an important issue.   I just left another meeting, and we were talking about border  security. There shouldn't even be a fight, because what we are talking  about is what we are charged with in Congress, Republicans and  Democrats, and the President. We have all taken that oath, and that  oath talks about protecting our country and upholding our Constitution  from all enemies, foreign and domestic.   When you look at border security, that should not be a partisan issue  if you focus on border security and take politics out of it--not Donald  Trump's fence, not a party's fence; this is security for the American  people.   Just last week, there was a bust of drugs coming in from Mexico in a  load of bell peppers that had over 1,000 pounds of methamphetamines. It  was valued at $1.2 billion, coming from our southern border. That came  through a legal border checkpoint. That is border security that we are  not doing that we should do that erodes the very social fabric of this  Nation.   Two weeks before that, there was a bust of a legal truck coming in  carrying cucumbers from the southern border through Mexico that had  over 200 pounds of fentanyl. In fact, it had enough fentanyl to kill an  estimated 55 million Americans--55 million Americans. Again, it came  through a legal checkpoint.   So when we talk about border security, take the narrative and the  argument off of Donald Trump's border wall  [[Page H1511]]  and put it on Americans' border security. If we as Republicans and  Democrats come together as Americans, we will have border security.   It is not racist. It is not trying to keep anybody out who wants to  come here legally, which there are ample places for people to come  legally. This is about securing the people in our country, the men and  women who get exposed to these drugs.   In addition to that--and I don't understand why the Mexican  Government hasn't done more about this. They are growing over 22  hectares of poppy fields. Poppy is used for heroin production. There is  not a medicinal use in that quantity that needs to come into this  country. The only way that is coming in is illegally, through either  illegal checkpoints or no checkpoints, or it is coming through legal  checkpoints where we are not emphasizing border security with the new  technologies we have.    So it pains me to think of this country going through another  shutdown that it doesn't need to because people want to play party  politics.   You think of the young men and women in DHS, with border security,  our TSA employees, our Coast Guard, Customs and Border Patrol, and ICE  agents. They show up for work, and we here in this body can't come to  an agreement about America's border security. It is shameful for us. It  is embarrassing.   But when you try to tell the people who are in those situations--I  know people very well who are in the Coast Guard, and when you say,  ``Well, you just don't understand. They are holding up. They don't want  Trump to have a wall,'' they say, ``I don't care whose problem it is.  Fix the problem.'' In fact, one of them said, ``You know where you need  to build a wall around first is around Washington, D.C. so you guys  can't leave until you solve this problem.''   It is just a shame that we, together, as Republicans and Democrats,  can't solve this problem. But, unfortunately, politics gets put into  this.   If I may talk about the other issue the gentleman was talking about,  being a veterinarian, I have come to believe, and my Christian values  say, that life begins at conception. There is no doubt in my mind. The  good Lord put it there, and I am blessed that I have had the  experiences I have had.   In fact, I have been able to do embryo transfers in the equine, in  the horse world, and I can withdraw an embryo from a female horse  between 5 and 7 days of pregnancy. Even at that size--when you look at  it under a microscope, it looks like a golf ball--it is a baby horse  developing.   I think it is ironic and it is sad that in this country we have laws  on the books that will protect the unborn turtle in an egg or the eagle  within an egg, in a nest, and we have laws that say that it is a  Federal offense and you will go to prison for it, that we will protect  species, but yet when it comes to our own kind, the human species--that  if you believe like you and I do and the majority of Americans that we  are created in the image of God--I have seen an erosion of our society,  and it pains me.   I know, every 100 years they say there is a breakdown of our society;  but I can only think that this time around, when you are saying it is  okay to kill a baby, full term, that is a breathing, living, creature  of God, it is okay, that something is wrong in our society.   I think of that verse in the Bible--the gentleman will know the  number and all that--that says:         If my people will turn away from their wicked ways and       humble themselves and get down on their knees, I will forgive       them.    And He says:         If they do that, then I will continue to bless them.    So, I appreciate the gentleman doing this. I have got some more facts  and figures if he has time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, as I was talking earlier about the drugs coming in, the  methamphetamine and the fentanyl that is coming in, these aren't coming  in by the honest farmer or ranch hand or farmworker in Mexico. These  are orchestrated by drug cartels.   Keep in mind, the methamphetamine and the fentanyl coming into this  country primarily comes via China, so you have nation-states that are  sending products into this country. China is trying to re-create the  Opium Wars of the 1800s with our youth in this country.   Mr. Speaker, Mr. Walker brought up the deaths, and I feel really bad  for his family to have his brother-in-law go through that. I can't  imagine the pain and the horror.  [[Page H1512]]    There are 300 opioid deaths a week in this country alone, but that is  just the tip of the iceberg.   A good friend of mine, he is a heart surgeon in Gainesville, Florida.  He said: Ted, that is just the tip of it. I have a young lady in, and  it is her fourth heart valve replacement. At 25 years of age, the  fourth heart valve replacement, because as they use the drugs, they  don't use sterile techniques. They get infected. Their immune system  goes down, and the bacteria will grow on the heart valve. Her fourth  one.   I said: Tom, what is the cost of that?   He said: The average heart valve is close to $100,000.   $400,000, and if she dies, she doesn't die from a drug overdose. In  the records, it is from heart failure.   So the 300 a week who we know are dying from drug overdoses, that is  just the tip of the iceberg.   We talk about the cost. You can put a monetary cost on the deaths and  the EMTs and all the emergency support staff and the ERs that we as  taxpayers are funding, because, as he said, guess who paid for that? I  said the hospital. He said: Absolutely. No insurance.   We can put a price on that, a monetary price, but you can't put a  price on the disruption and the loss of a family member, as Mr.  Walker's family went through. The price of that goes on forever.   If we look at just numbers, from a typical number standpoint, we get  2,000 inadmissible migrants arriving at our southern border daily. That  means, since January 2, when the Democrats took over, 41 days  approximately, that means there were 82,000 inadmissible migrants who  came into this country or were trying to.   Of the family units--that is a spouse, a husband and wife, or just a  mother and father with their children--in the last 41 days, that  equates to 36,395 family units.   If you look at the illegal aliens arrested for homicide charges just  in the last 41 days, it is more than 228 arrests.   Let's take politics out of this argument, and let's do what is right  by the American people: fund our government, fund DHS, secure our  borders with any means from above.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina for his  passion about this.
