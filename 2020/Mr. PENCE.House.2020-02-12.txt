 Mr. Speaker, surprise medical bills can be financially  devastating for families. Patients must be protected from this harmful  practice.   As Congress considers solutions to this issue, I urge Speaker Pelosi  to reject any proposals that include government price-setting.   Setting price controls on private transactions gives more power to  the Federal Government and reduces access to healthcare.   Congress must pursue solutions that hold patients harmless, increase  transparency, and resolve disputes that arise from surprise bills.                      Congratulating Melani Shaffmaster     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Melani  Shaffmaster of New Castle High School on being named the 2019-2020  Gatorade Indiana Volleyball Player of the Year.   This is Melani's second time honored with this title, having led her  team to three straight volleyball State championships. Melani has had a  remarkable high school career with thousands of assists, and kills, and  hundreds of aces and digs. Not only has she been a master on the court,  but she has also maintained a 3.9 GPA.   Mr. Speaker, Melani is a true role model for any student athlete, and  I wish her the best of luck in college and in her future.        Congratulating River Valley Resources on its 30th Anniversary     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate River Valley  Resources on celebrating their 30th anniversary.   On a recent visit to RVR Clearinghouse in Madison, Indiana, I was  able to witness the wonderful services that are provided to both adults  and children. RVR currently provides programs and services in 14  counties in southeastern Indiana and central Indiana.   RVR strives to create a competitive workforce through job readiness  training, life skills management, job placement, and is also a Child  Care and Development Fund voucher agent in 12 counties.   Mr. Speaker, I thank RVR for the wonderful work that they do, and I  wish them a happy anniversary.                           Recognizing Matt Peiffer     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Muncie resident and  Ball State student Matt Peiffer. His Muncie-based organization, A Voice  for Kids, is one of 30 winners in T-Mobile's second annual Changemaker  Challenge.   The Changemaker Challenge asks kids aged 13 to 23 to come up with  ideas to help their local communities. A Voice for Kids advocates for  the improvement of the foster care system.   A former child in Indiana's foster system, Peiffer has already helped  improve the system, and this award shows that people around the Nation  are noticing his good work.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Matt and A Voice for Kids for making  their community and the Hoosier State a better place.           Celebrating Shelbyville Rotary Club's 100th Anniversary     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Shelbyville  Rotary Club for celebrating 100 years of service.   The rotary club has been a beacon of service in the Shelbyville  community for this century. Last year alone, the club raised funds for  the Shelbyville Boys Club Youth Football program, Pantry Pals, SCUFFY,  the Blue River Community Foundation, and Girls Inc. The rotary club  also provides scholarships for every high school in Shelby County.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the members of the Shelbyville Rotary Club for  their service and dedication to Shelbyville and congratulate them on  their 100th anniversary.                            ____________________
