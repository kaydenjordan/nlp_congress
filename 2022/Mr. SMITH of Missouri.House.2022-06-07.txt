 Mr. Speaker, as the Republican leader of the  House Budget Committee, I led a group of 12 Members of Congress last  week to the Rio Grande Valley to see firsthand the real cost of  President Biden's disastrous immigration agenda.   There were major gaps in border wall and open areas that make it  easier for the Mexican cartels to make millions of dollars trafficking  humans and illegal drugs over the border. And yet, we saw $350 million  worth of rusted border wall materials sitting unused because of  President Biden's illegal decision to freeze border wall funding.   Border Patrol agents told me they are seeing 10,000 encounters each  week in the Rio Grande Valley sector alone, including 174 different  nationalities who have been apprehended on the southern border. The  rest of the world has figured out that our border is not secure,  whether the Biden administration realizes it or not.   I will continue fighting to secure the border and protect families  from President Biden's disastrous agenda.                            ____________________
