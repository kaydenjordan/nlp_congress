 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to applaud  the response to Hurricane Florence, which caused extensive damage in  the  [[Page H9156]]  Carolinas earlier this month. The mission is far from over, but the  Federal response has been swift, and the National Guard units from  across the country have been working together to help in the recovery  efforts.   Proudly, members of the Pennsylvania National Guard are helping to  provide shelter support. The level of professionalism and training  shown during this recovery by guardsmen from across the country is  commendable.   Mr. Speaker, there are many aspects of the recovery effort, including  food assistance. I am pleased that USDA acted quickly to announce  Disaster SNAP. Households that may not normally be eligible for SNAP or  food stamps may qualify for Disaster SNAP.   Providing food assistance to neighbors in need is exactly why the  SNAP program exists. Food security is an important step toward bringing  back normalcy and stability for families impacted by the disaster.   Mr. Speaker, as our fellow Americans begin putting their lives back  together, I am pleased to know that they will have help every step of  the way.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that the Committee on Education and the Workforce be discharged from  further consideration of the bill (H.R. 6014) to reauthorize the Family  Violence Prevention and Services Act, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.
