 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor,  thank, and express my sincerest gratitude for an incredible group of  students at Penn State University.   This group of students have spent the last year dedicating countless  hours to support a fantastic cause benefiting pediatric cancer  patients. I am talking about THON.   This year-long fundraising effort culminates in an annual 46-hour  dance marathon to support more than 4,500 families financially and  emotionally with children who are battling cancer.   On February 17, Penn State students, staff, family, friends,  volunteers, and spectators filled the Bryce Jordan Center for the 51st  Penn State IFC/Panhellenic Dance Marathon, more widely known as THON,  to raise money for the Four Diamonds Foundation.   THON was founded in 1973 by Penn State fraternities and sororities.  What began as a small fundraiser bringing in $2,000 in its inaugural  year has flourished into a campus-wide effort with more than 16,000  student volunteers across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.   In 1977, THON partnered with the Four Diamonds Foundation, and since  then, not a single Four Diamonds family has received a medical bill  thanks to the tireless work and dedication of Penn State students.   The Four Diamonds Foundation was founded by Charles and Irma Millard  in 1972 after their son, Christopher, lost his battle with cancer at 11  years old. Before Christopher passed away, he wrote a story about a  great knight who sought out the four diamonds of courage, wisdom,  honesty, and strength to be saved from the evil sorceress. His parents  realized those four qualities were all necessary to overcome cancer,  and they created the Four Diamonds Foundation in his memory.   Over the past 50 years, THON has grown into the largest student-run  philanthropy in the world.   Students stood from 6 p.m. on Friday, February 17 until 4 p.m. on  Sunday, February 19. While it was an impressive feat to hold, what is  even more incredible is the drive, fortitude, and flexibility these  students showed in their commitment to this cause.   This year, Penn State students raised a record $15,006,132.46, and to  date, students have shattered records and raised more than $200  million, making THON the largest student-run philanthropic effort in  the world.   Of course, their dedication is to be applauded, but ask any Penn  State student, and they will agree: THON isn't about them. It is about  the children and the families fighting cancer.   THON is for the kids, and it is for the families to focus on  celebrating more birthdays, piano recitals, science fairs, graduations,  and every other milestone a child should celebrate without fear.   THON exists so one day parents never have to hear the words: ``Your  child has cancer.''   Mr. Speaker, I am proud of these students, but more importantly, I am  proud of the children and the families who have the courage to fight  back against pediatric cancer.   Congratulations once again to everyone involved in this year's THON.  We are.                            ____________________
