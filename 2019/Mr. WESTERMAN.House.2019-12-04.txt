 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Barbara Jones  on her retirement from South Arkansas Community College.   Dr. Jones has served as the President of South Arkansas Community  College for more than 10 years and has always been dedicated to  promoting higher education.   Dr. Jones brought an impressive resume to south Arkansas with a  background in health science and educational leadership. She has served  on the American Association of Community Colleges Board of Directors as  well as several other professional educational organizations.   Prior to Barbara entering the collegiate sphere, she worked as a  laboratory scientist for 22 years in both hospitals and medical  facilities. Young people in Arkansas are becoming leaders in their  schools and communities, and Dr. Jones played a huge role in many of  their lives.   Working in higher education can often be a thankless job, but Dr.  Jones was a tireless force for over a decade. By encouraging students  in both STEM fields and others, Barbara demonstrated commitment to  learning skills for a lifelong career.   Dr. Jones will be greatly missed by the students and alumni of South  Arkansas Community College.   We wish her and her family all the best as she retires. It is with  great pride that I honor Dr. Jones.                            ____________________
