 Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes this  afternoon to talk about TrumpCare, specifically, about what families  back in my home State of Washington are saying about the harm that this  bill will do and why, despite how often Republicans say they are  struggling to find a way to jam TrumpCare through the Senate, now is  the time to keep the pressure on.   I have had to say this far too often: Right now people across the  country are scared, and they have a right to be. The policies in  TrumpCare would turn our healthcare system into a minefield of higher  costs and worse care for our families. If you are a young person who  needs mental healthcare, you could pay thousands more a year on top of  what you are already paying for insurance. If you are a senior, your  premiums could increase by as much as 850 percent. If you need  maternity care, the independent analysis by the Congressional Budget  Office shows you could pay as much as $1,000 more a month.   Under TrumpCare, 23 million people across the country would lose  coverage, and, because insurance companies would have far more power to  lower their standards and offer skimpy, snake-oil plans, we would go  back to the days when a trip to the emergency room could result in a  truly devastating financial hit.   I have just described some of the biggest impacts TrumpCare would  have. None of them help patients and families. They instead do serious  harm.   But you know who would benefit from TrumpCare? Special interests in  the healthcare industry that would get a massive tax break and, of  course, President Trump, who is desperate for a political win.   For these reasons and many more, people across our country are  rejecting TrumpCare. They don't want the dramatically higher healthcare  costs. They don't want this bill to create even more chaos in our  healthcare system than Republicans already have, and they certainly  don't think they should have to pay more, all to appease President  Trump and those at the very top.   Senate Republican leaders have said they expect their final product  will look a whole lot like the version of TrumpCare that passed in the  House. In fact, some of them said they expect to keep as much as 80  percent of the House-passed version of TrumpCare. So it is no wonder  that they are now having trouble figuring out how to cobble together  enough votes to jam this disastrous bill through the Senate. If that is  truly the case, then, I would again encourage them to drop this  reckless repeal effort, to stop creating chaos in our healthcare  system, which is driving up our premiums, and to work with Democrats on  real solutions.   We are ready, like we have always been, to find ways to bring down  families' healthcare costs while making sure they get the same quality  of care and finding ways to get families more affordable coverage.  Unfortunately, we have not heard from any Republicans who are willing  to reverse course. That is why, despite how much trouble Republicans  may be having with their disastrous policies, I am here today urging  anyone who rejects TrumpCare and what it means for our families' health  and financial security to fight as hard as they can against this bill.  Keep making those calls, keep rallying, and keep sharing your stories.  [[Page S3279]]    Since the election, I have heard from family after family in  Washington State about what the future holds for their healthcare. One  of those is a constituent of mine named Marcy Jefferson. Her husband is  a small business owner, and they purchase individual insurance.   Well, in 2014 Marcy was diagnosed with cancer. She has had to have  not one but two stem cell transplants since then, and her chemotherapy  costs are over $3,000 each month.   Before the Affordable Care Act, Marcy's health insurance had no out- of-pocket limit. Without limits on how much insurance companies can  charge patients--a protection that TrumpCare would take away--Marcy  says she and her husband will most definitely face bankruptcy.   Marcy also says that the ACA ``literally saved my life--and we could  not afford the type of care I am receiving without it.''   There are stories like Marcy's in literally every community in our  country--in red States, in blue States, in purple States. It is  appalling that instead of working with us to make healthcare more  affordable and with higher quality and expanding coverage, instead of  listening to people like Marcy and joining us at the table, Republicans  are trying to jam through the Senate a plan that would do the  opposite--one that would threaten lives and devastate our families  financially.   So I am going to do everything I can to fight back, and I will keep  working hard against the deeply harmful TrumpCare plan that Republicans  are determined to get signed into law. Families like Marcy's are  bravely speaking up and making clear just how damaging TrumpCare would  be, and that is exactly what Democrats here in the Senate are going to  do as well.                            the President's Budget    Before I close, Mr. President, I want to take a couple of minutes to  talk about President Trump's latest budget proposal, because even after  last week's stunning move by President Trump to obstruct our fight  against climate change and seeing another confirmation the week before  that that 23 million Americans would lose their healthcare coverage  under TrumpCare, we cannot lose sight of the grand scope of President  Trump's cruel attack against working families. Nowhere has the  President's broken promises to working families been more evident than  in his recent budget proposal.   President Trump spent his campaign promising workers he would stand  with them, promising seniors he would protect their care, promising the  middle class he would make the economy work for them. Then he came to  Washington, DC, and crafted a budget that is a perfect summary of all  the way those promises are broken.   In fact, the President's budget director came up to Capitol Hill just  2 weeks ago to try to defend the budget, to try to explain how it  didn't break promises, but he couldn't do it because it can't be done.   From his promises not to cut Medicaid or Social Security to his  promise to provide ``insurance for everybody'' that was better and at  lower cost, promise after promise was not just broken but shattered.   So I urge my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to reject  President Trump's anti-worker, anti-student, anti-woman, anti-senior  agenda. Thankfully, we are seeing signs that is happening. Democrats,  Republicans, and Independents have been criticizing this budget here in  DC and across the country. One senior Republican Senator called it  ``dead on arrival,'' and he is exactly right.   The families we represent want us to work together, to invest in our  workers and in our middle-class families, to protect patients, to stand  with women, to grow our economy from the middle out, and not simply  give more tax cuts to the wealthy or well connected. We were able to do  this before. Recently, Democrats and Republicans came together to pass  a spending bill that rejected President Trump's extreme agenda and  worked for families and the middle class. We were able to come together  on bipartisan budget deals that increased investments. So I am hopeful  that Republicans will stand with us on the side of the people they  represent, push aside this awful budget from the President, and work  with us to do this again. I stand ready to do that.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.
