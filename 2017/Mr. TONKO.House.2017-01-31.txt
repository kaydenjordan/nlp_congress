 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 724,  which would rescind President Trump's tragic refugee ban that would  have barred women like the Syrian violinist who has performed at the  White House and who is worried about her family that remain in Aleppo.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, that unanimous  consent request cannot be entertained.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.
