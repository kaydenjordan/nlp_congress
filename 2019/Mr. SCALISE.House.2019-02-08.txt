 Madam Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of  the majority leader the schedule for the week to come.   Madam Speaker, before I yield to the gentleman from Maryland, I want  to share and join in with him in the tribute that has been paid to our  former colleague John Dingell.   I served proudly on the House Energy and Commerce Committee with  Chairman Dingell, and what a giant, what a true institutionalist of  this House, the longest serving Member, a colleague of whom we will  have fond memories and will share those fond memories, I am sure, in  the days and weeks to come.   I know, Madam Speaker, and to my colleague from Maryland as well,  every time we go into that room, the committee room for the Energy and  Commerce Committee, we always get to look up now and know that it is  named after our colleague John Dingell and always remember his wit-- because he was tough, but he had a great wit to share along with the  combat that you would always get to engage in with him.   I will always remember, when the vote was finally called, he always  had his own unique way. As the clerk would be calling the roll of the  committee and they would call a member and the member would say ``aye''  or ``nay,'' he would always say: ``Dingell votes aye.''   He would have his unique way of addressing the issue of the day, and  we will always remember him. To his wife, Debbie, and his family, we  keep him in our prayers.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for going through  the schedule, and I would share that assessment as well, that if those  arrangements are made early next week, I would expect a large  contingent of our colleagues to want to be there. We will all be there  in spirit with John and his memory, as well as our wishes to his  family.   As he and I may have disagreed on some issues, he was a strong  supporter of the Second Amendment, and we would talk about that.  Mostly, when I had those conversations with Chairman Dingell, it was  about this great institution, this people's House that we both have the  honor to serve in, and his appreciation for what this institution means  to our great Nation. Those will be memories I will always cherish.   As we look to the schedule, I know the gentleman alluded to the  conference committee that is meeting. I am encouraged, as I talk to  different conferees, by the conversations, the issues that they are  tackling. Clearly, the issue that has been at the front and center of  the differences that we are trying to work through deals with border  security.    As we look to resolve the differences, ultimately, it is my hope that  we find a way to properly fund the tools that are needed to actually  secure the border, as our experts, our men and women who risk their  lives to keep our border safe, have laid out in detail: obviously,  technology to help them do their jobs better, the need to increase  security at ports of entry and to have more of the drug-testing  equipment that can do a better job of keeping drugs out of our country.   Clearly, part of that solution has to be some form of physical  barriers--whatever you want to call them, wall, physical barrier--along  areas where we have the worst problems.   If I can bring to the gentleman's attention, there was a story  yesterday in the Washington Examiner titled, ``Border agents just  apprehended convicted child molesters and an MS-13 member at the Texas  border where there's no barrier.'' This is a Washington Examiner  article from yesterday, and I include it in the Record.                [From the Washington Examiner, Feb. 7, 2019]   Border Agents Just Apprehended Convicted Child Molesters and an MS-13            Member at the Texas Border Where There's No Barrier                             (By Eddie Scarry)         U.S. Border Patrol agents said Thursday that they       apprehended several illegal immigrants at the southern border       in Texas, in places where there are no physical barrier walls       to deter illegal crossings.        Among those caught crossing into the U.S. were a Mexican       man with a previous conviction in Georgia for child       molestation, a Honduran man with a record in North Carolina       showing a conviction for ``Indecent Liberties with Child,''       and another Honduran male with a Florida record that       identified him as a member of the violent M-13 gang.        The apprehensions occurred in the Rio Grande Valley sector       of the southern border on Monday and Tuesday, according to a       release by the Border Patrol.        I toured a portion of that sector in January, and agents       said that areas that feature a 25-foot barrier of concrete       and steel have proven critical in blocking illegal border       crossers, forcing them to attempt their crossings in specific       areas where they can be apprehended. They've asked for more       of the same kind of border wall to fill in the long gaps that       current exist.        When President Trump said during his State of the Union       address Tuesday that his proposal is for new barrier that       ``will be deployed in the areas identified by the border       agents as having the greatest need,'' this is what he meant.     Madam Speaker, for my friend, the majority leader, I  want to read this comment and ask a question about this.   Among the other things that they were able to identify as they were  able to stop, just earlier this week, some of these people coming in, a  person with ``a previous conviction in Georgia for child molestation, a  Honduran man with a record in North Carolina showing a conviction for  `indecent liberties  [[Page H1484]]  with a child,' and another Honduran male with a Florida record that  identified him as a member of the violent MS-13 gang.''   This is just one more example, earlier this week, of people who are  coming across our border illegally in areas--and the article notes that  this happened in the Rio Grande Valley sector of the southern border on  Monday and Tuesday, according to our Border Patrol agents, in areas  where there is no physical barrier.   So as the gentleman himself has said just a few days ago, and I  quote, ``physical barriers are part of the solution'' to improve border  security, I would ask the gentleman, when we get this conference report  hopefully wrapped up this weekend, can the gentleman give an assurance  that there will be money to properly not only secure the border but to  include the physical barriers that are not there in those areas where  we have child molesters and gang members coming across our southern  border?   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I think we are  all going to be encouraging those members of the conference committee  to continue the work that they are doing. That headway seems to be  going in the right direction.   Hopefully, we come up with a bill by early next week that we can vote  on next week before we get to the deadline on the 15th to continue to  properly fund those other areas of the government that haven't been  funded. That includes the border security that is necessary, including  physical barriers.   Shifting gears, I would ask the gentleman about a piece of  legislation that we filed that we have been trying to get unanimous  consent to bring up, and this is H.R. 962, a bill by my colleague, Ann  Wagner from Missouri.   As we saw earlier, in these last few days, you had the Governor of  New York signing legislation that, among other things, would allow for  a baby that comes out of the womb alive, whether it is from an abortion  that wasn't successful--whatever the case, if a baby comes out of the  womb alive, the fact that in the State of New York, and now we saw the  Governor of Virginia talking on a radio show about how that process and  procedure would be carried out where the baby, after it is born alive,  can be killed legally in those States.   As we talk about the sanctity of innocent life, clearly, there are  many different divisions amongst the parties on the issue of abortion.  But to many, this issue transcends abortion. This isn't related to  abortion anymore. If a baby comes out of the womb and is alive, the  fact that in only 26 States there are protections that that baby can't  be killed, that means in nearly half of the States in this country,  that baby still can be killed legally.   I still don't completely grasp how that is legal in America, that  someone who is born alive can still be killed and have that be legal in  certain States.   So we have a bill called the Born-Alive Protection Act that would  ensure that, regardless of how you feel about abortion--pro-life, pro- choice--after the baby comes out of the womb alive, it shouldn't be  able to be killed. H.R. 962 gives that protection that it can't be  killed. I would ask the gentleman if he would allow that bill to come  to the House floor for a vote.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I would remind the gentleman that when we  did bring that piece of legislation last year, the Born-Alive  Protection Act, it did pass the House, 241-183, in a bipartisan way,  with six Democrats voting with us to pass that bill to the Senate. It  did not get passed in the Senate.                                time  1200    However, as you look now, there have been a number of alarming  developments that have raised the profile of this issue.   When the Governor of New York signed into law his legislation and  celebrated the fact that, in his State, you can kill a baby after it  has been born, and you saw applause in the legislature over that, it  shocked people across the country. It horrified and angered people  across the country.   When the Governor of Virginia, just a few days ago, went to a radio  station and described, in detail, how a baby born alive can still be  killed, can be killed after it is born alive, and it is legal in that  State, it is legal, and not protected in nearly a majority of our  States, this issue has come to the forefront of Americans.   Again, pro-life, pro-choice, wherever you are on this issue, the vast  majority of Americans feel strongly that you should not be able to kill  the baby after it is born alive.   So we can talk about a long, drawn-out legislative process, but now  there is more interest and more anger to confront this violent act of  murder. How can it be anything other than murder to kill a child after  it comes out of the womb? So I know we can talk about a long, drawn-out  procedure.   I have made it very clear I will be filing a discharge petition if we  can't get to the point where we get this bill brought to the floor in a  quicker way. There is a quicker way to do this and address this  problem.   Again, if you ask most pro-choice people in America, they don't think  it is right that you can kill the baby after it comes out of the womb.  And so, as the gentleman can talk about a regular order procedure, this  bill has passed the House before, and now there is more interest in the  Senate to confront this issue. We have the ability to give them that  opportunity.   I would just ask if the gentleman would reconsider, to move this in a  quicker way and allow the unanimous consent motion to go through. If no  one objects, we can bring that bill to the floor. And so far, as we  have been making the motion for unanimous consent, there has been no  opposition expressed. They have just not allowed the motion to go  forward and be recognized.   So I would just ask the gentleman to reconsider and allow us to, at  least, have that opportunity to try to bring this bill to the floor in  the quickest way possible, to stop this barbaric process from being  allowed anywhere in America.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for those comments.  I would just ask if the gentleman would urge the chairman of the  Judiciary Committee to move swiftly to bring this bill up for a vote as  we continue to use every legislative tool we have available to,  hopefully, try to get a unanimous consent agreement to bring the bill  to the floor. But ultimately, if that is not allowed, and if the  committee process doesn't work and actually take attention to this in a  quick way, then we will go a different route and use the discharge  petition route.   So we have continued to try to make the point that this issue needs  to be addressed by this Congress. The President, in his State of the  Union Tuesday night, was very clear that Congress ought to address this  issue. And the President, in his speech--and I thought it was an  incredibly eloquent speech, confronting the challenges we face, but  also talking about the greatness of this country and highlighting some  of the people who achieved greatness, the three men who stormed the  beaches of Normandy, and the challenges they faced to liberate Europe,  to keep America free.   Ultimately, one of those gentlemen actually went on to help liberate  Dachau; and to see the Holocaust survivor who was at Dachau, and  liberated by that very gentleman, to both be on the same row of the  gallery, was a special moment, a special moment that reminds us of the  greatness of this country.   And as the President talked about that at the end, he challenged us,  he challenged Congress to reach for greatness, not gridlock, but for  that same greatness as we confront the challenges that this great  Nation faces today.   This action, the fact that, in many States of this Nation, it is  allowed to kill a baby after it has been born, is a moral wrong that we  need to fix. That is another act of greatness that we need to rise up  to; and I hope we do in the quickest way possible.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
