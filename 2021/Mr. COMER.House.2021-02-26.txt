 Mr. Speaker, this bill isn't about COVID. It isn't about  providing relief to struggling Americans. This massive $1.9 trillion  spending bill is about checking boxes with Democrat donors, political  allies, and left-wing special interest groups.   This bill pushes out $350 billion to bail out poorly managed, locked- down blue States, even though tens of billions of taxpayer dollars  already provided to them remain unspent. It pushes this money out  without guardrails, without strings attached, without certifications of  need or accounting requirements. They are irresponsibly and recklessly  spending hard-earned American taxpayer dollars.   Mr. Speaker, the Republicans on my committee offered comments and  amendments to make these dollars less vulnerable to waste, fraud, and  abuse; amendments that targeted actual COVID-19 relief that were tied  to important policies, like reopening schools, businesses, and  communities. These amendments protected against bailing out underfunded  public employee pension plans. They made sure funds were shared  equitably with small and rural localities. These amendments prioritized  the American people.   Mr. Speaker, my Democrat counterparts on the Committee on Oversight  and Reform refused to adopt a single one of these amendments. They  refused to engage in any meaningful debate.   Why?   Because they don't want the American people to see where this money  is going. Because, sadly, it isn't going to help them.
