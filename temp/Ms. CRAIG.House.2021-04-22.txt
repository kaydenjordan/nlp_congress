 Mr. Speaker, as a Member of Congress, it is such an honor  to have the ability to help my constituents back home by solving  problems and making our government work more effectively for them.   Earlier this year, a man named Jorge Chaves Meza from Farmington,  Minnesota, reached out to my office for help enlisting in the U.S.  Marine Corps. You see, Jorge came to our community from Costa Rica in  hopes of serving our country in the U.S. military, but his Permanent  Resident Card was lost in the mail.   This could have prevented Jorge from serving our Nation, but,  fortunately, my office was able to work with the USCIS to expedite  getting Jorge a replacement card. I am so glad to announce that he  received it and just took his oath of enlistment.   Stories like Jorge's are the most rewarding part of public service,  and I am so proud of his commitment to serving our Nation.   Thank you, Jorge, for your service.                            ____________________
