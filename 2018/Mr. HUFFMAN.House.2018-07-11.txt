 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and  Management Act is our country's most important fisheries law. Magnuson  is the framework for governing fishing in Federal waters, which is big  business in this country: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration estimates that commercial and recreational fishing  generates roughly $200 billion in economic value and supports 1.7  million jobs.   This significant economic impact depends on sustainable management of  fish stocks and protecting the ocean ecosystems on which they depend.  Now, the 1996 and 2006 reauthorizations of Magnuson moved us in that  direction after decades of overfishing had led to the collapse of  fisheries and devastation for fishing communities in many parts of the  country.    Instead of building on that success, I am sad to say that H.R. 200,  which many have called the empty oceans act, would roll back the  important conservation and management standards that have helped us get  to this point, that have helped end overfishing, and that have helped  rebuild a record number of fish stocks. This attempt to return us to  the bad old days of failed fishery management policy and overfishing  that inevitably follows from loose standards should be seen as  unacceptable to everyone who cares about sustainable fisheries.   Now, Magnuson, as has been said, has traditionally been a bipartisan  effort. I have tried to work with Mr. Young in good faith to find a  path towards a bipartisan compromise, and I thank him for his efforts  to get there. We came close. I am disappointed that we fell short.   But we need to be very clear that Democrats are opposing H.R. 200 not  for partisan reasons, but for important policy grounds that, in the  past, have never been partisan and should not be partisan today.   That is also why many fishery stakeholders oppose this bill in its  current form. They don't want to see Magnuson's core conservation  provisions undermined. That is why letters have been pouring in in  opposition to this bill, because it does undermine the very heart of  our country's flagship fisheries law.   We have heard, for example, from the Alaska Longline Fishermen's  Association, Fishing Communities Coalition, Cape Cod Commercial  Fishermen's Alliance, Seafood Harvesters of America, Maine Coast  Fishermen's Association, Marine Fish Conservation Network, Northwest  Guides and Anglers Association, Gulf of Mexico Reef Fish Shareholders'  Alliance, Association of Northwest Steelheaders, Gulf Restoration  Network, American Fly Fishing Tackle Association, and on and on,  including hundreds of chefs, scientists, and recreational anglers,  among others. In fact, the stack of letters that we have received is  quite voluminous, as I have them right here.   The changes my Republican colleagues are proposing to Magnuson are  irresponsible. I am disappointed that they are ignoring the concerns  that have been expressed from so many stakeholders who are telling them  to be more careful as we reauthorize this important bill. There is an  old saying: If it ain't broke, don't fix it.   The bottom line with this Magnuson reauthorization is this: the law  is working as intended. Reauthorization is important, but it shouldn't  come at the expense of the law's core provisions that have made it so  successful.   Mr. Chairman, I have offered an alternate amendment to reauthorize  Magnuson. It contains constructive, bipartisan ideas on how to best  manage our fisheries by allowing for flexibility and modernizing  aspects of fisheries management, but doing so without undermining the  core provisions of the law.   As an angler myself, who represents many commercial and recreational  fishing interests in northern California, I strongly believe that there  [[Page H6071]]  needs to be a bipartisan path forward. I would still very much like to  have meaningful discussions with my colleagues across the aisle to  develop legislation in the spirit of previous bipartisan Magnuson  reauthorizations, while leaving the core conservation and management  provisions intact.   We can also make progress and do more to support recreational fishing  interests. We should do that together, without sacrificing the science- based framework that is so important to the long-term sustainability of  fisheries management.   Unfortunately, H.R. 200 falls short in this regard, and I must  request that my colleagues vote ``no'' on the bill in its current form.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Maine (Ms. Pingree).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, while I certainly appreciate the size of the Louisiana  and Alaska fisheries--and to some extent, I am jealous of some of the  fishing opportunities that exist in those places. I have fished,  myself, in Alaska, but Mr. Graves has yet to invite me to Louisiana for  some fishing, and we hope to fix that going forward.   I don't want to leave the impression that the fishing industry and  fishing communities in other parts of the country are not just as  important. I also don't want to leave the impression that there is  universal support for H.R. 200 even in Alaska and Louisiana. So we are  going to have a little bit of a battle of the posters, Mr. Chairman.   This is a partial listing of the groups that oppose H.R. 200 in its  current form. They oppose it for the reasons that I have mentioned.  They consider it irresponsible to undermine the science-based catch  limits and rebuilding framework that have been so critical to the  success of this bill going forward, and they don't want to see us  backslide into the era of loose regulations and overfishing that will  inevitably follow. They have seen this movie before, and they know what  happens when we undermine core conservation provisions.   So among the many groups and organizations listed in opposition, we  certainly have the Alaska Long Line Fishermen's Association, over here,  the Gulf Fishermen's Association, and the Gulf of Mexico Reef Fish  Shareholders Alliance, among many, many others in opposition to H.R.  200.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from the State of  Washington (Ms. Jayapal).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I certainly want to respectfully push back on the idea  that you have to be a member of the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus to  have standing in this debate.   The fact is, and we have shared some of the groups opposing this  legislation, the opposition includes many recreational fishing  interests, and opposing legislators include many of us who actually do  spend a lot of time on the water catching fish. So let's dispel that  notion.   Now, there are some in the recreational fishing sector who will argue  that Magnuson is broken, that it does not work for them, because, as  they explain, it requires recreational fisheries, just like other  fisheries, to abide by overall catch limits that are based on science.  In other words, the law doesn't work because they don't want to have to  stop fishing when their catch reaches unsustainable levels. That is a  situation not of a law that is broken. It actually shows that we have a  law that is playing a very, very important role.   Now, what would H.R. 200 do if it were enacted into law? It would  enable recreational anglers to take more fish right now without regard  for the future.   Proponents of the bill are advocating to increase recreational catch  limits, reallocate catch away from commercial fishermen with mandated  reallocation reviews, and water down the sustainable fishing mandates  in current law.                                time  1530    That would mean taking more fish now, threatening fisheries with the  risk of overfishing in the future, which we know, because we have seen  this movie before, will lead to bans and closed fisheries in the  future.   Managing fisheries sometimes requires tough choices. It shouldn't be  about immediate gratification. And let's remember, the recreational  fishermen are not disadvantaged under the current management system. In  fact, in some regions, like the Gulf of Mexico, recreational fishers  currently take home 70 percent of the Gulf's most popular fish.  Recreational anglers land an overwhelming majority of species like  amberjack, cobia, red drum, king mackerel, spotted sea trout, and  triggerfish. And for the Gulf red snapper, the division of quota  between the recreational and seafood sectors is a more balanced  situation, roughly 50/50.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, of course I have great respect for my colleague from  Alaska. In fact, in many ways, he deserves credit for helping craft the  original Fishery Conservation and Management Act, for bringing to the  Nation what could be considered the Alaska model of fisheries  management through subsequent Magnuson Act reauthorizations. So I find  myself, ironically, in the position of defending the framework that he  essentially created against my colleagues' attempts to make changes  that I believe are fundamentally threatening to that very framework.   It is this Alaska model that we support, complete with science-based  catch limits, industry accountability for sustainable harvest, and the  constant march towards sustainable practices. That is what has made  U.S. fisheries, under the Magnuson Act, a model for the world, and that  is what we are trying to continue.   Now, it has been suggested that rebuilding timeframes are too rigid  and too restrictive. We will talk more about this when we get to some  of the specific debate on amendments. But it is important to know that  there is flexibility on rebuilding goals in the Magnuson Act and that  flexibility is being used. It is also working. And a great example of  that is what has happened with sea scallops under the Magnuson Act.   Fishery managers implemented a rebuilding plan for sea scallops in  1998. Within a couple of years, the fishery had been rebuilt, and now  the scallop fishery is one of the country's most valuable fisheries.   In 1998, a little over 13 million pounds of scallop were landed. By  2016, that amount had tripled to 40 million pounds, resulting in more  money in fishermen's pockets.   So there is a lot at stake with these issues, and we should bear in  mind not only the numbers we talked about regarding the many jobs, the  billions of dollars contributed to the economy from commercial and  recreational fishing, but the potential to do even more and to do even  better if we manage our fisheries carefully.   NOAA has estimated that rebuilding all U.S. fish stocks would  generate an additional $31 billion in seafood sales, support an  additional 500,000 jobs, and increase the revenue that fishermen  receive at the dock by $2.2 billion. That is why we want to keep these  critical provisions that have worked so well, because we can do even  better if we stay the course.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, we certainly support recreational fishing. I do. I have a  lot of it in my district, and that is one of the reasons why, as I  worked with Mr. Young to try to achieve a bipartisan reauthorization  bill, we were willing to accept many of the provisions regarding  recreational fishing. But you don't help recreational anglers when you  go too far in relaxing annual catch limits or when you go too far in  rolling back the rebuilding framework. Because when these fisheries  crash, as inevitably they will, it is not just commercial fishing boats  that are going to be out of the water. Everyone suffers. These  fisheries will be closed.   And that is why so many recreational fishing interest groups and  individuals have weighed in in opposition to H.R. 200. They have  concluded, as we have, that the short-term gratification for some is  not worth the long-term damage to all.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, while we have some differences in the two sides, I  don't believe that I have been injecting hyperpartisan rhetoric in this  debate. Our differences, as I have emphasized multiple times, are about  policy. This is not about which party we are on. In fact, it used to be  very bipartisan, that this Congress would defend science-based catch  limits and rigorous rebuilding timeframes because we all knew that  those were very, very important provisions for sustainable fisheries,  whether you were a Democrat or a Republican.   Now, if there is some group out there who has written a letter that  refers to the wrong section, or includes inflammatory rhetoric because  they feel like they were kept out of the loop as this bill developed,  maybe that is an indication that they were kept out of the loop as this  bill developed. And maybe that should have been considered along with  the pile of letters that have come into my office and into other  offices expressing fierce opposition to some of these irresponsible  changes being proposed in this Magnuson-Stevens Act reauthorization.   Rather than disparage the stakeholders who are opposing this bill, I  think we should listen to them.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, we have some very critical differences of opinion on  whether this bill is a good idea after years of success in rebuilding  depleted fish stocks, after all of the economic value that we have  created by allowing commercial and recreational fishing to resume in  places all over this country, where at one time it was shut down  because we failed to properly manage our fisheries.   We think, fundamentally, it is a bad idea at this point to declare  mission accomplished and start rolling back the very bedrock provisions  that have enabled us to achieve this success. It is with that in mind  that I request Members to vote ``no,'' and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time  in opposition, although I am not opposed to the manager's amendment.    Mr. Chairman, in 1996, during floor debate passage of  the bipartisan Sustainable Fisheries Act that amended and reauthorized  Magnuson, the gentleman from Alaska said the following:         It is crucial that the management agencies within the       Federal Government be proactive in protecting fisheries       rather than attempting to address overfished stocks after       they are in a crisis situation.    I couldn't agree more, and it is true now, more than ever. Twenty-two  years ago our fisheries were in shambles. Rampant overfishing had  decimated stocks to the point of collapse and Congress needed to make  some tough choices to ensure that there were fish left to catch in our  oceans.   We made tough choices in 1996, and we made them in 2006, putting in  place requirements to end overfishing, to rebuild overfished stocks,  and setting science-based annual catch limits. And because we did that,  because we made those tough choices, the number of overfished stocks is  at an all-time low. The number of rebuilt stocks is at an all-time  high, and most stocks are trending in a positive direction that is  benefiting fishermen in coastal communities.   I cannot support legislation that would turn our backs on what has  worked so well, but H.R. 200, unfortunately, would take us in the wrong  direction, back to the bad old days of fisheries management and  taxpayer bailouts because we loosen the rules that prevent overfishing.   Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for his many years of service in  this Chamber, and I would note that those of us who were not here in  1996 are not so-called johnny-come-latelies, but we are simply younger  than the gentleman. In fact, just about everyone in this House is  younger than the gentleman, and I say that with great respect.                                time  1600    I have worked on fisheries issues throughout my time in this Chamber  and, before that, for 6 years in the California Assembly. In my  personal life, I have been fishing as long as I can remember. I have  even pulled in set nets on a commercial boat in Cook Inlet in the  gentleman's district. So my years of interest in these issues is  largely why I am so disappointed to be standing here debating a  fisheries bill that is, unfortunately, too partisan.   My staff and I worked hard and in good faith to find a bipartisan  compromise, and while the manager's amendment does remove some of the  most egregious language that would undermine environmental laws like  the Endangered Species Act, the National Marine Sanctuaries Act, the  American Antiquities Act, and the National Environmental Policy Act,  the fact is those provisions never should have been in a Magnuson  reauthorization bill in the first place. They were always nonstarters,  and removing them does not fix the serious threat to fisheries posed by  H.R. 200's undermining of catch limits and rebuilding timeframes.   What is more, my staff and I did offer compromise language from  Senator Wicker's Modernizing Recreational Fisheries Management Act.  Even that language that every single Republican on the Senate Commerce,  Science, and Transportation Committee had supported in markup was  rejected, unfortunately, by my colleagues across the aisle and did not  find its way into the manager's amendment.   We also offered on these points of disagreement for catch limits and  rebuilding timeframes to simply leave existing law in place because it  has been working, and that, too, was unacceptable, unfortunately, to  our colleagues across the aisle. So what is left before  [[Page H6084]]  us in H.R. 200 would fundamentally gut provisions that have made  Magnuson so successful.   Now is not the time to move away from catch limits based on sound  science and toward catch limits based on wishful thinking. It is not  the time to allow rebuilding of overstocked fish to be delayed  indefinitely. We have seen this movie before, and we know what happens.   Mr. Chairman, the manager's amendment does remove some poison pill  provisions that should never have been in the bill, but it does nothing  to fix the wrongheaded rollbacks of catch limits and rebuilding  timeframes that will inevitably lead us to overfishing. That is why  this bill has been called the empty oceans act, and that is why it is  opposed by so many stakeholders.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record the dozens of letters we have  received since the manager's amendment was introduced.                                            Gulf of Mexico Reef Fish                                          Shareholders' Alliance,                                                       July 5, 2018.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Democratic Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Democratic Leader Pelosi: On behalf       of the Gulf of Mexico Reef Fish Shareholders' Alliance       (Shareholders' Alliance), I write to you today to express our       continued strong opposition to H.R. 200, the ``Strengthening       Fishing Communities and Increasing Flexibility in Fisheries       Management Act of 2017.''        The Shareholders' Alliance is the largest organization of       commercial snapper and grouper fishermen in the Gulf of       Mexico, with membership in every Gulf state. We work hard to       ensure that our fisheries are sustainably managed so our       fishing businesses can thrive and our fishing communities can       exist for future generations. We are the harvesters that       provide much of the American public with a reliable source of       domestically-caught wild Gulf seafood, and we do this through       a philosophy that sustainable seafood and profitable fishing       businesses depend on healthy fish populations.        It has come to our attention that the House plans to vote       on H.R. 200 after Congress resumes from its July 4th recess.       We must express our continued concerns with this harmful bill       and we strongly encourage you to vote against it. It would       significantly harm our nation's fishermen and women, seafood       suppliers, and seafood consumers through punitive       restrictions and requirements that would not improve       recreational fishing. H.R. 200 would make several damaging       changes to the bedrock principles of the Magnuson-Stevens       Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens       Act).        H.R. 200 would unnecessarily make it more difficult for the       Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Gulf Council) to       use limited access privilege programs (LAPPs) and catch       shares as management tools. We believe that the decision-      makers on the ground in the region should be able to make an       informed decision as to whether LAPPs or catch shares may be       appropriate for a fishery or not. Congress shouldn't tie the       hands of the Gulf Council and preemptively remove these       fishery management tools from the toolbox. Using these tools       for commercial and charter fishing sectors has no impact on       how recreational fishing is managed.        Also, H.R. 200 would promote new limitations and exemptions       to annual catch limits (ACLs). ACLs allow fishing at       sustainable levels to maximize access while minimizing the       risk of overfishing our shared fishery resources. Inherent in       this management tool is the acknowledgement that exceeding       science-based catch limits reduces future opportunities, and       that this should be avoided. The existing generation of       fishermen has already sacrificed to rebuild these fisheries--      let's not burden the next generation with having to rebuild       them again.        Additionally, proponents of H.R. 200 claim that the       Magnuson-Stevens Act does not provide adequate flexibility       and rigidly imposes a 10-year rebuilding timeframe for       overfished fisheries. However, the Magnuson-Stevens Act       already allows fishery managers to approve fishery rebuilding       timelines greater than 10 years in length due to a range of       biological, economic, or social factors. In fact, Gulf of       Mexico red snapper--the resource that many of us have built       our small businesses on--is already experiencing that       flexibility as it is in Year 13 of the current 27 year       rebuilding plan. If the red snapper stock rebuilds by 2032 as       intended, the stock will have been under a rebuilding program       for over 40 years.        Finally, H.R. 200 would overload the Gulf of Mexico Fishery       Management Council with allocation review requirements that       would leave little time or funding to perform its primary       function of managing Gulf fisheries (e.g., setting catch       limits and fishing seasons, conducting stock assessments,       habitat management, etc.).        Furthermore, some Amendments to H.R. 200 would simply make       a bad bill even worse. Specifically, Amendment 26 would open       the door to levying additional taxes on commercial fishermen,       over and above the maximum amount they are legally required       to pay today. We question why this punitive measure is       directed only at two regions of the United States--the Gulf       of Mexico and the South Atlantic. Why are the other six       regional fishery management councils exempted from this       measure? Furthermore, Amendment 26 would initiate a process       that could lead to eliminating the participation of       commercial fishing, seafood industry, and charter fishing       businessmen and women in regional fishery management       councils. These purported ``conflicts of interest'' are a       non-issue, as all regional fishery management councils       already enact standard operating procedures to address this       concern. Simply put, Amendment 26 is a direct assault on       commercial fishermen in these two regions and would only       serve to eliminate fishing expertise from regional fishery       management councils in order to further the interests of       recreational fishing organizations. This would be a       disservice to the millions of Americans who only access       American seafood though restaurants, fish markets, and       grocery stores.        Our nation has set the gold standard for sustainable       fisheries because of our commitment to science-based       management under the 2007 Magnuson-Stevens Act       reauthorization. The science-based conservation requirements       of the Magnuson-Stevens Act helped support the development of       the commercial individual fishing quota programs in the Gulf       of Mexico have played crucial roles in nearly tripling the       red snapper quota for all fishermen in the Gulf of Mexico       over the last 10 years, from 5 million pounds to nearly 14       million pounds. Clearly, the Magnuson-Stevens Act is working.        The nation's fishermen, seafood suppliers, consumers, and       Congressional leaders must protect the gains we have made       under the last 40 years of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. It is in       everyone's best interests to pass vibrant national fishery       resources on to the next generation. H.R. 200 would put that       in jeopardy. H.R. 200 is widely opposed by the commercial       fishing industry throughout the United States (especially in       the state of Florida), as well as by the seafood industry,       the restaurant industry, the charter fishing industry, and       others who depend on healthy fisheries to support strong       businesses. Once again, we ask that you oppose H.R. 200 to       ensure Americans have access to sustainable seafood today and       for years to come.        Thank you for your consideration on this important matter.            Sincerely,                                                       Eric Brazer,      Deputy Director.                                   ____                                     Gulf Fishermen's Association,                                                       July 2, 2018.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Democratic Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Democratic Leader Pelosi: Please       accept this letter from the Gulf Fishermen's Association       opposing H.R. 200, the ``Strengthening Fishing Communities       and Increasing Flexibility in Fisheries Management Act.'' The       Gulf Fisherman's Association represents commercial fishermen       in the Gulf of Mexico who are dependent upon healthy fishery       resources to support our way of life.        H.R. 200 is a threat to the success record of the Magnuson-      Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-      Stevens Act), weakening the science-based management that has       made the U.S. a leader in the field. The provisions within       H.R. 200 that will add exceptions to rebuilding timelines,       exemptions to annual catch limits, and mandate allocation       reviews are unnecessary. The Magnuson-Stevens Act in its       current form is working and is responsible for rebuilding       dozens of stocks. In fact, NOAA's Status of the Stocks       released in March showed that overfished stocks are at an       all-time low. Why change what's already working?        Additionally, Rep. Graves' Amendment 26 to H.R. 200 makes       it clear that this bill is being used to harm commercial       snapper and grouper fishermen in the Gulf of Mexico. This       amendment would open the door for additional taxation of       commercial fishermen through resource rents and royalties. It       also is an attempt to eliminate charter-for-hire and       commercial representation on the Gulf of Mexico and South       Atlantic Fishery Management Councils Council by unfairly       implying that they have a ``fiduciary conflict of interest''.       The language in this amendment makes us ask the following       questions:        Why is it reasonable to impose a tax on commercial       fishermen while at the same time eliminating their voice in       the decision-making process?        If commercial fishermen should not serve on the Gulf       Council because of a supposed financial ``conflict of       interest,'' why should marine suppliers and scientists whose       companies and universities have received funding from       recreational lobbying groups be able to serve?        In conclusion, H.R. 200 is not the fix for our fisheries       that it is advertised to be. It threatens to turn back the       clock on fisheries management and take us back to a time when       there was less fish for everyone. That hurts both commercial       and recreational fishermen. It would also damage the Council       system, which has been effective at creating regional       solutions for their fisheries. Lastly, this bill is a failure       in bi-partisanship, as evidenced  [[Page H6085]]       by a shortage of democratic co-sponsors and a lack of       consideration for all sectors of fisheries. It seeks to help       recreational fishermen at the expense of commercial fishermen       who work hard to provide this great country with wild       sustainable seafood. That's something the Gulf Fishermen's       Association cannot support and urge all representatives to       vote ``no'' on H.R. 200.        Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the       ``Strengthening Fishing Communities and Increasing       Flexibility in Fisheries Management Act.'' We hope that you       will take our concerns seriously and urge you to vote ``no''.            Sincerely,      Glen Brooks.                                   ____                                                       July 9, 2018.        Dear Representative: As leading manufacturers, retailers,       guides, outfitters and media serving the fly fishing       industry, we write to urge you to oppose H.R. 200, a bill       that threatens the health and abundance of marine fisheries.       H.R. 200, the ``Strengthening Fishing Communities and       Increasing Flexibility in Fisheries Management Act,'' would       amend the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and       Management Act (MSA). The MSA has been methodically       rebuilding fisheries decimated by once-rampant overfishing.       Since 2000, forty-four previously overfished stocks have been       fully rebuilt, and NOAA Fisheries just reported that the       number of overfished stocks is at an all-time low.        Thriving and healthy fish populations are at the heart of       our businesses, and saltwater fly fishing is a vibrant and       growing segment of our industry. The Magnuson-Stevens Act is       working as intended to maximize fishing opportunities while       ensuring the long-term sustainability of marine fisheries.       Yet the work is not done. While the science-based management       required under the Magnuson-Stevens Act has dramatically       reduced overfishing, fifteen percent (15%) of assessed       fisheries are still overfished. Now is the time to double-      down on our proven management system, not undermine it.        Unfortunately, H.R. 200 attacks the very provisions in the       Magnuson-Stevens Act that are responsible for putting       America's ocean fish on a secure path to full recovery. If       enacted, H.R. 200 would allow many different fisheries to be       exempted from the annual catch limits and accountability       measures identified by independent scientific bodies. Setting       clear, science-based limits on catch and enforcing those       limits is a hallmark of prudent management. H.R. 200 would       also undermine the recovery of fisheries by allowing       fisheries managers to relax timelines for rebuilding depleted       stocks. Healthy fisheries support the greatest number of       angling opportunities, and should be rebuilt as quickly as       possible, as currently directed by the Magnuson-Stevens Act.        Make no mistake, H.R. 200 seeks to undermine our       conservation progress in service of increasing short-term       economic gain. As successful business leaders, we assure you       that prioritizing the health of our nation's fishery       resources is the best way to invest in American businesses       like our own. We urge you to vote no on H.R. 200.

Dear Member of Congress: We understand that H.R. 200, the       ``Strengthening Fishing Communities and Increasing       Flexibility in Fisheries Management Act,'' is on the schedule       for floor debate and a vote on Wednesday afternoon The       Seafood Harvesters of America (SHA) remains staunchly opposed       to this bill as it would do very little to improve the       management of the recreational fishing industry while       severely undermining the sacrifices the commercial fishing       industry has made to ensure that we are sustainably       harvesting fisheries resources.        The Seafood Harvesters of America is a broadly-based       organization that represents commercial fishermen and their       associations. Our members reflect the diversity of America's       coastal communities, the complexity of our marine       environments, and the enormous potential of our commercial       fisheries. As domestic harvesters of an American public       resource, we recognize and embrace our stewardship       responsibility. We strive for accountability in our       fisheries, encourage others to do the same, and speak out on       issues of common concern that affect the U.S. commercial       fishing industry, the stewardship of our public resources,       and the many millions of Americans who enjoy seafood.        In addition to the threats posed by H.R. 200 as we've       outlined in previous letters (below), we are concerned with a       proposed amendment to H.R. 200 that will be debated during       the floor vote. Specifically, we are concerned with Amendment       #26 which directs the General Accountability Office to       develop a report to Congress on the ``resource rent'' of       Limited Access Privilege Programs (LAPPs) in the Gulf of       Mexico and Southeast, and examine ``fiduciary conflicts of       interest'' on these Regional Fishery Management Councils.       First, by studying only LAPPs without also studying       recreational fishing and non-LAPP fisheries, this language       unfairly singles out LAPPs and is aimed at attacking these       successful programs. Commercial fishermen already pay for       their commercial permits, quota, licenses, vessel       registration, business taxes, observer costs, among other       costs. On top of that, fishermen in LAPPs pay an additional       fee to recover costs of administering the program. There is       no reason to limit an analysis of the fishing value extracted       to LAPPs and such a biased analysis would lead to false       conclusions. Second, the Regional Fishery Management Councils       were purposely created to involve fishery stakeholders from       all sectors in the Council process to guide policy and       regulations. The process by which Council Members are       appointed is thorough and well-vetted, and already requires       financial disclosure of their fishing interests. This       language shows a misunderstanding of the Council structure       designed within the Magnuson-Stevens Act (MSA). Targeting       commercial and charter fishermen representatives on Councils       for these two regions would not only undermine the intended       Council appointment process to encourage stakeholder       participation in management of our fisheries resources, but       set a dangerous precedent for the rest of the country.        As we've outlined in our previous letters, the Harvesters       remain opposed to H.R 200 because of a number of sections       that pose a direct threat to sustainable fisheries       management:        (1) H.R. 200 risks overfishing and imperils rebuilding of       overfished species        Despite significant flexibility already incorporated into       the MSA, Section 303 establishes multiple exceptions to the       rebuilding timeline. Congress previously strengthened the       rebuilding timeline requirements because many fish stocks       were not recovering and were at risk of continued       overfishing. Without this statutory standard, rebuilding       timelines could vary dramatically, perpetuating depleted       stock conditions and harming our businesses' bottom lines.        Overfishing has been illegal since the MSA was first signed       into law in 1976, but the 2007 requirement for annual catch       limits (ACLs) truly put an end to the practice Section 204       waives the requirement for ACLs for a large number of       species, including virtually all bycatch species and many       fish that are caught in international waters, significantly       raising the risk of overfishing.        Repealing MSA Section 407 entirely (Section 306 in H.R.       200) would remove backstops against recreational quota       overages and allocations for Gulf of Mexico red snapper       which, combined with H.R. 200's sweeping ACL exemptions,       increases the risk of overfishing and makes it difficult for       management bodies to allocate quota to prevent quota       overages.        (2) H.R. 200 hinders Councils' ability to manage our       fishery resources        Councils already have the flexibility to conduct allocation       reviews as necessary, so requiring that the South Atlantic       and Gulf Councils conduct a review of commercial and       recreational allocations every 5 years (Section 202) is       duplicative, costly, and would effectively prevent these       Councils from having the time and money to manage the       resource (i.e. stock assessments, habitat management, among       other responsibilities).        Section 304 establishes a suite of procedures that would       make the use of Exempted Fishing Permits (EFPs) nearly       impossible, removing a pathway for Councils to work with       industry to develop and test innovative gear, fishing, and       management technologies aimed at improving resource       management. Additionally, this Section bans the use of EFPs       to test for Limited Access Privilege Programs (LAPPs).        (3) H.R. 200 would impose unnecessary Congressional       interference        Fishermen are deeply involved in the development of catch       share programs, which often take years of deliberation with       extensive public input. Under current law, Councils can       require referenda on these programs at their discretion.       Mandating additional referenda and specifying who should be       allowed to vote in them is unnecessarily intrusive to the       Council process and creates undue hurdles to catch share       development (Section 205). While we recognize that a catch       share program may not be appropriation for every fishery, we       feel strongly that this management tool should remain a       viable option        We are disappointed to see this bill move along near       partisan lines. The reauthorization of the MSA has       traditionally been a bipartisan effort that advances the       sustainability of our nation's fisheries. Instead,  [[Page H6086]]       what we see today is a partisan effort to advance the       interests of the recreational fishing industry at the expense       and to the detriment of the commercial fishing industry.        As thousands of commercial fishermen around the country       stand in opposition to this bill, we urge House Leadership to       reconsider bringing this bill to the House floor for a vote.       We are serve as a direct connection to the ocean for many       inland citizens and we take our responsibility as stewards of       the ocean very seriously. We stand ready to work with Mr.       Young and others to develop a bill that works for all sectors       and progresses fisheries management across the board.        We appreciate your consideration of our request. Please       reach out to our Executive Director, Leigh Habegger, should       you have any further questions.            Sincerely,                                              Christopher Brown,                                                          President,                                     Seafood Harvesters of America.

Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record this column  recently written by the head of the National Marine Fisheries Service  and also the chief scientist for the National Marine Fisheries Service  under the Bush administration.   I would like to call special attention to this statement by these  experts from the Bush administration, who say: ``We believe this is an  ill-conceived, dangerous piece of legislation that would undermine the  tremendous progress in fisheries rebuilding and sustainable management  that has occurred since the last reauthorization of the Magnuson- Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act in 2007.''              Don't Hurt Fisheries With Dangerous Legislation     (By William Hogarth and Steven Murawski, special to the Tampa Bay                                   Times)         This Wednesday the U.S. House of Representatives is       scheduled to vote on H.R. 200, the Strengthen Fishing       Communities and Increasing Flexibility in Fisheries       Management Act. We believe this is an ill-conceived,       dangerous piece of legislation that would undermine the       tremendous progress in fisheries rebuilding and sustainable       management that has occurred since the latest       reauthorizations of the Magnuson Stevens Fisheries       Conservation and Management Act in 2007.        Since 2007, more than 40 of the most overfished and       historically important fish stocks in the nation have been       recovered. Overfishing now occurs for fewer than 10 percent       of stocks, the lowest proportion since records have been       kept. Rebuilding stocks has resulted in increases in       fisheries yields and translated into lower prices to       consumers, more business-friendly approaches to commercial       fisheries management and more healthy recreational fisheries.        The term ``flexibility'' in H.R. 200 is a code word that       would undermine timely, effective management of stocks when       downturns inevitably occur. Heavy on requirements for studies       and other administrative requirements, H.R. 200 would make       fisheries management more cumbersome. The bill as written       would delay timely, effective conservation responses and       would limit the flexibility to use innovative management       tools. Healthy fisheries without healthy stocks is a non       sequitur. We urge the House to reject this piece of       legislation that seeks to solve problems that simply do not       exist.     Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, supporters of this bill argue that the requirement to  rebuild overfished stocks needs more ``flexibility,'' but it is  important to note that the Magnuson Act already provides a lot of  flexibility.   While I am fully aware that it isn't always easy or popular to  implement fishing restrictions, management tools like annual catch  limits and rebuilding plans are essential to ensuring a future for our  fisheries and fishing industry.   In my district, fishermen went through several tough years while  groundfish stocks were depleted. Magnuson provided the scientific and  regulatory framework to bring those fisheries back. We have now rebuilt  half of our groundfish species, and more are on the way to recovery.   These accomplishments certainly did not come easily. Our fishermen  had to make sacrifices. But the long-term health of our fisheries and  communities that depend on them in making these tough decisions has  benefited from it. That is why these decisions were supported by  commercial and recreational fishermen. That support has been integral  to sustaining the fisheries that are critical for West Coast  communities. This success story, by the way, has been replicated around  the country time and again.   Our success and the sustainability of the fishing industry rely on  harvesting from healthy and productive fish stocks. Fishing  restrictions are only put in place because they are absolutely  necessary. If there aren't enough fish to support strong harvests both  now and in the future, we have no choice but to cut back in order to  avoid the tragedy of the commons.   It is important to note that the law allows councils to delay  rebuilding when the biology of the stock, environmental conditions, or  international management considerations present challenges. Because of  these broad but fair exemptions, more than 50 percent of all overfished  stocks today have rebuilding plans that are longer than the 10-year  baseline in the act. So there is flexibility, and it is being used.   Further, current law gives councils 2 years to put a rebuilding plan  in place and another year to reduce rather than end overfishing. That  is 3 years of lead time before significant harvest restrictions go into  effect.   My amendment requires that an exemption to strong rebuilding  timelines would only be permitted if rebuilding plans have at least a  75 percent chance of success. That is contrasted with the 50 percent  chance of success that ordinarily applies to rebuilding plans.   Now, I am proud that, without being required to do so, most of the  West Coast groundfish fishery recovery plans have a greater than 75  percent chance of meeting their rebuilding goals, and we have seen the  success of that. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of all the  regions.   The bottom line is that we should not be weakening standards unless  we have a very robust rebuilding plan in place. That is what this  amendment addresses.   I want to note that, in addition to all of that, the current Magnuson  Act requires a rebuilding timeline be as short as possible. H.R. 200  would change that requirement to be as short as practicable. This is a  very problematic weakening of the law, with real consequences.   Currently, the agency has to do whatever is possible, whatever is  feasible. Practicable is a lower standard. It means the stocks would  not be built in a reasonable timeframe, and this change could even  allow the agency to do little or nothing to rebuild a stock.   History has shown us what happens if we don't do that. We need to  tackle rebuilding aggressively in order to succeed. Rebuilding plans  that take a weak approach to harvest or drag on rebuilding for many  years inevitably fail.   So, unless the law is very clear and strong on this point, managers  could choose not to deal with rebuilding situations proactively. My  amendment addresses this to be sure that we continue to see fish stocks  rebuild so that fishermen can ultimately reap the rewards.   Mr. Chairman, I request an ``aye'' vote, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment  because it would set a bad precedent by waiving the requirements to  provide compensatory mitigation for federally authorized maintenance  dredging projects in inland waterways, inlets, or harbors located in  North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.   As it should, Magnuson requires compensatory mitigation to protect  essential fish habitat, including seagrass. This mitigation requires  the restoration, establishment, enhancement, and/or preservation of  aquatic resources to offset unavoidable adverse impacts from activities  like dredging.   Many of the inland waterways in the Southeast that need maintenance  dredging are actually home to seagrasses, so these States are required  to mitigate the negative impacts. Compensatory mitigation is the most  obvious, commonsense solution for offsetting the damage to these  important habitats.   Fish depend on healthy seagrass habitats to survive and reproduce,  not only in the Southeast but all across the Nation's coasts, including  in my district.   Moreover, we need all the help that we can get to recover seagrasses.  Globally, 30 percent of seagrass meadows have disappeared. Of the  seagrasses that remain, nearly a quarter are threatened or near  threatened. In fact, the only marine plant listed as endangered in the  United States is a seagrass found in Florida.   Seagrasses are highly productive hotspots for biodiversity and can  act as a carbon sink, making this habitat a critical component in  buffering oceans against the impacts of climate change. Protecting and  restoring essential fish habitat and seagrass is very important to  maintain productive fisheries and healthy oceans.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I will close by stating that I can  appreciate the frustration that the gentleman may be feeling, feeling  like this is a process of remitigating for the same thing over and over  again.   I think it is a little more complicated than that, but if the  gentleman is willing to work going forward on some ways to perhaps  consolidate the regulatory burden and find something for the long term  that provides a little more certainty and streamlining, I would be  happy to work with him on that.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, regrettably, I rise in opposition to the  amendment offered by my friend, Mr. Graves. This amendment requires the  Comptroller General to submit a report to Congress, but it is unclear  what the overall purpose of this report would be.   In fact, because of the vagueness of that purpose, there has been  concern that it may be about identifying what would happen if the  overall value of the red snapper fishery commercial quota was  completely taken away or given to private anglers. Would this report be  used to make the argument that the red snapper quota should be  reallocated to recreational fishermen? I can't support either of those  propositions, nor a reporting requirement with such ambiguous goals and  potentially significant impacts on the fishery.   When it comes to setting these allocations, picking winners and  losers from among commercial and recreational fishing interests, that  should be the job of regional councils, not of Congress. In fact, the  entire structure of Magnuson and the council system is designed to  encourage stakeholder participation on the councils, from a regional  perspective.   We need to let the fishery management councils do their job and not  have Congress micromanaging these type of decisions.   It is unclear, also, why this amendment only targets limited access  privilege permits. Every type of commercial or recreational fishing  activity could be viewed as having a ``resource rent.'' So it is  questionable that every other form of commercial and recreational  activity would be excluded from this type of report. There is no reason  why an analysis of the economic value commercial and recreational  fishermen extract from a Federal resource would be limited to just  catch share programs.   Finally, with respect to the conflict of interest provisions in this  bill, I would have supported--and I have talked to the gentleman about  this--this amendment, had it been a report on ways to eliminate  conflicts of interest on all fishery management councils, because there  are concerns, bipartisan concerns, in that regard, and it is something  that should be addressed to improve fishery management in all councils.   Unfortunately, this seems to be a rather targeted and direct attack  on what many view as a well-managed commercial red snapper fishery, and  we should not be devoting public resources to such a report.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, we are not opposed.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I do rise in opposition to this amendment  offered by the gentleman from New York. This is an amendment that would  lift the ban on striped bass fishing in the Block Island transit zone  between Montauk, New York, and Block Island, Rhode Island.   Commercial and recreational fishing is allowed in State waters, as  the gentleman said, from shore to 3 miles offshore. Striped bass is  managed by the States from Maine through North Carolina through the  Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission.   Federal waters have been closed to striped bass fishing since 1990  when a moratorium went into effect to protect juvenile fish entering  the spawning population and to help rebuild a fishery that was  recovering from decades of overfishing.   There has been an ongoing effort to reopen the striped bass fishery  in the transit zone, yet there is no science to justify it. In  contrast, the science shows that allowing fishing in this transit zone,  which encompasses about 155 square miles of habitat, could  disproportionately impact spawning females and, thus, threaten the  overall health of the striped bass stock.  [[Page H6094]]    This would be detrimental to some of biggest recreational and  commercial fishing ports on the East Coast. Opening up Federal waters  in one region would undermine the protections and commitment to  rebuilding that others along the coast have invested in. It would set a  bad precedent in managing the striped bass fishery, which still has a  long way to go.   Finally, Congress should not be legislating on species-specific  fishery management actions. This issue is regularly assessed by the  Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission. We need to let that  commission do its job and make decisions that are based on science.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, these certainly are arguments that can and  should be made at the Atlantic Council. In fact, they are made  regularly, and that council has representation regionally, has  representation from all the key stakeholders, and has access to the  best available science, the state-of-the-art science on this issue. So  I think we need to let that council do its job, and, with that, I  request a ``no'' vote.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
