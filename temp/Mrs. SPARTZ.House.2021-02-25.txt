 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 5, the  so-called Equality Act.   Unfortunately, this is another bill which did not go through the  committee process or real debate.   The Judiciary Committee should have had an opportunity to consider  H.R. 5 in a legislative hearing. Sadly, this is the first time we are  debating, just hours before it is set to receive a vote, with no  ability to propose any amendments. I am not sure why we even bother to  have committees if we  [[Page H639]]  are passing significant legislation without them.    I would just like to highlight three major concerns.   Concern number one: Broad scope. And I agree with the gentleman from  New York, there are some protections that already exist. Last year, the  issue of possible employment discrimination of gay and transgender  individuals was addressed by the Supreme Court in an opinion written by  Justice Gorsuch. But this bill has very sweeping changes with potential  major adverse implications for religious freedoms and women's rights  and safety.   Concern number two: Broad and ambiguous definition of gender  identity. This language can have unintended consequences and be taken  advantage of by criminals or sexual predators. Also, the safety of  women in prisons, juvenile detention facilities, and domestic violence  shelters could be put at risk, which would force them to share  traditionally women-only spaces with biological men, even if a  biological male fraudulently gains access.   Concern number three: Opportunities and safety for female athletes.  The science is clear, men are biologically stronger than women.   According to a 2019 Duke University study that involved dozens of  specialists in sports science and medicine: ``Biological males and  biological females are materially different with respect to main  physical attributes that contribute to elite athletic performance.''   The Women's Sports Policy Working Group--a group of champion female  athletes and academics--has stated that even when height, size, and  weight are equal, males are incrementally stronger and generate more  explosive force so that if males and females are forced to compete  against each other, the physical safety of females is differently at  risk.   The reality has already shown itself to be harmful to the  opportunities and safety of female athletes. For example, a female  track athlete in Connecticut lost potential scholarships after being  pushed out of qualifying for regional track meet spots by two  transgender athletes. A transgender MMA fighter caused significant  damage to a female athlete's skull.   These examples demonstrate the far-reaching consequences this bill  can have on women and girls, should it become law.   American women have worked very hard to secure our rights for many  years, and just last year we celebrated 100 years of women's suffrage.  But this is a giant step back. Perhaps if this body had actually  deliberated over this bill and engaged the proper legislative process,  these concerns could have been addressed.   A vote for the Equality Act in its current form is a vote against  religious freedom, against women, against female athletes, against  incarcerated women, and against science and safety. A vote ``yes'' on  this bill is a vote against our daughters.                                time  1345
