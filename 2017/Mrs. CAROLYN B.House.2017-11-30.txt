 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, last week we lost  one of the finest people ever to serve the people of New York State and  the country when Congressman Maurice Hinchey passed away.   I would like to express my deepest condolences to his wife, Ilene;  his sons, Reese and Josef; his daughter, Michelle; and the entire  Hinchey family.   Maurice leaves behind a legacy of service that is second to none.  During his 18 years in the New York State Assembly, he became what  former Governor Mario Cuomo called ``the environmental conscience of  New York State'' for his groundbreaking investigations into polluters  and landmark environmental laws.   When he came to Congress in 1993, he continued that work, creating  the Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area, preserving wild public  lands, and doing everything possible to clean and protect his beloved  Hudson River.   Maurice and I came to Congress in the same class and we became fast  friends. I already miss him dearly, but I know that his work and his  legacy will be remembered for generations to come. To know him was to  love him.   Rest in peace, my dear friend.                            ____________________
