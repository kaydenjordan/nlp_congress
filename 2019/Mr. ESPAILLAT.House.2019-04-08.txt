 Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for this opportunity to  speak. I thank Representative Clyburn for allowing me a few minutes to  address a pressing issue before he assumes control of this Special  Order hour.   Last week, the President of the United States made politically  motivated announcements that he will seek to cut U.S. aid to Honduras,  Guatemala, and El Salvador, which together are commonly known and  referred to as the Northern Triangle countries. In making his decision,  the President cited asylum seekers--moms, children, seniors, and young  men--who make up the migration patterns from these nations that reflect  themselves at the southern border.   As it turns out, Mr. Speaker, I was in the region with some of my  colleagues from both sides of the aisle when the President articulated  his plan to freeze foreign aid for this part of the world. This aid has  effectively helped curb violence in El Salvador, forge economic hope,  and furnish essential health and education programs there as well.   While on this trip with key members of the Foreign Affairs and  Judiciary Committees, we met with leaders from the region and El  Salvador and discussed the relationship between the United States and  their respective countries with great optimism.   I will admit, Mr. Speaker, the manner in which our President views  and discusses our regional partners stands in stark contrast to the  security objectives and economic commonalities we discussed with his  Central American counterparts.   When our President rambles on about ``evil people'' pouring into our  country and the millions and millions of dollars we are just giving  these governments, comments that are not only racist in scope but  patently false, he fails to understand that this very aid is our best  approach and our best tool in addressing the migration patterns to the  southern border.   With our assistance, these countries can make tangible progress  toward building an environment where their citizens feel safe, industry  prospers, and people receive the essential services they need and  deserve.                                time  1945    When my colleagues and I were in Mexico, a country that perhaps has  received more of the President's verbal attacks than any other country  in the world, we discussed budding economic zones in the country and  the sweeping development initiatives its new President Lopez Obrador  has undertaken.   We discussed the fact that less than 12 percent of the folks going  back from the southern border to their countries of birth are from  Mexico.   We discussed the curtains of economic development that the Mexican  President plans to put forward--not a wall, curtains of economic  development: a rail line in the Mayan coast; reforestation of the  southern border of Mexico; and infrastructure, very ambitious  infrastructure projects close to the northern border.   Perhaps we should look at that as a guide to what we should do here  in our Nation.   And having conversations about shutting down our border as we were  there was not something very positive for our visit.   In El Salvador, we met with ambitious, 38-year-old President-elect  Nayib Bukele. He detailed his intentions to work more closely with the  United States, specifically, to review and reevaluate Chinese influence  and an agreement with China that he has inherited from the previous  government.   He also informed us that, because of our help, Mr. Speaker, homicide  has gone down 50 percent in El Salvador. At one point, 104 people per  100,000 people were being killed, the highest homicide rate in the  world. It is now down 50 percent--still a war zone, but down 50  percent. Young people are being recruited away from the gangs.   What they really need now is a shot in the arm for economic  development and jobs. That is what will help with the migration  patterns that reflect themselves at the southern border.   And this young President has captured the enthusiasm of the young  people. He campaigned against corruption and violence; yet, while we  were there, the President threatened to cut the aid to El Salvador.   In fact, we should take what we did there to Guatemala and Honduras,  because it is working.   And it is clear, Mr. Speaker, that this is all summed up that the  President fails to share our optimism that collaboration will lead to a  solution in this region.   He fails to register the miserable motivations that would prompt  somebody to seek refuge for their families in an unknown country  thousands and thousands of miles away. People just don't get up and  leave their families and neighborhoods. They do that because they are  facing violence, because they are facing abject poverty, because they  are facing natural disasters.   The President fails to understand that. He fails to understand, Mr.  Speaker, that Chinese and Russian influence in Central America is  growing and that every step we take backwards will result in two steps  forward for them and will leave a vacuum of leadership in the region.   Right now, the President is simply failing--failing the American  people and failing our allies.   I look forward to reviewing this issue this week when the Foreign  Affairs Committee holds a hearing on the administration's failed  policies in Central America.   We must hold him accountable.   Mr. Speaker, I again want to thank Whip Clyburn for allowing me some  time to address this issue on behalf of the Congressional Hispanic  Caucus in lieu of our monthly Special Order hour, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
