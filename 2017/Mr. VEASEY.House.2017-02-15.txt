 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, we are going to talk today about something  very important: our economy, jobs, and the state of America in regards  to those subject matters.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the State of South  Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), who is a good friend of mine, our colleague,  and our assistant leader, to come address us on a very important issue  that relates to many of those things that we talk about.   I would like to invite Leader Clyburn to come and talk to today. I  really appreciate his coming and taking the time to be part of this  hour.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the leader for his comments  and for participating tonight. I really appreciate his words and that  recognition.   I want to thank everyone that is with us today to talk about our Blue  Collar Caucus and jobs in this country. I think that there is nothing  more important to any individual--any man or woman--than the ability to  be able to have a good job, to take care of your family, and to be able  to be a part of the American economy and to contribute to that economy.   I want to start off talking about President Barack Obama. Under  President Barack Obama, the American economy added 9.3 million jobs and  overcame one of the worst economic crises our Nation has ever seen.   In Arlington, Texas, which is part of the district that I represent  in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, we have a General Motors plant. As you  know, we could have lost our car industry. We have probably the most  profitable plant in the General Motors family. All of the cars that you  see around here at the Capitol, all of the Yukons, all of the  Suburbans, the Tahoes, the Escalades, we make those in Arlington,  Texas. We are very proud of our plant, very proud of the company being  there all those years and for the UAW workers there that help make that  plant great.   Despite the gains that we have seen with President Obama's saving the  auto industry with the 9.3 million jobs and our overcoming one of the  worst economic crises, again, that our country has ever seen, many  workers across the U.S. felt that the economic recovery had left them  behind. The rise of automation and outsourcing pushed many of those  workers out of jobs that they absolutely loved. The frustration felt by  these workers is understandable. Everyone--everyone--wants a good job  that lets them, for their family, be able to take care of themselves,  be able to pay their bills, send their kids to college, and buy a car.    President Trump appealed to many blue-collar workers during his  campaign with a populist message and pledges to help working America,  but his actions since taking office directly contradict so many of his  promises. President Trump is playing one of the slickest political  scams we have ever seen on hardworking American families. It is a scam.  It is not real.   On his first day in office, President Trump signed an executive order  that raised mortgage rates for new homeowners. Those same people that  live in those Rust Belt States are those same individuals that were  Democrats that went on television and went on social media and said  they were going to give this guy a chance. What does he do on the very  first day? We are going to raise interest rates on new homeowners,  people trying to live the American Dream. There is nothing more that  embodies the American Dream than being able to buy that first home. It  was a slap in the face to those blue-collar workers and a boost to Wall  Street.   President Trump also signed an executive order that made it easier  for Wall Street bankers to make money on risky bets. His Labor and his  Treasury Cabinet nominees both have track records that are very  unfriendly to the middle class and have no understanding what middle  class workers face.   It is clear that President Trump does not have a plan to fight for  the working man and woman as he promised on the campaign trail. That is  why my colleagues and I--Brendan Boyle who is here with me from the  State of Pennsylvania, we formed the Blue Collar Caucus to address  challenges facing  [[Page H1226]]  blue-collar workers in today's economy. We are going to stand up to the  Trump administration when he turns his back on working class America.   Our mission is to listen directly to middle class America's concerns  and translate their needs into policies that allow them to adapt to the  changing job market. We have to be able to equip our blue-collar  workers with training that leads to jobs and opportunities. We just  can't say ``job training.'' Those training opportunities have to lead  to something of substance, which is a real job with a paycheck and some  benefits.   This year alone, the U.S. is expected to add 2.5 million middle-skill  jobs, the majority of which employers are telling me--and they have  been to my office, and Mr. Boyle has probably heard the same thing.  They are saying that these jobs are hard to fill. The Blue Collar  Caucus is going to prioritize training and retraining initiatives to  provide real opportunity and security to working class Americans.   I have a lot more to say, but I do want to turn it over to Brendan  Boyle from Pennsylvania, my good friend, who also has the same passion  to represent and really stand up for working class America, for blue- collar America--not just promise them things, not just get them pumped  up with a bunch of hype, but to really talk about real policy  initiatives that will help them be able to put some food on the table,  put some money in the bank, be able to buy that first house and buy  that car that they always wanted. I thank the gentleman very much for  his dedication to blue-collar America.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the State of  Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch).                                time  1745     Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Brendan F. Boyle).    One of the things I remember growing up in Fort Worth,  Texas, was that we were blessed to have several manufacturing  facilities that were union shops. We had General Dynamics, which is now  Lockheed Martin. When I was growing up, it had about 30,000 employees  out there.   We had Bell Helicopter, which is owned by Textron now. There are lots  of employees out there. We had Miller Brewing Company, which is still  there. Now it is MillerCoors. We had several places, like General  Motors, which I think I mentioned a little bit earlier.   So we had several places that had good benefit. I had family members  that worked at many of those places. Good benefits, good jobs that  people could really be proud of. One of the reasons why we have seen  the decline of pay in this country is because of the Republicans and  their efforts to undermine labor.   When you start talking about undermining labor and when you turn on  these talk radio shows--you turn on The Rush Limbaugh Show, you turn on  Mark Levin, you turn on these shows--they are always talking about how  bad unions are in this country. But when I think about my own  experience growing up in Fort Worth and I think about towns like White  Settlement; towns like Benbrook; the community that I grew up in, Stop  Six and Como; and I think about the middle class jobs that many of  these union shops brought to all communities, again, whether it was the  White community, the Hispanic community, or Black, they allowed people  to be able to put some food on the table.   I have got to tell you, I was really kind of tickled and shocked at  the same time by an article in the opinion section in The Wall Street  Journal back on September 3, 2015. It was titled: ``The Shop Steward in  the White House.'' It was taking a shot at President Obama for all of  the things that he was doing for American workers, and many of the  things that the Wall Street guy that wrote the article was complaining  about, saying all these things about President Obama, they were all  actually really good things that the President was advocating for.   My question and what I want to know and what I want Rust Belt workers  and people all around the country to ask: Is this Presidency, is this  administration going to embody and really embrace those same principles  that were talked about for President Obama when he was really trying to  protect these workers? Is this President going to do the same thing?  Are his partners in the legislative branch, our colleagues on the other  side of the aisle, the Senators on the other side of the Capitol that  are Republicans, are they going to also stop going after American  wages, stop going after American workers and their benefits, and start  standing up for these workers so they can put some more food on the  table?   That is what I want to know. Those are the type of questions that we  should be asking and we should be talking about.   President Trump can put out a statement on this right now if he  wanted to, but obviously he has a lot of other things going on.   The Davis-Bacon Act, as many of us know, is the rule that ensures all  Federal contractors are paid a fair wage while they are working on  public works projects.   If there was ever a repeal of Davis-Bacon, we would see a decrease in  the quality of blue-collar jobs, and we can absolutely not afford that.  Stagnating wages, like I talked a little bit about earlier, has left  workers unable to care for their families. As a result, one-third of  blue-collar families are enrolled in one or more social safety net  program.   That is not what blue-collar workers want. They want the ability to  be able to take care of their own families. They don't want these  social safety net programs. They want to be providers and be proud of  their jobs.   The Blue Collar Caucus intends to defend the Davis-Bacon Act and  fight any attempts to decrease wages for America's already struggling  working class. We know that we can build an economy that works for  everybody if we just work together. So work with us as we stand against  President Trump's unfulfilled promises and stand up for these blue- collar workers. That is what we want our friends on the other side of  the aisle to do.   But what I would really like to see right now, even before President  Trump reaches out to, again, his Republican friends in the legislative  branch, is for him to come out and make a statement for these blue- collar workers, for these people in the Rust Belt, for these people in  the South, for these people in Dallas-Fort Worth, and all over the  country. I want him to come out and make a statement on where he stands  on Davis-Bacon.                                time  1800    It is one thing to just talk in broad categories about bringing jobs  back to  [[Page H1228]]  our country, stopping our jobs from going overseas. This is an actual  policy that we know has been good for many workers in Mr. Boyle's  district and in mine and, again, everywhere. Where is the President on  this issue? Why is he not saying anything about Davis-Bacon? I want to  hear what he has to say. I know that Mr. Boyle knows about just how  important things like Davis-Bacon are and other issue areas are.   Another area is the Supreme Court nominee, Mr. Gorsuch. Where is he  going to rule when it comes to working families? That is what I want to  know. That is the type of thing that I hope that people on the factory  floors and shops across this country start talking about is how is this  man going to rule? We already know that he has made several bad rulings  as it relates to working families, rulings that will directly affect  how big their paychecks are, literally has made rulings that have taken  money right out of their pockets, right out of their bank accounts.  Those are the types of things that we need to be talking about, not all  this 35,000-feet-up-in-the-air-type stuff, but actual policy details  that we know can impact and hurt families.    Absolutely. When I am back in the district in the Dallas- Fort Worth area--and Dallas and Fort Worth are the two most  recognizable cities that I represent in the district, but there are  other cities. We have Irving that is there, we have Grand Prairie, we  have Arlington where the Cowboys stadium is located, and a lot of  people are asking: When are we going to get these good jobs back? We  want to see some of these good jobs come back. I have got to tell you,  the President made a lot of promises when he was on the campaign trail  about bringing some of these jobs back, and I want to see those jobs  come back, too.   I think that with everything going on right now, with the resignation  of General Flynn and there being so much talk about campaign operatives  on the Trump campaign talking to Russian intelligence officials, I  think that he is going to be too distracted to help these workers. I  think that Republicans are going to be too distracted to help these  workers in the Rust Belt, to help these middle class, these blue-collar  workers.   I have got to tell you, during our retreat last week while we were in  Baltimore, I opened up The Wall Street Journal first thing in the  morning. I saw this article about how--and it was about jobs still  pouring in to Mexico, and it was really one of the saddest things that  I ever read. For some manufacturers, Mexico is still the best move.  They specifically were talking about a corporation called the Rexnord  Corporation.   It really broke my heart when I was reading the articles about how  they were asking the workers at this plant  [[Page H1229]]  in America, in our country, to actually train individuals from foreign  countries to replace them. They wanted them to train them for the jobs  that they currently had here in our country and asking them to, you  know, train these people so we can ship your job out of the country and  you can be replaced. How demoralizing to go to work knowing that you  are training someone next to you for your job to be sent overseas or  sent out of the country, your livelihood, everything that you have  known. For a lot of these little, small towns, these companies really  are the face of the town.   In Texas, and I am sure it is like this in Indiana and in other parts  of the Rust Belt and other parts of blue-collar America, Friday night  football is a really big deal, maybe the local high school basketball  game is a really big deal, but also that ranks right up there with both  of those two athletic activities in these towns, their identity is  driven by their job. I thought that was such a sad commentary about  where we are now.   Again, with all of the executive orders, when you start talking about  the travel ban on citizens from Muslim countries, when you start  talking about the executive order to raise interest rates on first-time  homeowners, no executive orders whatsoever to protect the American  worker. We are a month into the administration. No executive order, no  action, no comments on Davis-Bacon, nothing to reinforce the fact that  we are with these guys, and it is really sad.   I am sure that these workers out there, in America, in New Jersey, in  other States, I bet you they are sitting back watching, saying: How in  the world is this President going to help us with all of the  distractions that are going on over there? When is he going to help us?  He has done all these other things with the executive order, why not do  something for the American worker?    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. Norcross).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Norcross). I really appreciate his heartfelt words. I thank him for  telling us about his journey, employment, and how much electricians  mean to this country, and other people that work with their hands.   I think it is sad that in a lot of our public schools that type of  work has  [[Page H1230]]  been--quite frankly, there is no other way to say it--some of it has  been put down. But those workers are important. We need to stop having  people rank jobs and make sure that we know that all jobs in this  country are important.   Since 2000, the United States has lost about 4.8 million  manufacturing jobs. That is a 29 percent decrease in jobs for blue- collar workers. Again, manufacturing jobs are good-paying jobs.  Manufacturing jobs pay about 20 percent higher than service jobs do. So  any manufacturing job that we lose in this country is bad.   One of the saddest stories--and there are so many sad stories about  these plants that have closed down, and so much of the focus has been  on the Rust Belt, and rightfully so. And Marcy Kaptur may tell me if I  am pronouncing the name of this city correctly. But there is a story  about the closing of a Rubbermaid facility in a place called Wooster,  W-O-O-S-T-E-R. They said that they were shutting down this Rubbermaid  facility in Wooster, Ohio, but they were going to keep the big outlet  mall open. And I thought to myself: How in the world can people afford  to go to the outlet mall, or any shop, if the jobs are gone? It is just  another sad story about how America is losing manufacturing jobs.   Luckily, we have people like the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur),  who fights for her State and fights for manufacturing jobs, and not  just in her State, but for the entire country.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Kaptur for her dedication to the working  class men and women in this country and for all blue-collar workers.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Kaptur and everybody  that has participated tonight.   I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
