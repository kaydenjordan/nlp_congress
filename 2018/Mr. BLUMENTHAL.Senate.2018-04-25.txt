 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize  Carolyn Lumsden, who received the Sigma Delta Chi Award from the  Society of Professional Journalists.   Ms. Lumsden, an opinion editor for the Hartford Courant, wrote an  editorial series last year which revealed the breadth of the crumbling  concrete foundations issue in northeastern Connecticut. Her work,  ``Crumbling Foundations,'' gave a thorough look at this tragic  situation where hundreds, potentially tens of thousands, of homes have  foundations that need to be replaced because the concrete contains an  iron sulfide that ultimately weakens the structure. Through her months  of research, Ms. Lumsden spoke with homeowners, engineers, geologists,  data analysts, bankers, and lawyers to understand the complete scope of  this problem.   ``Crumbling Foundations'' initiated much-needed, positive progress  for the people of Connecticut, thanks in part to the data and personal  testimonies Ms. Lumsden gathered. In the months following the series'  publishing, the Internal Revenue Service approved tax breaks for  homeowners, and the State of Connecticut approved $100 million in  bonding over 5 years to help the homeowners suffering from crumbling  foundations. I am working, along with my congressional delegation  colleagues, on additional Federal relief to homeowners and funding for  research into pyrrhotite.   Ms. Lumsden's dedication to using her position as a journalist to  assist the people of Connecticut is deeply admirable. For over 200  years, the American press has uncovered and reported vital information  to the public about our communities. Thanks to ``Crumbling  Foundations,'' our State is now acutely aware of this significant  tragedy and is working actively to find a solution.   I applaud her tireless efforts to uncover the truth of this problem  and hope my colleagues will join me in congratulating Ms. Lumsden on  her well-earned honor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am here to talk about money in  politics and, even more insidiously and potentially perniciously, money  in government.   The money in politics begins with the President's nominee to be  Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo. I suggest to my colleagues that they  read an article that appeared in opensecrets.org from the Center for  Responsive Politics. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the  Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:     [OpenSecrets.org, Center for Responsive Politics, March 24, 2018]           Trump Picks Top Koch Recipient for Secretary of State                   (By Megan Janetsky and Matthew Kelly)         President Trump nixed Rex Tillerson as secretary of state       Tuesday in favor of CIA Director Mike Pompeo, a former Kansas       congressman whose political career was paved by Koch       Industries.        Headquartered in Pompeo's former Wichita district, the       privately held company run by conservative megadonors Charles       and David Koch has funneled more money to the Trump pick than       any other federal politician.        The oil-and-gas conglomerate built a reputation for using a       network of ``dark money'' to exert political influence and       was Pompeo's top donor over the course of his former       congressional career.        That ``in'' may work to the advantage of the Koch brothers,       who hold a significant interest in global affairs, especially       with Trump's recently imposed tariffs.                          TOP DONORS TO MIKE POMPEO                              [Career Totals] ------------------------------------------------------------------------                           Donor                                Total ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Koch Industries.........................................        $400,500 Textron.................................................         $79,810 Mull Drilling...........................................         $70,350 Club for Growth.........................................         $64,817 Ritchie Exploration.....................................         $55,954 INTRUST Bank............................................         $55,300 McCoy Petroleum.........................................         $52,550 AT&T....................................................         $51,250 Cox Enterprises.........................................         $47,300 Emprise Bank............................................         $44,555 ------------------------------------------------------------------------         Since his first bid for Congress in 2010, Pompeo has       received $400,500 from Koch Industries--$335,500 from       individual employee contributions and $65,000 from its       corporate PAC, Center for Responsive Politics data shows.        Each election cycle leading up to his confirmation as CIA       director in 2017, Pompeo led all federal politicians in Koch-      related donations. He's also received more money from the oil       interest than any candidate since 1989.        Trump's announcement came in a surprise tweet Tuesday       morning, adding Tillerson to a growing list of White House       officials to unceremoniously leave the administration.        Tillerson thanked members of the State Department in a news       conference that afternoon, saying ``the world needs selfless       leaders such as these.''        ``I will address a few administrative matters related to my       departure and work towards a smooth and orderly transition       for secretary of state-designate, Mike Pompeo,'' Tillerson       told reporters.        Pompeo's relationship with the Kochs has held strong over       the years. In 2014, when he faced a tough primary challenge,       the Koch-funded Americans for Prosperity group spent over       $409,000 supporting Pompeo.        Other congressional leaders who trailed Pompeo in career       donations from Koch Industries include House Speaker Paul       Ryan (R-Wis.) with $274,172 and Senate Majority Leader Mitch       McConnell (R-Ky.) with $148,350.        But Pompeo's ties to the Koch brothers predate his       political career.        He used investments from the Koch empire to help kick-start       a Wichita-based company, Thayer Aerospace. After leaving the       company, Pompeo acted as head of Sentry International, an oil       drilling manufacturer with Koch ties.        Those investments seem to have paid off.        When Pompeo entered Congress, he brought with him a former       Koch Industries lawyer as his chief of staff. Within his       first week on the job, Pompeo proposed measures considered       top legislative priorities for Koch Industries.        The proposals included cutting funding for an Environmental       Protection Agency registry of greenhouse-gas polluters and a       database of consumer complaints about unsafe products, The       Washington Post reported.        Along with Koch support, Pompeo has been bankrolled by       other oil-and-gas interests, including Textron, Mull Drilling       and McCoy Petroleum. The industry has given him a total of       $1.2 million, the most by any industry, CRP data shows.        Now Pompeo enters the role of the White House's chief       diplomat, a position that can affect the financial interests       of multinational companies.

Senate..............        $148,350 ------------------------------------------------------------------------         The Koch brothers already have a broad international       presence. According to the company's website, Koch companies       alone ``employ more than 120,000 people across about 60       countries.''        While Pompeo has yet to take a stance on Trump's recently       rolled out tariffs, Charles Koch harshly rejected them,       saying in a press release last week that ``History is filled       with examples of administrations that implemented trade       restrictions with devastating results.''        ``One might assume that, as head of Koch Industries--a       large company involved in many industries, including steel--I       would applaud such import tariffs because they would be to       our immediate and financial benefit,'' he wrote. ``Corporate       leaders must reject this type of short-term thinking, and we       have.''        Late last year, the Charles Koch Foundation embarked on a       multimillion-dollar project to promote the realist school of       foreign policy in programs at elite universities such as       Harvard, Notre Dame and the Massachusetts Institute of       Technology.        Koch is an outspoken libertarian when it comes to foreign       policy, and the realist school of foreign policy champions       restraint on the world stage and taking a backseat on       humanitarian intervention and nation-building.    The article has the headline ``Trump picks top Koch  recipient for secretary of state.'' The article says that ``former  Kansas congressman whose political career was paved by Koch  Industries'' received more money than others in similar situations.   The reasons to vote against Mike Pompeo are many, but one of the  principal ones is that he was one of the chief recipients of money from  the Koch brothers or their organizations. In fact, since his first bid  for Congress in 2010, Pompeo has received $400,000 from Koch  Industries, $335,000 from employee contributions, and $65,000 from its  corporate PAC, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.   The Pompeo nomination is a poster boy for the impact of money in  politics, the influence of the Koch brothers on this administration,  and the enduring effect of campaign contributions, of influence-buying  and pettiness in government.   The Koch brothers are blatantly using their influence in the Trump  administration to advance an agenda based on their own self-interests  at the expense of our democracy, and they have reached into the  uppermost levels and echelons of this administration through  individuals they have supported over years and years, such as Mike  Pompeo.   In July of 2015, 2 weeks before he kicked off his campaign for  President, the President said through a tweet: ``I really like the Koch  Brothers (members of my [Palm Beach] Club), but I don't want their  money or anything else from them. Cannot influence Trump!'' Well, they  are good friends. They are members of the club. And nobody can deny  their influence on Donald Trump, their impact on this administration,  or their enduring reaches and effects on public policy.   If you have ever wondered where Republican ideological positions  originated on lowering corporate taxes, undercutting healthcare, or  loosening environmental regulations, look no further than a Koch front  group called Americans for Prosperity. Americans for Prosperity is the  recipient of the largest grants made by another organization called  Freedom Partners. POLITICO describes Freedom Partners as ``the Koch  brothers' secret bank.'' The group peddles dark money to front groups  to drum up public support for policies that benefit the richest of the  rich.   The Americans for Prosperity organization has been called by the  Washington Post ``the third largest political party in the United  States.'' It was founded in 2004 by David Koch, who serves as the  chairman of the board, and he has crammed the group with Republican  operatives. Many of them work for the Vice President. They operate in  36 States. They are heavily involved in electoral activities, spending  millions of dollars on TV ads that spread disinformation, falsely  claiming that the middle class will benefit from policies designed to  enrich the millionaire backers and billionaire backers of Americans for  Prosperity.   The organizations backed by these two groups and others have  consistently claimed that tax cuts for the wealthy will benefit all  Americans. They have consistently argued for measures that cause  environmental degradation. In fact, the Koch brothers have an enormous  stake in repealing regulations that protect the environment and put  limits on polluting fossil fuel companies, repealing those regulations  designed to accomplish that goal.   Americans for Prosperity drives the Koch energy agenda. The group  spent millions lobbying for its industry-backed champion, Scott Pruitt,  to head the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as others  nominated for EPA and Energy Department positions. Once they were in  place, these cronies wasted no time in seeking to dismantle the  environmental regulations prohibiting oil and gas drilling on Federal  lands, withdraw from the Clean Power Plan, which is aimed at cutting  U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and revoke a moratorium on new coal  leases.   There are other examples of influence by an American in modern  political history but none so egregious as the Koch brothers in this  administration.   Most recently, we saw their influence on the judiciary in suppressing  votes. The Koch brothers are throwing a lot of money behind the  nomination of judges who are poised to rule in their favor, undermining  judicial precedence and the rule of law. Its network is helping Donald  Trump stack the courts with far-right ideologues.   Donald Trump entered office with more than 100 vacancies on the  Federal bench--an opportunity created in part by Senate Republicans who  blocked many of Barack Obama's nominees before he left office. Judges  enjoy lifetime appointments. If the Koch brothers succeed in rigging  the judiciary against the needs of everyday Americans, the effects will  be felt for generations to come.   Americans for Prosperity is also behind shameless efforts to suppress  votes. It has launched disinformation campaigns, sending out bogus  registration mailings with incorrect deadlines in swing States like  North Carolina and Wisconsin. When challenged, Americans for Prosperity  claims that these blatant lies were the result of clerical error.   Our Nation needs prosperity but not an influence-peddling  organization that claims to be for prosperity but, in fact, leads to  policy that undermines the prosperity of everyday Americans.   My reasons for opposing Mike Pompeo's nomination go well beyond the  campaign contributions he has received. His views are contrary to  American values. He has repeatedly devalued and dismissed religious  tolerance. He has allied himself with anti-Islam and anti-LGBT groups.  At a time when the environment our children will inherit hangs in the  balance, he is a career-long climate change denier, drowning in dark  money from the Koch brothers' oil industry. His regressive views on  reproductive rights jeopardize the healthcare of millions of women  around the world. If confirmed, he will be responsible for executing  Donald Trump's misguided policies, and he will reinforce Donald Trump's  misguided instinct, expanding, for example, the global gag rule that  prevents foreign aid from being provided to global health programs that  discuss or provide abortion services. He will cut programs covering  everything from HIV prevention, to maternal and child health, to  epidemic disease response, putting our lives at risk.   Money in politics has reached its apex in this administration, not  only in politics but in government. Just within the last day or so, the  President's Director of the Office of Management and Budget gave a  speech to a group of bankers in which he said:         We had a hierarchy in my office in Congress. If you were a       lobbyist who never gave us money, I didn't talk to you. If       you were a lobbyist who gave us money, I might talk to you.    That quote from Mick Mulvaney, the head of the Office of Management  and Budget, was made to a group of about 1,300 bankers in plain view  and hearing of the American public.  [[Page S2445]]    First, the idea that a lobbyist would have to pay in order to have  access to a Member of Congress or his administration raises the  potential of bribery, extortion, and perhaps pay-to-play. It is pay-to- play and the image of it that has so sullied this town and government  in general that President Trump swayed so many people by describing it  as a swamp. Well, the swamp has been deepened, and it has been further  polluted by exactly this kind of talk.   I will say to Mick Mulvaney: You are destroying the credibility and  trust of the American people and our honest colleagues, who come to  work every day and try to help and serve the American people. Some of  them still work in the Federal Government at high levels, in fear of  losing their jobs because they adhere to a standard of integrity that  no longer prevails.   In fact, the mindset and mentality of pay-to-play has become the new  normal in this administration. It is filled with people at the highest  levels who regard unbridled and unapologetic graft as the new normal.  That is what that quote says to the average American.   It is typical of the practices of the Administrator of the EPA, who  accepts virtually free lodging from a lobbyist who has access to him,  as well as takes luxury flights and stays in exorbitantly expensive  hotels at taxpayers' expense. Conflicts of interest, ethical  violations, and other kinds of betrayal of the public trust have become  commonplace at the top levels of the EPA.   It is the mindset of a President of the United States who literally  every day accepts benefits from foreign governments and payment in  violation of the U.S. Constitution, specifically in violation of the  emoluments clause that prohibits such benefits and payments without the  consent of Congress. Donald Trump has never come to the U.S. Congress  seeking approval for the payments and benefits that go to the Trump  Organization, which he still owns. That failure is a violation of the  emoluments clause of the U.S. Constitution, and it is the reason that  200 of us Members of Congress have brought legal action to vindicate  our trust and the trust of the American people that the Constitution  will be followed and that we will do our job. We have standing to bring  that action because the President of the United States is preventing us  from reviewing those payments and benefits that go to him, which we  have an obligation to review under the U.S. Constitution. That case  will be heard in court in June.    I hope the courts will vindicate the rule of law. I hope we will see  an end to this corrosive and corrupting impact of money in politics and  money in government through a web of deceit and contempt for the rule  of law that betrays the trust of the American people.   The Washington, DC, that is conveyed by these quotes and actions by  officials at the very top of our government are not my Washington. They  are not the Washington, DC, of many of our colleagues--honest and hard- working in this Chamber, in the House of Representatives, and in the  executive and judicial branches--who continue to do their job. Among  them are two of our colleagues: Johnny Isakson and Jon Tester.   Senator Isakson of Georgia and Senator Tester of Montana have helped  to lead the Veterans' Affairs Committee over the past few days as it  raises concerns and questions about the serious allegations made by men  and women in uniform or retired Active-Duty military. These concerns go  directly to the ethics and integrity and character and ability of the  President's nominee to be VA Secretary, Ronny Jackson, a rear admiral  in the U.S. Navy. There is no realistic path at this point to  confirmation of Admiral Jackson. He should have a hearing if he wishes.  He should be considered if he chooses. But the administration owes the  American people, as well as the Senate, answers to questions raised by  the chairman and ranking member of the VA Committee. I have talked to  both of them, as well as the staff, about this investigation, and I  have participated in their thinking and support their efforts to  uncover the truth. Facts are stubborn things. That is what Ronald  Reagan said. It remains true even more so today in this inquiry.   The administration has failed to vet this nomination. It failed  abjectly to uncover the truth before it submitted this nomination. It  owes the truth and the facts now to the Senate before there is any  hearing. Documents and evidence should be provided, and the  administration should reverse course, if necessary, and make sure that  full access is provided to all of these documents and evidence.   As recently as yesterday, members of the VA Committee were barred  from viewing the FBI background check. The Inspector General's report  of 2012 on Rear Admiral Jackson was not provided to our committee, and  other relevant evidence and documents may exist, but they have been  denied.   I urge the administration to provide the facts, respond to the  questions, and address the serious allegations that have been made,  because they are consistent and credible and compelling. The more time  goes on, the more serious and substantial these allegations become in  their detail and depth and power. Time is not on their side, and so  far, the administration has abjectly failed to respond.   I thank Senators Isakson and Tester for their leadership and for  their insistence on integrity and character because our veterans  deserve it. Most importantly, our veterans deserve the very best  leader, not one who will be encumbered by the baggage of allegations,  unrefuted and unrebutted so far. Our veterans deserve the very best in  healthcare and employment opportunities and skill training. Our  veterans deserve that we keep faith with them and choose the very best  leader, with experience in management, as well as a commitment to the  high standards of integrity that befit the Veterans' Administration. It  has seen problems. It needs improvement and reforms. The path forward  for the VA is with a person and a leader who has unimpeachable  integrity.   I thank Senator Isakson and Senator Tester for their leadership and  insistence on that high bar in the Veterans' Administration for the  sake of our veterans.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
