 Madam Speaker, I rise to offer legislation that would  extend the extraordinarily successful scandal-free payroll passthrough  for airline employees. It reviews the airlines as our--    Yes, Madam Speaker, I have a unanimous consent request.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committees on  Financial Services, Transportation and Infrastructure, and the Budget  be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 8504, Payroll Support  Program Extension Act, and ask for its immediate consideration in the  House.    Madam Speaker, in plain English what you just said is  that the Republican majority killed this legislation plain and simple.   If they had just agreed, then tens of thousands of workers for the  airlines--flight attendants, they don't get paid a heck of a lot of  money; pilots, yeah, they do well; mechanics and gate agents; tens of  thousands of those people have been furloughed as of yesterday.

It is time to do real things for the  American people, and this is real. These people's lives are at stake.
