 Madam Speaker, I rise today to voice support for my  friend Representative Susan Wild's bipartisan Dr. Lorna Breen Health  Care Provider Protection Act, a bill that establishes training programs  for healthcare workers to prevent suicide and burnout.   As I am here in Congress today, I think of my constituents back home  in Michigan who are in the midst of another COVID-19 spike, who are in  our hospitals telling us they are full, who cannot provide care in  the way they have been trained and taught and in the way they would  like to. These spikes leave us exhausted. They leave our healthcare  workers all the more stressed.    People are being pushed to the limit. Since the start of this  pandemic, Michigan's healthcare workforce has become fragile. We have  lost workers due to the stress of this pandemic, yet this bipartisan  legislation that brings us together here today will provide support to  the workforce.   Michigan healthcare workers deserve this. They are working and are  continuing to work on the front lines of this pandemic. It is time to  change how our healthcare industry approaches mental health. We must  step up to provide a more reliable culture and supportive  infrastructure for healthcare professionals to count on for years to  come.   It took a pandemic for us to get this Dr. Lorna Breen bill, and we  will not forget our healthcare workers. We will continue to stand up  for them.
