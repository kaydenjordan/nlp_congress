 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise in support of H.R. 477, and I want to thank Chairman  Hensarling and Chairman Huizenga for their hard work on this effort.   While we are finally seeing improvements in our economy, we will not  experience its full potential until we fully unleash American small  businesses.   As chairman of the House Small Business Committee, I frequently hear  from small-business owners that regulations are preventing their growth  and expansion. The bill before us today addresses one of the many  regulatory hurdles that stand in the way of small business development.  Reducing red tape on brokers would decrease the burdens on small  businesses that are going through the next phase of their growth,  including transitions in ownership.   This should be a time of expansion and increased opportunities, not  higher cost and bureaucratic red tape. Let's work together on behalf of  our Nation's small businesses so they can continue to grow today and  create the jobs of tomorrow.                                time  1530
