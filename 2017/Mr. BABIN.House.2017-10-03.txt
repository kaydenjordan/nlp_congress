 Madam Speaker, as the father of 5 and the grandfather of  13, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 36, the Pain-Capable Unborn  Child Protection Act, also known as Micah's Law, named after Micah  Pickering.   Micah was born prematurely at 22 weeks of age. In fact, the same age  and exact stage of development that the current despicable policy  permits for legal, on-demand abortion.   After receiving intensive care in his infancy, Micah is now an  active, healthy, and happy kindergartner. Micah is living proof that we  need to pass H.R. 36. Congress needs to take this crucial step to  ensure the protection of thousands of innocent lives every year,  innocent lives just like precious Micah.   The scientific evidence is overwhelming that, by at least 20 weeks of  age, unborn babies can feel excruciating pain during typical abortion  procedures. This is both cruel and inhumane. As Members of Congress, it  is our duty and our moral obligation to pass this commonsense  legislation.   We must protect the most defenseless. Enough is enough. I urge my  colleagues to join me in supporting this critical bill to protect the  sanctity of every human life. God knows it is time.
