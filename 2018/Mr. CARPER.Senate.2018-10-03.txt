 Mr. President, along with Senator Chris Coons and  Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware, I would like to take  this opportunity to reflect on the life of LCDR James J. Connell, of  Wilmington, DE. J.J. passed away on January 14, 1971, at the age of 32,  at the hands of Vietnamese guards during the Vietnam war after being  held as a POW. In life and death, J.J. epitomized the best of the  country's selfless citizens who put their lives on the line during the  Vietnam war. His service exemplifies the unwavering courage, devotion  to duty, and honor that he had and reminds us all of how good we can  be.   J.J. Connell was born on May 6, 1939, in Wilmington, DE, attending  Salesianum High School until 1957. Following this, he graduated from  the U.S. Naval Academy on June 7, 1961, after having spent some time in  Congress as a page. By 1962, he was designated as a naval aviator.  After additional training, he was assigned as a flight instructor at  NAAS Whiting Field, FL. He then served with Attack Squadron 55 aboard  the USS Ticonderoga, then at NAS Lemoore, CA, until deploying on the  USS Ranger on December 1964. After 7 months of combat, he was shot down  over North Vietnam on July 15, 1966. Though he only sustained minor  injuries, rescue efforts were impossible in the high-threat area he  landed in, and consequently, he was captured.   J.J. was captured by the North Vietnamese at a time when U.S.  prisoners were declared as criminals and subjected to brutal conditions  such as isolation, beatings, starvation, and other means of torture.  Despite the heinous means of brutal force the Vietnamese used, J.J.  refused to fold under pressure, demonstrating courage and determination  beyond his years. He was in captivity for 1,645 days before his death,  with his remains returning to the United States on March 6, 1974. He  left behind two children who would never know their father and a wife  who had previously waited years hoping that J.J. would return home  alive.   Though it seems that time may have forgotten J.J. Connell, it is  imperative that we remember the hard work and dedication he put into  protecting our country and keeping it safe. Posthumously, he was  awarded with the Navy Cross, the second highest award for valor after  the Medal of Honor and the highest award of valor presented to any  Delawarean during the Vietnam war. J.J. was a true hero, and is an  inspiration to us all even today.   Along with Senator Chris Coons and Congresswoman Lisa Blunt  Rochester, I wish to commemorate J.J., to celebrate his life, and to  offer his family our deepest sympathy on their tragic loss.                            ____________________
