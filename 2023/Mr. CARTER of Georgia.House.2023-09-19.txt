 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  director of the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers, Dr. Thomas J.  Walters, for his 44 years of service to the United States.   Director Walters oversaw the training and management program for new  law enforcement officers across the country, including those at the  Glynco, Georgia, campus in my district.   Mr. Walters dedicated his entire four-decade career to defending our  national security, serving as a Border Patrol agent, and in various  leadership positions. He embodies both patriotism and leadership, and  the next generation of officers is undoubtedly grateful for his  expertise and the example he set. Director Walters emphasized that  serving as the FLETC director was an honor and a career highlight.   I know I speak for the whole First District when I say we appreciate  his dedication to law enforcement and his service to others. I welcome  the new FLETC director, Benjamine ``Carry'' Huffman, and I wish him the  best of luck.             Remembering Lieutenant Colonel David Leonard Sharpe     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of  Lieutenant Colonel David Leonard Sharpe. At the age of 81, he leaves  behind a legacy of bravery, leadership, and selflessness. In 1966, he  graduated from the U.S. Army Ranger School and became the first Army  Ranger in the Georgia National Guard. He served in the U.S. Army  Reserves in the Georgia National Guard for 41 years, from 1960 to 2001.   We remember him not only for his military accomplishments, but also  for his dedication to his community. He excelled as a mechanical  drawing teacher at Glynn Academy high school in Brunswick. In the  summers, he worked on commercial and residential planning.   I know Mr. Sharpe's legacy will live on in the positive impact he had  on his  [[Page H4388]]  community, and I extend my deepest condolences to his family.                 Congratulating Dale Greene on his Retirement     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  University of Georgia's Forestry and Natural Resources dean, Dale  Greene, for his decades of accomplishments before he retires at the end  of the year.   Greene has consistently displayed his passion for his students and  teaching throughout his time working at UGA, and he has been a key  factor in the success of many young leaders. Greene joined the  University of Georgia in 1986, and since then has won several awards,  including but not limited to, the Herrick Award for Superior Teaching,  the Wise Owl Award, the Silver Beaver Award from the Georgia Boy Scouts  of America, and the Billy Hudson Distinguished Citizen Award.   Greene was also inducted into the Georgia Foresters Hall of Fame in  2007 for his efforts in expanding research and funding to his  university. I am proud to commemorate such a hardworking individual  that has aided in so many Georgians' postgraduate successes in  agriculture.                        Congratulating The Crab Shack     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate The  Crab Shack for being named one of the best seafood restaurants in the  United States by the Food Network.   On the charming Tybee Island of Georgia sits The Crab Shack, known  for its outstanding fresh seafood, river views on the marsh of Chimney  Creek, and extensive choice of in-house events.   This unique restaurant is a perfect spot for vacationing families  with a wide range of food options, activities, and incredible southern  hospitality service. Savannah locals, Jack and Belinda Flanigan,  developed The Crab Shack from nothing more than a few tables and some  friends, and since then it has developed into an iconic river spot for  all to enjoy.   An alligator enclosure on the property's outer boundaries attracts  numerous people who come to feed the young gators.   I am proud to celebrate the accomplishments of this local restaurant,  which brings many visitors to the beautiful islands of Georgia.                            ____________________
