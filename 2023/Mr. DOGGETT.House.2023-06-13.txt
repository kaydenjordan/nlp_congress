 Mr. Speaker, the GOP has become, sadly, the ``Guns Over  People'' party. Their answer to the desperate pleas of families from  all across America who want to stop the slaughter of schoolchildren and  other innocents--their answer is to do absolutely nothing.   Today, during this National Gun Violence Awareness Month, what do  they do?  [[Page H2828]]    They go a step further. This is the only opportunity this year that  Speaker McCarthy has permitted us to consider any gun violence  legislation. What do they do about gun violence?   They enable a little more of it. More pistol braces in the hands of  killers will cause us to brace for more death.   Republicans want to stop an ATF rule that will require background  checks in certain narrow instances when a brace turns a handgun into a  rifle. Background checks are exactly what we need for all gun purchases  so that those who go through the gun shop loophole and don't get a  check when they buy it at a gun show or on the internet have to have  the same standard as if they bought it in a gun shop.   They will not even permit us to respond to the desperate pleas of the  people of Uvalde to ban weapons of war from the hands of teenagers who  couldn't on their own go out and buy a beer.   There is an orgy of violence going on, and they are obstructing those  of us who want to respond to the police from doing anything about it,  from banning weapons of war, from requiring background checks to ensure  we know what kind of person is getting a gun and, if they have a  problem, they ought to be denied that access.   The gun industry is marketing these so-called ``stabilizing braces''  to convert heavy pistols into short-barreled rifles that are more  concealable.    Mr. Speaker, the guns are already the number one killer  of children in our country. This year, there have been 291 mass  shootings. We can count the numbers, but we can't count the pain of an  empty chair where there was once a vibrant parent or a wonderful little  child who was murdered in a mass shooting. This Congress could do  something about it if we could end the obstruction. We need to move  toward reducing gun violence, not enabling it.                                time  1315
