 Madam Speaker, I rise today in solemn memory of  Ms. Verna Campbell, a constituent, beloved mother, grandmother, and  eternal fighter for the working class.   Ms. Campbell left us on October 22 but leaves behind a powerful  legacy in my community. She was a loving mother to 10 children and  step-children, and always worked to support her second family, 1199  SEIU.   Ms. Verna was a long-time delegate for 1199, where she fought for  labor rights, fair pay, and dignity for all workers.   She devoted herself to the Staten Island Democratic Association, the  Staten Island NAACP, the Staten Island Women's Political Caucus, and  the 120th Precinct Council.   Ms. Verna was a founder of the Staten Island African American  Political Association and, over the years, has worked to bring African  Americans into Staten Island politics.   Ms. Verna also played key roles in electing numerous African  Americans to public office throughout her life.   Staten Island and all of New York City will deeply miss Ms. Verna  Campbell, but we are all blessed for her membership in our community  throughout her lifetime.                            ____________________
