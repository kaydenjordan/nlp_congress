 Mr. President, first, on the topic of net neutrality,  since the administration's FCC voted to end net neutrality in December,  Democrats have been working hard to round up enough Senators to  overrule the FCC's decision, which places control of the internet in  the hands of the biggest corporations.   Today we reached a milestone: 50 Senators will support Senator  Markey's resolution of disapproval. All 49 Democrats have signed on to  cosponsor, and my friend from Maine, Senator Collins, has also said she  will support it.   With our full caucus supporting the measure, it is clear that  Democrats want to keep the internet from becoming a Wild West where  ISPs are free to offer premium service to the wealthiest customers  while average consumers are left with far inferior options.   When we force a vote on this bill, Republicans in Congress will, for  the first time, have the opportunity to right the administration's  wrong and show the American people whose side they are on. Are they on  the side of big internet service providers and corporations, or are  they on the side of consumers, entrepreneurs, startups, and small  business owners?   I applaud Senator Collins for supporting this effort and hope  sincerely that more of her colleagues will do the same. Given how  quickly this measure has earned the support of 50 Senators, I believe  we have a real chance of success in restoring net neutrality and  keeping the internet open and free for all Americans.   Mr. President, another pressing issue before us this week is FISA and  the 702 program. The majority leader is pressing forward on a 6-year  bill to reauthorize the 702 FISA Court program. This is a significant  bill, but right now the majority leader is pushing for its passage  without debate or amendments. That is the wrong approach.   Many of my colleagues would like to offer amendments on this  legislation and, frankly, they deserve that right. Personally, I  believe that while the bill makes some improvements to the 702 FISA  program, it should go somewhat further. We could do a better job  balancing the crucial national security imperatives of the program with  legitimate concerns about privacy and protecting the rights of American  citizens.   Clearly, the bill on the calendar is better than the status quo, and  it is certainly better than no bill at all, but that is not the choice  before us. The majority leader can open up the bill for limited debate  and a few amendments, not to delay but so we can have some amendments  and try to improve it.    For that reason, I will be voting no on the upcoming cloture motion.  If cloture is not invoked, we can move quickly to an amendment process  where Senators from both parties could offer ideas to improve the bill.  That is what we ought to do, especially on a bill on the most sensitive  area of the government, where security and liberty meet, and that will  stand for 6 years. That is too quick for too much. We ought to have  some amendments and some discussion.                                     DACA    Mr. President, the fate of the Dreamers has been the subject of  months of intense bipartisan, bicameral negotiations. Last week, a  bipartisan group of Senators went to the White House with an agreement  that represents the best path forward. Senators Graham and Durbin,  alongside Senators Gardner, Menendez, Flake, and Bennet, worked out a  compromise that fits squarely inside the four corners President Trump  outlined as the parameters of a deal in a televised meeting last  Tuesday. In exchange for passing DACA protections, the Gang of 6 deal  includes President Trump's full budget request for border security,  including funding to build barriers along the southern border. It deals  with family reunification within the scope of the negotiations-- foreclosing the possibility of Dreamers sponsoring their parents for  citizenship. The deal would also curb the diversity lobbying system-- another item President Trump requested. The full details of the  proposal will be announced tomorrow, but those are the broad strokes,  as I understand them.   The concessions in the bill are tough pills to swallow for Democrats.  It is not the bill we would have written if we were in charge, but that  is not the situation we find ourselves in. To make this body work--to  avoid a shutdown--we must compromise. So Democrats tried, in good  faith, to meet the President and our Republican colleagues halfway--to  find a deal that neither  [[Page S175]]  side loved but both sides could live with, and that is what a  bipartisan group of Senators achieved.   The deal they produced is right down the middle. It addresses the  precise issues the President identified as part of a deal. Yet, at the  pivotal White House meeting last Thursday, President Trump turned his  back on this bipartisan solution and proceeded to use foul and vulgar  language to demean African and Caribbean countries.   His well-reported comments were certainly unbefitting the Presidency  of the United States. They were beneath the dignity of his office. They  went against the very idea of America--which holds up as an  unassailable truth that all men are created equal, no matter their  station or country of origin, but just as distressing, President  Trump's comments reveal an intransigence about coming to a deal for the  Dreamers. It seems the President has only two ways of negotiating:  Either he commits to a deal one day and then betrays his word the  next--which is what happened last year after Leader Pelosi and I met  President Trump on DACA--or he even dismisses the possibility of  compromise and says a bipartisan deal is that he gets everything he  wants.   Hundreds of thousands of lives hang in the balance. Funding for our  men and women in uniform hangs in the balance. President Trump needs to  step up. He can't just bluster. He can't just play a game of  brinksmanship. He can't just be obstinate and say: My way or the  highway. He needs to be willing to take yes for an answer.   A very fair bipartisan deal remains on the table. It is the only game  in town, and we are making steady progress on building additional  support in both Houses of Congress. If it were put on the floor of the  House or Senate, I predict it would get a majority vote in either one.  There is a deal to be had this week. The only person blocking it is  President Trump.   So I have a challenge for President Trump. Everyone is talking about  how bigoted your comments were last week. Well, actions speak louder  than words. If you want to begin the long road back to prove you are  not prejudiced or bigoted, support the bipartisan compromise that three  Democrats and three Republicans have put before you--one that was aimed  at meeting the concerns you voiced. Give the Dreamers safety here in  America and bolster border security at the same time. This may be the  last train leaving the station. President Trump needs to get on board.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I thank Senator Stabenow and my colleague  from Indiana and my colleague from Ohio. Senators Brown, Stabenow,  Donnelly, Klobuchar, Heitkamp, Casey, and Baldwin have been such  stalwart voices for working men and women in their States--namely,  teamsters and food workers--as well as Senator Manchin, for the miners  in West Virginia, and so many others across the country.   We come to the floor tonight to urge our Republican colleagues to  join us in doing something to shore up pension plans for over 1 million  Americans. Millions of middle-class workers in this country--teamsters,  miners, carpenters, and steel workers--have put their money into plans  year after year. They knew they wouldn't be rich when they retired, but  they thought they could live a life of decency and dignity. They often  forewent salary increases. They said: Don't give me a raise at this  percent; give me a lower raise, but put money in that pension. These  people earned these pensions. They are the backbone of America.   But now, after all of their hard work and all of their savings,  several multiyear pension plans are at risk of failure, through no  fault of the workers. Families in my State and across the country could  see their retirement savings slashed. Teamsters, miners, carpenters,  and food service workers are at risk of losing security through no  fault of their own. They weren't responsible for the stock market  crash, and they weren't involved in offshore swaps in London or  somewhere, but that diminished the value of these plans. They are  certainly not responsible for Congress twiddling its thumbs and doing  nothing in the face of these shortfalls. Teamsters in my State, for  instance, are facing a 30-percent reduction in their retirement  benefits. They feel the impact of the cuts every day.   So in conclusion, we have to get something done. Our Republican  friends spent most of 2017 pressing legislation to help the wealthiest  corporations and biggest corporations to get  [[Page S183]]  big tax breaks, but what about the middle-class worker? What about the  middle-class worker? Let 2018 be different. Let it be the year when we  fix these plans, and let's do it in the upcoming budget deal.   I know that Senators Brown, Stabenow, Donnelly and so many others  will continue to fight for hard-working pensioners until we fix the  problem.   So again, I want to thank my good friend, the Senator from Ohio, Mr.  Brown, for organizing an outstanding group of Senators to speak this  evening on a crucial topic: pensions.   Senators Brown, Stabenow, Klobuchar, Heitkamp, Donnelly, Casey and  Baldwin have always been such stalwart voices for the working men and  women of their States.   We all come to the floor tonight to urge our Republican colleagues to  join us in doing something to shore up pension plans for over a million  Americans.   Millions of middle-class workers in this country--teamsters and  miners and carpenters and steel workers--put money into pension plans  year after year, forgoing large salary increases or other benefits. Do  you know why? Because they said: I am going to work hard my whole life,  but when I retire I want to retire with some degree of dignity. And  that is what they did.   But several multiemployer pension plans are at a real risk of  failure. Families in my State and across the country could see their  retirement savings slashed. Teamsters and miners and carpenters and  food service workers are at risk of losing that security through no  fault of their own.   They weren't responsible for the market crash in 2009, which  diminished the value of so many of these plans. And they certainly  aren't responsible for Congress twiddling its thumbs, doing nothing to  fix the looming shortfalls in the many years since.   And yet, Teamsters in my State are facing a 30-percent reduction in  their retirement benefits. They feel the impact of those cuts every  day.   These are funds that workers contributed to, and they earned every  penny. They won't allow the families of my State to buy riches or  luxuries. These pension plans won't fund the purchase of yachts or  beach homes. What they will do is guarantee hard-working men and women  the peace of mind that comes with a secure retirement.   We have an obligation to see that the promise made to these workers  is upheld. And we ought to do it soon. If we don't, it is going to cost  taxpayers more in the long run. And all throughout the meantime,  hardworking American families will be denied the benefits they rightly  deserve.   Republicans spent most of 2017 pressing legislation that helped the  wealthiest corporations and the biggest corporations to the detriment  of the middle class. Let 2018 be different. Let 2018 be a year when we  finally fix these pension plans. And let's do it in the upcoming budget  deal.   This will be another test of the Republican majority. Will they again  ignore the pressing needs of working Americans across the country? Will  President Trump again talk about helping the working men and women of  this country but then turn his back on them? We will see.   What I know is that Senator Brown, and this group of Democratic  Senators, will continue to fight for the hardworking pensioners of this  country until we fix this problem.
