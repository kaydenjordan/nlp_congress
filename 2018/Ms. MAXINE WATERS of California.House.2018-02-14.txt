 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 3299, or the so- called Protecting Consumers' Access to Credit Act of 2017. There is a  good reason over 200 civil rights, consumer, faith-based, housing,  labor, and veterans advocacy organizations oppose this bill. The type  of credit that this bill helps consumers access is the kind that makes  it easier for vulnerable consumers to sink into insurmountable debt  like payday and other high-cost loans.   H.R. 3299 expands the ability of nonbanks to preempt State-level  consumer protections by stating that the interest rate on any loan  originated by a national bank that is subsequently transferred to a  third party, no matter how quickly after it is originated, is  enforceable, which incentivizes riskier and predatory lending. H.R.  3299 advances a dangerous precedent by allowing third parties that  purchase loans from national banks to collect on interest rates that  would otherwise be illegal because they exceed State caps.   Now, this bill is an attempt to overturn a court decision related to  the legal concept of ``valid when made'' from the Second Circuit Court  of Appeals in Madden v. Midland Funding, LLC. In that case, the court  held that, when loans are transferred from banks to nonbank third  parties, they must maintain the same terms, rates, and conditions as  required by the State where the originating bank is chartered.   Despite claims by proponents of the bill, legal experts have  explained in testimony that ``the valid-when-made doctrine is a modern  invention, not a cornerstone of U.S. banking law.''   The Madden decision is only the rule of law in the States under the  Second Circuit, which are Connecticut, New York, and Vermont. Some  industry advocates, particularly marketplace lender fintechs, have  argued the ruling and confusion about valid when made caused such great  market ambiguity that it has resulted in reduced lending to needy  borrowers in those States, but those claims have not been  substantiated.   The only purported evidence we have on the effect of the Madden rule  is a single, unpublished study that cannot even be peer-reviewed  because it relies on private data from a single, unidentified  marketplace lender, and the authors of that study have not endorsed  this bill. In addition, 20 State attorneys general, including the  attorneys general for all three States under the Second Circuit, oppose  this legislative change.   But do you know what? Predatory lenders are worried about the Madden  case for a different reason.   Elevate, an online payday lender, is afraid that they won't be able  to continue making predatory loans if the Madden decision stays in  place. In their public filings with the SEC, Elevate said:         To the extent that the holdings in Madden were broadened to       cover circumstances applicable to Elevate's business or if       other litigation on related theories were brought against us       and were successful, we could become subject to State usury       limits and State licensing laws in addition to the State       consumer protection laws to which we are already subject. In       a greater number of States, loans in such States could be       deemed void and unenforceable, and we would be subject to       substantial penalties in connection with such loans.    Mr. Speaker, I do not doubt the sincerity of the good actors that may  be trying to navigate a difficulty the Madden ruling potentially  caused, but this is not just about those businesses, because H.R. 3299  would go much further to allow other third parties, including payday  lenders, to evade or outright disregard State-level laws and collect  debt from borrowers at unreasonably high rates of interest if they  purchase loans from a national bank. These arrangements are called  rent-a-bank or rent-a-charter agreements, and they allow payday lenders  to use banks as a front for predatory behavior and the evasion of State  interest rate caps.   Payday loans drain wealth from low-income consumers, particularly  those in communities of color, and payday loans trap their borrowers  into a cycle of debt that it takes years to climb out of with high  interest rates that are often in excess of 300 percent.   So let's be clear. Instead of simply overturning the Madden decision,  H.R. 3299 would go far beyond that and codify an expanded preemption  power without any proof that it will benefit consumers. In fact, all we  do know is that the bill will make it easier for bad actors to evade  safeguards that States have put in place to protect borrowers.   We cannot advance a bill that will allow nonbanks like payday lenders  to ignore State interest rate caps and make high-rate loans. While  Congress has preempted some State laws for national banks, it did not  authorize national banks to extend the privilege to whatever entities  they so choose.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to  the gentleman from California (Mr. Khanna), vice chair of the  Congressional Progressive Caucus.    I yield an additional 1 minute to  the gentleman from California.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Both of the gentlemen, Mr. McHenry and Mr. Rothfus, who are advancing  this legislation come from States that don't support it.   Mr. McHenry, North Carolina has banned payday lending. Mr. Rothfus,  Pennsylvania has banned payday lending. And here you have a bill that  would allow payday lenders to buy up debt from national banks and,  basically, charge consumers whatever they would like to charge them.  They would get around the ban of your own States. Do you really want to  do this?   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   I would like to remind Mr. Pittenger that his State, North Carolina,  again, along with Mr. McHenry, attorneys general have opposed this  bill. They do not like this bill, and I just want to remind them that  they don't have the support of their States in doing so.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs.  Carolyn B. Maloney), the ranking member of the Capital Markets,  Securities, and Investments Subcommittee on the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, you have heard those of us who are opposed to this  legislation repeat over and over again that this is all about predatory  lending; that this bill would open the gates wide to the kind of abuses  that we have been fighting so hard against.   Mrs. MALONEY asked the questions: Why do you want to do this to your  constituents? Why do you want to do this to the very consumers that we  are supposed to be protecting?   I have raised a question to those who come from States where the  attorneys general oppose this legislation. The gentlemen from North  Carolina and Pennsylvania, who are here in support of this bill, they  are ignoring the fact that their State attorneys general are saying  that this bill is a bad bill.   Of course, if H.R. 3299 was really about expanding access to  underserved populations, as the proponents claim, then they may be  surprised to learn that the Nation's leading civil and consumer groups  are all opposed to this legislation because it will harm consumers, not  help them.                                time  1445    According to a news article from last November, there is a reason the  NAACP, the Southern Poverty Law Center, the National Consumer Law  Center, the Consumer Federation of America, and dozens of churches,  women's groups, and antipoverty organizations from around the country  have denounced the bill.   In September, those groups wrote a joint letter to Congress warning  that H.R. 3299 ``wipes away the strongest available tool against  predatory lending practices'' and ``will open the floodgates to a wide  range of predatory actors to make loans at 300 percent annual interest  or higher.''   The article goes on to say: ``But you don't have to take the NAACP's  word for it, just take a look at the companies who are lobbying in  favor of H.R. 3299.''   Well, they aren't many, as it is a complicated and obscure issue. But  one of them, according to a Federal lobbying disclosure form, is a firm  called CNU Online Holdings, LLC. Most customers of CNU Online Holdings  don't even realize they use it. They are more familiar with CNU's  parent company, payday lending giant Enova Financial; or its flagship  brand, CashNetUSA.   The bottom line is that this bill is not helping our consumers, but,  rather, lining the pockets of predatory lenders who are looking for any  way around State interest rate caps and consumer protections.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, this is odd. Here, we  have another Member of Congress, whose State attorney general opposes  the bill, and who has banned payday lending.   So, here, Mr. Emmer is joining with Mr. McHenry and Mr. Pittenger,  whose State opposes the bill, North Carolina. Again, the two of them  are in opposition to their own State's attorney general. And now we  have Mr. Rothfus from Pennsylvania and all of these speakers on the  opposite side of the aisle who are coming here to support a bill that  will open up the opportunity for payday lenders to basically rent a  bank and put these payday loans out there at exorbitant amounts.   Mr. Speaker, again, this is rather odd to see so many Members  representing, supposedly, their constituents who come from States where  payday lending has been banned and their attorneys general oppose this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I think my friend on the opposite side of the aisle, the  chairman, is right. I must make sure that I am correct in the way that  I identify my colleagues, who they are and what States they come from.   So I would like to repeat: Mr. McHenry is from North Carolina. Mr.  Pittenger is from North Carolina. The attorney general from that State  opposes this bill, and this State has banned payday lending.   Also let me just mention that Mr. Rothfus from Pennsylvania is  another one who is opposed by his attorney general. His attorney  general is opposed to this bill, is opposed to his representation, and  Pennsylvania has banned payday lending.   Of course, we were joined by Mr. Emmer, who is from Minnesota.  Minnesota is in the same position as North Carolina and Pennsylvania.  The attorney general of Minnesota opposes this bill, and Minnesota bans  payday lending.   So let's be clear. We want to make sure that everybody understands  who these Members are who are coming here in opposition to their  attorneys general, in opposition to their State. These are  Representatives from States that oppose this bill. These are  Representatives from States who have banned payday lending.   So I want to be sure that I agree with my chairman. We should let  everyone know who they are. We should pronounce their names correctly.  We should be sure that all of their constituents understand who their  Representatives are and what they are doing here today on this bill  that will help to explode predatory lending.   This is the rent-a-bank bill that would allow payday lenders to buy  up debt from national banks and be able to charge whatever they would  like, 300 percent and more, to the unsuspecting consumers.   So I thank the chairman for helping me to make that clear.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, Chairman Hensarling has named the Members on my side of  the aisle, the Democrats who support this bill. None of them are on the  floor at this time. None of them came here to defend the position that  they took. Some of them are reconsidering the vote that they took, and  so I don't want him to try and wrap this bill around the fact that  there were some Democrats who supported it.   This is a Republican bill. This is a bill by the opposite side of the  aisle that supports payday lending and the ability for payday lenders  to continue to exploit their consumers in a new and different way. They  simply allow them to buy up this debt from the national banks to be  able to basically overcome usury laws.   So while he would like everyone to believe there is all of this great  Democratic support and he keeps saying over and over again how  bipartisan this bill is, none of them are on the floor at this time.  None of them came here to defend their position. None of them have  said, ``I know that I am absolutely correct.'' As a matter of fact,  some of them are raising questions about whether or not they should  have voted for the bill, understanding it in one particular way, and  some now understanding what it really does.   So I thank the gentleman for his position, and I thank him for being  a strong advocate for his position. I thank him for at least stepping  up to the plate to say, in essence, he believes that he is doing the  right thing, despite the fact that he has got Members on that side of  the aisle who are going against their own States' attorneys general.   But let us not believe that this is some great Democratic bill. It is  not.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time.   There was a reference to Senator Warner, and he said that the Madden  fix bill must address the payday lender loophole. I alluded to some of  this kind of thinking about those who may have supported the bill  without really giving a lot of thought to this loophole, but I just  want you to know that even the author of the bill, Senator Warner, is  saying that the Madden fix bill must address payday lender loopholes.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3299 is ultimately a bill that would make it easier  for bad actors to get around interest rate caps that States have put  into place to protect borrowers from predator payday pit traps. Let's  be clear: the availability of affordable credit is very important in  every community, and we should work together in ways to make sure that  underserved communities have fair access to credit and banking  services.   But measures like H.R. 3299 do not productively advance that goal. In  fact, the bill would do the opposite. It would open the door for  nonbanks to ignore States' strong protections and make loans with high  interest rates. The bill would usher in a wave of harmful, high-cost  payday loans in States where such loans were previously disallowed.   Let's not forget that last month Mick Mulvaney, who President Trump  illegally appointed to serve as Acting Director of the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau, directed the Consumer Bureau to reconsider  its sensible and much-needed rule on payday vehicle title and certain  high-cost installment loans. That rule, put in place under the  leadership of Richard Cordray, would require payday lenders to ensure  that consumers can actually afford to pay off their loans.   Essentially, Donald Trump and Mick Mulvaney are helping out payday  lenders by undermining the Consumer Bureau's rule as well as rolling  back and undermining many of the other critical protections put in  place by Democrats in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer  Protection Act.    On top of his pull to reconsider the payday rule, Mulvaney has also  drawn a Consumer Bureau lawsuit against a group of payday lenders who  allegedly failed to disclose the true cost of loans which had interest  rates as high as 950 percent a year.   Mr. Speaker, Congress should be standing up for and enhancing  protections for consumers, not legislating to make it easier for  hardworking Americans to be drawn into payday debt traps.   H.R. 3299 is widely opposed by over 200 consumer and civil rights  groups, including the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights,  the NAACP, the National Consumer Law Center, the Southern Poverty Law  Center, and many others.   And so I think it is clear what we are advocating on this side of the  aisle. We are simply saying that we should not create this loophole,  that we should understand the struggle that many of us have been in to  try and keep payday lenders from going into the most vulnerable  neighborhoods, targeting the most vulnerable people, taking advantage  of folks who have no place to turn and who need a few dollars until  payday, taking advantage of them and trapping them into these loans and  creating all of this debt for them.   This would just go a long way to continue that kind of madness, and  so I would urge Members to vote ``no'' on the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 3978, the TRID  Improvement Act of 2017.   H.R. 3978 has been dramatically expanded without input from Democrats  to include several highly problematic and damaging bills. If enacted,  this amended package of bills would ease the ability of high frequency  traders to manipulate the stock markets undetected, encourage a  regulatory race to the bottom in our Nation's stock exchanges, and harm  investors and small businesses by weakening efforts to prevent  accounting fraud at smaller public companies.   Taken together, this deregulatory package could significantly  undermine market stability and gut investor and consumer protections at  a time when our financial markets are already rattled.   Madam Speaker, from January 26 until last Thursday, the stock markets  plunged just over 10 percent, becoming what the financial services  industry calls ``stock market correction,'' and for the past two  trading days, markets have rebounded the most since 2016.   Although market corrections are not new, what distinguishes today's  volatility is that it is driven by complex computer strategies designed  to buy and sell stocks and options millions of times a day. As many of  us have witnessed, the Dow Jones Industrial Average may be up 500  points and then down 600 in less than a few minutes. For the average  American who was hoping to one day retire with dignity by investing her  hard-earned savings in the stock market, it can be distressing to see  such wild swings always wondering whether the markets are truly fair or  whether she is going to be fleeced. Unfortunately, the passage of H.R.  3978 would likely make those swings more extreme and increase the  likelihood of problems going forward.    I am going to walk through each of the problematic provisions in this  bill. Beginning with title IV, this provision is identical to H.R.  4546, the National Securities Exchange Regulatory Parity Act, which  would weaken the standards for listing public companies for trading at  U.S. stock exchanges. Today, exchanges listing standards set minimum  requirements for a company's shares to be sold to the public without  having to comply with State law. Exchanges can only revise these  standards if the Securities and Exchange Commission first finds that  new standards are substantially similar to the listing standards of the  New York Stock Exchange.   This bill would remove any separate analysis for changing the  standards and, thus, automatically preempt State oversight. As a  result, the bill would encourage a race to the bottom of listing  standards as exchanges compete with each other to attract companies  with less restrictions, even if the standards are beneficial to the  investors.   I believe that we should be strengthening the current analysis to  promote fair and rigorous listing standards and only preempt State law  when companies meet high standards. This is why I worked with the  cosponsors last Congress to strike a bipartisan compromise which passed  the House unanimously to require the SEC to develop a core qualitative  listing standard. Unfortunately, my Republican colleagues have reversed  their position in favor of empowering the industry over the investing  public.   Turning to title III which is identical to H.R. 1645, the so-called  Fostering Innovation Act, this provision would eliminate the  independent audit of a company's financial reporting controls for up to  10 years for newly public companies provided that they have $50 million  or less in gross revenues and less than $700 million in outstanding  shares. Passed in the wake of the Enron and WorldCom accounting  scandals, the requirement that public companies conduct an independent  audit of financial controls is one of the many accounting provisions  required by the bipartisan Sarbanes-Oxley Act that directly benefits  investors and public companies by improving the accuracy of their  financial reporting.   In fact, companies that are not subject to such review by an  independent auditor are more likely to issue corrections to their  financial reports leading to investor losses and higher losses for the  company.   Investors like these audits because they improve the veracity of the  reports they rely on to make investment decisions. Today, truly small  public companies--those with less than $75 million worth of shares--are  already exempt from the audit requirement. But this bill would extend  the exemption to large companies that are nearly ten times that size.  The law already provides newly public companies with an exemption for 5  years. Extending it to a decade would harm investor confidence and all  such companies, hurting the very companies the bill's supporters  purport to help.   Title II of this bill is the same language as H.R. 3948, the  Protection of Source Code Act. This bill bans the SEC from inspecting  source code used by regulated entities to engage in algorithmic or  computer-driven trading and other activities that impact the securities  markets and investors without first obtaining a subpoena. This  provision would severely hamper the ability of the SEC to effectively  examine persons like high-frequency traders and to investigate market  disruptions.   The recent stock market volatility, which has seen all of the major  stock indices decline by more than 10 percent in less than 2 weeks, has  been exacerbated by high-frequency traders using complex computer  algorithms to determine when to buy and sell millions of trades per  second by making it harder for the capital markets COP to detect and  stop bad actors and rein in fraudulent trading schemes. This provision  will inevitably harm everyday Americans and retirees who rely on fair  capital markets to invest their hard-earned savings.   To make matters worse, Republicans added a provision to pay for the  cost of the bill by taking $2 million from the Securities and Exchange  Commission's reserve fund. As a result, our financial watchdog will  have less resources to support its capacity to oversee the markets  through investments in IT and to respond to unforeseen market events  like the flash crash.   In short, this bill asks taxpayers to pay for the costs of diminished  capital market oversight by taking away SEC's funding to respond to  emergency market situations that threaten market stability. This  provision doubles down on the irresponsible policymaking we often see  by the opposite side of the aisle.   The bill before us today would also make two less significant changes  which I believe the Republicans included to garner additional support  for the legislation. Nevertheless, even with these provisions, the  package should be soundly rejected.   Title I, which includes the version of H.R. 3978, TRID Improvement  Act of 2017, that the committee previously considered, would amend a  mortgage disclosure known as TRID or the know-before-you-owe disclosure  that informs home buyers of the terms and conditions of their mortgage.  Responding to the concerns of some in the real estate industry, this  provision would amend the disclosure to account for the discounts paid  to borrowers in States where simultaneous lender and buyer title  insurance is issued. However, the revised form does nothing for bars in  States that do not provide such special rates to home buyers, and the  provision eliminates the Consumer Bureau's ability to fix this aspect  of the form even if a problem arises in the future.  [[Page H1158]]    The final provision, title V, is identical to H.R. 2948, the SAFE  Mortgage Licensing Act. This title would ease the ability of  individuals employed as mortgage originators to change employers by  creating a temporary 120-day licensing regime so that they can continue  to work at their new employer.    This bill would effectively treat mortgage originators who work for  State registered firms the same as federally registered firms and was  unanimously supported by committee Democrats. Unfortunately, because  this legislation has been packaged with other deeply problematic and  destructive bills, sensible relief to these individuals that has broad  bipartisan support is being held hostage by Republicans' efforts to  roll back as many safeguards as they can this year.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 3978, as amended, threatens many of the important  reforms Democrats made to restore investor confidence to our capital  markets after the worst financial crisis in generations. As the stock  markets continue to wobble ominously in ways that threaten the savings  of hardworking Americans, Congress should be strengthening oversight of  the financial system, not weakening it.   Not surprisingly, H.R. 3978 is strongly opposed by the North American  Association of Securities Administrators who serve on the frontline  combating securities fraud on the State level and by nonpartisan  organization who speak on behalf of our Nation's consumers, investors,  and unions, including Consumer Federation of America, Center for  American Progress, Americans for Financial Reform, AFL-CIO, and Public  Citizen, and so do I.   Madam Speaker, I urge everyone to reject this harmful package of  bills and to vote ``no'' on H.R. 3978.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1530     Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, given the extreme volatility in the stock markets over  the past few weeks, I am particularly troubled by title II of this  bill, which would make it easier for high-frequency traders to evade  regulatory oversight of their potentially disruptive automated trading  algorithms.   This provision is widely opposed by nonpartisan consumer and investor  advocacy groups who recognize the impact automated trading has on our  markets.   Let me read for you excerpts from a few letters from these groups  that highlight the dangers of title 2.   Americans for Financial Reform--a coalition of more than 200  consumer, civil rights, investor, retiree community, labor, faith- based, and business groups--wrote: ``Title II would prevent regulators  from inspecting not only their raw source code used in automated  trading, but also any related intellectual property that `forms the  basis for the design of' source code. Examination of such intellectual  property would only be possible in an enforcement context pursuant to a  subpoena. This implies that the SEC would have to wait until the damage  was done through a `flash crash' or similar market disruption before  taking any action, which would have to be retrospective.   ``In light of the significance of automated trading to modern  markets, and the potential risk of high-frequency trading, it makes no  sense to tie the hands of regulators in examining detailed trading  strategies and methods of high frequency traders.''   The Center for American Progress cautioned that: ``But in an era of  fast-moving, `flash-crash'-prone markets, the SEC may have a wide range  of regulatory reasons for why it may need to examine source codes,  including approvals of new trading products or the supervision of  trading venues. The SEC should only exercise that authority carefully  and under the strictest protections for confidential information, but  blocking it by law dangerously limits the SEC's ability to address the  significant technology-based challenges to financial markets.''   The Consumer Federation of America, an association of nearly 300  consumer advocacy groups, similarly opposed title 2 because it ``would  weaken SEC oversight of algorithmic trading and hamstring the agency  from responding quickly to flash crashes or other market breakdowns.''   Further, the CFA wrote that: ``At a time when algorithmic trading is  taking on increased importance in our capital markets, this bill would  make it more difficult for the SEC to properly oversee such trading.                                time  1545    ``The bill would require the SEC to first issue a subpoena before it  could compel a person to produce or furnish to the SEC algorithmic  trading source code or `similar intellectual property.' This would  undermine the SEC's examination authority by creating a gaping hole in  its ability to gain access to firm records relevant to the examination.  It would also have a devastating effect on the agency's ability to  respond quickly in the event of another `flash crash' or such events in  the future. In order to oversee the markets effectively, the SEC needs  to be able to accurately and efficiently reconstruct order entry and  trading activity, including for algorithmic traders.''   Public Citizen, a consumer rights advocacy group with over 400,000  members and supporters, wrote: ``Market volatility caused not by real  events such as outbreak of a war, but by computers, including computer  glitches, threatens to erase savings to some innocent investors and  erodes general investor confidence. The recent swings in the markets  attest to the need for robust and urgent supervisory inspection. The  May 6, 2010 `Flash Crash,' where markets collapsed by more than $1  trillion in less than an hour, revealed that such a robust and urgent  supervision has been lacking. The SEC required nearly a half year to  investigate this incident before identifying a flawed algorithmic at  one major trader. SEC oversight should be streamlined, not hampered.  Trading instructions and records of human traders are already subject  to inspection, so it should be no different for those instructions and  records generated by a machine. Hiding source code from regulatory  scrutiny will leave those responsible for mistakes as well as those  attempting to manipulate markets unaccountable.''   These letters demonstrate the wide opposition to title II by groups  that truly understand that robust oversight of algorithmic trading is  necessary for the help of our makers.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record letters from these groups.                                                  February 13, 2018.      Please vote NO on H.R. 3299 and H.R. 3978.       Hon. Member,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Hon. Member: On behalf of more than 400,000 members       and supporters of Public Citizen, we ask you to vote NO on       H.R. 3299 and H.R. 3978, which are expected to be considered       by the full House on Wednesday, February 14, 2018. Provisions       in these bills would expose borrowers to abusive loans,       investors to dubious securities, and Americans generally to a       riskier financial system.  [[Page H1160]]         H.R. 3299, the Protecting Consumers' Access to Credit Act       of 2017, would allow predatory lenders to escape state limits       on high interest rates. The bill would nullify the Second       Circuit Court ruling in Madden v. Midland Funding. That       decision provided that a financial institution that buys       loans originated by a national bank could not benefit from       the National Bank Act's preemption of state interest rate       caps. While the Madden decision did not limit interest rates       that banks charge on credit, it does limit nonbanks from       evading state interest rate caps. This bill would pave the       way for payday lenders, financial technology (fintech)       companies and others to exploit that loophole and use a       ``rent-a-bank'' arrangement in order to charge high interest       rates. Twenty state Attorneys General have written to oppose       this measure, noting that it undermines their efforts to       protect borrowers from abusive loan rates. We urge you to       oppose this bill.        H.R. 3978, the TRID Improvement Act of 2017, is actually a       package of bills that were considered separately in the House       Financial Services Committee. One of these is the Financial       Stability Oversight Council Improvement Act (formerly H.R.       4061). This measure would add numerous procedural       requirements for the Financial Stability Oversight Council       (FSOC) when it considers the designation or continued       designation of a nonbank firm as a systemically important       financial institution (SIFI). Current rules already make SIFI       designation a high hurdle. The case of MetLife, for example,       shows that firms enjoy more than ample methods to contest       designation. After FSOC designated MetLife as systemically       important, it contested it in court and the case is pending.       Increasing the government's burden for designation would       restrict its ability to apply enhanced supervision to major       institutions. However, the largest bailout of the 2008       financial crash went to AIG, a nonbank engaged in reckless       derivatives activity beyond the purview of banking       supervisors. We oppose this measure.        Another bill contained in H.R. 3978 is the Fostering       Innovation Act (previously H.R. 1645). This bill amends       Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) law by increasing       from five to 10 years the time that CEOs of firms with less       than $50 million in revenue must attest to the accuracy of       their financial reporting. Congress approved SOX in response       to the accounting scandals at the turn of the millennium. The       rules are designed to promote accounting accuracy to the       shareholders who have entrusted their savings to these firms.       A Government Accountability Office (GAO) report found that       companies with inferior financial reporting controls have a       significantly higher likelihood of issuing a restatement of       their financial accounts. Firms that are unwilling to oblige       SOX should not be trusted with the capital of savers.       Extending the CEO attestation requirement from five to 10       years exacerbates the problem. From an investor perspective,       accounting safeguards are more important for smaller       companies, since larger companies generally attract a larger       and more sophisticated base of stock and bond holders who can       perform effective oversight. We oppose this measure.        A third bill that is part of the H.R. 3978 package is the       National Securities Exchange Regulatory Parity Act (formerly       H.R. 4546). This bill would eliminate state supervision of       securities if they are listed on an exchange, even if the       exchange has reduced standards compared with those of major       exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange. Under current       law, state supervision is pre-empted only if the security is       listed on exchanges with rules overseen by the Securities and       Exchange Commission (SEC). Rules may differ between       exchanges, but they must be approved by the SEC to ensure       that they prevent fraud, serve the public interest and       protect investors. Moreover, exchanges must adopt and enforce       rules that are ``substantially similar'' to the major       exchanges, known formally as ``Named Markets,'' under current       law. The existing system deters a race to the bottom, where       an exchange may attempt to attract companies with weaker       rules. Conversely, this bill would actually promote that race       to the bottom by removing the requirement that the exchange       adopt rules that are substantially similar to those of the       Named Markets. We oppose this measure.        A fourth measure in H.R. 3978 is the Protection of Source       Code Act, (formerly H.R. 3948). This measure would impede the       ability of the SEC to conduct effective compliance       examinations of market volatility involving computer-driven       algorithms. The bill imposes a strict subpoena requirement       before staff could inspect otherwise routine business records       that involve source code. Market volatility caused not by       real events such as the outbreak of a war, but by computers,       including computer glitches, threatens to erase savings to       some innocent investors and erodes general investor       confidence. The recent swings in the markets attest to the       need for robust and urgent supervisory inspection. The May 6,       2010 ``Flash Crash,'' where markets collapsed by more than $1       trillion in less than an hour, revealed that such robust and       urgent supervision has been lacking. The SEC required nearly       a half year to investigate this incident before identifying a       flawed algorithm at one major trader. SEC oversight should be       streamlined, not hampered. Trading instructions and records       of human traders are already subject to inspection, so it       should be no different for those instructions and records       generated by a machine. Hiding source code from regulatory       scrutiny will leave those responsible for mistakes as well as       those attempting to manipulate markets unaccountable. We       oppose this measure.        Because of our opposition to these elements in H.R. 3978       and to H.R. 3299 we urge you to vote NO on these bills. As we       are marking the 10th anniversary of the Wall Street Crash,       it's clear that American consumers and investors deserve       stronger financial reforms, not weakened protections that       will make our economy more susceptible to another collapse.        Thank you for your consideration. For questions, please       contact Bartlett Naylor.            Sincerely,      Public Citizen.                                   ____                                                       Americans for                                                Financial Reform,                                  Washington, DC, February 13, 2018.        Dear Representative: On behalf of Americans for Financial       Reform, we are writing to urge you to vote in opposition to       H.R. 3978, which is being considered on the House floor       today. This legislation is a grab bag of bad legislative       ideas that should never have advanced through the House       Financial Services Committee. Especially notable given the       recent wild swings in stock prices, Title II of this bill       would sharply limit the ability of the Securities and       Exchange Commission (SEC) to investigate high-frequency       automated trading strategies that can disrupt markets. But       that is hardly the only harmful bill in this package. There       are several other provisions that would weaken consumer and       investor protections.        Title I, ``TRID Improvement,'' would amend the TILA/RESPA       Integrated Disclosure Rule (also known as TRID) to change how       title insurance fees are disclosed, in a manner that would       increase confusion and potentially misinform consumers as to       the final cost of these important fees. The title insurance       market already lacks transparency and fairness; fees are       grossly inflated in relation to the value of the insurance.       The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) carefully       studied this issue in its rulemaking to determine the       clearest and most accurate way to disclose fees in light of       varying state laws on title insurance and differences in       practices by different companies. The changes in the       statutory language here would limit the CFPB's authority to       create a consistent method of disclosure across different       companies and different states, and to reflect ways in which       title insurance costs can change at closing. Further       refinement in title insurance disclosures can be addressed       through rulemaking by the CFPB itself in consultation with       stakeholders.        Title II, ``Protection of Source Code,'' would severely       restrict the ability of the SEC to examine the detailed       trading strategies of high-frequency traders or automated       traders, even in cases where such traders posed a risk to       markets or the financial system. Title II would prevent       regulators from inspecting not only the raw source code used       in automated trading, but also any related intellectual       property that ``forms the basis for the design of'' source       code. Examination of such intellectual property would only be       possible in an enforcement context pursuant to a subpoena.       This implies that the SEC would have to wait until the damage       was done through a ``flash crash'' or similar market       disruption before taking any action, which would have to be       retrospective.        In light of the significance of automated trading to modern       markets, and the potential risks of high frequency trading,       it makes no sense to tie the hands of regulators in examining       detailed trading strategies and methods of high frequency       traders. At any brokerage, trading instructions to a human       trader, including the conditions under which such a trade       would be carried out (e.g., a limit order) are part of the       books and records routinely open to inspection by FINRA or       the SEC. Trading instructions must not be exempt from       inspection simply because they are automated. They should be       part of the books and records of the organization, just as       other order-related documents are. Intellectual property       related to source code clearly involves trading strategies,       which have always been a subject for regulatory inspection       and oversight.        The continued high volatility on Wall Street is giving       evidence of the potential systemic dangers of high-frequency       automated trading. Now is not the time to tie the SEC's hands       in doing oversight of such trading.        Title III, ``Fostering Innovation,'' would double the time       for which certain new public companies are exempt from key       financial reporting controls, most notably attestation by an       auditor that their earnings and accounting are accurate. It       grants this exemption to a class of companies, newly public       companies with low revenue growth, which have a particular       strong incentive to manipulate their financial statements and       deceive investors. This piece of the legislation would both       harm investors and undermine the integrity of our capital       markets.        Title IV, ``National Securities Exchange Regulatory       Parity,'' would dangerously expand Federal pre-emption from       state securities laws designed to protect investors from       securities fraud. Under current law, a national securities       exchange needs to meet listing standards similar to those of       a major national exchange--e.g., the New York Stock Exchange,       NASDAQ--for its securities to be deemed ``covered       securities.'' Under this  [[Page H1161]]       classification, securities enjoy the advantages of exemptions       from state-level regulations.        Title IV in H.R. 3978 would amend the Securities Act of       1933 to remove the requirement that companies meet listing       standards rigorous enough to be considered similar to those       of major exchanges, effectively allowing riskier, less liquid       securities to qualify as ``covered securities'' and avoid       state securities laws designed to protect investors and       financial markets. Under this section of H.R. 3978, a       security would be exempt from state-level fraud protections       as long as it is traded on a national exchange that is a       member of the National Market System. This would mean that       securities could be pre-empted from the oversight of state       securities regulators without meeting the strong standards       that the SEC has laid out for individual securities to       qualify for preemption under Section 18 of the Securities       Act.        Both the North American Securities Administrators       Association (NASAA), the main body of state securities       regulators, and the chief securities regulator for the       Commonwealth of Massachusetts have made the dangers of this       legislation clear in strongly worded opposition letters. In       these letters, they advocated for fair and rigorous listing       standards as essential to protect retail investors and       savers, to maintain high standards for corporate governance,       and to avoid conflicts of interests that harm investors.       Title IV of H.R. 3978 unacceptably weakens these listing       standards.        The sections of H.R. 3978 discussed above are,       individually, bad bills for consumers and investors rights       and protections. Packaging them together only worsens the       harm. We urge you to reject H.R. 3978.        Thank you for your attention to this matter. For more       information please contact AFR's Policy Director, Marcus       Stanley.            Sincerely,      Americans for Financial Reform.                                   ____                                     Mortgage Bankers Association,                                  Washington, DC, February 13, 2018.      Hon. Paul Ryan, Speaker of the House,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Jeb Hensarling,      Chairman, House Financial Services Committee, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Maxine Waters,      Ranking Member, House Financial Services Committee, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan, Leader Pelosi, Chairman Hensarling and       Ranking Member Waters: On behalf of the Mortgage Bankers       Association (MBA), I am writing to express our support for       H.R. 3978, the TRID Improvement Act, which the House of       Representatives will vote on this week. I would highlight       MBA's strong support for the inclusion of two individual       bills--H R. 2948 and the previously free-standing H.R. 3978--      within this updated vehicle.        MBA enthusiastically supports the inclusion of Title V,       Section 501, entitled ``Eliminating barriers to jobs for loan       originators,'' within the newly re-packaged bill. The Secure       and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing (SAFE) Act of       2008 created two parallel but asymmetrical regimes for       mortgage loan originators (MLOs) that have resulted in uneven       consumer protections and an un-level playing field for       mortgage originators. The SAFE Act requires MLOs employed by       non-bank lenders to be licensed, which includes pre-licensing       and annual continuing education requirements, passage of a       comprehensive test, and criminal and financial background       reviews conducted by state regulators. These MLOs are also       registered in the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and       Registry (NMLS). By contrast, MLOs employed by federally-      insured depositories or their affiliates must only be       registered in the NMLS, and do not have to pass a test or       meet specific education requirements.        The result is a two-tiered system that inhibits job       mobility for loan officers and makes it difficult for non-      bank lenders to compete for talented employees. Rather than       leaving a job on a Friday and starting a new job on a Monday,       an MLO who moves from a bank to a non-bank lender must sit       idle for weeks, and sometimes months, unable to engage in       loan origination activities while they complete the SAFE       Act's licensing and testing requirements -- despite the fact       they have already been registered in the NMLS and originating       loans. This bill promotes a fair and competitive labor market       by eliminating barriers to the ability of non-bank lenders       (especially small lenders) to compete for talented staff, and       allowing MLOs to more easily move to the employer that offers       them the best chance to succeed.        Section 501 of the bill is a bipartisan, narrow solution       that would provide ``transitional authority'' to originate       mortgages for individuals who change corporate affiliation       from a federally-insured institution to a non-bank lender, or       move across state lines, while they work to meet the SAFE       Act's licensing and testing requirements. Transitional       authority would be available only to MLOs that have a clean       history as an originator (e.g., no license denials,       revocations or suspensions, cease and desist orders, or       felonies that preclude licensing).        MBA is especially grateful for the leadership of the bill's       author, Representative Steve Stivers (R-OH), as well as its       bipartisan original cosponsors: Representatives Joyce Beatty       (D-OH), Bruce Poliquin (R-ME), and Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ).       Last Congress, the bill was unanimously reported from the       House Financial Services Committee, and shortly thereafter       passed the full House of Representatives under suspension of       the rules. Again, late last year, the bill was reported from       committee by a unanimous vote of 60-0.        MBA also supports Title I, Section 101, entitled ``TRID       Improvement'', of the newly re-packaged bill, as originally       introduced as a free-standing vehicle by Representatives       French Hill (R-AR) and Ruben Kihuen (D-NV). This section       would amend the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA)       to require the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to       allow the accurate disclosure of title insurance premiums and       any potential available discounts to homebuyers. Under       current regulations, the CFPB does not permit title insurance       companies to disclose available discounts for lender's title       insurance on the government-mandated disclosure forms. This       creates inconsistencies in mortgage documents and causes       confusion for consumers. This section would minimize that       confusion by allowing title insurance companies to disclose       available discounts and accurate title insurance premiums to       consumers across the country.        MBA urges all members of the House to support the newly       reframed H.R. 3978. Thank you for your consideration of our       views on this bill, which will help promote a more       competitive real estate finance market and thereby enhance       overall economic development and growth.            Sincerely,                                                   Bill Killmer,                                  Senior Vice President, Legislative                                             and Political Affairs.     Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to  whether or not the chairman has more speakers?    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, it has become par for the course for the majority to  recklessly advance harmful deregulatory packages like H.R. 3978. My  friends on the other side of the aisle are moving forward with  regulatory roadblocks at a furious pace, pushing dangerous bills  through the House nearly every week.   It appears that they may have already completely forgotten a way that  lacks financial regulation and allowed the crisis in 2008 to occur.  That crisis badly damaged the whole economy and harmed all of our  constituents. The impact was enormous: $13 trillion in household wealth  was lost; 11 million people lost their homes to foreclosure; and the  unemployment rate reached 10 percent.   Democrats responded by enacting Wall Street reform to ensure that  consumers, investors, and our economy are protected from reckless  actors and bad practices, but now Republicans cannot wait to take us  back to the bad old days. It makes no sense.   As we have discussed, the package of bills now before us guts  important financial protections at a time when markets are already  experiencing turmoil. It would allow high-frequency traders to  manipulate the stock markets undetected, encourage a regulatory race to  the bottom at our Nation's stock exchanges, and harm investors by  weakening efforts to detect accounting fraud at smaller public  companies. This package of bills threatens important progress we have  made to reduce risk in the financial system and return investor  confidence.   In recent weeks, we have seen volatile markets that threaten the  savings of hardworking American families. These circumstances should  serve as a clear reminder that Congress should be strengthening  oversight of the financial system, not weakening it by undermining or  removing important protections.   H.R. 3978 is strongly opposed by our State's security cops, who are  at the front line of combating fraud, and it is opposed by groups  representing consumers, investors, and unions.   Madam Speaker, for all of these reasons, I urge Members to oppose  H.R. 3978, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record  the following letters of opposition.                                   Center for American Progress,                                  Washington, DC, February 13, 2018.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Democratic Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: The Center for       American Progress (``CAP'') is writing today to express       opposition to H.R. 4061, the Financial Stability Oversight       Council Improvement Act of 2017, which is included as Title       VI of the revised H.R. 3978 package. It is our understanding       that the revised H.R. 3978 package will be considered on the       floor of the House of Representatives this week, so we       welcome the chance to share our concerns regarding this       legislation with you and your Members.        In short, this bill erodes a vital new financial regulatory       tool implemented following the devastating 2007-2008       financial crisis. If enacted, the U.S. financial regulatory       structure will be less equipped to handle risks that build up       outside of the traditional banking sector--making the       financial sector as a whole more vulnerable to another shock       and economic downturn. Americans paid for the last crisis       with their jobs, homes, and savings, while banks and other       financial institutions were bailed out. This bill       inexplicably makes a repeat of that economic calamity more       likely.        The 2007-2008 financial crisis demonstrated that excessive       risk could build up outside of the traditional banking       sector. Nonbank financial institutions like Lehman Brothers,       Bear Stearns, and AIG did not face the type of oversight and       regulatory standards warranted by their systemic importance.       The failure or near-failure of these institutions threatened       the stability of the U.S. financial sector. AIG and Bear       Stearns were bailed out accordingly, while the failure of       Lehman Brothers brought the global financial system to the       brink of collapse. The crisis also revealed that no one       financial regulator had a system-wide mandate, meaning       individual regulators were only focused on their respective       segments of the financial sector. This left financial       regulators in the dark regarding risks that built up across       different parts of the sector or that emerged in       underregulated parts of the sector.        In the wake of the financial crisis, President Obama worked       with Congress to pass the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and       Consumer Protection Act--the most significant financial       regulatory reforms enacted since the Great Depression. One       important pillar of Dodd-Frank was the creation of the       Financial Stability Oversight Council (``FSOC''), a new       systemic risk regulatory body. The FSOC was created to bring       the disparate financial regulators together to identify and       mitigate threats to financial stability. The most important       tool given to the FSOC to fulfill this mission is the       authority to subject a nonbank financial company to enhanced       oversight and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board if       material distress at the company, or the company's       activities, could threaten financial stability. The FSOC has       used this designation authority sparingly and only after a       thorough, multi-stage review process in which the FSOC       communicates extensively with the company and the company's       primary regulators.        H.R. 4061 would add multiple additional hurdles to the       FSOC's already-rigorous designation process. The proposed       changes would add an estimated two years to the designation       process, meaning it would take roughly four years for the       FSOC to designate a nonbank financial company that could       threaten U.S. financial stability. The four-year estimate       does not even factor in the time it will take for the legal       proceedings to play out when a company challenges the       designation in court. The legal challenge by MetLife took       years, and likely would have taken longer if the Trump       administration didn't agree to stop pursuing the case. If       anything, this bill increases the procedural issues a       designated company could raise in court. H.R. 4061       practically invites a legal filibuster of the designation. It       renders the designation authority nearly useless. Hollowing       out this crucial post-crisis authority makes it far more       likely that an underregulated systemically important nonbank       will cause or aggravate the next financial crisis.        Contrary to critics of the FSOC, it is not a rigid body and       has in the past responded to legitimate process and       transparency suggestions. In 2015, after soliciting public       comment, the FSOC adopted 17 changes to its designation       process and transparency policies The current designation       process in place is rigorous and appropriately thorough. H.R.       4061 would add no less than nine new bureaucratic steps.       These proposed changes are excessive, and the intent is       clear: To prevent the FSOC from using this vital tool.        This legislation is even more concerning given the actions       Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Chairman of the FSOC, has       taken since the start of the Trump administration. The FSOC,       under Mnuchin's leadership, has: (i) rescinded the       designation of AIG, the company that received a $182 billion       bailout during the crisis; (ii) slashed the FSOC's budget and       staff; (iii) dropped the legal proceedings regarding       MetLife's designation; (iv) signaled that Prudential's       designation may be rescinded this year; and (v) recommended       some deeply concerning additional changes to the FSOC's       designation process in a report published in late 2017.       Further restricting the FSOC's authority at a time when it is       being dismantled from within would be a grave mistake.        For these reasons, CAP recommends that Members vote ``NO''       when the revised H.R. 3978 package of bills, which includes       H.R. 4061, is considered on the floor.        If you have any questions about this letter or would like       to discuss these issues further, please contact Gregg       Gelzinis.            Sincerely,                                                 Gregg Gelzinis,                                        Research Assistant, Economic      Policy, Center for American Progress.                                   ____                                                  February 13, 2018.        Dear Representative, The undersigned organizations urge you       to vote against H.R. 3978, the TRID Improvement Act. The       bill, which amends Section 2603 of RESPA, would create       confusion and undermine consistency in mortgage disclosures.       In particular, the bill would make it harder for consumers to       understand how much they are paying for title insurance, a       required fee that already lacks a transparent, functioning       market.        In 2007, a GAO report concluded that borrowers ``have       little or no influence over the price of title insurance but       have little choice but to purchase it.'' Instead, the lender       typically chooses the insurer. As a result, the fees are       grossly inflated in relation to the value of the insurance.       Recent studies have found that barely 5% to 11% of premiums       are paid out in claims. Almost the entirety of a title       insurance premium goes to commissions, not insurance       coverage. In contrast, for health insurance, minimally 80% of       premiums are returned to consumers in claim payouts and the       loss ratios for auto insurance fluctuate between 50% and 70%.       Borrowers already pay inflated title insurance costs.       Increased confusion in title insurance price disclosures       would only serve to exacerbate the problems in the market       with transparency and fairness.  [[Page H1165]]         The method required by the Consumer Financial Protection       Bureau for disclosing title insurance premiums reduces       consumer confusion and enhances consistency between the       estimated and final loan cost disclosures. The bill would       change the final loan disclosure, decreasing consistency with       the initial disclosure. As a result, it would increase       consumer confusion, especially where the consumer opts not to       purchase both lender and owner policies (only the lender       policy is required) after getting the early disclosure       containing both.        The bill's requirement to disclose the ``actual'' cost of       the insurance will lead to confusion in almost half of the       states because the calculation of premiums is not       standardized under state law and title companies within those       states do not provide comparable rates. In contrast, the CFPB       regulations take into account that comparison shopping in       such states is not possible and provides a standardized       approach. Further refinement of the title insurance       disclosures can be addressed by the CFPB itself in       cooperation with stakeholders to ensure any outstanding       issues are addressed with the input of all affected parties.        We urge you not to undermine the CFPB's careful rules for       restoring transparency and market competition to the title       insurance market. Please vote no on H.R. 3978.            Sincerely,      Americans for Financial Reform.      Center for Responsible Lending.      National Association of Consumer Advocates.

Dear Representative: We understand the House is scheduled       to vote this week on H.R. 3978, the ``TRID Improvement Act.''       While we did not take a position on this bill when it came       before the House Financial Services Committee, we urge you to       oppose it now that it includes the following extraneous,       anti-investor bills: H.R. 3948, the ``Protection of Source       Code Act;'' H.R. 1645, the ``Fostering Innovation Act;'' and       H.R. 4546, the ``National Securities Exchange Regulatory       Parity Act.'' Each of these bills would harm investors and       undermine the integrity of our capital markets.        H.R. 1645, the ``Fostering Innovation Act,'' would make       financial accounting fraud more likely.        This legislation would extend the period of time in which       certain public companies would be exempt from a requirement       that provides important protections against financial       reporting errors, including errors that are the result of       fraud. That is the requirement under Section 404(b) of the       Sarbanes-Oxley Act that requires auditors, as part of their       audits of public company financial statements, to assess and       attest to the adequacy of the company's internal controls to       ensure accurate financial reporting. This bill would extend       this exemption for up to five years to a class of companies,       including those that have gone public but may be struggling       to produce significant revenues, that could have a particular       incentive to manipulate their financial statements in order       to attract more capital. Companies should not be permitted to       raise capital in the public markets if they do not have       adequate controls in place to prevent financial reporting       errors and fraud. And auditors cannot reasonably attest to       the accuracy of a company's financial statements without       carefully assessing those controls. Requiring auditors to       attest to the adequacy of those controls as part of the       financial statement audit contributes to the market       transparency and integrity that is essential to a healthy       capital formation process. Moreover, the number and severity       of financial restatements has declined since the requirement       was adopted, which demonstrates that these requirements have       benefited the market significantly. Because this legislation       would make financial accounting fraud more likely, we oppose       it. Furthermore, because this legislation is being attached       to the TRID bill, we urge you to oppose the entire package.        H.R. 3948, the ``Protection of Source Code Act,'' would       weaken SEC oversight of algorithmic trading and hamstring the       agency from responding quickly to flash crashes or other       market breakdowns.        At a time when algorithmic trading is taking on increased       importance in our capital markets, this bill would make it       more difficult for the SEC to properly oversee such trading.       The bill would require the SEC to first issue a subpoena       before it could compel a person to produce or furnish to the       SEC algorithmic trading source code or ``similar intellectual       property.'' This would undermine the SEC's examination       authority by creating a gaping hole in its ability to gain       access to firm records relevant to the examination. It would       also have a devastating effect on the agency's ability to       respond quickly in the event of another ``flash crash'' or       other such events in the future. In order to oversee the       markets effectively, the SEC needs to be able to accurately       and efficiently reconstruct order entry and trading activity,       including for algorithmic traders. Because this legislation       would weaken SEC oversight of algorithmic trading and       hamstring the agency from responding quickly to flash crashes       or other market breakdowns, we oppose it. Furthermore,       because this legislation is being attached to the TRID bill,       we urge you to oppose the entire package.        H.R. 4546, the ``National Securities Exchange Regulatory       Parity Act,'' would drastically weaken standards for       securities to be listed and traded on exchanges.        H.R. 4546 would change the terms on which securities are       deemed ``covered securities,'' and thus exempt from state       oversight. It would do so by removing any requirement that       these securities have to meet conditions comparable to the       current listing standards on leading national exchanges.       Instead, any security listed on an exchange that is a member       of the National Market System (NMS) would be exempt from       state regulation and oversight. Because the bill would not       establish any core quantitative or qualitative requirements       for covered securities to replace those eliminated by the       bill, it would likely accelerate an already troubling race to       the bottom in listing standards among NMS members. Moreover,       the bill does not sufficiently protect against the       possibility that a venture exchange could eventually be       established specifically to meet the bill's requirements for       state preemption. If this were to occur, smaller, more local       offerings typically overseen by states could be ``designated       as qualified for trading'' on such an exchange without any       assurance that they can meet basic quantitative and       qualitative standards designed to ensure investors are       appropriately protected. In short, this bill would eliminate       protections afforded by state oversight, fail to replace the       current meaningful protections afforded by high listing       standards with a comparable alternative, and leave investors       without any reasonable hope that the SEC will be able to       provide effective oversight at the federal level. Because       this legislation would drastically weaken standards for       securities to be listed and traded on exchanges, we oppose       it. Furthermore, because this legislation is being attached       to the TRID bill, we urge you to oppose the entire package.        The TRID bill should not be used as a vehicle to pass       extraneous, anti-investor bills. Because the bills attached       to the TRID bill would harm investors and undermine the       integrity of our capital markets, we urge you to vote no on       the entire package when H.R. 3978 comes to the floor this       week.            Respectfully submitted,      Barbara Roper,        Director of Investor Protection.      Micah Hauptman,        Financial Services Counsel.     Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to  the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, the current language of  title II of H.R. 3978 would require SEC examination staff to obtain a  subpoena before it could inspect any source code whatsoever, including,  for example, computer code reflecting a firm's adherence to the SEC's  cybersecurity regulations.   The amendment offered by Mr. Foster would narrow the requirement in  title II to only apply to proprietary source code related to  algorithmic trading. While I applaud Mr. Foster and the amendment's  cosponsor, Mr. Scott, for narrowing the overbroad language of title II,  the amendment cannot fix this untimely and ill-advised legislation.  Even as amended, title II would undermine effective oversight of the  high-frequency traders that simultaneously create and stand to benefit  from the kind of extreme market volatility that we have seen in the  past few weeks.   Let's not forget that, on May 6, 2010, in an event referred to as the  ``flash crash,'' major U.S. stock indices inexplicably plummeted nearly  $1 trillion in less than an hour before mostly rebounding. Alarmingly,  market regulators took nearly 5 months to determine that the flash  crash was caused by a combination of a flawed execution algorithm of  one institutional investor and aggressive algorithmic trading by HFTs.   While it is too early to tell exactly what created the recent  volatility in the U.S. stock market, market analysts have suggested  that algorithmic trading has played a central role. In fact, just last  Tuesday, the day after the Dow Jones Industrial Average saw its biggest  one-day point drop in history, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin  testified before the House Financial Services Committee that  algorithmic trading ``definitely had an impact on market moves.''   Given the importance of algorithmic trading in our stock market, it  makes no sense to obstruct the SEC's access to the information that  enables such activity merely because it exists in an electronic format.  Americans who have trillions of their dollars in 401(k) and other  retirement and savings plans deserve the SEC's best efforts in  investigating and mitigating computer-driven market disruptions. For  this reason and for all of these reasons, and given my broader concerns  that the bill would significantly harm investor confidence in our  markets even if the amendment is adopted, I am urging a ``no'' vote on  H.R. 3978.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the  yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
