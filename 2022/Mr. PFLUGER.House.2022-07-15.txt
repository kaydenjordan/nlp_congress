 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Washington  for yielding time.   Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Democrats' extreme pro- abortion agenda.   Today, I am voting against two bills that go far beyond Roe v. Wade,  which is the decision to move these types of unenumerated decisions to  the State level, as the Constitution clearly says, backed up by the  Supreme Court.   But what my Democrat colleagues are pushing would permit elective  abortions, up to and including a baby's due date, an extreme position  legalizing abortion based on the child's race, sex, or disability.  Tragic.   Another of their initiatives opens up dangerous loopholes for child  traffickers to cover up their crimes by forcing victims to receive  abortions across State lines, and it criminalizes those who might  encourage delaying an abortion, including parents or healthcare  providers. Parents.   Since the overturn of Roe v. Wade, Democrats at all levels, including  the White House, have spread misinformation and fear surrounding the  decision. Presenting the killing of a child as a woman's only avenue to  success in her career or life is inhumane and wrong.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to vote against these  bills.
