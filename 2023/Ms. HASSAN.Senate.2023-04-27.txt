 Madam President, I am honored to recognize Robert  and Linda Burlock of Berlin as April's Granite Staters of the Month.  For half a century, the couple has shown tremendous dedication to their  community by continually welcoming new families and residents moving  into the East Side of Berlin.   Throughout the time that Robert--``Bobby''--and Linda have lived on  Grafton Street in Berlin, every time newcomers have arrived, they have  made it their personal mission to welcome them. They are the unofficial  ambassadors for the neighborhood. One time, when Bobby saw from across  the street two newcomers struggling to move their furniture, he sprung  up to help. He originally had taken days off of work to relax and lay  back, but instead, he spent the next few days helping the newcomers  settle in. Another time, when a neighbor's father passed away, Bobby  helped her clean out her father's garage, a task that would have been  daunting if done alone. When heavy snow covered Grafton Street, Bobby  would send over a buddy with a snow plow to his neighbors' yards, and  when their front yards were overgrown with grass, he would offer to mow  their lawns. Linda worked in lockstep with her husband to welcome the  newcomers, always inviting them over for drinks and quickly forging  strong friendships. For every new neighbor, she would always make a  dish to send over as a welcome gesture.   Beyond any single act of assistance, Bobby and Linda have developed a  sense of community in Berlin that is truly special. When their longtime  neighbor and good friend passed away a few years ago, a newcomer moved  in from New Jersey. Although he kept to himself at first, Bobby and  Linda were determined to get to know him, and soon enough they were  good friends. Bobby says that he now sees his new neighbor as another  son.   Bobby and Linda's generosity leaves a lasting impact on the people  that they assist, showing neighbors, new and old, that everybody  counts. And they set an example for all Granite Staters by showing that  each and every one of us can make a difference in our own community. I  hope that all Granite Staters are inspired by Bobby and Linda's story  and follow their example of extending kindness to strangers, since our  communities are only as strong as their individual members. Bobby and  Linda are a shining example of the Granite State spirit of kindness and  generosity, and I am glad to honor the neighborhood spirit that they  have created on the East Side of Berlin.                            ____________________
