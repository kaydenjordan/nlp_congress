 Madam Speaker, on Friday, I was  grateful to travel on Air Force One to Charlotte with my colleagues  from South Carolina, Ralph Norman and William Timmons, along with our  colleagues from North Carolina, Virginia Foxx, Patrick McHenry, Richard  Hudson, Mark Meadows, Mark Walker, Ted Budd,  Dan Bishop, and Greg  Murphy.   WIS-TV News of Columbia reported the President spoke at the North  Carolina Opportunity Now Summit at Central Piedmont Community College.  President Trump highlighted the impact opportunity zones have made and  announced a new nationwide initiative called Opportunity Now.   ``Under my administration, we work to restore the American promise of  upward mobility,'' President Trump said. ``We want everyone to get  ahead and get ahead big league.''   Over the weekend, everywhere I went, citizens praised President  Donald Trump with victory in the impeachment hoax as acquitted,  exonerated, vindicated, not guilty, innocent, empowered, esteemed, and  cleared.   Madam Speaker, I congratulate President Donald Trump.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
