 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, with Vladimir Putin's ruthless invasion of  Ukraine--and a new generation of threats on the horizon with AI and  emerging technologies--America's military readiness has never been more  important. That is why, today, I am pleased to speak in support of the  National Defense Authorization Act for the fiscal year 2024.   I want to thank Chairman Jack Reed of Rhode Island and Ranking Member  Roger Wicker of Mississippi for their leadership as well as their staff  work. And because of that, the Senate will soon vote on a national  defense package that will protect the men and women in uniform, defend  our Nation's interests, and support our allies.   For the 63rd year in a row, this bipartisan agreement will authorize  necessary funding for our Nation's security. I hope we will pass it  without delay.   This year's National Defense Authorization Act authorizes a topline  of nearly $886 billion, including $844 billion for the Pentagon. This  is a $28 billion increase compared to our current fiscal year, and a  more than $100 billion increase compared to the last year.   Now, that may come as a surprise if you listen to the political  speeches, given that some voices on the right have cried that our  defense spending is falling so far behind.   The fact is this: This is the largest defense budget in the history  of the United States ever--the largest defense budget ever.  Importantly, it provides a more than 5-percent pay increase for our  troops and our Pentagon's civilian workforce. That is the largest  increase in decades--the largest increase in decades--and it is well- deserved.   This bill also expands employment opportunities for military spouses,  funding for childcare, improved military housing, the quality of life  elements that we absolutely owe the men and women in uniform.   It will ensure that our Nation can ward off threats from China and  North Korea, with strong investments in the Pacific Deterrence  Initiative. It addresses shortfalls in recruitment and improves our  cyber defense capabilities. This year's NDAA also includes a number of  provisions that I helped to author, including proposals that will  support the administration's AUKUS agreement, boost Impact Aid funding  for school districts that serve military families, strengthen digital  manufacturing for future technologies, and authorize key Illinois  military construction projects.   In addition to funding our Nation's long-term priorities, this  package also will provide military aid to our friends in Ukraine and  our allies throughout Europe, including the Baltics. Nearly 18 months  after Putin began his full-scale invasion, Ukraine remains on the  frontlines of democracy. And as I saw recently in Vilnius last week,  during this year's NATO summit, the Ukrainian people's heroism and  determination continues to rally the western alliance in their support.   Today's NATO is larger and stronger than ever. It is more united than  ever. And the United States must continue to do everything in our power  to maintain the strength and unity of this alliance.   I want to give special recognition to President Biden. When he was  elected to the Presidency, he told me this story and shared it with  others, that in the first meeting of the NATO alliance, there was a  fundamental question that was asked: Is the United States still  committed to the NATO alliance?   It was an unthinkable question years ago, but not so when President  Biden came in office. The previous President, Donald Trump, raised  serious questions as to whether we viewed the NATO alliance as part of  our future and the future well-being of the world. President Joe Biden  made it clear from the start that he was committed to NATO. Even before  the Putin invasion of Ukraine, he made it clear that the alliance had a  future under his administration, and he has proven it.    I saw it last week in Vilnius. His arrival and commitment to future  support for Ukraine made a difference. It really mobilized not just the  members of the alliance, the 31 nations that are  [[Page S2970]]  a part of it, but other countries from around the world that wanted to  be there and testify--the Prime Minister of Japan, the President of  South Korea, the Prime Minister of Australia. None of those countries  are members of that alliance, but they wanted to be physically present  to make it clear that they stood in support of the alliance and its  goals and its values. I salute President Biden for his leadership in  bringing us to that moment.   Unfortunately, some lawmakers on the other side of the Capitol seem  ready to capitulate to Putin and other autocrats. Last week, the MAGA  majority in the House of Representatives voted to inject politics into  this Defense appropriations process. Thankfully, their amendment to  block U.S. support for Ukraine amid Putin's war of choice failed, even  though 89 House Republicans voted for it.   Think of that. Putin is killing innocent people in Ukraine every day.  They are begging us to stand with them, to defend their own country, to  defend democracy, and to give them a future that is aligned with NATO  and the West, and these 89 Republicans said: Cut them off. Don't give  them another nickel. That is the end of it.   What were they thinking? Where are their values?   Ultimately, the House passed a bill that would abandon our  servicemembers in other ways, along with our allies, and jeopardize our  national security in a new age of threats. The bill passed by the House  of Representatives would eliminate access to reproductive healthcare  for men and women in the military, politicize schoolbooks, and  undermine progress addressing the climate crisis and recordbreaking  heat.   If you paid any attention at all to weather forecasts across the  Nation over the last 2 weeks, how can you question that we are in a  real climate crisis? The city of Phoenix, AZ, last week had 3 days with  temperatures in excess of 115 degrees. The temperature of the globe  measured in scientific terms is the highest ever recorded. Extreme  weather events in New England and other places are fair warning to us  that if we don't take this seriously, the next generation, our children  and grandchildren, will face a world much more difficult to live in.   So MAGA Republicans in the House nevertheless want to rip away not  only the addressing of the climate crisis but also the basic freedoms  of every American, particularly those who defend our freedom every day.  They have hijacked a bipartisan process to pursue an extremist agenda.   The best explanation I can give for this irresponsible conduct is  ``Don't worry, the Senate will clean it up.'' Well, we will clean up  their mess. We have to. We need to do it on a bipartisan basis. But the  MAGA Republicans cannot prevail when we talk about our Nation's  defense.   Here in the Senate, one Republican, for instance, is blocking  hundreds of military promotions to advance that same extremist agenda.  Think about that. The men and women in service in our military, who  have risked their lives and seen their comrades and friends fall beside  them, who have been given combat awards for their bravery, are being  denied promotions because of one Senator, one Republican Senator from  Alabama, who has decided to stop the promotions for over 200 of these  deserving individuals. Is that our gratitude to the military for their  service to our country and their bravery?   I think it is awful that we are in this situation--indefensible. I  hope more and more Republican Senators will speak out against their  colleague and what he is doing to our military. It endangers our  national security, and it shows great disrespect to men and women who  deserve our highest level of respect.   As my colleague from Illinois, Senator Duckworth--and she being a  national hero herself for her service to our Nation--has pointed out,  this partisan charade by one Senator from Alabama has already had a  direct impact on our military readiness. For the first time, for  example, in over 100 years, the U.S. Marine Corps is without a Senate- confirmed Commandant. Everyone should take note of how extreme that  situation is. Very soon, the Army, Navy, and Joint Chiefs will be in a  similar position if the Senator from Alabama does not lift his hold.   So to my Republican colleagues who come to the floor and question  President Biden and the Democratic Party's commitment to national  security, I say: Take a look in the political mirror.   The National Defense Authorization Act we have before us is a serious  proposal, which, of course, means there are compromises included. And  while it will make important progress, this bill is far from perfect.  For instance, this bill once again, in my estimation, extends  unnecessary restrictions on transferring detainees from Guantanamo.  This will make it even harder to close this shameful facility once and  for all. The amount of money we ask taxpayers to spend on Guantanamo is  indefensible--millions and millions of dollars for each person who is  being held there after we have agreement that more than half of them  should be released. It is time to close Guantanamo, and this Senator  would like to see that done as part of this bill.   This bill also includes questionable provisions based on false  concerns regarding diversity and inclusion in our Armed Forces-- provisions that ultimately impair, not improve, military readiness.   I would like to see several of my amendments be considered, including  those that would hold accountable perpetrators of heinous atrocities in  Ukraine and elsewhere by criminalizing crimes against humanity;  strengthening public transparency on the impact of lethal strikes; push  the Pentagon toward technologies of the future, such as EVs; address  the troubling human rights record of countries such as Egypt which  claim to be our allies and friends in one breath and yet jail peaceful  activists in the next--and more. I am heartened that negotiations on a  second managers' package continue, and I look forward to seeing these  issues considered.    Lastly, I hope any increase in defense spending is matched by a  similar increase in nondefense discretionary spending to keep parity  between the two accounts. The reality is this: While it is important to  provide robust spending for national security, it is equally important  to invest in America--schools, roads, hospitals, and beyond. Simply  put, our strength at home projects strength abroad.   I look forward to working with my colleagues on these issues before  we leave for the August recess.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm  Rachel Bloomekatz to an Ohio seat on the Sixth Circuit Court of  Appeals.   Ms. Bloomekatz is a longtime appellate litigator who has represented  a diverse range of clients, across the political and ideological  spectrum, throughout her career. She received her bachelor's degree  from Harvard College and her law degree from the University of  California, Los Angeles School of Law, before clerking for Judge Guido  Calabresi on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.   Following this role, Ms. Bloomekatz clerked for Chief Justice  Margaret H. Marshall of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court and  spent 1 year serving as an assistant attorney general in the  Massachusetts Attorney General's office. She then clerked for Justice  Breyer on the U.S. Supreme Court.   She later entered private practice, where she focused on protecting  voting rights and holding government actors accountable. During this  time, she represented a wide variety of clients on appellate matters,  including, in one case, representing one of our Republican colleagues  in the Senate.   Today, Ms. Bloomekatz works as a solo practitioner. And throughout  her legal career, she has amassed significant experience briefing and  arguing dozens of Federal and State appeals. In each matter,  irrespective of her client, she has proven herself to be an effective  advocate and has regularly won praise from opposing counsel.   The American Bar Association has unanimously rated Ms. Bloomekatz  ``well qualified,'' and she has the strong support of Senator Brown.   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for her confirmation.    I announce that the Senator from Maryland (Mr. Cardin) is  necessarily absent.    Mr. President, 2 months ago I had the privilege of  delivering the commencement address at Loyola University Chicago  Stritch School of Medicine in Chicago.   It was an inspiring celebration. Among the new doctors receiving  their medical degrees that day were six young people who had been  brought to this country as children and educated in American schools,  but had never been able to become citizens.   It used to be that such young people had no real future in America.  In 2012, however, with bipartisan encouragement from Senator Dick Lugar  and myself, President Obama created the DACA program, which allows  young people who are undocumented and meet rigorous conditions can  remain in America and work legally.   That same year, Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine  became the first medical school in America to openly welcome  undocumented DACA recipients. It was a courageous decision. But there  was a big obstacle: DACA recipients are ineligible for Federal tuition  assistance, and without such financial aid, most Dreamers cannot afford  college, much less medical school.   In stepped a smart, visionary public servant with a creative  solution. His name was William Brandt, Jr. As chair of the Illinois  Finance Authority, he created a program to provide interest-free loans  to DACA students at Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of  Medicine. In exchange, these Dreamer doctors, after they graduate, work  in medically underserved areas in Illinois. In a life filled with many  firsts and financial successes, Bill Brandt considered Illinois' loan  program for DACA medical students his proudest achievement. It is  really a model for the Nation. Thirty-eight DACA recipients have now  graduated from Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine.   As someone who has worked for more than 20 years to pass the Dream  Act, I am grateful to Bill for having such faith in Dreamers. And I am  deeply saddened by his recent death at the too-young age of 73. Bill  Brandt was born in Chicago and his talent for business was obvious  early on. In college, he worked as a door-to-door salesman for Kirby  Vacuum Cleaners and once won the salesman-of-the-year award from the  local distributor. His introductory pitch to customers was: ``Brandt is  the name; dirt sucking's the game.'' Who could say no to that?   In 1976, after earning a master's degree in sociology from the  University of Chicago, he founded his own company, Development  Specialists, Inc., and became a pioneer in the corporate restructuring  and bankruptcy consulting industry.   There are people--Gordon Gekko types--who specialize in buying  distressed companies only to strip them of their assets and then  declare bankruptcy and fire all the employees. Bill Brandt was the  opposite of that. To Bill, success meant helping struggling companies  turn around. He was proud of all the companies he helped regain their  financial footing and of the thousands of jobs he helped save. He  believed that good public policies could make the economy stronger and  fairer for everyone. When Congress passed a new Federal bankruptcy law  in 1994, he testified about ways to make the new law fairer, more  streamlined, and accessible to everyone.   To Bill, social justice wasn't just a theory; it was a calling. As a  high school senior, he started to do community outreach at the Benton  House, a social services organization in Chicago's Bridgeport  neighborhood. He believed that government could help make life better  for people and that everyone has a responsibility to hold government  accountable. He was a trusted adviser and friend to many public  officials, including former Illinois Governor Pat Quinn and President  Bill Clinton. Bill also believed that everyone has a responsibility to  leave the world a better place than they found it. He certainly lived  up to that responsibility, and he will be missed.   Loretta and I offer our condolences to Bill's family, especially  Patrice, his wife of 43 years; their children Katherine, Joan, John,  and William; their grandchildren; to Bill's many friends; and to the  countless others, like those Dreamer doctors at Loyola University  Chicago, who will help keep his legacy alive for years to come.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
