 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 954) to remove the use restrictions on certain land  transferred to Rockingham County, Virginia, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 954         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. REMOVAL OF USE RESTRICTION.         Public Law 101-479 (104 Stat. 1158) is amended--        (1) by striking section 2(d); and        (2) by adding the following new section at the end:       ``SEC. 4. REMOVAL OF USE RESTRICTION.         ``(a) The approximately 1-acre portion of the land referred       to in section 3 that is used for purposes of a child care       center, as authorized by this Act, shall not be subject to       the use restriction imposed in the deed referred to in       section 3.        ``(b) Upon enactment of this section, the Secretary of the       Interior shall execute an instrument to carry out subsection       (a).''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 954, offered by our colleague, the chairman of the  Judiciary Committee, Congressman Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, would  remove certain deed restrictions on an approximately 1-acre portion of  a property previously transferred in Rockingham County, Virginia, under  the terms of the National Park Service's Federal Lands to Parks  Program. The transferred land included a garage that had previously  been used by the National Park Service.   Following the transfer, Rockingham County decided that the nonprofit  Plains Area Daycare Center, which provides affordable childcare for  nearly 100 children, would benefit from use of the garage.   In 1990, Congress passed a law allowing for a portion of the  previously transferred land to be used for the childcare center.  Although a portion of the transferred property is authorized for use as  a daycare center, the center encounters hurdles in securing financing  for improvements and repairs due to the terms of the original deed and  the subsequent legislation.   H.R. 954 would remove certain deed restrictions from an approximately  1-acre portion of the property, while the other 2 acres would continue  to be subject to the existing deed restrictions and revisionary clause.  Removal of these deed restrictions will ensure that improvements and  repairs can take place without further delay in the future.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte), the chairman of the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1397) to authorize, direct, facilitate, and expedite the  transfer of administrative jurisdiction of certain Federal land, and  for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1397         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1397, offered by the gentlewoman from Virginia  (Mrs. Comstock), would authorize a small land exchange between the  Department of the Interior and the Department of Transportation.   Specifically, the bill transfers administrative jurisdiction over  approximately a third of an acre of Federal land within the boundary of  the George Washington Memorial Parkway of the National Park Service to  the Department of Transportation, and transfers from the Department of  Transportation approximately a half an acre of Federal land within the  boundary of the Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center of the Federal  Highway Administration.   The transfer centers on Colonial Farm Road, which provides public  access to Claude Moore Colonial Farm and also serves as an entrance  road to the Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center and as a secondary  entrance to the Central Intelligence Agency. The configuration of the  property lines between the farm and the research center requires farm  staff to  [[Page H5405]]  travel across research center property to access their facilities.   The three Federal agencies have discussed concerns over crossing  property lines, the need to have uninterrupted access to the  properties, and the need to improve security near perimeter fencing of  the research center. The agencies have identified properties suitable  for exchange on their boundaries which will provide public access to  the farm while providing the means to improve security outside the  fencing of the research center and the Central Intelligence Agency.  Though the immediate security concerns have previously been addressed  through a temporary agreement, legislation is needed to codify the land  exchange.   I include in the Record an exchange of letters to Chairman Bill  Shuster of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the  responses. We thank them for agreeing to help expedite consideration of  this bill today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Natural Resources,                                       Washington, DC, July 5, 2017.      Hon. Bill Shuster,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: On June 27, 2017, the Committee on       Natural Resources ordered favorably reported without       amendment H.R. 1397, to authorize, direct, facilitate, and       expedite the transfer of administrative jurisdiction of       certain Federal land. The bill was referred primarily to the       Committee on Natural Resources, with an additional referral       to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.        I ask that you allow the Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure to be discharged from further consideration of       the bill so that it may be scheduled by the Majority Leader.       This discharge in no way affects your jurisdiction over the       subject matter of the bill, and it will not serve as       precedent for future referrals. In addition, should a       conference on the bill be necessary, I would support your       request to have the Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure represented on the conference committee.       Finally, I would be pleased to include this letter and any       response in the bill report filed by the Committee on Natural       Resources to memorialize our understanding, as well as in the       Congressional Record.        Thank you for your consideration of my request and for the       extraordinary cooperation shown by you and your staff over       matters of shared jurisdiction. I look forward to further       opportunities to work with you this Congress.            Sincerely,                                                        Rob Bishop,      Chairman.                                   ____           House of Representatives, Committee on Transportation and             Infrastructure,                                      Washington, DC, July 5, 2017.      Hon. Rob Bishop,      Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Bishop: Thank you for your letter concerning       H.R. 1397, to authorize, direct, facilitate, and expedite the       transfer of administrative jurisdiction of certain Federal       land. As noted, the Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure received an additional referral on this       legislation.        In order to expedite floor consideration of H.R. 1397, the       Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure agrees to       forgo action on this bill. However, as you noted, this is       conditional on our mutual understanding that forgoing       consideration of the bill would not prejudice the Committee       with respect to the appointment of conferees or to any future       jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in       the bill or similar legislation that fall within the       Committee's Rule X jurisdiction. Should a conference on the       bill be necessary, I appreciate your agreement to support my       request to have the Committee represented on the conference       committee.        Thank you for your cooperation on this matter and for       agreeing to place a copy of this letter and your response       acknowledging our jurisdictional interest into the bill       report and the Congressional Record during consideration of       the measure on the House floor.            Sincerely,                                                      Bill Shuster,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Comstock).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1404) to provide for the conveyance of certain land  inholdings owned by the United States to the Tucson Unified School  District and to the Pascua Yaqui Tribe of Arizona.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1404, the Pascua Yaqui  Tribe Land Conveyance Act, sponsored by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Grijalva), the ranking member on the National Resources Committee.   H.R. 1404 would authorize a land exchange involving the Tribe, the  Tucson Unified School District, and the Department of the Interior.   Under the bill, a 39.65-acre parcel of land currently held by the  district shall be placed in trust for the benefit of the Tribe if the  district relinquishes all right, title, and interest to it.   A 13.24-acre parcel of land shall be sold by the U.S. to the district  at fair market value, and a Federal interest of 27.5 acres of land held  by the district shall be cleared in exchange for the district paying  the appraised value of the Federal interest. The Federal interest is a  reversionary interest imposed on certain land patented to the district  under the Recreation and Public Purposes Act of 1926.   All transfers under the bill are subject to valid existing rights.  Gaming pursuant to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act would be prohibited  on lands taken into trust under the bill.   This bill is substantively similar to the bill the House passed  during the 114th Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the sponsor. I urge adoption of the measure, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.  [[Page H5407]]         Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1541) to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to acquire  certain property related to the Fort Scott National Historic Site in  Fort Scott, Kansas, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1541         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. AUTHORIZATION TO ACQUIRE LUNETTE BLAIR.         The Act entitled ``An Act to authorize establishment of the       Fort Scott National Historic Site, Kansas, and for other       purposes.'', approved October 19, 1978 (Public Law 95-484) is       amended--        (1) in the first section--        (A) by inserting ``only'' after ``donation''; and        (B) by striking ``: Provided, that the buildings so       acquired shall not include the structure known as `Lunette       Blair' ''; and        (2) in section 2--        (A) by striking ``When the site of'' and inserting ``(a)       When the site of''; and        (B) by adding at the end the following:        ``(b) The boundary of the Fort Scott National Historic Site       established under subsection (a) is modified as generally       depicted on the map referred to as `Fort Scott National       Historic Site Proposed Boundary Modification', numbered 471/      80,057C, and dated February 2017.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   H.R. 1541, sponsored by the gentlewoman from Kansas (Ms. Jenkins),  removes the statutory prohibition preventing the Secretary of the  Interior from acquiring a structure known as the Lunette Blair  blockhouse and including the structure in the boundary of the Fort  Scott National Historic Site.   Congress initially deemed the Lunette Blair blockhouse anachronistic  and excluded the structure from the boundaries of the Fort Scott  National Historic Site. The National Park Service now wants to add the  blockhouse to expand the interpretation of the site and to demonstrate  its different roles throughout American history. The private citizens  that currently maintain the blockhouse would like to donate the  structure to the National Park Service.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support preservation of this  unique piece of Kansas' heritage, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I note that the sponsor, Ms. Jenkins, was  unable to be here to speak in support of her bill. She was unavoidably  detained in her district due to a flight cancellation today. However, I  have her statement in strong support of the measure. On her behalf, I  urge adoption of the measure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1719) to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to acquire  approximately 44 acres of land in Martinez, California, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1719       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``John Muir National Historic       Site Expansion Act''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Historic site.--The term ``Historic Site'' means the       John Muir National Historic Site in Martinez, California,       established by Public Law 88-547 (78 Stat. 753).        (2) Map.--The term ``map'' means the map entitled ``John       Muir National Historic Site Proposed Boundary Expansion'',       numbered 426/127150, and dated November 2014.        (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of the Interior.       SEC. 3. JOHN MUIR NATIONAL HISTORIC SITE LAND ACQUISITION.         (a) Acquisition.--The Secretary may acquire by donation the       approximately 44 acres of land and any interests in the land       that is identified on the map.        (b) Boundary.--On the acquisition of the land authorized       under subsection (a), the Secretary shall adjust the       boundaries of the Historic Site to include the acquired land.        (c) Administration.--The land and any interests in land       acquired under subsection (a) shall be administered as part       of the National Historic Site.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1719 would authorize the expansion of the John Muir  National Historic Site by approximately 44 acres.   Located in the San Francisco Bay Area, in Martinez, California, this  site preserves the 14-room Italianate Victorian mansion where John Muir  lived, as well as a 325-acre tract of native oak woodlands and  grasslands owned by the Muir family.   The additional proposed acreage in this bill is directly adjacent to  the current site and will allow for better public access to trails in  the area. This acreage will be donated to the National Park Service and  will not be acquired with any Federal dollars.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1913) to establish the Clear Creek National Recreation Area  in San Benito and Fresno Counties, California, to designate the Joaquin  Rocks Wilderness in such counties, and for other purposes.

CLARIFICATION REGARDING FUNDING.         No additional funds are authorized to carry out the       requirements of this Act. Such requirements shall be carried       out using amounts otherwise authorized.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1913, introduced by the gentleman from California  (Mr. Panetta), is a bipartisan bill that reopens public access and  facilitates recreational activities in central California. The bill  designates 63,000 acres as the Clear Creek National Recreation Area,  21,000 acres as the Joaquin Rocks Wilderness, and releases 1,500 acres  of wilderness study area.   Once considered a world class off-highway vehicle, or OHV, recreation  designation, the Clear Creek area has been closed to the public for  nearly a decade due to concerns from the EPA about naturally occurring  asbestos. However, after commissioning a study of the area, the State  of California's Off-Highway Motor Vehicle Recreation Division found a  minimal health risk to OHV users from exposure to naturally occurring  asbestos. Despite these findings and appeals from local communities and  OHV users, the Bureau of Land Management has not reopened the area to  the public or for OHV use.   This bill remedies the situation by reopening and redesignating the  area as the Clear Creek National Recreation Area and including special  provisions to prioritize and facilitate long-term, sustainable off- highway vehicle access and recreation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and friend for  introducing this legislation, and I urge its adoption.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1306) to provide for the conveyance of certain Federal land  in the State of Oregon, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1306         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(2) Reciprocal right-of-way agreements.--        (A) In general.--On the date on which the agreement is       entered into under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall provide       to the Confederated Tribes all reciprocal right-of-way       agreements to the Oregon Coastal land in existence on the       date of enactment of this Act.        (B) Continued access.--Beginning on the date on which the       Oregon Coastal land is taken into trust under section 202,       the Confederated Tribes shall continue the access provided by       the reciprocal right-of-way agreements referred to in       subparagraph (A) in perpetuity.        (e) Land Use Planning Requirements.--Except as provided in       subsection (c), once the Oregon Coastal land is taken into       trust under section 202, the Oregon Coastal land shall not be       subject to the land use planning requirements of the Federal       Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1701 et       seq.) or the Act of August 28, 1937 (43 U.S.C. 1181a et       seq.).       SEC. 205. LAND RECLASSIFICATION.         (a) Identification of Oregon and California Railroad Grant       Land.--Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of       this Act, the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary       shall identify any Oregon and California Railroad grant land       that is held in trust by the United States for the benefit of       the Confederated Tribes under section 202.        (b) Identification of Public Domain Land.--Not later than 2       years after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary       shall identify public domain land in the State of Oregon       that--        (1) is approximately equal in acreage and condition as the       Oregon and California Railroad grant land identified under       subsection (a); and        (2) is located within the 18 western Oregon and California       Railroad grant land counties (other than Klamath County,       Oregon).        (c) Maps.--Not later than 3 years after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to Congress       and publish in the Federal Register one or more maps       depicting the land identified in subsections (a) and (b).        (d) Reclassification.--        (1) In general.--After providing an opportunity for public       comment, the Secretary shall reclassify the land identified       in subsection (b) as Oregon and California Railroad grant       land.        (2) Applicability.--The Act of August 28, 1937 (43 U.S.C.       1181a et seq.), shall apply to land reclassified as Oregon       and California Railroad grant land under paragraph (1).             TITLE III--AMENDMENTS TO COQUILLE RESTORATION ACT       SEC. 301. AMENDMENTS TO COQUILLE RESTORATION ACT.         Section 5(d) of the Coquille Restoration Act (Public Law       101-42; 103 Stat. 92, 110 Stat. 3009-537) is amended--        (1) by striking paragraph (5) and inserting the following:        ``(5) Management.--        ``(A) In general.--Subject to subparagraph (B), the       Secretary, acting through the Assistant Secretary for Indian       Affairs, shall manage the Coquille Forest in accordance with       the laws pertaining to the management of Indian trust land.        ``(B) Administration.--        ``(i) Unprocessed logs.--Unprocessed logs harvested from       the Coquille Forest shall be subject to the same Federal       statutory restrictions on export to foreign nations that       apply to unprocessed logs harvested from Federal land.        ``(ii) Sales of timber.--Notwithstanding any other       provision of law, all sales of timber from land subject to       this subsection shall be advertised, offered, and awarded       according to competitive bidding practices, with sales being       awarded to the highest responsible bidder.'';        (2) by striking paragraph (9); and        (3) by redesignating paragraphs (10) through (12) as       paragraphs (9) through (11), respectively.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would first like to acknowledge the gentlemen from  Oregon, Mr. DeFazio and Mr. Walden, for their hard work on this  important piece of legislation, which will benefit several Indian  Tribes in the State of Oregon.                                time  1715    H.R. 1306 benefits three recognized Tribes in western Oregon by  conveying publicly-owned forestlands to two of them, and to improve the  management of forestlands currently held in trust for a third Tribe.   Various iterations of H.R. 1306 have been considered multiple times  in previous Congresses, and nearly identical bills benefiting some or  all of these Tribes were passed by the House in the 113th and 114th  Congresses.   Title I of H.R. 1306 would place title to approximately 17,519 acres  of public land in Oregon in trust for the benefit of the Cow Creek  Umpqua Tribe. Lands to be held in trust under this section are depicted  on a specific map, and the conveyance of the land in trust shall be  subject to valid existing rights.   A substantial amount of the public land placed in trust for the Tribe  is currently part of the Oregon and California railroad land grant,  managed by the Bureau of Land Management.   Under title I, the Secretary is required to reclassify an equal  acreage of public domain land located in the vicinity of the land given  to the Tribe, as O&C land.   Land placed in trust by the Tribe under title I may not be used for  gambling under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, and timber harvested  from such land shall be subject to Federal law restricting the export  of unprocessed logs.   Title II of the bill would provide that seven tracts of land  currently managed by the Bureau of Land Management, totaling 14,742  acres, be held in trust for the benefit of the Confederated Tribes of  the Coos, Lower Umpqua, and Siuslaw Indians.   The parcels so transferred are located in western Oregon's Coos,  Douglas, Benton, and Lane Counties, and include tracts such as the Coos  Head, the Talbot Allotment, and the Umpqua Eden parcels, which are of  particular cultural significance to the Tribes, as well as areas which  are managed for timber production.   Title III would correct a situation with respect to the management of  the Coquille Tribal Forest in Oregon. This forest has been regulated as  part of the Northwest Forest Plan, which is inconsistent with the  management of other tribally-managed forests in the United States.  Under this title, the Coquille Tribe would manage its forest under the  National Indian Forest Resources Management Act. This will improve the  Tribe's ability to manage its timber resources.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2156) to provide for the establishment of a national  memorial and national monument to commemorate those killed by the  collapse of the Saint Francis Dam on March 12, 1928, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2156         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Saint Francis Dam Disaster       National Memorial Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) On March 12, 1928, the Saint Francis Dam located in the       northern portion of Los Angeles County, California, breached,       resulting in a devastating flood that caused the death of       approximately 425 individuals.        (2) The residents of Santa Clarita Valley, San Francisquito       Canyon, Castaic Junction, Santa Clara River Valley, Piru,       Fillmore, Bardsdale, Saticoy, and Santa Paula were directly       impacted and suffered greatly from the worst flood in the       history of the State of California.        (3) The disaster resulted in a tremendous loss of human       life, property, and the livelihood of local residents, and       was surpassed in the level of destruction in the 20th century       only by the great San Francisco earthquake of 1906.        (4) The collapse of the dam may represent America's worst       civil engineering failure in the 20th century.        (5) The site of the disaster is subject to the theft of       historic artifacts, graffiti, and other vandalism.        (6) It is right to pay homage to the citizens who were       killed, injured, or dislocated due to the flood, and to       educate the public about this important historical event.        (7) It is appropriate that the site of the Saint Francis       Dam and surrounding areas be specially designated and       protected to commemorate this tragic event.       SEC. 3. SAINT FRANCIS DAM DISASTER NATIONAL MEMORIAL.         (a) Establishment.--The Secretary is authorized to       establish a memorial at the Saint Francis Dam site in the       County of Los Angeles, California, for the purpose of       honoring the victims of the Saint Francis Dam disaster of       March 12, 1928.        (b) Requirements.--The Memorial shall be--        (1) known as the Saint Francis Dam Disaster National       Memorial; and        (2) managed by the Forest Service.        (c) Donations.--The Secretary is authorized to accept,       hold, administer, invest, and spend any gift, devise, or       bequest of real or personal property made to the Secretary       for purposes of developing, designing, constructing, and       managing the  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous materials on the bill currently under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The Saint Francis Dam disaster is considered one of the worst civil  engineering catastrophes in the 20th century.   H.R. 2156, introduced by the gentleman from California (Mr. Knight),  my good friend, recognizes the incident's devastation and subsequent  impacts on the residents of northern Los Angeles County by establishing  a national memorial and monument to preserve the area for future  generations.   The bill authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to establish the  memorial using donations from the community, working in consultation  with the Santa Clarita City Council and the public. No taxpayer funds  are authorized for the construction of the memorial.   The bill also authorizes the creation of a 440-acre monument that  will encompass the Saint Francis Dam memorial. The boundaries of the  monument were designated in consultation with the local community, and  the bill includes provisions to ensure motorized access within the  monument and continued grazing on any land where it is already  permitted.   The memorial and the monument created by this legislation are a  fitting tribute to the 400 people who lost their lives tragically and  thousands more whose lives were forever changed by the Saint Francis  Dam disaster.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill introduced by Mr. Knight,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Knight), the author of the legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 597) to take lands in Sonoma County, California, into trust  as part of the reservation of the Lytton Rancheria of California, and  for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 597         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Lytton Rancheria Homelands       Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The Lytton Rancheria of California is a federally       recognized Indian tribe that lost its homeland after it was       unjustly and unlawfully terminated in 1958. The Tribe was       restored to Federal recognition in 1991, but the conditions       of its restoration have prevented it from regaining a       homeland on its original lands.        (2) Congress needs to take action to reverse historic       injustices that befell the Tribe and have prevented it from       regaining a viable homeland for its people.        (3) Prior to European contact there were as many as 350,000       Indians living in what is now the State of California. By the       turn of the 19th century, that number had been reduced to       approximately 15,000 individuals, many of them homeless and       living in scattered bands and communities.        (4) The Lytton Rancheria's original homeland was purchased       by the United States in 1926 pursuant to congressional       authority designed to remedy the unique tragedy that befell       the Indians of California and provide them with reservations       called Rancherias to be held in trust by the United States.        (5) After the Lytton Rancheria lands were purchased by the       United States, the Tribe settled on the land and sustained       itself for several decades by farming and ranching.  [[Page H5416]]         (6) By the mid-1950s, Federal Indian policy had shifted       back towards a policy of terminating Indian tribes. In 1958,       Congress enacted the Rancheria Act of 1958 (72 Stat. 619),       which slated 41 Rancherias in California, including the       Lytton Rancheria, for termination after certain conditions       were met.        (7) On August 1, 1961, the Lytton Rancheria was terminated       by the Federal Government. This termination was illegal       because the conditions for termination under the Rancheria       Act had never been met. After termination was implemented,       the Tribe lost its lands and was left without any means of       supporting itself.        (8) In 1987, the Tribe joined three other tribes in a       lawsuit against the United States challenging the illegal       termination of their Rancherias. A Stipulated Judgment in the       case, Scotts Valley Band of Pomo Indians of the Sugar Bowl       Rancheria v. United States, No. C-86-3660 (N.D.Cal. March 22,       1991), restored the Lytton Rancheria to its status as a       federally recognized Indian tribe.        (9) The Stipulated Judgment agreed that the Lytton       Rancheria would have the ``individual and collective status       and rights'' which it had prior to its termination and       expressly contemplated the acquisition of trust lands for the       Lytton Rancheria.        (10) The Stipulated Judgment contains provisions, included       at the request of the local county governments and       neighboring landowners, that prohibit the Lytton Rancheria       from exercising its full Federal rights on its original       homeland in the Alexander Valley.        (11) In 2000, approximately 9.5 acres of land in San Pablo,       California, was placed in trust status for the Lytton       Rancheria for economic development purposes.        (12) The Tribe has since acquired, from willing sellers at       fair market value, property in Sonoma County near the Tribe's       historic Rancheria. This property, which the Tribe holds in       fee status, is suitable for a new homeland for the Tribe.        (13) On a portion of the land to be taken into trust, which       portion totals approximately 124.12 acres, the Tribe plans to       build housing for its members and governmental and community       facilities.        (14) A portion of the land to be taken into trust is being       used for viniculture, and the Tribe intends to develop more       of the lands to be taken into trust for viniculture. The       Tribe's investment in the ongoing viniculture operation has       reinvigorated the vineyards, which are producing high-quality       wines. The Tribe is operating its vineyards on a sustainable       basis and is working toward certification of sustainability.        (15) No gaming shall be conducted on the lands to be taken       into trust by this Act.        (16) No gaming shall be conducted on any lands taken into       trust on behalf of the Tribe in Sonoma County after the date       of the enactment of this Act north of a line that runs in a       cardinal east and west direction from the point where Highway       Route 12 crosses Highway 101 as they are physically on the       ground and used for transportation on January 1, 2016, and       extending to the furthest extent of Sonoma County.        (17) Any agreement, now or in the future, regarding gaming       restrictions between Sonoma County and the Tribe will be       effective without further review by the Bureau of Indian       Affairs.        (18) By directing that these lands be taken into trust, the       United States will ensure that the Lytton Rancheria will       finally have a permanently protected homeland on which they       can once again live communally and plan for future       generations. This action is necessary to fully restore the       Tribe to the status it had before it was wrongfully       terminated in 1961.        (19) The Tribe and County of Sonoma have entered into a       Memorandum of Agreement in which the County agrees to the       lands in the County being taken into trust for the benefit of       the Tribe in consideration for commitments made by the Tribe.       SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.         For the purpose of this Act, the following definitions       apply:        (1) County.--The term ``County'' means Sonoma County,       California.        (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of the Interior.        (3) Tribe.--The term ``Tribe'' means the Lytton Rancheria       of California.       SEC. 4. LANDS TO BE TAKEN INTO TRUST.         (a) In General.--The land owned by the Tribe and generally       depicted on the map titled ``Lytton Fee Owned Property to be       Taken into Trust'' and dated May 1, 2015, is hereby taken       into trust for the benefit of the Tribe, subject to valid       existing rights, contracts, and management agreements related       to easements and rights-of-way.        (b) Lands To Be Made Part of the Reservation.--Lands taken       into trust under subsection (a) shall be part of the Tribe's       reservation and shall be administered in accordance with the       laws and regulations generally applicable to property held in       trust by the United States for an Indian tribe.       SEC. 5. GAMING.         (a) Lands Taken Into Trust Under This Act.--Lands taken       into trust for the benefit of the Tribe under section 4 shall       not be eligible for gaming under the Indian Gaming Regulatory       Act (25 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.).        (b) Other Lands Taken Into Trust.--        (1) Time-limited prohibition.--Lands taken into trust for       the benefit of the Tribe in Sonoma County after the date of       the enactment of this Act shall not be eligible for gaming       under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. 2710 et       seq.) until after March 15, 2037.        (2) Permanent prohibition.--Notwithstanding paragraph (1),       lands located north of a line that runs in a cardinal east       and west direction and is defined by California State Highway       Route 12 as it crosses through Sonoma County at Highway 101       as they are physically on the ground and used for       transportation on January 1, 2016, and extending to the       furthest extent of Sonoma County shall not be eligible for       gaming under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. 2710       et seq.).       SEC. 6. APPLICABILITY OF CERTAIN LAW.         Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Memorandum       of Agreement entered into by the Tribe and the County       concerning taking land in the County into trust for the       benefit of the Tribe, which was approved by the County Board       of Supervisors on March 10, 2015, and any addenda and       supplement thereto, is not subject to review or approval of       the Secretary in order to be effective, including review or       approval under section 2103 of the Revised Statutes (25       U.S.C. 81).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous materials on the bill currently under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   H.R. 597, sponsored by the gentleman from California (Mr. Denham), my  colleague, would take into trust approximately 511 acres of land of  noncontiguous fee land owned by the Lytton Rancheria. The land is  adjacent to the town of Windsor, in Sonoma County, California. Under  the bill, gaming under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act is prohibited  on these lands.   In 2009, the Tribe applied to the Department of the Interior to place  title to approximately 127 acres of lands acquired in this area in  trust. The application is still pending with the Department of the  Interior.   The Tribe has testified that it intends to use a portion of the lands  for Tribal housing, while the rest would support a diverse range of  economic development, including plans for a future resort and winery.   I want to thank the sponsor of the legislation for his hard work on  this bill, and I urge adoption of the measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
