 Mr. President, Senator Merkley and I wish to recognize the  50th anniversary of the Juneteenth Oregon Celebration in our hometown  of Portland, OR. Every year on June 19, people in Portland and across  the State of Oregon and the Nation join together to celebrate when, on  June 19, 1865, more than 250,000 enslaved people in Texas were finally  declared free more than 2 years after the signing of the Emancipation  Proclamation. Juneteenth is a celebration of freedom and recognition  that emancipation was delayed for many enslaved people even after the  Civil War was over. This day is among the most important days of  commemoration in our Nation.   The Juneteenth celebration was brought to Oregon in 1945 by the late  and beloved community leader Clara Peoples. She led the first-ever  Juneteenth celebration in Oregon at work. When her supervisor told her  that if the celebration ran over 15 minutes she would be fired, she  announced to her coworkers, ``Hear ye, hear ye. It's Juneteenth. We  have 15 minutes to celebrate.'' Thanks to Clara's tireless efforts in  the community and her work to create the nonprofit organization  Juneteenth OR, the first official citywide celebration of Juneteenth  occurred 50 years ago on June 19, 1972--and is today celebrated with a  parade and other festivities like delicious food, art and live music.   Clara Peoples continued fighting for her community by lobbying at all  levels of government to make Juneteenth a recognized holiday on the  State and national level. While, sadly, Clara did not live to see her  efforts realized, she clearly paved the way for Juneteenth to at long  last be declared a Federal holiday and a State holiday in Oregon.  Today, we remember and honor her as, in the words of the Rev. Dr.  Ronald Myers, ``the mother of Juneteenth.''   Soon after Clara Peoples passed away in 2015, her granddaughters  Jenelle Jack and Jynnefer Robinson took over as leaders of Juneteenth  OR. Jenelle and Jynnefer continue to champion this special and  important event, creating and coordinating online celebrations for 2  years during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. They even sent Oregon's  candidate for last year's Miss Juneteenth, Aceia Spade from Eugene, OR,  to Galveston, TX, where she was crowned National Miss Juneteenth Queen.  It was through Jenelle and Jynnefer's efforts--and the efforts of the  dedicated staff and volunteers of Juneteenth OR--that Portlanders and  Oregonians across the State will once again be able to celebrate  Juneteenth in person this year. We look forward to another Clara  Peoples Freedom Trail Parade this year, as well as another Miss  Juneteenth competition where young Black women will have the  opportunity to showcase who they are, their talents, and their  confidence.   While celebrating a victory in the fight to keep the film ``Birth of  a Nation,'' which celebrated the terrorism of the Ku Klux Klan, from  being played in Portland, another Oregon hero and notable civil rights  advocate Beatrice Morrow Cannady said, ``human rights, the greatest of  all rights, and human happiness once again triumphed.'' So we want to  say that when enslaved people in Texas finally learned that they were  free, human rights and human happiness triumphed. When Juneteenth  became a citywide celebration in Portland 50 years ago, human rights  and human happiness triumphed. When Juneteenth became a national  holiday in 2021, human rights and human happiness triumphed. And now,  on the 50th anniversary of Portland's first Juneteenth and the first  time that Oregon has recognized this important day as a State holiday,  human rights and human happiness have triumphed.   Juneteenth is an opportunity to celebrate the emancipation of Black  Americans and progress made in the fight for human rights and human  happiness. It is also a reminder, however, that the fight for true  equity for all Americans is far from over. Together, we must  [[Page S2909]]  press forward and never stop until all are equal.                            ____________________
