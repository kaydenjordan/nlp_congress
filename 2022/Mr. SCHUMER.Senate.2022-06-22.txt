 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session.    Mr. President, pursuant to S. Res. 27, the Judiciary  Committee being tied on the question of reporting, I move to discharge  the Judiciary Committee from further consideration of Arianna J.  Freeman, of Pennsylvania, to be United States Circuit Judge for the  Third Circuit.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, on the issue of our actions last night,  yesterday, Democratic and Republican negotiators at long last released  what the Nation has been waiting for for a very long time--a gun safety  bill that can be described with three words: common sense, bipartisan,  lifesaving.   As the author of the Brady background checks bill--the last major gun  safety bill, which passed in 1994--I am pleased Congress is on the path  to take meaningful action to address gun violence for the first time in  nearly 30 years. The bill is real progress. It will save lives. It is  my intention to make sure the Senate passes this bill before the end of  the week.   Last night, the process to quickly pass gun safety legislation  formally  [[Page S3046]]  began here on the floor after 64 Senators agreed to get on the bill.  Let me emphasize that number again. Sixty-four Members came together  last night to move forward--an unmistakable sign of the broad support  and momentum behind this bill. That is good news for American families  and American communities that have waited for years to see real  progress against gun violence.   Once again, it is my intention now to keep the process moving quickly  and secure final passage before the week's end.   A little over a month ago, our Nation witnessed two of the most  traumatic mass shootings seen in years: a racially motivated attack in  Buffalo and the worst school shooting in years in Uvalde, TX.   After these shootings, the Senate had a choice: We could succumb to  gridlock and hold a vote on a bill with many things we would want but  that had no hope of getting passed or we could try to find a bipartisan  path forward, as difficult as it seemed to get anything done. Over the  past 4 weeks, we chose to try to get something done.   Immediately after Uvalde, I spoke with Senator Murphy, who has been  our leader on these issues, and he asked me to give negotiators time  and space to do their work. Given his long experience in this area, he  thought that they could succeed. I was happy to agree because I knew  that even if there was a chance to get something positive and tangible  done on gun safety, it was well worth the effort. So I told Senator  Murphy I would give him the space he needed.   That quickly became the consensus of our caucus and the consensus of  many of our gun safety advocates, who pressed us to secure real  progress. We were all on the same page: Get something real done even if  it might not be everything we wanted.   This proved to be the right decision because today we are only a few  days away from passing the first major gun safety bill in nearly 30  years.   I want to thank all my Democratic and Republican colleagues for  working together to reach this point. I want to particularly thank  Senators Murphy and Sinema and all my Democratic colleagues who were  part of the bipartisan working group. And, of course, I also want to  thank Senators Cornyn, Tillis, and my Republican colleagues who made  the decision to tackle this difficult issue.   Most important of all, I want to thank all the survivors of gun  violence, all the families and advocates who dedicated years of their  lives to try to make a difference. This would not be possible without  their years of work. No matter how many mass shootings have been met  with gridlock over the years, these families never gave up on their  hopes of making change happen. As I have told them, rather than curse  the darkness, they lit a candle. They have turned their grief into  action, and now their action has brought us to the brink of passing the  first significant gun safety bill in decades.   The negotiators have done their work. Now it is time for the Senate  to complete the job and pass the bill before the end of the week. The  American people have waited long enough.                                 INSULIN Act    Mr. President, now on an insulin bill, another bit of good news, a  bright light. Earlier this morning, my colleagues Senators Shaheen and  Collins released legislation taking direct aim at one of the most  confounding problems facing millions of Americans: the skyrocketing  cost of insulin.   After months of hard work and good-faith negotiations, the efforts of  my colleagues Senators Shaheen and Collins have produced the INSULIN  Act. This bipartisan bill will cap insulin at $35 a month, change the  system that favors corporations instead of patients by keeping prices  high, and help lower costs for millions of Americans with diabetes. It  is my intention to bring the INSULIN Act to the floor of the Senate  very soon, and it ought to pass this Chamber expeditiously.   Reducing the price of insulin is not a Democratic issue or a  Republican issue; it is something that affects millions of Americans in  every city and every State. In fact, State legislatures across the  country have passed bills capping the cost of insulin for patients--not  just blue States but some deeply red States as well.   Senators Shaheen and Collins approached me earlier in the year and  said they wanted to draft a bill that not only capped insulin prices at  $35, but, in addition, they said they also wanted to have a bill that  goes deeper and goes to the depth of the problem, to change the system  of high prices that puts profits ahead of patients and lower the cost  for millions of Americans with diabetes. I agreed that would be  preferable. I encouraged them. And after a lot of work--hard work,  diligent work--they have written a very fine bill.    Now, it is time for Congress to get the job done. If we can pass this  bill, it will be a win for everyone--most of all, the millions and  millions of Americans who rely on insulin to manage their diabetes.   There is no time to waste because the surge of insulin costs is one  of the most infuriating trends of the past decade. For many people, the  cost of insulin can climb up to hundreds of dollars a month, sometimes  as much as $400 or even more. It is horrible and infuriating.   Skyrocketing insulin costs means that many Americans have to ask some  soul-wrenching questions: Do I pay for my groceries, or do I pay for my  medication? Do I have to ration my supply and take maybe half the  dosage each day--which we know hastens the onset of diabetes and  hastens the virulence of diabetes; or some ask: Will I have to skip my  medication altogether?   These are questions no American should have to ever ask, but this is  the reality for far too many in this country. No American should have  to go broke just to access the medicines they need to stay alive. So  that is why the Senate should make the INSULIN Act a priority in the  coming months.   Again, I want to thank Senators Shaheen and Collins for all their  hard work in bringing this bill together. This has been a passion of  both of theirs for a very long time. It has been a priority for many of  us in this Chamber for years, and to have a bipartisan bill like this  one is truly a breakthrough.   Very soon, I intend to have this bill come before the Senate so we  can take decisive, much-needed steps toward lowering the cost of  insulin for millions who need this drug to stay alive.                       Nomination of Arianna J. Freeman    Mr. President, finally on judicial nominees: As we continue moving  forward on the first major gun bill in decades, the Senate will also  proceed with confirming even more of President Biden's highly qualified  judicial nominees. Later today, the Senate will move forward on the  historic nomination of Arianna Freeman to serve as circuit judge for  the Third Circuit.   Ms. Freeman would make history as the first Black woman ever to  preside as an appellate judge on the Third Circuit, which is home to  more than 3 million African Americans in the Northeast and the Virgin  Islands, but which has had only five African-American judges in its  entire history.   Her confirmation would be a long overdue step toward a more  representative bench that is vital for the health of democracy.   And her qualifications--Yale Law School, clerkships for three Federal  judges, and extensive experience as a Federal defender--should erase  any doubt that she merits appointment to the bench. Normally, a nominee  with Ms. Freeman's resume should command strong bipartisan support, so  it was deeply regrettable that her nomination was locked in committee  with an 11-to-11 vote. Nevertheless, we are proceeding with her  nomination today. I have just moved to discharge her nomination out of  the Judiciary Committee so we can bring her to a vote on the floor.   Again, a simple look at her resume shows she has the skills. We know  she has the temperament and experience to make an excellent judge. And  despite delays, the Senate is going to move her one step closer to  confirmation today.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, pursuant to S. Res. 27, the Judiciary  Committee being tied on the question of reporting, I move to discharge  the Judiciary Committee from further consideration of Hernan D. Vera,  of California, to be United States District Judge for the Central  District of California.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Pursuant to S. Res. 27, the Committee on the Judiciary  being tied on the question of reporting, I move to discharge the  Committee on the Judiciary from further consideration of Jessica G.L.  Clarke, of New York, to be United States District Judge for the  Southern District of New York.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    I yield the floor.
