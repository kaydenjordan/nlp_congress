 Madam President, I understand there are three bills at  the desk due for a second reading en bloc.    In order to place the bills on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings en bloc.    Madam President, all week I have been outlining the  humanitarian and security crisis at our Nation's southern border. I  have discussed the threats from the inflow of drugs and criminal  aliens; I have shared career border security experts' strong support  for physical barriers; and I have cited the empirical data that  actually backs them up. But on day 20 of this partial government  shutdown--a shutdown that has been prolonged by my Democratic  colleagues' refusal to even come to the table--I thought I might try  something different this morning, so I brought a visual aid.   The chart right here behind me sums up my Democratic colleagues' past  and present positions on border security.   Over here on the left, you have a border fence made out of steel  bollard at the U.S.-Mexico border in Nogales, AZ. Construction on this  upgraded steel slat barrier began back in 2011 at the direction, mind  you, of President Obama's Department of Homeland Security--this fence  over here, under President Obama, at the direction of his Department of  Homeland Security.   Just 5 years prior, Senator Obama joined with then-Senator Hillary  Clinton, the current Democratic leader, and several other Democrats and  voted to authorize 700 miles--700 miles--of physical barriers under the  Secure Fence Act of 2006.   On the right of this chart, we have an example of a barrier like  those the new Speaker of the House has recently described as immoral. I  would defy my colleagues to tell me what the difference is. They are  exactly identical. So we went from the Obama administration, when  everybody was supporting a wall that looked just like this, to the  Trump administration, where now it is immoral. It is the kind of  barrier that all of a sudden the Democrats are so opposed to that they  would rather prolong the partial government shutdown than agree to an  additional investment of approximately one-tenth--one-tenth--of 1  percent of Federal spending.   They are identical walls, exactly alike. When President Obama was  there, they were for it. When President Trump is there, they are not.  As I said, it is basically the same photograph twice.   I do that to underscore the point that the Trump administration is  requesting funding for the same kinds of physical barriers that the  Obama administration was actually proud to build and  [[Page S112]]  bragged about: fencing with spaced slats that allowed visibility, made  with reinforced steel.   They are the same kinds of barriers that Customs and Border  Protection experts have told us actually produce real results. You  could call them walls; you could call them fences; you could call them  steel slats, but what they really are is effective. That is what they  are. Call them what you will, but they are effective.   According to the Government Accountability Office, after the outdated  fencing in Nogales was replaced by this particular steel slat  structure, the Border Patrol reported a significant drop in violent  encounters with illegal immigrants. The Border Patrol is not on either  side of this debate. They are just giving us the facts--just the facts.   During the 2 years leading up to the 2011 construction, 376 assaults  on Border Patrol agents were recorded in the Nogales station. In the 2  years after--after--the bollard fence went up, the number of assaults  fell to 71. That is 376 down to 71. That is a decline of 81 percent  after the wall or fence or steel slats--whatever you choose to call it.   We have seen big success in other sectors as well. The Trump  administration reports that in four border sectors where physical  barriers were recently built or upgraded, illegal traffic dropped by-- listen to this--90 percent--90 percent.   It is a fact that physical barriers are effective, as Democratic  Senators used to understand perfectly well when there was a different  occupant in the White House and, indeed, used to say publicly. They  used to say that they are an essential ingredient in a balanced  strategy for securing our border.   That was then, and this is now.   So why the tale of two completely Democratic Parties? Why does the  Speaker of the House feel compelled to denounce as ``immoral'' the very  kind of structures that her own party leaders recently praised as  essential? Why do my Democratic colleagues and why does the Democratic  leader feel the need to prolong this partial shutdown to avoid getting  more of the same investments he used to vote for? What is the reason  for this bizarre about-face?   Well, even these very Democrats are finding it difficult to invent a  good excuse. On Tuesday, the distinguished House majority leader, Mr.  Hoyer, was asked by reporters how there is any real daylight between  border security construction projects that Democrats have supported in  the past and the ones they are now trying to block. Here is what  majority leader Hoyer said to those reporters. This is an honest man.  ``I don't have an answer that I think is a really good answer.'' ``I  don't have an answer that I think is a really good answer.'' That is  the majority leader of the House of Representatives. Well, the reason  is because there isn't a good answer. There is no credible answer to  this massive flip-flop.   We all know what the real reason is. My Democratic colleagues are  operating purely on political spite directed at the President of the  United States. Why else would they rather have a partial government  shutdown drag on for nearly 3 weeks than get more of what they used to  vote for and brag about? Why else would they plug their ears and refuse  to listen to the experts out on the ground who do this kind of work,  like President Obama's own former Border Patrol Chief? Here is what he  says: ``I cannot think of a legitimate argument why anyone would not  support the wall as part of a multi-layered border security issue.''   Remember, the proposal we are talking about today would represent  one-tenth of 1 percent of Federal spending for this year--one one- thousandth.   With a straight face, Democrats are trying to convince the country  that the Federal Government simply cannot reopen, that they simply  cannot negotiate with the President because the sky would come crashing  down if we invest one one-thousandth of Federal spending in proven  border security solutions--proven border security solutions, by the  way, that their own party used to support and that President Obama's  Border Patrol Chief and other security experts continue to support.   Let's call it what it is--a flip-flop that is not based on principle  or on evidence but solely on the fact that President Trump is the  occupant of the White House.   So Republicans support the President's commonsense request. The  experts on the ground who actually risk their own safety to secure our  Nation support it. Even the 2006 versions of President Obama, Secretary  Clinton, and the Democratic leader would have supported it, but today's  Democrats now say that the same fencing and barriers that were A-OK  when President Obama was in the White House are now ``immoral''-- ``immoral''--because President Trump is the one making the requests.   This is not how you make serious policy. Partisan tantrums are no way  to govern. My Democratic colleagues need to get serious about their  responsibilities, seek treatment for their brand-new partisan allergy,  seek some treatment for their brand-new party allergy to border  security, sit down with the President, and negotiate a solution that  works for everyone. That is the only way to move the country forward.                            ____________________     Madam President, reserving the right to object, there  is a lot of important business the Senate could be tackling. We have  typically done that during these government shutdowns. The last thing  we need to do right now is to trade pointless--absolutely pointless-- show votes back and forth across the aisle.   Just a few days ago, very recently--not years ago--before the latest  shifts in political winds, my good friend the Democratic leader  completely agreed with me on this. In fact, he and I made an explicit  commitment to several of our Members on this very point. We announced  it here on the floor. We agreed that we wouldn't waste the Senate's  time on show votes related to government funding until a global  agreement was reached that could pass the House, pass the Senate, and  which the President could sign.   Here is how the Democratic leader himself stated his position, and  remember, this was very recently: In order for an agreement to be  reached, all four congressional leaders must sign off and the President  must endorse it and say he will sign it. That is how you make a law.  Most importantly, the President must publicly support and say he will  sign our agreement before it gets a vote in either Chamber--before it  gets a vote in either Chamber.   That was my good friend the Democratic leader just recently. I intend  to keep my word, and I intend to hold him to his.   Yesterday, the White House made clear that the President opposes  piecemeal appropriations that neglect border security and would veto  them, so obviously that isn't going to become law. This proposal flunks  the Democratic leader's own test of a few days ago.   Look, the political stunts are not going to get us anywhere. Senate  Democrats should stop blocking the Senate from taking up other urgent  matters, like the pending bills concerning Israel and the Syrian civil  war. In previous government shutdowns, the Senate has done business.  The Senate hasn't been shut down. That is what we ought to be doing and  actually at the same time negotiate with the President on border  security because nothing else is going to get a solution. Therefore, I  object.    Madam President, colleagues on the Democratic side of  [[Page S114]]  the aisle apparently pledged to oppose proceeding to other important  bills--we have experienced that at least to this point--during the  government shutdown even though there is no precedent for that.   All but four yesterday voted against the motion to proceed to S. 1,  and I am assuming they will vote against it again this afternoon. S.  1--the bill they are preventing us from going to--has wide bipartisan  support and is a critical step in supporting our allies in the Middle  East and securing peace in Syria.   I have talked to many Americans who are intensely interested in the  Israel issues. They don't understand why this important legislation  would be stymied over a dispute over something entirely different.   Through the Chair, I ask Senator Cardin if this blockade against  business on the floor is absolute.    Madam President, I say to my friend from Maryland--I  will repeat the question in a minute, but the answer to his question to  me is, because this will not produce a result. It has been perfectly  clear that the only way to produce this result is for the President,  the Speaker of the House, and the minority leader to agree, because we  need votes from Democrats both in the Senate and the House in order to  pass a measure that the President will sign.   My question of the Senator from Maryland was, is this blockade  against business on the floor absolute?    As I said, Madam President, repeatedly, it will not  solve the problem because the President has made it clear he won't sign  it.   Let me try one more time. Does the Senator, through the Chair--    Can we have order in the Senate?   Does the Senator intend to vote against proceeding to other measures  during the government shutdown?    Madam President, I think since the Senator from  Maryland is unwilling to answer my question, the assumption should be-- and I say this to the broad pro-Israel community in America that we all  interact with on issues related to the U.S.-Israel relationship--the  Senator is saying he might well vote to proceed to something else but  not vote to proceed to these important Israel bills and this important  Syria bill.   I want to make sure everybody understands where we are. The Senator  is refusing to answer the question as to whether or not this blockade  against Senate business applies to everything or just to these pro- Israel bills. So I think the refusal to answer provides the answer for  our colleagues, and I assume we can anticipate the Democrats will try  to get votes on other matters during the government shutdown but just  not the Israel issue and the Syria issue.    Madam President, through the Chair, I have a question  of Senator Van Hollen. He is going to propound a consent agreement, I  assume.    I object.    I will not prolong this because I know a lot of my  Democratic colleagues on the floor may want to speak, but there are two  shutdowns going on here. The first one related to the government can  only be solved with a Presidential signature, supportive of the Speaker  of the House and supportive of at least 10 of our Democratic  colleagues--or 7 on the other side. In other words, there has to be a  deal, an agreement.   There is a second shutdown going on that, as far as my research can  discover, is rather unprecedented. The Senate itself is being shut down  because of the refusal of our colleagues on the other side to do  business in the Senate during this period. There is no precedent for  that. There is no reason for that. We are all here.   The bill they are refusing to let us get on relates to Israel, our  great friend Israel, and addresses the atrocities that have been  occurring in Syria.   I am having a hard time understanding why the Senate should be shut  down as well as the government. We are all here. In fact, attendance  looks pretty good, and I don't know why we can't process bills that the  vast majority of us support.   I had hoped to pass all of these bills at the end of last session. We  had some last-minute objections--and I will say on our side--and so we  were unable to do it, but the vast majority of the Members of the  Senate do want to process these bills.   So I would hope, no matter how you view the government shutdown, that  there is no real significant reason to shut down the Senate.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call  be waived.    Mr. President, I had an opportunity to talk to  President Trump a few moments ago and wanted to indicate to our  colleagues that he will sign the bill that we have been discussing here  to guarantee that government workers who have been displaced as a  result of the shutdown will ultimately be compensated. So I want to  ease their anxiety about that particular possibility.   With that in mind, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to  the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 3, S. 24.    I know of no further debate on the bill.    I further ask that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to a period of morning business, with Senators permitted  therein to speak for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 15, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 16, submitted earlier  today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk, and I ask for its first reading.    I now ask for its second reading and, in order to  place the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I  object to my own request.    Now, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when  the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Friday, January 11; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; finally, that following  leader remarks, the Senate resume consideration of the motion to  proceed to S. 1.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the provisions of S. Res. 16 and do so as a further mark of  respect to the late John Culver, former Senator from the State of Iowa.  [[Page S147]]
