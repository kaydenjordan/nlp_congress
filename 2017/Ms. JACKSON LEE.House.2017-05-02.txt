 Mr. Speaker, yesterday evening I began my remarks by  saying, ``Say it is not so''; and I rise again this morning, as we  begin our journey on ensuring that the government does not shut down  and again rebutting TrumpCare that is so devastating, to say, ``Say it  is not so.''   This morning we rose to headlines of the President of the United  States saying that the government needs a shutdown in September. I am  glad Democrats recognize that we do not represent just Democrats. We  represent the entire Nation, and we owe them a commitment to govern,  and that is what we will do.   We now will face another attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act,  ObamaCare. I am glad that Democrats have come together around common  sense and the responsibility of serving not only the healthy, but the  sick.   Last evening, in a very emotional testimony, one of our late-night  hosts who entertains America every night, gave an emotional statement  about his infant son who was receiving heart surgery. In his tears, his  excitement for the success, but also his pain that people who did not  have money, as we debate this frivolous healthcare bill, will be  subject to the dangers and the devastation and the potential death of a  child they love.   Say it is not so.   And I remember when we started the Affordable Care Act, as a member  of the Judiciary Committee--all committees were involved in this  process. I remember us holding Democratic hearings to listen to  families who were suffering and were the brunt of not having health  insurance:   The father who had a medical student son who was interning in Atlanta  who had to drive with great fury to pick him up to be able to take him  back to Washington, D.C., when he had an immediate attack of an  appendix,  [[Page H3007]]  laying him on his back seat because the insurance that the young man  had only covered him in the city of Washington, D.C., where he was  going to medical school.   Or I remember the mother whose son was a drug abuser--but a lawyer,  got himself back on track but suffered from hepatitis--whose son died  in the emergency room because he did not have the medical coverage as  he was getting his life back to help stabilize him, died in that  medical condition and in that emergency room.   Those are just a few stories of those who died because they did not  have health insurance pre the Affordable Care Act.                                time  1015    Now, today we come with a bill that is going to eviscerate the sick  people with preexisting diseases--it is not like the Affordable Care  Act--and literally throw them under the bus. Because what they are  doing is taking away essential services and saying that there is no  room at the inn for those with preexisting conditions, such as  diabetes, asthma, allergic conditions, heart disease, cancer, leukemia,  or a baby that is born with a heart defect.   It is tragic that the bill they are putting on the floor is taking  away essential services, like mental health, substance abuse,  hospitalization, maternity; and they are throwing them to the States.  If your State will do it, so what. I live in a State--as we all do, we  love our State--they are facing fiscal crisis.   Do you think they are going to take the sickest?   No, they are not.   Twenty-four million people will still lose their insurance.  Hardworking families will have no health insurance. Those with  preexisting conditions, under the Trump plan, still remain in the  darkness of corners, not helped, and ready to die.   What family wants to subject their loved one to a place where they  have no hope?   Then, of course, there is the horrific age tax. The premiums for  those between age 50 and 64, hardworking Americans, just because they  have reached a certain age, their premiums will shoot through the roof.  These are people who have made and built this country with their hands  and their minds, our mothers and fathers, and even ourselves. How  tragic it is to be able to have these kinds of conditions. Then, of  course, it will shorten the life of the Medicare trust and literally  implode that.   This is governing?   I don't think so. I don't think so. And I, for one, am not going to  stand for it because it is important that our people understand that we  govern as Democrats.   As we put this bill on the floor to keep from closing this  government, let me just say to you quickly that we have upped the NIH-- the National Institutes of Health--with $2 billion. We have preserved  the yearlong Pell, and we have funded housing so people don't have to  be thrown out of housing.   Mr. Speaker, Democrats know how to govern and save this country. I  don't know what this person is doing at all.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I have listened to the debate on the  floor, and I want to join my fellow colleagues--women and men of the  Democratic Caucus--on opposing the Working Families Flexibility Act of  2017.   I just have one anecdotal story that reflects the constituents that I  represent. Take that woman who I saw--when going to my elementary  schools, visiting them, I saw a mother who got up at 4 in the morning  to take three buses to drop her young child off at an elementary  school, and then get two buses back to work, an hourly wage maker. She  does it because, one, she is supporting her child and, two, she has got  to work.   This bill is a complete undermining of all of the hardworking men and  women who need their money to pay a light bill, to pay rent, maybe even  a mortgage, to pay the normal expenses that many take for granted. And  this bill wants to substitute compensatory time for overtime pay.  [[Page H3047]]    So I cannot imagine that anyone with a heart would have this  legislation as a substitute for this hardworking mother to be paid  overtime. I just can't imagine that compensatory time off cannot pay  the light bill, cannot pay rent, cannot pay healthcare costs, which we  see are immediately being taken away from 24 million Americans.   So I oppose this legislation because I want to stand on the side of  the hardworking mother who needs her resources for a school uniform, a  school trip, a rent payment, a light bill.   Mr. Speaker, this bill should be opposed. It does not serve the  American people.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Frankel, our  chair, our leader, and all of my colleagues that appeared today. What a  powerful force of women who are standing by our Marines.   Now, let me be very clear: All of our men and women in the United  States Marines have earned and deserve our respect and trust. All of  the women in the United States Marines deserve our trust and our  respect.   So it saddens me today to have to rise and bring to the attention of  so many this unbelievable abuse of the men and women--men because their  reputation is tarnished, through no fault of their own, who are not  affiliated with Marines United; and women who feel that their service  to this Nation has been denigrated.   Let me cite for you the words of 23-year-old Erika Butner:   ``As a Marine Corps veteran, I am disheartened and disgusted with  this scandal.''   Victim blaming and the excuse that some are giving that boys will be  boys needs to stop.   Butner says she first heard of the group in August when a friend of  hers was posted to the page without her consent. In January, she  notified the Naval Criminal Investigative Service and Google about a  shared drive posted to the group that contained naked photos of more  than two dozen servicemembers. Comments posted to the group described  the victims graphically and, in some cases, advocating that they be  raped or sexually assaulted. Names, ranks, and duty stations of the  victims were also shared. The Marines United page has been taken down,  but there are supposed to be some 30,000 users of that site.   Can you imagine that this is my story for America: that young women  marines who put on the uniform and, therefore, are willing to lay down  their life and bleed for this Nation and die will be subjected to this?   So I join my colleagues in standing against it, and I ask my friends  in the United States Marines--and I have many. I have staff persons who  have been members of the Marines and a wounded warrior on my staff  right now who loves his Marines. But enough is enough. We will not  tolerate the objectification of women, we will not tolerate the  nonconsensual pornography, and we will not live with sexual assault.   That is why, for starters, I am proud to be a cosponsor of  Congresswoman Speiers' resolution for claiming April as Sexual Assault  Awareness and Prevention Month. Also, I am very pleased of the privacy  bill that is being put forward to never have this occur again. Every 98  seconds another American is sexually assaulted, and there are an  average of 321,500 victims per year.   So this ties very clearly into what these United States Marines, who  happen to be women, are facing. This is a horrendous reality for women  here in the United States, but it is a reality for women in uniform who  are defending our freedom abroad. That is what I want to focus on as I  complete my remarks.   These female marines go to faraway places and are in the battlefront  and the battle lines, standing alongside with their male counterparts.  They are expected to go through basic training without any waivers.  They are expected to carry that gun without any waivers. They are  expected to wear that uniform in dignity without any waivers.   Nude photographs of female marines and veterans across the military  were shared on Marines United, and those photographs showed women in  various stages of undress, and they were grossly obscene. Some posts on  Marines United suggested sexually assaulting women marines and that  women did  [[Page H3056]]  not belong in the United States military or this particular branch.   Once again, these photos were posted without the knowledge and the  consent of the women whose photos were posted. This conduct, as I said,  is unacceptable.   The Marines Corps' creed of good order and discipline is being  undermined when it cannot police Marines who use social media to  promote anti-Semitism, sexism, and racism. These messages of hate are  oppressive and demean human dignity.   Let me close by saluting our United States Marines because I do know  that they have decades and centuries of laying their lives down. That  is not the issue here as I stand before you today.   What the issue is, of course, is that United States Marines deserve  the dignity and the respect, even if they are women and, I might say,  especially because of what has occurred because they are women. They  ask for no deference. They ask for no waivers. They ask for no  apologies in terms of them being United States Marines. They simply  want that dignity and respect that we all owe them.   I salute them and we stand alongside them.
