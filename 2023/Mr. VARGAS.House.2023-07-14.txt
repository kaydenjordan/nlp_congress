 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Mr. Robb  Lally, a dedicated public servant and volunteer for more than 35 years.   Robb Lally entered the seminary at a young age, and as a deacon,  served in a Catholic parish and later for the Salvation Army.   In 1988, Robb Lally headed to San Diego to work with the Alpha  Project, a nonprofit human services organization that serves over 4,000  men, women, and children daily.   Robb carried out Alpha Project's mission to empower individuals,  families, and communities by providing work, recovery, and support  services to people who are motivated to change their lives and achieve  self-sufficiency.   Mr. Lally's years of service were instrumental to the organization's  mission and growth by working on and contributing to many critical  housing projects.   On June 7, 2023, Robb's life and legacy were honored at a celebration  of life in San Diego, California.   On behalf of the residents of California's 52nd Congressional  District, I will express my deepest condolences to the family of Mr.  Robb Lally. His legacy is felt and his presence will be greatly missed.  He was a great man.                            ____________________
