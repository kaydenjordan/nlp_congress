 Mr. President, 75 years ago over Brech, France, an  American B-17 bomber was downed by hostile fire. The copilot of that  bomber was Second Lieutenant Joseph Boyle, a proud Granite Stater.  Lieutenant Boyle was one of four survivors out of a crew of 10, and  while two of the crew escaped capture, Lieutenant Boyle and another  aviator were captured and interned in Stalag Luft III, a notorious  prisoner of war camp operated by the German Luftwaffe. For his service  during the Second World War, which included 16 bombing raids over  enemy-occupied territory, Lieutenant Boyle was awarded the  Distinguished Flying Cross and the Purple Heart.   After he returned home, Mr. Boyle raised a family, opened a furniture  business, and was active in his community. Mr. Boyle was a lifelong  tennis player and golfer and cherished the time he spent with his eight  grandchildren. Mr. Boyle passed away in 2009, after a life well-lived  and full of love. He is missed by his family and all those whose lives  he touched in New Hampshire and across the world.   In 2001, before his passing, the people and government of France  enacted a monument to Mr. Boyle and the other members of his aircrew.  Standing outside the town of Brech, this memorial displays the names of  the Americans who were in that downed B-17. As this year marks the 75th  anniversary of the day that Mr. Boyle and his crew were shot down, the  people of Brech have invited Mr. Boyle's family to join them to  remember the events of that day and the sacrifice that many Americans  made so that the people of France could once again be free.   Ceremonies such as this one are so important, both to honor the  service and sacrifice of the Greatest Generation and as a symbol of the  enduring relationship between the United States and our oldest ally,  France. It is critical that we remember all those who sacrificed in the  fight against totalitarianism and helped keep our nations safe and  free.                            ____________________
