 Mr. President, I rise today to honor Carolyn  Pollan, who passed away at the age of 84 on Saturday, October 23, 2021.   Carolyn Pollan was a native of Fort Smith, AR, who dedicated her life  to serving the Natural State. She was elected to the Arkansas House of  Representatives in 1975 and was one of only three women serving in the  State legislature at the time. She served until 1999, becoming the  longest serving woman and Republican in Arkansas House history.   Throughout her career, Carolyn was a champion of Arkansas' families  and children. Her leadership in developing policies to help kids and  families landed her in more positions to create positive change for  future generations.   She created and chaired the children and youth committee--a new  committee specifically designed to address problems affecting  children--and served on the education committee and legislative  council, as well as the joint budget committee. In addition, she formed  the first domestic abuse hotline and established the Arkansas  Commission on Child Abuse, Rape, and Domestic Abuse. She also crafted  legislation that brought about major, positive changes to teaching at- risk youth. Over 250 pieces of legislation she sponsored were passed,  many of them positively impacting Arkansas's families and children.  Family, friends, and colleagues say no one came close to matching her  passion on these issues. Additionally, Carolyn was the first woman  appointed as associate speaker pro tempore of the State House.   Carolyn also cared deeply about education. For 25 years, she served  on the John Brown University Board of Trustees--the first woman to do  so--and became a Trustee Emeritus. She also created the Pygmalion  Commission in 1993, which continues to improve educational outcomes for  at-risk students in Arkansas. Additionally, she served on numerous  educational boards and committees. Carolyn chaired the Southern  Regional Legislative Council Education Committee and Southern  Legislative Council Education Committee, served in the Office of  Technology Assessment of the Congress Advisory Board for the National  Study of Computers in Education, and on several educational boards  within the U.S. Department of Education and U.S. Department of Labor.   Carolyn also worked for Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee for 3 years,  where she helped enact welfare and workplace reforms and managed the  State's multimillion-dollar tobacco settlement. She served on the  development committee of the Clinton School of Public Service and was a  founder and board president of the Arkansas Center for Health  Improvement within the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences,  which has significantly improved the health of Arkansans since its  founding.   She has been honored by numerous organizations in recognition of her  accomplishments. Carolyn was included in the Top 100 Women in Arkansas  by Arkansas Business Magazine and was honored as one of 10 outstanding  legislators in the U.S. by the National Assembly of Government. She was  also named among the top 100 most influential people in Arkansas  according to a statewide poll conducted by the Associated Press. In  2020, she was inducted into the Arkansas Women's Hall of Fame.   With such an impressive background and career, Carolyn remained  humble and never lost sight of the reason she served: to protect  Arkansas's vulnerable families and children and create greater future  opportunities that would not only benefit them tremendously but also  benefit the state. She was well-respected by colleagues across the  aisle who attested to her willingness to work together if it meant  improving the lives of Arkansans.   Carolyn Pollan's relentless advocacy and passion created a far  better, safer, and healthier Arkansas for families and children that  boasts more access to important educational opportunities. I am honored  to recognize her incredible life and join with her loved ones, former  colleagues, and community in celebrating Carolyn's legacy.                            ____________________
