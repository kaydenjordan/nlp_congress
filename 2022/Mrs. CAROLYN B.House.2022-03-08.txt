 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend  the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 881) condemning the  heinous terrorist attack on Congregation Beth Israel in Colleyville,  Texas, on January 15, 2022, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 881         Whereas, on January 15, 2022, Malik Faisal Akram entered       Congregation Beth Israel in Colleyville, Texas, taking four       individuals hostage;        Whereas MI5, Britain's counterintelligence and security       agency investigated Mr. Akram in 2020, and he was listed as a       subject of interest, but was later determined to no longer       pose a threat;        Whereas Mr. Akram arrived at New York's John F. Kennedy       Airport on December 29, 2021, staying in New York City for       two days until taking a flight to Dallas, Texas;        Whereas it is reported Mr. Akram chose the synagogue       because it appeared to be the closest gathering of Jewish       people to a Federal prison where he demanded to see a woman       who is in custody after being found guilty of two counts of       attempted murder, armed assault, using and carrying a       firearm, and three counts of assault on United States       officers and employees in Afghanistan;        Whereas according to the Anti-Defamation League, in 2020       and 2021, there were 8,366 incidents of extremism or       antisemitism in the United States;        Whereas more than half of the religiously motivated hate       crimes reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in       2020 were anti-Jewish hate crimes;        Whereas Jewish Americans make up about 2 percent of the       population of the United States, but crimes against them make       up 55 percent of the anti-religious hate crimes in the United       States;        Whereas, on Sunday, January 16, 2022, President Joe Biden       classified this attack as an act of terror and Vice President       Kamala Harris affirmed we should combat antisemitism and hate       wherever it exists;        Whereas the four hostages were held for nearly 11 hours,       during that time Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker used the skills       he learned by attending several security courses hosted by       local law enforcement, the Federal Bureau of Investigation,       the Anti-Defamation League, and the Secure Community Network;        Whereas Good Shepherd Catholic Community church provided       support and housed family members of the worshipers held       inside the Synagogue during the 11 hour standoff;        Whereas Pleasant Run Baptist Church offered their thoughts       and support during the standoff, and allowed for their       parking lot to be used by the media;        Whereas worshipers who were watching service virtually       contacted local law enforcement once they realized there was       an incident underway at Congregation Beth Israel; and        Whereas because of the swift response from local, State,       and Federal law enforcement officers and emergency responders       on the ground, no hostages were harmed during the hostage       situation: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) stands with the community of Colleyville, Texas, the       hostages, and all those affected by the terrorist attack on       Congregation Beth Israel on January 15, 2022;        (2) commends the Federal, State, and local law enforcement       officers and emergency responders who responded to       Congregation Beth Israel in Colleyville, Texas;        (3) condemns this heinous terrorist attack; and        (4) reaffirms our commitment to combat hate, bigotry,       antisemitism, and violence against Jewish Americans.     MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise  and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this  measure.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 881, and I condemn in  the strongest terms the hateful attack on Congregation Beth Israel of  Colleyville, Texas, on January 15 of this year.   Anti-Semitism is a dangerous and growing crisis both in the United  States and around the world. According to the Anti-Defamation League,  in 2020 and 2021 alone, there were 8,366 incidents of extremism or  anti-Semitism just here in the United States.   According to the FBI, in 2020, more than half of the religiously  motivated hate crimes reported targeted Jewish people, even though  Jewish Americans make up only 2 percent of the population of the United  States of America. This is a staggering level of anti-Semitism.   Tragically, on January 15, 2022, violent anti-Semitism became all too  real for the Congregation Beth Israel in Colleyville, Texas. Four  individuals were taken hostage simply for being Jewish.   Although all hostages were eventually rescued safely, this attack  never  [[Page H1353]]  should have happened in the first place. After the defeat of Nazi  Germany in 1945, the revelations of the barbarity, and the scope of the  Holocaust, the world vowed never again. Yet, the hate and bigotry that  drove the Nazis to commit genocide is still alive and well. This is  something we simply cannot allow to continue.   I have made fighting hatred and anti-Semitism--a personal mission. In  2020, we passed my bill, the Never Again Holocaust Education Act, to  support Holocaust education in all schools across this country so that  the next generation will learn the horrific consequences of anti- Semitism, bigotry, and hate.                                time  1300    Freedom of religion is one of the most basic rights afforded to every  American in the First Amendment of our Constitution. No one should face  discrimination or violence because of their religious beliefs.   We must send a clear and unequivocal message that anti-Semitism has  absolutely no place here in the United States.   I thank my colleague, Representative Van Duyne, for introducing this  important resolution. Let it be a reminder that the rallying cry of  ``never again'' must be more than mere words. It is our duty to come  together to denounce anti-Semitism and hate, and this resolution does  just that.   I encourage all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote  ``yes,'' and I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes  to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), chair of the  Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs  and Related Agencies.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield the  gentlewoman from Florida an additional 1 minute.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I call upon all of  my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this important  resolution, H. Res. 881, and to join me in condemning, in the strongest  terms, the heinous attack on Congregation Beth Israel of Colleyville,  Texas, on January 15 of this year.   Mr. Speaker, anti-Semitism is a growing crisis, both in the United  States and across the world, and we need to stand up together to  denounce anti-Semitism and hate. This resolution does just that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support it, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
