 Mr. Speaker, I rise to inquire of the majority leader the  schedule for the week to come, and I yield to my friend, Majority  Leader McCarthy from California.   (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I thank the majority leader for that  information.   Mr. Speaker, I might say that that may be the most expensive birthday  present anybody ever has gotten, when you mentioned Mr. Thornberry. The  chairman has done very well, and I congratulate him on his work and on  [[Page H5869]]  his bipartisan working together with his committee members.   The majority leader and I have talked about this briefly, but,  obviously, we now have on the schedule 2 weeks left to go to do our  business. There is some discussion in the Senate, as the gentleman  knows, about them meeting into August.   Obviously, one of the problems with that is for, particularly,  younger Members. A lot of Members here have children who go back to  school the third week in August, so the first 2 weeks are not available  to them.   Can we give them some direction on whether or not we expect to be  here past the scheduled adjournment date of July 31?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.  Members ought to plan accordingly.   Secondly, Mr. Speaker, the Appropriations Committee is marking up its  bills, but we have not yet adopted a budget and, therefore, have no  House-approved top line for discretionary spending.   Can the majority leader give us any view as to whether or not the  Budget Committee may be reporting, before we leave for the August  break, a budget establishing an upper line for discretionary spending?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the majority leader for his  observation.   I might say, if I can, the first year I was majority leader, which  was in 2007, we passed all appropriations bills before the August break  to the Senate, but I am pleased that the Appropriations Committee is  moving forward, and let's hope that we can honor regular order.   Does the majority leader expect us to consider each of the bills that  the gentleman refers to as having been passed through subcommittee,  some through full committee? Do we expect to consider those discretely  one at a time on the floor?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the majority leader.   Mr. Speaker, in addition, one of the things, obviously, that I think  both sides are concerned about, and Secretary Mnuchin has urged, and  others have urged us to deal with, is the debt limit. We are not  exactly sure when it will be necessary and when the administration will  run out of extraordinary measures to ensure that we pay our bills.   I have told the majority leader privately and I have said publicly to  the press that assuming we have a clean debt limit extension, it would  be my intention to urge my Members to support such a clean debt limit  extension.   Does the gentleman have any thought as to when we might be  considering that?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   Mr. Speaker, lastly, I would say that obviously I know the gentleman  and I, and I think the overwhelming majority of Members of the House on  both sides of the aisle, are very concerned that we ensure that  sanctions on Iran's malevolent actions and Russia's actions, including  involving itself in an American election, is an item of concern. I know  the gentleman is working on it.   Can the gentleman tell me what he thinks the schedule for that bill  might be?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. I share that view that  we want to get this done as soon as possible.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
