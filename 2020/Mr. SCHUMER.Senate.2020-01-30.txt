 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk for  President's counsel and the House managers.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The Democratic leader's question is this:         Yesterday I asked the President's Counsel about the       President's claim of absolute immunity. Specifically, I asked       the President's lawyers to name a single document or witness       that the President turned over to the House impeachment       inquiry in response to their request or subpoena. Mr. Philbin       spoke for 5 minutes and talked about the various types of       immunities and privileges the President could invoke, but did       not answer my question. So I ask once again, can you name a       single witness or document that the President turned over to       the House impeachment inquiry?    It is directed to both parties, and the President's counsel goes  first.   Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Minority Leader Schumer,  thank you for that question. I apologize if I was not direct at getting  to the nub of the question yesterday.   I was intending to explain the rationales that the administration had  provided for its actions and to explain, contrary to the question, that  there was not simply absolute defiance and not simply a blanket  assertion that we won't do anything. That is the way the House managers  have tried to characterize it.   So let me be clear. There were document subpoenas issued prior to the  adoption of H. Res. 660. The President explained--the administration  explained--in various letters that all of those were invalid, and there  were no documents produced in response. There were no documents  produced in response because all of those subpoenas were invalid. There  was no attempt to reissue those subpoenas or to retroactively attempt  to authorize them.   There were then subpoenas for witnesses who were senior advisers to  the President. The President advised the head of the committees that  had issued those that those senior advisers had absolute immunity, and  they were not produced for testimony. Those three senior advisers were  not produced.   There were then subpoenas for witnesses to others whom the House  Democrats insisted would be required to testify without the benefit of  agency counsel, and I have explained that principle. The Office of  Legal Counsel advised that those subpoenas attempting to require  executive branch officials to testify without the benefit of agency  counsel were unconstitutional, and so those witnesses were not  produced. Still, there were 17 witnesses who testified, not including  the 18th witness, the ICIG, whose testimony is still secret.   So there was quite a bit of testimony, and there have been,  subsequently, some documents relevant to this, produced under FOIA. I  just want to raise that because it makes clear that, if you follow the  law and you follow the rules and you make a document request that is  valid, documents get produced. If you don't follow the law, the  administration resists. That is why the documents were not produced-- because the subpoenas were invalid. We made that very clear.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. The quick answer, Senator, is that not a single  document was turned over and not a single witness was produced. The  witnesses who did come came in defiance of the orders of the President.   Counsel has, obviously, made all of these claims that we think are  completely spurious, but what they don't answer is, what was the  motivation to fight all of these subpoenas?   They argue this interpretation which the courts have rejected--that  the courts have looked at it and that somehow these subpoenas were  invalid. But why didn't they produce the documents? Why did they insist  on this ``now discredited by the courts'' legal theory? Because they  were covering up the President's misconduct.   I want to return briefly to finish the comments I was making earlier  about the Senator's question earlier on mixed motives.   There is a good reason mixed motives are no defense. Otherwise,  officials who commit misconduct could always claim that, even if they  did it and even if it were corrupt, they must be acquitted because they  were able to invent some phony motivation and insist it played some  minor role in their scheme.   Imagine how that principle would apply to a President charged with  bribing members of the electoral college. Multiple Framers cited this  specific threat while discussing impeachment at the Constitutional  Convention. Could a President defend himself on the ground that he was  motivated, in part, by a noble desire to reward members of the  electoral college for their public service? Could he defend it on the  ground that, even as he handed over the bribes, he wasn't just acting  corruptly but was also seeking to advance the public interest by  keeping himself in power? According to the President's lawyers, yes, he  could.   Indeed, for all of the reasons we provided, there is no doubt that  the President's quid pro quo, the solicitation of foreign interference,  and his use of official acts to compel that interference were a  fundamentally corrupt scheme, by which I mean the motive and intent was  to benefit himself--to obtain personal political gain while ignoring  and injuring core national interests in our democracy and our security.  [[Page S708]]    We have demonstrated, we believe, that the scheme was entirely  corrupt, but if you have any question about that, ask John Bolton. If  there is any question about whether the motive was mixed or not mixed,  ask John Bolton. He has relevant testimony. You can ask, also, Mick  Mulvaney.   You can subpoena the documents and answer the earlier questions as to  what the documents say about when the President withheld the aid and  whether there was any interagency discussion of reforms in the errata.  I mean, the President's counsel literally made the argument that the  circumstance that changed was a change in the errata, but there is no  evidence to support that idea.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The manager's time has expired.   The majority leader is recognized.                                    Recess     Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Democratic leader is recognized.    I send a question to the desk for the House managers.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senator Schumer for the House managers:         Many of our colleagues are worried that if we were able to       bring witnesses and documents in the trial it would take too       long. Mr. Schiff mentioned we could do depositions in one       week. Please elaborate. What can you say that will reassure       us that having witnesses and documents can be done in a short       time, minimally impeding the business of the Senate?    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. I thank the Senator for the question.   First of all, with respect to the documents that we subpoenaed and  sought to get in the House, those documents have been collected. So  that work has been done. We have been informed, for example, that the  State Department documents have been collected. Those can readily be  provided to the Senate for its consideration.   With respect to witnesses, if we agree to a 1-week period to do  depositions while you continue to conduct the business of the Senate,  it doesn't mean that we would have unlimited witnesses during that  week. We would have to decide on witnesses who are relevant and  probative of the issues. Neither side would have an unlimited capacity  to call endless witnesses. We would have a limited period of time, just  as we had a limited period of time for our opening presentations and  for this question and answer period.   If there is any dispute over whether a witness is truly material or  probative, that decision can be made by the Chief Justice in very short  order. If there is a dispute as to whether a passage in a document is  covered by an applicable privilege and if, for the first time, the  White House would actually invoke a privilege, the Chief Justice can  decide, is that properly made or is that merely an attempt to conceal  crime or fraud?   So this can be done very quickly. This can be done, I think,  effectively. We have never sought to depose every witness under the  face of the Sun. We have specified four in particular, who we think are  particularly appropriate and relevant here. But we should be able to  reach an agreement on concluding that process within a week. So that is  how we would contemplate it being done.   We would make that proposal to our opposing counsel. It would be  respectful of your time. It would, I think, be a reasonable  accommodation. And counsel says that the Constitution mandates a  reasonable accommodation. Well, let's have a reasonable accommodation  here, and the reasonable accommodation could be to take 1 week to  continue with the business of the Senate. We will do the depositions,  and then we will come back, and we will present to you what the  witnesses had to say in those depositions. That is how we contemplate  the process would work.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The majority leader is recognized.
