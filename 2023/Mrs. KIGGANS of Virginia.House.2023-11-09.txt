 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Virginia  Beach Sheriff Ken Stolle, who recently retired after an incredibly  successful 43-year career in public service.   During his 13-year tenure as sheriff, Ken Stolle brought about  numerous positive changes for our local law enforcement officers and  our community, including creating a successful transition program for  inmates at the end of their sentences, implementing body cameras for  all Virginia Beach sheriff's deputies, and establishing successful  mental health programs for those serving time in the prison system.   Stolle was often quoted as saying he ran the largest mental health  facility in Hampton Roads, and his emphasis on this issue led to  policies that have been a blueprint for agencies across the country.   Before serving as sheriff of Virginia Beach, Ken worked for the  Virginia Beach Police Department, practiced law in Hampton Roads,  represented Virginia Beach in the Virginia State Senate, and served our  great Nation as a United States Navy reservist.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Sheriff Stolle for his many years of service to  our community, our Commonwealth, and our country. We wish him the best  of luck in retirement.                            ____________________
