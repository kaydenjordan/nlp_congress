 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for this opportunity  to discuss the historic preservation tax credits that historically have  stimulated nearly $150 billion in private sector investment.  [[Page H9352]]    As we have discussed over the last month, the tax credit is  critically important for economic development and revitalization,  especially in small, rural areas of this country. Without the credit,  projects that transform communities in all 50 States, from West  Virginia to Texas, to Wisconsin, simply will not happen.   Mr. Speaker, the chairman's word means something to me, so I am  asking for his commitment to continue working with me to ensure that  the Federal historic preservation tax credit is preserved in the final  tax reform package.    I yield to the gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and I look forward to  working with him as well. We have had a good working relationship over  the years. I want to continue this process because I understand this  process. I will be voting to continue the process in anticipation that  it will be in the final bill.
