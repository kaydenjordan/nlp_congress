 Mr. Speaker, as a former prosecutor, I saw many different  types of crimes committed and many different criminals through court,  but  [[Page H7177]]  none so heinous as the targeting and abuse of our Nation's children.   That is why I urge the House to consider legislation that I  introduced last year, the Child Rescue Act, which is currently in the  House Judiciary Committee.   This bipartisan bill, which I introduced with Congresswoman  Spanberger, requires the Department of Justice to convene with experts  to focus on protecting children who are suffering abusive situations,  whether this be trafficking, sexual abuse by family and trusted adults,  or pornography.   Technology companies report more than 45 million photos and videos  online of children being sexually abused in 2018, and the U.S.  Sentencing Commission also released a report last year which studied  child sexual abuse image producers and found that these crimes had  increased by 422 percent over the last 15 years.   I am proud to join this bipartisan effort to develop proactive  solutions to protect our Nation's youth and safeguard them from heinous  predators. The Child Rescue Act is a targeted solution supported by  child protection advocacy organizations, and I urge Chairman Nadler and  the Judiciary Committee to act on this legislation as quickly as  possible.                            ____________________
