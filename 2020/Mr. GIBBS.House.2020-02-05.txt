 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, no question, the Great Lakes are an important  environmental and economic resource of the United States--$200 billion  in economic activity. So many communities rely on the Great Lakes for  drinking water, jobs, recreation, and more.   While the Great Lakes may have had a troubled environmental history,  recent restoration and protection efforts have been successful.   The GLRI is a major factor in these efforts, funding projects that  will ultimately leave the Great Lakes in a better condition for future  generations to enjoy.   Several years ago, when I was chairman of the subcommittee with  jurisdiction, we had some concerns, so in our oversight responsibility  and to protect taxpayer dollars, I requested the GAO do a study of this  program, and it came back with an excellent return. That is why I think  we are getting some of these returns about what is going on. Also, it  is important that that study gave us some helpful ideas to improve the  program. We are seeing that today, and the program is working very  well.   I feel good that we did that study, and we know what is going on. We  know the taxpayer dollars are protected, and we did our oversight role.   Ohio is home to many important projects funded by the Great Lakes  Restoration Initiative: State commissions to reduce phosphorous, Asian  carp prevention, and various habitat restoration projects. The GLRI  remains an essential element in repairing and preserving the Great  Lakes.   I thank my colleague from Ohio (Mr. Joyce) for sponsoring this bill.  I urge my colleagues to support passage of H.R. 4031.
