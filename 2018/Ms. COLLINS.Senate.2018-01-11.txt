 Mr. President, today I wish to commemorate the 250th  anniversary of the city of Sanford, ME. Sanford was built with a spirit  of determination and resiliency that still guides the community today,  and this is a time to celebrate the generations of hard-working and  caring people who have made it such a wonderful place to live, work,  and raise families.   The year of Sanford's incorporation, 1768, was but one milestone in a  long journey of progress, a journey that is inextricably linked to the  history of our Nation. In 1661, British Army General William Phillips  purchased large tracts of land from two chiefs of local Abenaki Tribes  for his growing lumber business. Called Phillipstown, the lands  remained largely uninhabited due to the ongoing conflict between  England and France for control of the northern American Colonies.   Hostilities in the region ceased in 1739, and the new community grew  rapidly, reaching a population of 1,500 within just a few decades. At  the time the town was incorporated in 1768, Maine was a province of  Massachusetts, and the Governor of Massachusetts used the occasion to  honor Peleg Sanford, stepson of William Phillips and former four-term  British Governor for the State of Rhode Island.   When the American Colonists fought for independence, Sanford stood  with them. The city's cemeteries contain the headstones of 33 patriots  who joined freedom's cause.   With the Mousam River providing power, Sanford was home to more than  a dozen sawmills and gristmills. In the 1860s, Sanford truly became a  city of industry when Thomas Goodall established a massive textile mill  that produced everything from material for clothing to railroad car  upholstery. Skilled textile workers poured into Sanford from Europe and  French Canada, giving the city an international flavor that still  exists today.   In the 1950s, the owners of Sanford's textile mills began moving  operations to southern States, leaving behind thousands of jobless  workers and vast, empty factories. Local business and community leaders  responded with the energy and determination that defines the city,  traveling throughout the country to entice new employers. Noting this  remarkable effort, LIFE magazine called Sanford ``the town that refused  to die.'' Today Sanford has a diversified industrial base, from  textiles to technology.   Sanford is among Maine's oldest municipalities, but it also is  Maine's newest city, having changed its charter from the town form of  government to that of a city in 2013. It is also new in the sense of  embracing the technology of the future through the construction of both  the largest municipally owned broadband network in Maine for economic  development and a 50-megawatt solar array for renewable energy  generation. The new Academic and Career  [[Page S166]]  Technical High School that will open this summer reaffirms Sanford's  commitment to education.   The celebration of Sanford's 250th anniversary is not merely about  the passing of time. It is about human accomplishment. We celebrate the  people who, for longer than America has been a nation, have pulled  together, cared for one another, and built a great community. Thanks to  those who came before, Sanford, ME, has a wonderful history. Thanks to  those there today, it has a bright future.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 80th  anniversary of the Shawnee Peak Ski Area in Bridgton, ME. Shawnee Peak  is the oldest continually operated major ski facility in Maine and  possesses natural beauty, which combines with the love of the outdoors  and the strong sense of community of the region's residents.   Originally called Pleasant Mountain Ski Area, the facility opened  with a rope tow on January 23, 1938. That day of celebration was  preceded by many years of hard work by Bridgton's Lions Club and  Chamber of Commerce, Bridgton Academy, the Pleasant Mountain Ski Club,  and the local Civilian Conservation Corps to plan, raise money, and  clear trails. With Maine's Western Mountains providing spectacular  views of the Lakes Region and Mount Washington, Pleasant Mountain soon  began attracting skiers from throughout New England.   Renamed Shawnee Peak in 1988, the ski area has long been a place of  innovation, including the site of Maine's first T-bar and chairlift.  Shawnee Peak pioneered night skiing and in the 1970s helped to lead the  acrobatic freestyle skiing movement that is now a favorite event in the  Winter Olympics. Shawnee Peak also is a leader in offering youth  programs in skiing and snowboarding to encourage children to stay  active and to challenge themselves.   In 1994, Shawnee Peak was purchased by business leader and  entrepreneur Chet Homer and his family. Echoing the conservation ethic  that defines our State, Mr. Homer has stated he does not think of  himself as owning the mountain, but rather of being its steward.   For 80 years, Shawnee Peak Ski Area has strengthened Maine's skiing  industry, spurred economic development in a rural region, and brought  families and friends together in wholesome recreation. It is a pleasure  to congratulate Chet Homer and his team for the accomplishments of this  Maine family business and to wish them continued success in the years  to come.                            ____________________
