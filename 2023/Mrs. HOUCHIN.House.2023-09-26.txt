 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment. I  thank the gentlewoman from Wyoming for yielding and for her leadership  on this issue.   I share the concern of many of my constituents with respect to the  World Health Organization or the WHO, particularly with respect to the  recent track record related to the COVID-19 pandemic.   In fact, I supported President Trump's efforts to remove the United  States from the WHO. Our tax dollars are precious. Tax dollars should  only be spent on necessary programs and necessary programs only.   We should be prioritizing our limited resources within organizations  that have a track record of delivering for the American people.   Frankly, based on the WHO's own record, I struggle to say the WHO  fits into that category. We have had to  [[Page H4550]]  make a lot of tough decisions about what to spend taxpayer dollars on,  about what to cut and what not to cut.   An international organization with a dangerous record of protecting  the world from the spread of diseases just does not meet the simple  threshold. Are American taxpayers getting what they are paying for?   Again, I thank the gentlewoman from Wyoming for her efforts to bring  this to the floor. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
