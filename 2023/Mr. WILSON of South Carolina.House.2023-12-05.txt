 Mr. Speaker, the Midlands of South  Carolina this week celebrated the life of Dr. Kaushal Sinha on Sunday  with a memorial service at Caughman-Harman Funeral Home in Lexington.   Dr. Sinha was born February 10, 1940, in Bande Vishunpur, India, the  son of Srimati Indirawati Devi and Sri Puneet Sinha.   He and his beloved wife, Arunima, came to New York City with only $6  each in their pockets when they arrived. His first job in America was  limited to cleaning medical equipment with his medical degree  supplemented by being a night janitor.   From the humble background of a village without electricity, he  became the first college graduate of the village, leading to becoming  chief of the orthopedic department of Lexington Medical Center.   I was grateful to volunteer with Kaushal and Arunima to establish the  Hindu Temple and Cultural Center of South Carolina.   Dr. Sinha and the Indian-American community of over 4 million  citizens reinforce, with the highest income per capita of any household  of an ethnic group, that the American Dream is alive for persons who  work hard to achieve based on their personal effort, not government  dependency.   In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected  America for 20 years in the global war on terrorism as it continues  moving from the safe haven of Afghanistan to America with Biden open  borders for terrorists. It is sadly clear there will be more 9/11s  across America imminent in our country.                            ____________________
