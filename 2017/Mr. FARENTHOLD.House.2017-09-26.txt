 Mr. Speaker, I am here to talk a couple minutes about  the best and the worst that I saw during Hurricane Harvey in the 27th  District of Texas that I represent.   The worst was dished out by nature and high winds. The best was the  spirit of the Texans who rose to the challenge. It was neighbor helping  neighbor, friend helping friend, and stranger helping stranger.   I live in Corpus Christi. It is a relatively large community of  almost 400,000 in the metropolitan area. We were spared the brunt of  Harvey. It missed us by about 20 miles. But just across the bay,  communities like Port Aransas, Aransas Pass, Ingleside, Rockport,  Refugio, Tivoli, and many more took horrible winds. Ninety-some-odd  percent of the homes in the resort town of Port Aransas are  uninhabitable right now. The brand new school in Refugio they just  turned the keys over had the roof blown off and was severely water  damaged, and it will be weeks before they are fully operational again  in that school.   Rockport, with their beautiful oak trees, had limbs and branches  strewn all over the streets, and houses' second stories are gone. They  looked great from the front, but then you would look in the back, and  there would be no back.   In Port Aransas, boats having risen and moved inland, an oil drilling  platform loose in the ship channel, completely changing the skyline of  the city.   But rather than sitting around and moping and crying, Texans came  together, helped each other clear the debris, and are slowly but surely  getting on with their lives.   The recovery period is going to be tough, though. There is just so  much debris. They are picking it up and stacking it at transfer  stations, but it will be months before the process is finished. It is  tough driving down the streets of the places you love seeing debris  stacked, smelling the rotting mold. But you know it is going to come  back.   We are struggling right now to find homes for people, places for them  to stay. People have been staying with friends and relatives. FEMA has  been helping out with hotels. I have to say, I am really impressed with  the way local, State, and Federal folks are working hard to give people  a hand up. We have had leaders from President Trump down to Members of  Congress and all throughout the country come to see what is going on,  and all have pledged their help. And it is going to be a Herculean  effort to come back, but come back we will.   I suspect in a year, certainly in 2 years, towns like Rockport and  Port Aransas, where many folks vacation, are going to have their doors  open again and inviting people to come visit. In fact, the goal is to  be ready by spring break of this year, and I suspect it is going to be  worth visiting.   You need to help the businesses out, need to help the people out by  not forgetting us, by keeping us in your prayers, and by supporting us  here in Congress as we give the people the help they need to rebuild  their lives. I want to thank my colleagues from Texas, my colleagues  from the rest of the country, for the support. It is a shame that this  has been such a tough season, but we are seeing not just the resilience  of Texas but of all the American people with what is going on in  Florida. And we are going to get reports, I think, of people helping  people in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and other areas so  damaged by the storms we faced this year.                                time  1745    But I am proud to be an American. I am proud we are all helping out,  and I look forward to continuing the recovery effort in all of the  areas of this country that have been so devastated by natural disasters  this year.    Mr. Speaker, I did want to add that, though Texans  are helping people and people are helping each other, volunteer  organizations like Mr. Weber is talking about, the Federal Government,  also, is helping with FEMA and SBA loans.   Some people have gotten denial letters from FEMA. If you read them  carefully, they are not always denial letters. You should follow up  with FEMA. It may be you are just missing some paperwork.   All Congressmen have folks in their office, caseworkers or red tape  cutters, who can help if you are having problems getting the help you  need from FEMA or the SBA. We can't get them to bend or break the  rules, but if you are having trouble communicating or you feel like you  are not being treated right, please call your Member of Congress'  office because we are here to help in more ways than just sitting up  here in Washington making laws.   One of the best parts of the job is helping folks out on a one-on-one  basis, and we are doing that throughout the district I represent, from  Wharton, Bay City, Victoria, down to Corpus Christi, Rockport, and to  all the other communities that I represent.   So I just want to make sure folks knew that your congressional office  is a resource.
