 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from New York  for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, because we are talking about need this morning, having  seen Mr. Deutch in Florida, let me offer my deepest sympathy for the  tragic loss of our children.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today to be able to speak for many of those who  cannot be on the floor today, and that is the millions of disabled  Americans; and to be able to say that with all of the consternation and  the uncomfortableness of some of the very important people in America:  small businesses, the engine of our economy.   I have to stand and speak for the value of civil rights and the civil  rights of Americans with disabilities who waited for centuries to not  be looked upon in distaste and disgust.   I remember preceding the passage of the American with Disabilities  Act. George H.W. Bush is a Texan, and I see often his passion for  passing that bill.   There are 57 million Americans with disabilities. That translates to  1 in 5 Americans. There are 31 million Americans with physical  disabilities.   I heard some of their comments: ``As an older woman with  disabilities, I feel invisible.'' Or ``I am not living; I am just  existing.''   The ``notice and cure'' framework included in this bill would  fundamentally change the structure of the ADA's public accommodations  title and remove any reasons for business to comply proactively with  the law.   The same as the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that we now suffer because  we gutted section 4 and section 5, and we have voter suppression, and  people are not having their civil rights in terms of voting.   You touch this in a way that you undermine the very existence of  people living with disabilities. I am outraged, even though I am  empathetic.   But if it is a problem of lawyers, State bars can regulate them and  State courts can regulate them. You can punish or sanction lawyers who  do not have the proper protocols.   Mr. Chairman, this is wrongheaded. I ask my colleagues to stand for  civil rights for Americans with disabilities. This is not just an  amendment. It is undermining the civil rights of those  [[Page H1187]]  who are living with disabilities. They have a right to live.   Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 620, the ``ADA Education and  Reform Act,'' legislation that would infringe on important civil rights  of Americans who live with physical disabilities.   I am deeply troubled that the House of Representatives is taking up  H.R. 620, legislation that would remove any incentive businesses  currently have to comply with this longstanding civil rights law and  undermining protections that allow millions to live independently and  in the dignified manner they deserve.   There are about 57 million Americans with disabilities; that number  translates to 1 in 5 Americans.   There are 31 million Americans with physical disabilities who use a  wheelchair, cane, crutches, or a walker.   And for that I commend former President George H. W. Bush, along with  many members of Congress, for their leadership in passing the Americans  with Disabilities Act of 1990, legislation that made our country's  public spaces more accessible to those with disabilities.   H.R. 620 would require disabled persons to notify businesses of a  violation of the ADA's public accommodation provisions contained in  title III of the act, and wait up to 180 days to remedy that alleged  violation before a lawsuit could be filed, presenting a direct  undermining of the civil rights of Americans with disabilities.   The ``notice and cure'' framework included in this bill would  fundamentally change the structure of the ADA's public accommodations  title and remove any reasons for business to comply proactively with  the law.   H.R. 620's notice and cure provisions will have the effect of  inappropriately shifting the burden of enforcing compliance with a  federal civil rights statute from the alleged wrongdoer onto the  discrimination victim.   Moreover, it would undermine the carefully calibrated voluntary  compliance regime that is one of the hallmarks of the ADA, a regime  formed through negotiations between the disability rights community and  the business community when the ADA was being drafted 28 years ago.   H.R. 620 would, instead, perversely incentivize a public  accommodation to not comply with the ADA unless and until it receives a  notice of a violation pursuant to H.R. 620's notice provision.   Finally, the bill does nothing to address the problem that its  proponents seek to address, which is the purported concern with the  filing of meritless lawsuits by certain plaintiffs' attorneys, a  problem (to the extent that it is actually a problem) that is one of  state law, not the federal ADA.   This is not the first time in this Congress, or even this year, that  I witness the Republicans, allegedly a party for state's rights,  completely undermine the established idea that tort law should be left  for states to legislate without interference from federal mandates.   H.R. 620's proponents have never adequately articulated why federal  law must be amended to address a problem driven by state law.   Also, the bill makes no attempt to distinguish between meritorious  and non-meritorious lawsuits and would, instead, impose its harmful and  unnecessary requirements on all ADA claims, regardless of potential  merit.   I remain adamantly opposed to any effort to weaken the ability of  individuals to enforce their rights under federal civil rights laws and  I am concerned that H.R. 620 would undermine the key enforcement  mechanism of the ADA and other civil rights laws, namely, the ability  to file private lawsuits to enforce rights.   Joining me and my colleagues in opposition is a broad coalition of  236 disability rights groups, including:   American Foundation for the Blind,   the Bazelon Center for Mental Health,   the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation,   the National Council on Independent Living,   the National Disability Rights Network,   the Paralyzed Veterans of America,   Vietnam Veterans of America,   the AFL-CIO,   the Anti-Defamation League,   Human Rights Campaign,   the NAACP, and   the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.   Additionally, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights  opposes the bill because it would ``remove incentives for businesses to  comply with the law unless and until people with disabilities are  denied access'' which ``would lead to the continued exclusion of people  with disabilities from the mainstream of society and would turn back  the clock on disability rights in America.''   Likewise, the American Civil Liberties Union opposes H.R. 620 because  it would ``fundamentally alter [the] way in which a person with a  disability enforces their civil rights and would severely limit access  to places of public accommodations.''   For the foregoing reasons and those discussed below, we strongly  oppose H.R. 620 and respectfully dissent from the Committee report.   While it is very important to protect small and growing businesses,  we can do so without jeopardizing the rights of disabled individuals to  have a day in court.   I do not believe that we have crossed the T's and dotted the I's with  all the information that we should have in trying to improve our  situation and address the concerns of many small businesses.   Small businesses are the heartbeat of America and the backbone of  successful communities, which is why I have served as one of their  strongest advocates during my tenure in Congress.   But the reality is that H.R. 620 does not help small businesses, it  only hurts the disabled.   I do, however, hope that we can achieve this balanced goal through a  different avenue.   So today I stand with Ranking Member Nadler, Congressman Langevin and  all those who stand for civil rights and for the rights of Americans  with disabilities.   For these reasons I oppose H.R. 620.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chairman, first of all, the American Bar  Association supports this legislation.   Secondarily, the gentleman is talking about lawyers, not the  disabled. Let the State bars and let the State courts regulate these  lawyers. Sanction them, just like we have sanctions in the Federal  court system.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the rule which  makes in order H.R. 620, the ``ADA Education and Reform Act,''  legislation that would infringe on important civil rights of Americans  who live with physical disabilities.
