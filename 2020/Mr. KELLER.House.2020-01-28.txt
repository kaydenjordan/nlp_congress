 Madam Speaker, as part of a productive district work  period, our team met with job creators and employers who are members of  the Williamsport/Lycoming Chamber of Commerce.   The topic of discussion was the so-called Protecting the Right to  Organize Act, otherwise known as the PRO Act. One thing was clear from  these individuals: The PRO Act is a bad bill that has too much  government interference in the employee-employer relationship.   More than being bad for employers, the PRO Act is terrible for  workers. Cloaked in the language of employee protection, the real  result of the PRO Act is providing workers with fewer choices, fewer  rights, and an inability to speak directly for themselves.   Our Nation is experiencing the greatest economy in generations with  the lowest unemployment rate for all categories of Americans since I  was 4 years old. Congress should not pass legislation that would slow  economic growth, stifle job creation, and limit workers' free choice  and privacy. Yet, that is exactly what the PRO Act would do.   If Congress really cares about jobs, the economy, and workers'  rights, it should say no to the PRO Act.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to amend the rule  to provide for a motion to recommit on the Senate amendment to H.R. 550  so that minority voices can be heard on the critical issue of war.
