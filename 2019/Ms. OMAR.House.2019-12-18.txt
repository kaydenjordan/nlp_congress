 Madam Speaker, on March 7, 1788, six months after the  Constitution was signed at Independence Hall, Alexander Hamilton laid  out in detail the standards for impeachment in the Federalist papers.   Impeachment should, quote `proceed from the misconduct of public men,  or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust,'  Hamilton wrote.   Donald Trump has without question met these standards.   These words from our framers--they don't only serve as guidance for  people in this country.   They serve as guidance for people around the world wishing to build a  sound system of government.   And they have allowed us in the United States of America, to stand  for democracy and the rule of law around the world.  [[Page H12194]]    So as the world watches, captivated and bewildered by the lawlessness  of our president, I hope they are also able to see the full functioning  of our democracy as we hold him accountable.   With this impeachment vote, the world is able to see the fruits of  our democracy and the glory of the checks and balances preserved in our  Constitution.   Unlike the dictatorship that my family fled from, in a democracy, we  don't just vote. We get to impeach a lawless president.
