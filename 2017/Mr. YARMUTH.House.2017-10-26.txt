 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the bill we are debating today is not a real effort at  responsible budgeting. It is a means to an end: a single-minded plan to  make it easier to enact tax cuts for the wealthy and big corporations,  regardless of the consequences for everyone else.   If approved by the House today, an irresponsible $1.5 trillion tax  bill will come to the floor in a matter of weeks. It is being rushed  because Republicans don't want the American people to know what is in  it. They don't want you to find out that it overwhelmingly benefits the  wealthy while increasing taxes on millions of middle class families.   Rushing through legislation that impacts nearly every American family  and business is reckless, and voting on a bill that rewrites our  Nation's Tax Code a week or two after it is introduced without any real  input from the people who will be impacted is negligent. But that is  what you do when you can't defend your own policy.   And there are a lot of unjustifiable provisions in this budget. On  top of massive tax cuts for the rich, it cuts vital national  investments, threatening our economic progress and our national  security. It cuts more than $4 trillion in mandatory spending,  including nearly $2 trillion from Medicare and Medicaid alone.   The enormity of these cuts and the severity of the consequences for  American families cannot be overstated. But more cuts will be coming  once the Republican tax cuts blow an enormous hole in the budget. We  will see a tax on Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, nutrition  assistance--on important benefits that help American families get  ahead.   I know my Republican colleagues desperately want to believe that the  tax cuts in their budget will pay for themselves and usher in a new era  of economic growth--or at least they want the American people to  believe that. But the record is clear, this approach has failed time  and time again.   And now, even though the evidence and experts have concluded that  these tax cuts will not create an economic boom but will, instead, lead  to a higher concentration of wealth among the rich while dramatically  increasing deficits and debt, my Republican colleagues are trying to do  it again.   Everything we do in Congress should be about making the lives of  American families better and more secure. We owe them a budget that  invests in their future, a Tax Code that is fair, and a full and honest  debate on both. This budget and the tax cuts that will follow are a  failure on all fronts.   I, therefore, urge my Republican colleagues to abandon this dangerous  budget and start addressing the needs and priorities of the American  people.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. DelBene), a distinguished Member of  the House Budget Committee and Ways and Means Committee.   Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this budget  proposal.   With many working families and businesses still struggling to adapt  to a rapidly changing economy, our top priority in Congress should be  helping expand opportunities, opportunities to sustain long-term  economic growth  [[Page H8244]]  and security so no American is left behind.   Unfortunately, the bill we are voting on today is not a serious  budget designed to help middle class families. Instead, this budget is  simply a vehicle to rush through a partisan tax proposal using a  process known as reconciliation.   And what is worse, the Ryan-McConnell tax plan would add trillions of  dollars to the deficit, making our children foot the bill for tax cuts  that disproportionately benefit the wealthiest. In fact, the Tax Policy  Center has estimated that the Ryan-McConnell tax plan could raise taxes  by an average of $1,209 a year on families earning between $50,000 and  $150,000 a year. This is moving in the wrong direction.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''    Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal), a distinguished member of  the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I remind the prior speaker, my friend from  California, that Arthur Laffer was also the architect of the Kansas  plan, which was disastrous for that State. So citing him as a source, I  would be a little bit careful.   Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Lee), a distinguished member of the Budget  Committee and the Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Brendan F. Boyle), a distinguished member of the  Budget Committee.   Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose  the billionaires' budget. That is exactly what the Republican budget  is. 79.7 percent of it goes to the richest 1 percent.   On top of that, who pays for it? The middle class and working class  families of my district. Some 50 million Americans will be paying more  in taxes, not less, as a result of this tax plan.   Now, I have nothing against the billionaires that my friends on the  other side are so eager to help. I just don't think the working class  and middle class families of my district should be paying for their tax  cuts.   We should instead have a budget that focuses on building the middle  class out, on lifting up those who have been working for the last 15  years and not getting a pay increase. This budget does absolutely  nothing for those families, zero.   On top of all of this, it adds $1.5 trillion to our national debt. It  is wrong. It does not do anything to help the great American middle  class, and it must be rejected.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), the assistant Democratic leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Carbajal), a distinguished member of the Budget  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), a distinguished member of the  Budget Committee.   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, to my friend on the other side of the aisle, the  gentlewoman from Tennessee, the reality is that the truth hurts. This  budget resolution totally abandons America's most cherished values and  betrays its highest ideals.   This extreme budget not only threatens programs for our veterans and  hungry children, it makes drastic cuts to the Medicare and Medicaid  programs that our seniors count on for survival.   As it doles out that budgetary cruelty, this resolution hands massive  tax cuts to millionaires and powerful corporations all while adding  $2.4 trillion to the deficit over the next decade.   It also fails to protect our environment, neglects our children's  education, and once more targets women's healthcare for severe cuts.   In short, the wealthy win, the middle class is ignored, and we all  get saddled with more debt. Those are not values that this House should  stand for. It is certainly not what veterans, children, seniors, or  hardworking Americans deserve. This irresponsible budget rewards the  rich and powerful and punishes everyone else, and that is the best  thing that I can say about it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Jeffries), a distinguished member of the Budget  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Levin), a distinguished member of the Ways and Means  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I now yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a distinguished member of the  Budget Committee.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me  time.   Mr. Speaker, the American people will look forward to a Thanksgiving  and a Christmas of which families come together, but they will also see  a Halloween.   Today, on the floor of the House, the Republicans will vote for the  worst Halloween of hobgoblins and ghosts and monsters that you can ever  imagine. Monsters scare children, so today we will be voting on that  monster that will scare children.   Let me let you listen to Senator Sykes from Kansas, her State  offering a Republican tax cut that was going to boost the economy. Her  words are: ``With the benefit of hindsight, we can say with certainty  this promise was unfulfilled. In the following 5 years, Kansas  experienced nine rounds of budget cuts, stress on State agencies, and  the inability to effectively provide the core functions of government  for our citizens.''   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record Senator Sykes' message to  Congress.    A Message to Congress: Don't Make the Same Mistake We Did in Kansas      (By Dinah Sykes, a Republican member of the Kansas State Senate)         Americans want efficient government, responsible spending       and reasonable taxes. This is not difficult. Yet sometimes       what  [[Page H8248]]       seems so simple becomes complicated when these concepts are       turned into buzzwords and used as weapons for political gain.        In 2012, Republicans in Kansas enacted a ``revolutionary''       tax overhaul promised to be a ``shot of adrenaline to the       heart of the Kansas economy.'' With the benefit of hindsight,       we can say with certainty this promise was unfulfilled. In       the following five years, Kansas experienced nine rounds of       budget cuts, stress on state agencies and the inability to       effectively provide the core functions of government for our       citizens.        As Republicans in Congress begin working to modify the       federal tax code, I worry that tax reform done poorly could       lead to similar failure. I hope federal lawmakers learn from       mistakes made at the state level.        This year, the Kansas legislature--including many       Republicans like me--voted to partially restore income-tax       rates and to repeal a provision that allowed independent       business owners to pay almost no state taxes on their income.       We also overrode our governor's veto, who opposed rolling       back the tax cuts he championed.        Critics of our vote claim that Kansas didn't cut spending       enough to accompany the tax cuts. In reality, we cut our       budget through across-the-board cuts, targeted cuts,       rescission bills and allotments. Roughly 3,000 state employee       positions were cut, salaries were frozen, and road projects       canceled. We delayed payments to the state employee       retirement system and emptied our savings accounts. Even as       we issued more than $2 billion in new bonds to float our       debt, Kansas received three credit downgrades, making that       debt costlier.        In Kansas, we understand the allure of tax-cut promises. We       want to believe promises of amazing growth or outcomes. In       2012, traditional budget forecast models accurately predicted       the devastating effect the tax breaks would have on state       revenue. Proponents of the plan used dynamic scoring       predicting incredible economic growth and supporting their       own preconceived ideas. Today, we know which forecasts were       correct.        Across the state, citizens may have been paying less in       income taxes, but those decreases were offset by increases in       sales taxes, property taxes and fees. These changes alone       were not enough to put the state on the right path. Education       and infrastructure, key investments necessary for strong       economic growth, were treated as the enemy. As we went       through our 2017 legislative session, the ``shot of economic       adrenaline'' still showed no signs of materializing. Our       state functioned as though the Great Recession had never       ended.        Kansas should serve as a cautionary tale illustrating the       damage done when the normal order is shortchanged. America's       founders and countless generations of leaders embedded       deliberative procedures into our legislative process for a       reason. But in 2012, the governor's tax proposal looked very       different from the package he signed. A dispute between House       and Senate versions should have gone to conference committee;       however, the House cut short debate and rammed through a       motion to concur with the Senate instead. I watch now as       lawmakers in Congress use similar tactics, and I worry that       backroom dealing and circumvention of process will lead to       similar results.        I never anticipated entering public service. I was content       raising my family, participating in the PTA and operating my       business. However, I saw the impact that bad tax policy was       having on the state. I felt the results of growing class       sizes and shrinking programs in the schools my children       attended. I witnessed a gradual erosion of the quality of       life that makes Kansas such a great place to live.        There is a real temptation to let our frustration turn into       anger. In our increasingly polarized world, we see what       happens when we retreat to our ideological trenches. The       antidote, it would seem to me, is listening carefully to       those we disagree with and seeking common ground as a       starting point. (We should also note that failing to listen       to constituents while blindly holding to ideology can have       consequences: About a third of Kansas legislators became ex-      legislators in 2016.)        As our country looks at the key issues ahead of us,       including tax policy and health-care reform, we face       important questions: How can we as Americans work together to       improve our tax policy? How can we work together to provide       core government functions? Answering those questions requires       having civil conversations, learning from our neighbors and       sharing our experiences. We are better when we can work       together to find compromise.    Ms. JACKSON LEE. What do you think will happen to this Nation if we  vote for this budget plan, this Halloween of a plan?   The latest Republican budget mandates $4.9 trillion in budget cuts.   Mr. Speaker, I cannot vote for this. I cannot vote for it because of  the people in Texas after Hurricane Harvey; the people in Louisiana  after Hurricane Nate; the people in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands,  and Florida after Hurricanes Maria and Irma. I cannot vote for this.  This will gut disaster relief, education, infrastructure, research,  veterans benefits, and it will clearly provide tax cuts for the rich.   The Republican budget provides $1.6 trillion in tax cuts to  millionaires, billionaires, wealthy corporations. It doesn't give any  money to the middle class.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Mitchell). The time of the gentlewoman  has expired.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentlewoman.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, it explodes the deficit.   How could this happen?   It demands higher cuts to Medicare, Social Security, and education.  This is a Halloween that America will not tolerate.   My good friend from North Carolina, there will be over a million  people that will lose benefits under this plan and the tax plan that  they are planning. They will pay higher taxes. This is a bad bill. Vote  it down.   Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Budget Committee, I rise in strong  and unyielding opposition to the Senate Amendment to H. Con. Res. 71,  the Congressional Budget Resolution for Fiscal Year 2018.   As senior member of the Homeland Security Committee, the Ranking  Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland  Security, and Investigations, I oppose this phony budget resolution,  which is in reality nothing more than a smoke screen designed to pave  the way for massive tax cuts for the top 1 percent, while exploding the  debt and deficit by $1.5 trillion over ten years.   Here are five reasons why every Member of this House should vote  against this Republican budget resolution:   1. This Republican budget cuts nearly $1.3 trillion from Medicaid and  nearly $500 million from Medicaid;   2. This Republican budget includes massive spending cuts to the  priorities of the American people;   3. This Republican budget guts investment in areas critical to  expanding economic opportunity;   4. This latest Republican budget uses fast track procedures to  increase the debt and deficits by $1.5 trillion, while showering tax  cuts on billionaires, millionaires, and the wealthiest corporations;  and   5. As we have learned from bitter and painful experience, tax cuts do  not pay for themselves, notwithstanding the supply-side fairy tale  claims that they do.    This latest Republican budget mandates $4.9 trillion in spending  cuts to top priorities like disaster relief, education, infrastructure,  research, veteran benefits, and programs that expand opportunities for  American families.   This Republican budget provides $1.6 trillion in tax cuts to  millionaires, billionaires, and wealthy corporations, while raising  taxes on working and middle class families by $470 billion.   Mr. Speaker, let us be very clear and direct: the resolution before  us is not intended to reconcile tax and spending priorities to reflect  the priorities of the American people or to reduce the deficit and  national debt or to put our fiscal house on a sustainable path to  economic growth.   Rather the sole purpose of Republicans bringing this job-killing  budget to the floor today is to fast-track their ``Billionaires First''  tax plan, which will cause significant harm to working and middle class  families, especially to my constituents in the Eighteenth Congressional  District of Texas.   The McConnell-Ryan tax plan, which this budget resolution is designed  to grease the skids for, would raise taxes on about 1.5 million Texas  households, or 12.4 percent of households next year.   On average, families earning up to $86,000 annually would see a $794  increase in their tax liability, a significant burden on families  struggling to afford child care and balance their checkbook.   An estimated 2.8 million Texas households deduct state and local  taxes with an average deduction of $7,823 in 2015.   The Ryan-McConnell plan eliminates this deduction, which would lower  home values and put pressure on states and towns to collect revenues  they depend on to fund schools, roads, and vital public resources.   The proposed elimination of the personal exemption will harm millions  of Texans by taking away the $4,050 deduction for each taxpayer and  claimed dependent; in 2015, roughly 9.3 million dependent exemptions  were claimed in the Lone Star State.   Equally terrible is that the McConnell-Ryan tax plan drastically  reduces the Earned Income Tax Credit, which encourages work for 2.7  million low-income individuals in Texas, helping them make ends meet  with an average credit of $2,689.   The EITC and the Child Tax Credit lift about 1.2 million Texans,  including 663,000 children, out of poverty each year.   This reckless and irresponsible GOP tax plan is made all the more  obscene by the fact that 80 percent of the GOP's tax cuts go to the  wealthiest 1 percent.  [[Page H8249]]    To achieve this goal of giving more and more to the haves and the  ``have mores,'' the GOP budget betrays seniors, children, the most  vulnerable, and needy, and working and middle-class families.   The steep reductions in program investments proposed in this  Republican budget fall most heavily on low-income families, students  struggling to afford college, seniors, and persons with disabilities.   This Republican budget immediately guts investment critical to  expanding economic opportunity by lowering the already inadequate  austerity-level spending caps by an additional $5 billion in 2018 and  by even more in subsequent years.   Republican budget adopts Trumpcare but does even more damage because  in addition to depriving more than 20 million Americans of healthcare,  denying protection to persons with preexisting conditions, and raising  costs for older and low-income adults, cuts more than $1.8 trillion  from Medicaid and Medicare.   Republican budget ends the Medicare guarantee and calls for replacing  Medicare's guaranteed benefits with fixed payments for the purchase of  health insurance, shifting costs and financial risks onto seniors and  disabled workers; this represents a $500 billion cut to Medicare over  ten years.   The Republican budget focuses too narrowly on the military,  shortchanging American soft-power and other essential elements of  national security by increasing defense spending by $72 billion above  the cap and hollowing out the State Department and foreign aid agencies  with cuts of $11 billion and environmental and natural resource  protection by more than $6 billion.   Mr. Speaker, the federal budget is more than a financial document; it  is an expression of our values and priorities as a nation.   Sadly, this latest Republican budget, just like the previous one and  the President's ``skinny budget,'' fails this moral test of government.   America will not be made great by stealing another $1.8 trillion from  Medicare and Medicaid, abandoning seniors and families in need,  depriving students of realizing a dream to attend college without  drowning in debt, or disinvesting in the working families just to give  unwanted tax breaks to wealthy corporations and the top 1 percent.   America will not be positioned to compete and win in the global,  interconnected, and digital economy by slashing funding for scientific  research, the arts and humanities, job retraining, and clean energy.   Even a cursory review leaves the inescapable conclusion that this  budget represents a betrayal--of our values as a nation, and of the  promises made by the President during the election campaign.   This Republican budget is not a budget for the real world that real  Americans live in but is as much a fantasy budget as the Trump ``Skinny  Budget'' in that it pretends to achieve balance by assuming that  painless spending cuts can and will be made by the Congress.   To put this reckless, irresponsible, and draconian budget in  perspective, it is useful to examine what the proposed cuts mean when  applied to the programs depended upon by Americans to rise up the  economic ladder, plan for the future, provide for their families, and  strive to achieve the American Dream.   The elimination of funding for Community Development Block Grants  (CDBG) drains resources from communities, even in times of disaster  because CDBG provides flexible grants to local communities for a wide  range of unique needs, including Meals on Wheels, housing programs, and  community infrastructure improvements.   The Republican budget targets disaster grants made by the Federal  Emergency Management Agency, which help families and businesses when  their disaster-related property losses are not covered by insurance.   The Republican budget makes higher education more expensive by  cutting at least $211 billion from student financial aid programs, like  Pell Grants, over ten years.   The Republican budget also eliminates subsidized loans, making it  difficult for students, particularly low-income students, to afford  college and compounds the damage by making it more difficult to repay  student loans by eliminating the Public Sector Loan Forgiveness and  Teacher Loan Forgiveness programs.   The Republican budget's solution to the affordable housing crisis  currently facing cities large and small all across the country is to  convert all discretionary spending on affordable housing into a block  grant, which means there will be even less assistance to help the 71  percent of extremely low income renter households who spend more than  half their income on housing.   The Republican budget cuts at least $150 billion from the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) over the next ten  years by essentially converting it to a block grant, cutting off  funding for eligible individuals and requiring cash-strapped states to  either fill in the gap or take away food assistance from millions of  working families, children, and seniors.   Mr. Speaker, as economists and policy experts have documented time  and again, immigration reform would expand the size of the U.S.  workforce, and in turn would increase the size of the economy and  reduce deficits.   The Republican budget, however, again rejects comprehensive  immigration reform that would bring clear and just rules for those  seeking citizenship and help secure the nation's borders.   In doing so, the Republican budget squanders an opportunity to reduce  deficits by an estimated $900 billion over the next two decades, boost  the economy by 5.4 percent, and extend the solvency of Social Security.   The Republican budget continues to target federal employees by  cutting their compensation and benefits by at least another $163  billion over ten years, which comes on top of the $182 billion in cuts  federal employees have already absorbed in the form of higher  retirement contributions, pay freezes, and furloughs.   The Republican budget cuts hurts veterans by cutting veterans  benefits by nearly $50 billion over the next ten years, with newly  eligible veterans experiencing cuts in programs that pay for education  benefits as well as loan guarantees.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, it must be pointed out that the Republican  budget's pretension to balance is based on reliance on trillions of  dollars in budget games and gimmicks to rig the numbers.   The Republican budget counts a dubious $1.4 trillion ``economic  dividend'' from cutting taxes and taking away consumer protections that  is not backed up by any credible analysis or historical experience.   The Republican budget assumes, despite all precedent and evidence to  the contrary, that tax reform will be revenue neutral, even though  Republican tax plans are projected to lose between $3 trillion and $7  trillion.   Given these budgetary shenanigans, never could it more truly be said  that ``figures don't lie, but liars figure.''   In evaluating the merits of a budget resolution, it is not enough to  subject it only to the test of fiscal responsibility.   To keep faith with the nation's past, to be fair to the nation's  present, and to safeguard the nation's future, the budget must also  pass a ``moral test.''   The Republican budget resolution fails both of these standards.   I strongly oppose the Senate Amendment to H. Con. Res. 71 and urge  all Members to join me in voting against this reckless, cruel, and  heartless budget resolution that will do nothing to improve the lives  or well-being of middle and working class families, and the poor and  vulnerable `caught in the tentacles of circumstance.'    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time remains.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Kentucky has 12\3/4\  minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ half minutes to the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Neal), the ranking member of the Ways  and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the Democratic whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), a distinguished member of the Budget  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Vermont (Mr. Welch), a distinguished member of the Energy and  Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time we have  remaining.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Kentucky has 5\3/4\  minutes remaining. The gentlewoman from Tennessee has 5\1/4\ minutes  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   As we wind down our arguments here, once again, we have had a very  fascinating discussion and, once again, we seem to disagree on  virtually everything.   For instance, I have heard from the other side many times over the  last few days and today that we really can't say what the impact is,  the claims that we are making about whether this bill will help the  rich or help the middle class or help lower income individuals, because  we don't have the details. Well, that is absolutely correct; we don't  have the details.   But then, if we don't have the details, how can the other side talk  about the huge benefits that this proposal, this tax proposal that is  yet unwritten, will provide for the middle class? And how can they deny  that it will benefit the wealthy disproportionately?   We know from the outline that was released by the other side in  recent weeks that they intend to eliminate the estate tax. The estate  tax only benefits wealthy Americans, people with estates over $11  million for a couple.   They want to eliminate the alternative minimum tax. We know the  alternative minimum tax only affects wealthy individuals. There was one  estimate that the one year of President Trump's tax return that we  have, that in that year alone, the alternative minimum tax, if it were  repealed, would have saved him $30 million. So we know that affects  very wealthy people.                                time  1015    We know that if you reduce the top rate from 39.6 percent to 35  percent, that benefits very high-income people. So we do have enough  information to draw some pretty definite conclusions about the impact  that the released outline, at least, will have on wealthy Americans,  and we can draw some of the same conclusions about how it will hurt  middle class Americans.   If, in fact, the Republican tax bill repeals the deduction for State  and local taxes. In my State, there will be half a million people who  will lose an average of $9,900 of deductions every year. So we  absolutely know the impact that the proposal, as we know it now, will  have, and I think it is fair--given that there will be no hearings on  this bill--it is fair to raise the alarms about what the potential for  this bill is.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I now have the distinct honor of yielding 1  minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), the Democratic  leader.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would just like to say that, for anyone  watching this debate or watching any of our discussions out there in  the country, I know it often appears that we don't get along, that we  hate each other, and that we are at each other's throat, but nothing  could be further from the truth.   It has been such an honor to work with Chairman Black as a member of  the Budget Committee and all the Members. We do all respect each other  and get along. We just have some very serious disagreements about  policy. That is fair. That is what this country is about.   Once again, since I may not get to do it again as Chairman Black  pursues another office and probably won't appear with me on the same  program anymore, I just want to wish her the best and say what a joy it  has been to work with her.
