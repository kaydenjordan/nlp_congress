 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Cuban  people and in opposition to communism.   In the last week, we have seen thousands of people in Cuba rise up in  protest against the decades-long communist regime that has oppressed  millions.   Since these protests began, more than 100 people have been detained  by the communist government or have been reported missing. In response  to these protests, the government has shut down communications, turning  off internet service to their own people.   When I see what is happening in Cuba, I am reminded again why America  is the greatest country on Earth. In our country, a first-generation  Korean American can build an American Dream here and become a  Congresswoman. In our country, we respect and value our freedom of  speech and expression.   My parents fled North Korea and the country's communist rule. My  family knows what it was like to have to wait in line for basic  necessities. That is not how people deserve to live, and that is how  the people of Cuba are forced to live every day under communist rule.   We should stand with the people of Cuba. I stand with those fighting  for freedom, justice, and democracy.                           Enforce Immigration Laws     Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss the crisis on our  southern border. As an immigrant to this country, I strongly support  legal immigration and a system that is grounded in the rule of law.   The United States is a nation of immigrants. They add to the rich  fabric of our country. However, we are also a nation of laws. The  crisis on our southern border is not law and order.   As a Representative from California, a border State, I often hear  from my constituents about their concerns with the chaos at our border  created by the Biden administration's policies. The security of our  borders and enforcement of our immigration laws are vital to the safety  and security of our Nation.   We must contain this crisis and make it clear to the people that to  come to America, you must do it legally.                            ____________________
