 Madam President, over the weekend, I was reflecting on  the times that our Nation finds itself in today. We are witnessing the  rebirth of a new civil rights movement when it comes to reforming our  police departments.   Americans now know the names of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Freddie  Gray, and so many others. The current protests we have seen throughout  the Nation and throughout the world are a direct result of an  incredible leap in technology, where individual citizens and officers  themselves can record interactions between police officers and members  of the community in real time.   But these troubling interactions between the police and the citizens  they are sworn to protect and serve that we saw on video is not new,  but we now have the evidence. They just happened to be caught, creating  stronger legal evidence of misconduct and abuse.   Today, as our Nation experiences yet another civil rights movement,  this time during a pandemic, I want to share with my colleagues some  words of inspiration I often turn to in times of trouble.   First, in the Constitution: ``We the people of the United States, in  Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice. . . . '' That is  the first mention in the Constitution.   Let us think how we in the United States can help to establish  justice, as we are exhorted to do in the Constitution, which we are  sworn to uphold and defend.   The second set of words I would like to share with you are from my  colleague and dear friend, the late Elijah Cummings, who represented  Baltimore in the Congress for many years. Representative Cummings gave  the eulogy for Freddie Gray in 2015, who died after being arrested and  taken into police custody. During Freddie Gray's church service, Elijah  closed with a quote from the Old Testament Book of Amos:         I want justice--oceans of it. I want fairness--rivers of       it. That is what I want. That is all I want.    The third story I want to share with my colleagues is the inspiration  I felt from reading Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s ``Letter from a  Birmingham Jail,'' in April of 1963. Dr. King wrote:         We know through painful experiences that freedom is never       voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by       the oppressed. Frankly, I have yet to engage in a direct       action campaign that was ``well-timed,'' [in the view] of       those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of       segregation. For years now I have heard the words ``Wait!''       It rings in the ear of every Negro with a piercing       familiarity. This ``Wait'' has almost always meant ``Never.''        We must come to see, with one of our distinguished jurors,       that ``justice too long delayed is justice denied.''        We have waited for more than 340 years for our       constitutional and God given rights . . . Perhaps it is easy       for those who have never felt the stinging darts of       segregation to say, ``Wait.'' But when you have seen vicious       mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown your       sisters and brothers at whim; when you have seen hate filled       policemen curse, kick and even kill your black brothers and       sisters; when you see the vast majority of your twenty       million Negro brothers smothering in an airtight cage of       poverty in the midst of affluent society . . . when you have       to concoct an answer for a five year old son who is asking:       ``Daddy, why do white people treat colored people so mean?''       . . . when you are harried by day and haunted by night by the       fact that you are a Negro, living constantly at tiptoe       stance, never quite knowing what to expect next, and are       plagued with inner fears and outer resentments; when you are       forever fighting a degenerating sense of ``nobodiness''--then       you will understand why we find it difficult to wait. There       comes a time when the cup of endurance runs over, and men are       no longer willing to be plunged into the abyss of despair. I       hope, sirs, you understand our legitimate and unavoidable       impatience.    So this weekend, as I was thinking about our charge to establish  justice in the Constitution and the pleas from Elijah Cummings and Dr.  King, I contemplated where we are today. We are at a point in our  Nation that we need to make transformational change when it comes to  our police officers and their  [[Page S3176]]  fundamental relationships with our communities, in particular the  African-American community and other communities of color. We can no  longer wait. We must make bold changes now.   I agree with Leader Schumer and Senators Booker and Harris, who are  the authors of the Justice in Policing Act. My concern is that the  legislation authored by Senator Scott, the JUSTICE Act, falls  dangerously short for what we need for comprehensive, effective, and  transformational police reform that our country and the American people  are demanding.   I, therefore, hope that Leader McConnell will negotiate with Leader  Schumer so we can work on a bipartisan bill and establish a  constructive starting point on policing reform. I listened to the  debate with Senator Scott and Senator Kaine, and I have seen this  before. When we bring a partisan bill to the floor where there is no  prearranged opportunity to offer the types of amendments with simple  majority votes so the rule of the Senate can prevail and when you start  from a point that cannot lead to successful conclusion, you shouldn't  start. You should go back to negotiate a truly bipartisan bill.   We should use the model of the CARES Act legislation that was signed  into law in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. That was a bipartisan  bill that was brought to the floor. Let me just highlight a few of my  concerns with the JUSTICE Act.   This legislation does not contain any mechanisms to hold law  enforcement officers accountable in court for their misconduct. For  example, it makes no changes in the law when it comes to qualified  immunity or criminal intent standards for law enforcement. Current  legal standards have allowed law enforcement officers regularly to  evade criminal liability for excessive use of force and have shielded  officers from liability, even when they violate citizens'  constitutional rights.   The JUSTICE Act does not implement a public national misconduct  registry necessary to ensure communities have information necessary to  hold their law enforcement officers accountable. The JUSTICE Act fails  to establish a collection of all use-of-force data, data related to  religious and racial profiling, and it does nothing to end harmful  policing practices like racial and religious profiling.   By contrast, the Justice in Policing Act authored by Senators Booker  and Harris does contain legislation I authored, the End Racial and  Religious Profiling Act. Why do we need that? Studies have shown that  Blacks are 3.6 times more likely to be arrested for selling drugs,  despite the fact that Whites are more likely to sell drugs. Studies  show that Blacks are 2.5 times more likely to be arrested for  possessing drugs, despite using drugs at the same rate as Whites.   This is just wrong, and Congress and even President Trump recognized  this when we made some modest improvements to the FIRST STEP Act. That  was a bipartisan bill and started as a bipartisan bill, and we were  able to get it enacted. The End Racial and Religious Profiling Act is  designed to enforce the constitutional rights to equal protections  under law by eliminating racial- and religious-based discriminatory  profiling at all levels of law enforcement by changing the policies and  procedures.   It allows police to focus their work more accurately, rather than  wasting resources on blanket stereotypes. It requires enhanced data  collection for the Department of Justice to track and monitor  discriminatory profiling. It holds State and local enforcement agencies  accountable by conditioning Federal funds on the adoption of policies  and best practices to combat profiling by officers. It eliminates, once  and for all, discriminatory profiling. It is in the Booker-Harris bill.  It is not in the Scott bill.   The underlying JUSTICE Act does not include any real national  standards for law enforcement. By contrast, the Justice in Policing Act  contains legislation I authored, the Law Enforcement Trust and  Integrity Act, which takes a comprehensive approach on how local police  organizations can adopt performance-based standards to ensure that  instances of misconduct will be minimized through training and  oversight. That legislation takes steps to mitigate police violence by  designating resources for community development and the transformation  of public safety practices   In Baltimore, we have ongoing Federal partnerships with city law  enforcement and the Federal Justice Department following the tragic  death of Freddie Gray, Jr. This is an example of continued efforts to  rebuild trust between communities and police and encourages the  establishment of more effective police models.   The legislation I described provides public safety innovation grants  to help communities reimagine and develop concrete, just, and equitable  public safety approaches. This is in the Booker-Harris bill. It is not  in the Scott bill. The JUSTICE Act does not adequately address the  issue of no-knock warrants in drug cases, nor does it adequately  address the use of choke holds. Finally, the legislation does not  address the issue of establishing a national use-of-force standard.   By contrast, the Justice in Policing Act changes the use-of-force  standards for officers so that deadly force be used only as a last  resort, while requiring officers to employ deescalation techniques. Let  me bring to my colleagues' attention a letter dated June 23, 2020, from  the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.   In the letter, the Leadership Conferences writes to Congress:         We write to express our strong opposition to S. 3985, the .       . . [JUSTICE Act]. The JUSTICE Act is an inadequate response       to the decades of pain, hardship, and devastation that Black       people have and continue to endure as a result of systemic       racism and lax policies that fail to hold police accountable       for misconduct.    The letter goes on to say:         Abusive policing practices, coupled with devastating state-      sanctioned violence, have exacted systemic brutality and       fatality upon Black people since our nation's founding.       Police have shot and killed more than 1,000 people in the       United States over the past year, and Black people are       disproportionately more likely than white people to be killed       by police. The current protests in our cities are a response       not only to the unjust policing of Black people, but also       calls for action to public officials to enact bold,       comprehensive, and structural change.    The letter concludes.         . . . . Passing watered-down legislation that fails to       remedy the actual harms resulting in the loss of life is a       moral statement that is inconsistent with a genuine belief       that black lives matter. Anything less than full support for       comprehensive legislation that holds police accountable is       inexcusable.    Let me close my remarks once again by sharing some words from Dr.  King, from the March on Washington in 1963. In his famous speech at the  foot of the Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, DC,  Dr. King said:         In a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a       check. When the architects of our Republic wrote the       magnificent words of the Constitution and Declaration of       Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which       every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that       all men--yes, black men as well as white men--would be       guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the       pursuit of happiness. It is obvious today that America has       defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of       color are concerned . . . But we refused to believe that the       bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there       are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of       this nation. So we've come to cash this check, a check that       will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the       security of justice.    Dr. King continued by saying:         We have also come to this hollowed spot to remind America       of the fierce urgency of now. This is no time to engage in       the luxury of cooling off or take the tranquilizing drug of       gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promise of       democracy . . . Now is the time to lift our nation from the       quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of       brotherhood . . . Now is the time to make justice a reality       for all God's children. It would be fatal for the nation to       overlook the urgency of the moment . . .    The House of Representatives is scheduled to pass their version of  the Justice in Policing Act on Thursday. Let us take up meaningful  legislation in the Senate as the base bill negotiated between Democrats  and Republicans. Let us rise to the occasion and make the Founders of  this Nation proud.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
