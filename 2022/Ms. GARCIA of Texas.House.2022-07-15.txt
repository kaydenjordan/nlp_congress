 Madam Speaker, I rise in outrage at the cruel  attacks extreme Republicans have launched on women and their rights.   Because of these MAGA Republicans, our daughters will have less  freedom than their mothers for the first time in American history.   This has been their plan all along. As this graphic behind me shows,  women have been fighting Republican attacks for decades, and it has  been a tough fight. But House Democrats won't give up. We cannot go  back. We won't give up because we trust women.   Today, we will pass two bills to protect women, their rights, and  their freedoms--the Ensuring Women's Right to Reproductive Freedom Act  and the Women's Health Protection Act--for the second time.   Democrats are the party that stand with women. Without them, we  cannot be a better America. We always have and always will be with  women. We trust women.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak in support  of H.R. 8297 by my colleague and friend from Houston, Congresswoman  Fletcher.   First, let me be clear. There seems to be some fixation from the  other side that this decision should be left up to the States because  the Supreme Court said that. They need to re-read the opinion. It  simply says that it is returned to the people and their elected  Representatives. Last time I looked, I was an elected Representative,  and we all are elected Representatives.   So, we can pass these two bills today and put them in statute and  make it the law of the land because, I can tell you, if we leave it to  the States, things will be more extreme.   In my home State of Texas, extremist Republicans have created a  patchwork that is scary, discriminatory, and oppressive, and they are  doing that to limit our right to make our own deeply personal, private  healthcare decisions about our own bodies together with our families  and our providers.   This bill would restore women's rights in Texas and across the  country. It would stop Republicans from criminalizing, fining, or suing  women who exercise their constitutional right to travel across State  lines to obtain an abortion.   This is important since many companies have announced policies that  cover travel expenses for employees seeking abortion care who are not  able to get them in their own home State. They are threatening  businesses in Texas that they will throw them out of Texas.   This bill is necessary. We are the elected Representatives. We get to  decide.
