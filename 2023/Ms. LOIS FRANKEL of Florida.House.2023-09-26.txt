 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to  this rule, which is for a bad bill that takes food out of the mouths of  children, hurts our farmers, guts climate change actions, and is  another step toward the Republicans' dark and extreme goal to ban  abortion nationwide. More specifically, it nullifies the FDA's decision  to make the abortion pill, mifepristone, more accessible.   The medication abortion pill has been used effectively and safely for  20 years. FDA made an evidence-based decision to allow patients to fill  this medication as they would fill any other prescription, by going to  a drugstore or to their doctor or getting it through the mail.   The FDA decision removed a barrier for women in underserved  communities in need of care. Reversing this decision harms the most  vulnerable populations--women in maternity care deserts, women without  reliable access to transportation or childcare, and women who can't  take time off from work to visit a doctor.   Madam Speaker, I say this with emphasis: All women deserve the  freedom to decide whether or when to start or grow a family without  interference from politicians.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to listen to the science, listen  to the FDA, and reject this rule for these and so many reasons.
