 Madam President, for the past several months, both  Democrats and Republicans have been hard at work putting together two  major infrastructure bills to meet the challenges of the 21st century.  We have proceeded along two tracks. The first track is a bipartisan  infrastructure framework that has been agreed to by a group of  Democrats and Republican Senators and the White House. The second track  is a budget resolution with reconciliation instructions that will allow  the Senate to take up the American Jobs and Families Plan and make  historic investments in jobs, family support policies, and initiatives  to fight climate change. This week, the Senate aims to make even more  progress on these tracks.   Tonight, in a few minutes, I will file cloture on a shell bill, which  will act as a legislative vehicle for the bipartisan infrastructure  framework. That vote on cloture will take place on Wednesday. Again,  that vote on Wednesday will be a vote on cloture simply to the motion  to proceed to a debate on a bipartisan infrastructure bill.   I want to be clear about what these steps mean. There has been some  confusion. What we are talking about this week is a vote on whether to  proceed to debate on the bipartisan infrastructure framework. The  motion to proceed on Wednesday is simply about getting the legislative  process started here on the Senate floor; it is not a deadline to  determine every final detail of the bill. All a ``yes'' vote on the  motion to proceed simply means is that the Senate is ready to begin  debating and amending a bipartisan infrastructure bill; no more, no  less.   It is important to remember that even after the Wednesday cloture  vote, there are up to 30 hours of debate before we can adopt the motion  to proceed and offer amendments.   So let me be very clear about what I am committing to the Senate as  majority leader. If the bipartisan group of Senators reaches a final  agreement on legislative text by Thursday, I will make that agreement  the pending substitute amendment for debate once the motion to proceed  is adopted. If for some reason the group does not finalize the  legislative text to the agreement in time for Thursday, then I will  offer an amendment consisting only of the elements of the bill that  have already been put through committee on a bipartisan process. This  will allow this Senate to begin debate and amendments on the bipartisan  base bill, which has four main components:   First, the Environment and Public Works Committee report of the water  bill. This bill passed by a voice vote in committee and then 89 to 2 on  the Senate floor.   Second, the Environment and Public Works Committee report of the  highway bill. This passed by 20 to nothing.   Third, the Commerce Committee report on the rail and safety bill.  This bill passed by 25 to 3.   Fourth, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee report of the  Energy bill. This passed 13 to 7.   Again, if the text of the bipartisan deal is ready on Thursday, I  will offer it as the first substitute amendment. If for some reason it  is not, I will offer an amendment that consists only of the elements of  the bill that have gone through committee with substantial bipartisan  support, the four pieces that I mentioned just a second ago.   Now, I have spoken with the five leading Democratic negotiators:  Senators Sinema, Warner, Tester, Shaheen, and Manchin. They support  this approach.   I would remind my colleagues, moving to proceed to a legislative  vehicle, a shell bill, for bipartisan legislation, even while the  negotiators finalize the text of that legislation, is a routine process  in this Chamber. We have done it repeatedly. It is a sign of good faith  from both sides that negotiations will continue in earnest and both  sides are committed to reaching an outcome.   Earlier this year, the Senate moved forward on a vehicle--a  legislative vehicle--for what became the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act. In  fact, we went through the same process when the Senate moved to proceed  to the legislative vehicle for what ultimately became the United States  Innovation and Competition Act. In that legislation, our Senate  committees were working on various bills that all had to do with  American innovation and competition.   The Commerce Committee reported out the Endless Frontier Act. The  Foreign Relations Committee reported out the Strategic Competition Act.  And the Homeland Security Committee reported out additional pieces of  legislation. We put them together once we voted to proceed to debate on  the topic. The same thing--the very same thing is happening on the  bipartisan infrastructure bill.   I understand that both sides are working very hard to turn the  bipartisan infrastructure framework into final legislation, and they  will continue to have more time to debate, amend, and perfect the bill  once the Senate votes to take up this crucial issue.  [[Page S4946]]    But they have been working on this bipartisan framework for more than  a month already, and it is time to begin the debate. We must make  significant progress on both the bipartisan infrastructure bill and the  budget resolution before the end of the work period. There is no reason  we can't get the ball rolling this week on both elements of the  Senate's infrastructure agenda.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 142.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 100,  H.R. 3684.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum calls  for the cloture motions filed today, July 19, be waived.    Madam President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk, and I ask for its first reading.    I now ask for a second reading, and in order to place  the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to  my own request.    Mr. President, I have 2 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.

Madam President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.
