 Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in strong support of  H.R. 6201, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act of 2020, which  provides much needed protections for American families from the worst  conditions that might arise as the nation fights the spread of COVID- 19.   My thoughts and prayers are with the families who have lost loved  ones and the thousand who are sick, and the many others who will  struggle with the effects of COVID-19 over the coming days, weeks, and  months.   We owe a special debt to First Responders who will be the lifeline  for those who will need medical care to overcome this coronavirus  designated as COVID-19.   The legislation includes:   Health Care Worker Protections;   Emergency Paid Leave;   Emergency Unemployment Insurance; and   Paid Sick Days for Public Health Emergencies and Personal and Family  Care.   This bill provides immediate help to American families that are now  on the frontline of this fight to defeat COVID-19.   Yesterday, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a  pandemic, which has reached at least 114 countries, sickening over  139,000 people, and killing more than 5,116 worldwide.   The first presumptive COVID-19 positive case was reported in the  Houston area occurred in Montgomery County, Texas, which borders Harris  County, the location of Houston, Texas.   Montgomery County, Texas officials confirmed that the man has not  traveled out of the state or country recently.   Currently, the 20 people he had been in close contact with are in  self-quarantine.   If the case is confirmed by the CDC, this could be the first  community-spread case in the Houston area.   Community-spread occurring is the reason why we need tests in enough  supply that everyone can be tested so that we know the state of COVID- 19 in each community.   While the Houston area has other cases that are linked to travel  outside of the state, this is the first case not linked to travel  outside of the state.   The Montgomery County, Texas Public Health officials took steps to  protect children by closing schools two days before spring break to do  a deep clean, and they are expecting to resume classes after the break.   The person is being treated at an undisclosed hospital and is  reported to be under observation and doing well.   COVID-19 is more contagious than the flu.   The contagious score is 1.5 and COVID-19 is 2.3.   Although symptoms are compared to the flu, COVID-19 is not the flu.   Because there is no immunity, vaccine, or widely agreed upon  treatment there are only a few options for protecting the public and  limiting its spread.   This is a time in our nation that historians will write about and  anthropologists will study, but for us--living today--we are in a fight  against a foe that we have never faced before, but we must defeat.   The army before us are our medical researchers, doctors, nurses,  first responders, and sanitation workers, but they cannot defeat this  enemy alone.   Each of us, not just in the United States but around the world must  join the fight by paying attention to facts and not spread rumors.   The weapons for slowing the spread of COVID-19 are simple and they  work:   Washing hands;   Sanitizing surfaces;   Social Distance;   Isolation; and   Quarantines.   These tools for controlling the spread of infectious diseases are as  old as civilization and are still used today because they work.   Some of the first records of the use of cleaning, washing, and  isolation of the sick and those thought to be ill is found in the Bible  in the Book of Leviticus Chapter 13.   It provides detailed instructions to the community about leprosy, a  dreaded contagious disease.   To defeat COVID-19, we must practice hand washing, social distance,  isolation, and quarantine.   Hand washing sounds simple but it involves much more attention and  time to do it right--and remove germs.   To get accurate instructions on what is needed to know visit https:// coronavirus.gov, where information can be found on cleaning and  personal care.   Social distance means limiting physical contact and having at least  six feet separating persons while in public spaces.   Social distance practices can include not shaking hands, or touching  surfaces where the virus can be picked up.   Social distance can also involve limiting the number of people who  may be in an enclosed space.   Isolation for at least 14 days is for persons who may have been in  contact with a person who tests positive for COVID-19.   Quarantine is for persons who are suspected of having COVID-19 or  tested positive for having COVID-19.   Given the fluid nature of the events unfolding each person should be  informed and ready to support efforts to prevent or slow the spread of  the illness.   The National Institutes of Health, the CDC, university researchers,  and private companies are working on a vaccine, which will take a year  to produce in enough quantities to inoculate people from becoming  infected with COVID-19.   In the meantime, we must do all that we can to protect the elderly;  those with serious pre-existing health conditions, and our health care  workers from contracting COVID-19.   I believe that we must do more to prepare the public for what may be  localized, household, or individual quarantines to address the spread  of COVID-19.   We must vastly increase the number of tests and make sure that  everyone presenting with mild cold or flu like symptoms is tested to  accurately gauge the spread of COVID-19 in communities.   I saw news reports in early January on the novel Coronavirus's rapid  spread and the numbers of infected expanding so quickly, I knew this  was not something to be taken lightly and that time was not on our side  to mount an effective defense.   On February 10, 2020, I held the first press conference on the issue  of the novel coronavirus at Houston Intercontinental Airport.   I was joined by public health officials, local unions, and advocates  to raise awareness regarding the virus and the implications it might  have for travel to the United States from China and to combat early  signs of discrimination targeting Asian businesses in the United  States.   On February 24, 2020, I held a second press conference on the  International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World  Health Organization declaration of a ``public health emergency from the  outbreak of the Coronavirus.''   At that time, I formally requested the President of the United States  by letter to immediately suspend any health-related cuts that impact  efforts to contain and treat the coronavirus, including the $3.3  billion in cuts to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the  discretionary budget cuts for the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention (CDC) of nearly 19 percent at $678 million, severely  threatening the CDC's ability to respond to this and other epidemics in  the future.   Additionally, I requested the President to suspend cuts in both the  Medicare and Medicaid programs.   On February 26, 2020, I sent a letter to the Chair and Ranking Member  of the Committee on Homeland Security seeking a meeting with Acting  Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf to gain insight into the  Preparedness of the Agency to address a possible pandemic.   On February 28, 2020, I spoke on the Floor of the House and announced  plans to form a Congressional Coronavirus Task Force.   I thank Congressmen Brian Fitzpatrick and Dr. Raul Ruiz for joining  me as co-chairs of the Congressional Coronavirus Task Force.   Today, March 13, 2020, the House of Representatives is offering  additional tools to help the American public during this crisis, the  second relief package in less than a week.   I want to impress upon the American people that if they have not been  paying attention to the issue of the virus, they need to stop and learn  all that they can.   First, do not panic--get informed with facts by visiting https:// coronavirus.gov, this website is maintained by the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention (https://cdc.gov).   They must prepare for what is coming--if it has not officially  arrived in their community--do not assume that it will not make its  presence known.  [[Page H1691]]    The earlier bill provided $8.3 billion in funding in emergency  supplemental appropriations, which included:   More than $3 billion for research and development of vaccines,  therapeutics, and diagnostics;   $2.2 billion in public health funding for prevention, preparedness,  and response, $950 million of which is to support state and local  health agencies;   Nearly $1 billion for procurement of pharmaceuticals and medical  supplies, to support healthcare preparedness and Community Health  Centers, and to improve medical surge capacity;   $435 million to support health systems overseas to prevent, prepare,  and respond to the coronavirus;   $300 million to respond to humanitarian needs;   $61 million to facilitate the development and review of medical  countermeasures, devices, therapies, and vaccines, and to help mitigate  potential supply chain interruptions; and   Allows for an estimated $7 billion in low-interest loans to affected  small businesses.   On, Thursday, March 12, the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention (CDC) reported the coronavirus outbreak has now infected  more than 1,000 people in nearly 40 U.S. states--and the country's top  authority on infectious diseases reports that things will only get  worse.   The World Health Organization reports a 3.4 percent mortality rate  for COVID-19.   The challenge with this new coronavirus is that it is highly  contagious, and of those infected, 15-20 percent contract pneumonia   And 5 percent of these cases may develop Acute Respiratory Distress  Syndrome (ARDS), which is a rapidly progressive disease occurring in  critically ill patients.   The main complication in ARDS is that fluid leaks into the lungs  making breathing difficult or impossible.   This virus is a serious public health threat, but this does not mean  that we should have a public health panic.   There are knowledgeable and trained virologists, public health  experts, and physicians who need the funding provided by this bill.   I ask that my colleagues join me in voting in support of H.R. 6201.    Mr. Speaker, as I stand before the words ``In God We  Trust,'' tonight we took a vote to save the lives of our fellow  Americans.   I am very glad that what we did today was for families, healthcare  worker protections, emergency paid leave, emergency unemployment  insurance, paid sick days for public health emergencies, and personal  and family care.   I will go home to my district and convene meetings regarding those  who are dealing with education, healthcare, and testing, but the main  thing that we must do is test every single American who is showing  signs or needs.   What we have in this bill is to provide free testing. In addition, we  have organized the bipartisan Congressional Coronavirus Task Force. We  are doing that to engage with Members as they are away in their  districts.   This is more contagious than the flu and more deadly.   Let us be assured that we take care of the American people. I intend  to do so in my State of Texas and intend to make sure that resources go  to save lives.   In God we trust.                            ____________________
