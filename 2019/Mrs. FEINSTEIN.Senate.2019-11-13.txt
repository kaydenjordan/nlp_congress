 Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the  nomination of Steven Menashi to the United States Court of Appeals for  the Second Circuit.   From 2017 to 2018, Mr. Menashi served as the Acting General Counsel  of the Department of Education under Secretary Betsy DeVos. Mr. Menashi  has stated that, in this role, he was ``responsible for providing legal  advice related to all aspects of the Department's operations, including  litigation, rulemaking, regulation, and enforcement.''   Before Mr. Menashi joined the Department of Education, the Department  had found that thousands of students had been defrauded by for-profit  colleges. The for-profit schools had lied to students about job  prospects, graduation rates, and steered them into mountains of debt.  The Department had concluded that these students were entitled to  relief from their student loan debt.   But when Mr. Menashi arrived at the Department, he took a different  view. He wrote a memo, which has since been obtained by the New York  Times, arguing against full debt relief for the students.   Many of these students found themselves unable to work in the fields  that they had pursued at the for-profit colleges because the colleges  had either suddenly closed or the degrees had proven to be worthless.  Nonetheless, Mr. Menashi's idea, which the Department adopted, was to  use the private Social Security earnings data of the defrauded students  as a basis for limiting their relief. Even if you put aside the  unfairness of Mr. Menashi's plan, there was another problem: It was  illegal.   Six months after Mr. Menashi's plan was implemented, and while Mr.  Menashi was still at the Department, a  [[Page S6519]]  Federal court ruled that using students' private Social Security data  violated the Federal Privacy Act. The court ordered the Department to  stop using the students' private information and to stop collecting on  their student loans.   Even after this Federal court ruling, the Department failed to  comply. The Department continued to illegally collect on the student  loans of at least 16,000 defrauded students. The Department garnished  wages, seized tax refunds, and wiped out some students' credit ratings.   Less than 3 weeks ago, a Federal court held Secretary Betsy DeVos in  contempt of court and fined the Department $100,000. The Federal  magistrate judge who issued the contempt order said, ``[T]here have to  be some consequences for the violation of my order 16,000 times.''   Mr. Menashi should not be rewarded for providing such bad legal  advice with a lifetime appointment to the Federal bench.   While at the Department, Mr. Menashi also helped push new rules on  campus sexual assault that the administration's own analysis concluded  would dramatically reduce the number of sexual assault investigations.  Under these new rules, a student who is the survivor of sexual assault  would be subject to cross-examination by their attacker's  representative at a live hearing.   In 2018, Mr. Menashi joined the White House Counsel's Office, where  he has been a member of Stephen Miller's White House Immigration  Strategic Working Group. This working group has helped push a number of  extreme anti-immigrant policies, including the White House's policy of  separating children from their families, a problem that still has not  been fully remedied, despite a court order to do so.   At his hearing, Mr. Menashi refused to answer numerous basic  questions about his work, including about his role in the  administration's family separation policy. He also refused to answer  written questions about whether he has worked or advised on matters  relating to the whistleblower complaint and President Trump's call with  Ukraine's President. Importantly, none of these questions asked Mr.  Menashi about the substance of his advice. These questions simply  sought to understand what matters he has worked on. His refusal to  answer makes it difficult for us to fulfill our constitutional duty to  advise and consent.   Mr. Menashi's earlier career is equally troubling. He criticized  ``Take Back the Night marches,'' which aim to stop campus sexual  assault. He also wrote that the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade  had codified the ``radical abortion rights advocated by campus  feminists.'' He wrote that gun control legislation is ``pointless [and]  self-defeating, because guns reduce crime,'' and he claimed that a  major LGBT-rights organization had ``incessantly exploited the slaying  of Matthew Shepard for both financial and political benefit.'' Mr.  Menashi wrote that ``charges of racism are typically overblown,'' and  he compared affirmative action in college admissions to Nazi Germany's  Nuremberg laws.   I want to close with a quote from a letter of opposition submitted by  the Congressional Black Caucus. The CBC rarely takes a position on  judicial nominees, but in this instance, felt compelled to do so. The  CBC writes: ``Menashi's writings show a willingness to discriminate  against minorities, women and the LGBTQ community. Menashi, who has  consistently spoken against diversity and inclusiveness, does not  deserve a lifetime position on one of the most important appellate  courts in this country.''   In light of Mr. Menashi's record, it is hardly surprising that there  is bipartisan opposition to his nomination.   I will vote no on Mr. Menashi's nomination, and I urge my colleagues  on both sides of the aisle to do the same.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today, along with every other Senate  Democrat, I am proud to introduce the Violence Against Women  Reauthorization Act of 2019.   This bill passed the House by a vote of 163-158, with 33 Republicans  supporting it.   It was written by the people on the front lines helping victims. It  is not a Democratic bill or a Republican bill, it is a bill crafted by  and for survivors who know exactly what's need in the real world. In  other words, it is the survivors' bill. As I stated before, any  reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act must do two things.   First, it must preserve the advancements made when it was last  reauthorized in 2013. And second, it must include meaningful  improvements to the law.   The meaningful legal improvements in this bill are particularly  important, and I would like to highlight three. First, this bill  preserves the anti-discrimination protections that were made in 2013.  These protections are particularly important to the LGBT community.  According to the Center for Disease Control, along with 35 percent of  heterosexual women, 44 percent of lesbian women, and 61 percent of  bisexual women experience rape, physical violence, or stalking by an  intimate partner.   Similarly, the 2015 U.S. transgender survey found that 47 percent of  transgender people have been sexually assaulted. Simply put, these  protections are important and we should not only be preserving them, we  should be doing more to strengthen them. This bill also makes  meaningful improvements to the law to address domestic violence in  Indian country. For example, it expands jurisdiction over non-Indians  for crimes against children, elders, and law enforcement.   A 2016 Justice Department report explained that ``more than four in  five American Indian and Alaska Native women have experienced violence  in their lifetime.''   The report also found that 56 percent have experienced sexual  violence, 56 percent have experienced violence at the hands of an  intimate partner, and 9 percent have been stalked. For me, these  numbers are even more upsetting because California has the largest  Tribal population in the United States. We must continue to respect  Tribal sovereignty and ensure that we are doing the most to protect the  most vulnerable among us, particularly children. Finally, this bill  also keeps guns out of the hands of domestic abusers.   Guns are the most likely way for domestic violence to take a woman's  life. Women in the United States are eleven times more likely to be  murdered by a firearm than in other high-income countries. The presence  of guns in domestic violence situations increases the chances that a  woman will be murdered by 500 percent. This bill makes modest, but  necessary, improvements to the law to keep guns out of the hands of  domestic abusers.   For example, the bill amends current law so that people convicted of  stalking cannot possess firearms.   Yet, the National Rifle Association opposes it. 33 Republicans still  voted for the House bill, and I hope my Republicans colleagues in the  Senate will do the same. It's the right thing to do. The different  parts of the Violence Against Women Act are all linked.   For instance, preserving the non-discrimination advancements made  when VAWA was reauthorized in 2013 will help protect the LGBT  community, but keeping guns out of the hands of domestic abusers will  help protect LGBT victims as well.   This bill takes this sort of comprehensive approach by, for example,  preserving the advances made to non-discrimination protections and  improving the law in the areas of Tribal protections and gun safety.  There is no simple way to stop domestic violence, but we have a duty to  do all that we can.   I thank the president, and I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. BLUNT:   S. 2851.
