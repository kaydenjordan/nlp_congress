 Mr. Speaker, as the Oversight Committee Chairman    James Comer has stated, our investigation into the Biden family's  business dealings has uncovered a web of complex financial  transactions, shell companies, and attempts to conceal payments.   It is our duty to determine whether these activities compromise our  national security and impact the President's policy decisions.   Thanks to the hard work of Chairman Jason Smith in the Ways and Means  Committee, IRS whistleblowers have come forward with troubling  information. These courageous individuals shed light on the  politicization  [[Page H3630]]  and misconduct within the Department of Justice and the IRS regarding  the Hunter Biden investigation.   The American people deserve answers. They deserve to know if Federal  law enforcement was compromised, if Joe Biden was shielded from  evidence, and if Hunter Biden was given preferential treatment leading  to a sweetheart plea deal he received last month.   Transparency and accountability are the foundations of our democracy,  and as Members of this body, we must deliver on these principles. It is  our responsibility to ensure that no one is above the law and that  justice is served.    I urge all my colleagues to demand the truth and to stand with the  American people. Together, we can restore faith in our institutions and  safeguard the integrity of our democracy.                            ____________________
