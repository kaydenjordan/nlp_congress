 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4031,  the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act of 2019.   First, I want to thank my good friends from Ohio, Mr. Joyce and Ms.  Kaptur, for their leadership on this legislation. The Great Lakes are  an essential natural resource, not only for my district and State, but  for the entire country.   One of the world's largest bodies of fresh water, the Great Lakes  provide fresh drinking water for over 30 million people. In addition,  the Great Lakes serves as an economic engine, generating $8.4 billion  in wages, and supporting over 300,000 jobs.   But the Great Lakes are more than a source of revenue. Ask any of my  constituents what the Great Lakes mean to them, and they will tell you  they are an essential part of what makes northeast Ohio such a great  place to live, work, and raise a family.   Over the past decade, both Democrats and Republicans have understood  the importance of protecting the Great Lakes. Since 2010, the GLRI has  catalyzed critical restoration action that both restores and protects  the Great Lakes. In fact, for every dollar spent under the GLRI, an  estimated $3.35 in economic activity is produced.   I strongly urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4031 and ensure the  preservation of our waterways and ecosystems for future generations.  [[Page H805]]
