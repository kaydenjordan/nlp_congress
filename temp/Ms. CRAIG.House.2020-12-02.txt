 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding; and I  thank the chairman for his 30 years of service to the State of  Minnesota and to our family farmers across this Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 4054, the U.S. Grain  Standards Reauthorization Act of 2020.   As our family farmers face the growing impacts of COVID-19 and  continued trade instability, we must maintain the integrity of our  domestic grain market and inspection system.   This bipartisan legislation passed the Senate unanimously, to  reauthorize the Federal Grain Inspection Service at the U.S. Department  of Agriculture. I applaud Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat  Roberts and Ranking Member Debbie Stabenow on their bipartisan efforts  to get this across the finish line. This reauthorization provides  necessary certainty for buyers and sellers throughout the grain supply  chain.   Food and agriculture products have long remained the largest category  of exports for Minnesota. The Federal Grain Inspection Service provides  a reliable, competitive, and cost-effective official grain inspection  and weighing system to facilitate the marketing of U.S. grains and  oilseeds in export and domestic markets.   Just last year, Minnesota produced over $7.5 billion worth of corn,  wheat, and soybeans. The employees of companies in my district, like  CHS, Cargill, and ADM, keep our grain markets moving along the  Mississippi River and off to destinations across the globe.   While this year has certainly presented its challenges, reauthorizing  grain standards provides a glimmer of stability for our producers as  they continue to secure additional support in export markets. This  legislation shores up the infrastructure that will make sure those  exports continue into 2021.   I look forward to the passage of this bill for the family farmers of  my district and Minnesota's agriculture economy.
