 Mr. Speaker, as a grateful and proud daughter of the  United Auto Workers, I am heartened to see General Motors, Ford, and  Jeep Stellantis reach tentative agreements with the hardworking  brothers and sisters of the UAW.   This historic strike is deeply personal to me. I know firsthand from  my parents and constituents the difficult jobs they do day in and day  out, sometimes 10 hours a day 6 days a week.   While too many manufacturing jobs have been shipped overseas to penny  wage havens, I salute companies inside our borders, the largest  consumer market in the world, for agreeing to pay fair wages with good  benefits that our hardworking American autoworkers have earned.   Firms in other nations should follow suit. Our trade negotiators  should focus on reciprocal contracts for market access to achieve fair  trade globally to stop the exploitation of workers in the automotive  industry in the Third World.   Let's recall after the United Auto Workers conceded major benefits  during the 2008 Great Recession to literally save the Big Three from  bankruptcy. These agreements represent a monumental step toward finally  making these workers whole again.   They say that when unions fight, all workers win. Last week we saw  Toyota raise wages for their workers knowing they must now compete.   Record profits should mean record contracts. Americans must honor  people who work hard hour by hour building the economic prosperity of  our great Nation.  [[Page H5472]]    From Toledo to Wayne to Wentzville to Belvedere, their vigilance,  fortitude, and guts have made this new progress possible. I salute  those in our unions who have fought so hard and have dedicated their  lives to building our middle class from the middle out and the bottom  up.   Onward.                            ____________________
