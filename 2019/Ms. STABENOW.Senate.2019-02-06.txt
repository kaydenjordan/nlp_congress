 Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to a  Michigan veteran whose bravery, spirit of service, and selfless  dedication to his fellow soldiers earned him the Nation's highest  military honor and the eternal gratitude of 44 American families.   Charles S. Kettles was Michigan through and through. He was born in  Ypsilanti in 1930, and that is where he passed away on January 21,  2019, a couple of weeks after his 89th birthday.   He attended Edison Institute High School in Dearborn and fell in love  with flying in the school's flight simulator. Perhaps it was no  surprise; his father served as a military pilot during both World Wars.   Charlie was active in the community. He and his brother opened a Ford  dealership in DeWitt. He later earned a master's degree in industrial  technology from Eastern Michigan University and launched its aviation  program. He served on the Ypsilanti City Council and in the local  Kiwanis club. He was close to his family and enjoyed his nine  grandchildren.   In many ways, Charlie lived an ordinary Michigan life. What made his  life truly extraordinary were events that happened far away from  Ypsilanti on the other side of the world.   Charlie was drafted into the Army in 1951, attended Army aviation  school, and served tours in Japan and Thailand. He retired from Active  Duty in 1956, and that could have been the end of his military service,  but the Army was in desperate need of helicopter pilots during the  Vietnam war. So in 1963, Charlie volunteered for active duty and  learned to fly the UH-1D ``Huey.''   Those skills would save lives on May 15, 1967, when then-Major  Kettles volunteered to lead a flight of six Hueys on a rescue mission  when members of the 101st Airborne Division were ambushed by enemy  troops.   The helicopters came under fire, but that didn't stop Charlie. He  kept on flying. When he returned to base after his second rescue  flight, his helicopter was leaking fuel, and his gunner had been  severely wounded.   Then the call came in: 44 Americans still needed to be evacuated.  Charlie found a Huey that wasn't leaking fuel, led a flight of six  evacuation helicopters back to the landing zone, and successfully  rescued the stranded men--or so he thought.   On the flight back to base, Charlie learned that eight troops had  been unable to reach the evacuation helicopters. He didn't hesitate.  With no regard for his own safety, he turned his Huey around and  returned to the landing zone.   His helicopter was hit by gunfire, and a mortar round damaged the  rotor blade and shattered the windshield. Despite the damage, Charlie  skillfully navigated his helicopter to the landing zone. The remaining  troops scrambled aboard, and all 44 finally made it off the  battlefield.   Charlie was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the Army's  second-highest citation for valor, in 1968; yet when I heard his story,  I thought, if anyone was ever worthy of receiving the Medal of Honor,  Charlie was.   Typically, the Medal of Honor must be awarded within 5 years of the  heroic act. That is why, in 2015, I introduced legislation with Senator  Gary Peters and Congresswoman Debbie Dingell to allow Charlie to  receive the Medal of Honor. In 2016, that is just what happened.   ``In a lot of ways, Chuck is America,'' President Obama said during  his Medal of Honor ceremony at the White House. ``To the dozens of  American soldiers that he saved in Vietnam half a century ago, Chuck is  the reason that they lived and came home and had children and  grandchildren. Entire family trees--made possible by the actions of  this one man.''   Charlie remained humble about his award.   ``Out of all of that, there is really only one thing that means  anything--those 40 names are not on the wall in D.C. Awards are nice,  but there is far more gratitude in simply knowing that.''   Charlie Kettles was a real-life hero and the very best of Michigan.  The people of my State and the families of the 44 men he saved will  remain forever grateful for his service and sacrifice.   Thank you.                            ____________________
