 Madam President, we all know the grief the opioid  crisis produces: broken families, stolen opportunity, lost loved ones.  This epidemic has been especially severe in my home State of Kentucky,  claiming lives at a record pace.   In light of this urgent problem, I am proud Congress is fighting  back. We have passed substantial bipartisan legislation to give  communities the resources they need. The most recent government funding  bill provided billions of dollars of additional support. But the work  to end the suffering continues.   One of the most heartbreaking facts is the skyrocketing number of  infants who are born dependent on opioids. Defenseless children start  their lives suffering from addiction. That is why in 2015 I sponsored,  along with Senator Casey, the bipartisan Protecting Our Infants Act. As  the first law to specifically address prenatal opioid exposure, it  directed the Secretary of Health and Human Services to review the  subject of opioid abuse in prenatal and infant patients. Our bill  tasked the Secretary with developing strategies to fill the gap in  opioid research and programming and provide recommendations for  preventing further harm to expecting mothers and newborns.   Now it is time to build on our success and better protect vulnerable  children, so today I will introduce the Protecting Moms and Infants  Act. This legislation directs the Secretary of HHS to report on the  implementation of the strategies developed in the previous bill. It  would have the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention develop  educational materials to better inform doctors and expecting mothers  about opioid alternatives. It authorizes increased funding for  competitive Federal grants to help organizations address this  particular part of the opioid crisis. This bill continues our years- long efforts to protect the most vulnerable.   I thank Senator Casey and my colleague from Kentucky, Congressman  Brett Guthrie, who is sponsoring companion legislation in the House.   Medical professionals, law enforcement officials, and many across  Kentucky are working every day to bring an end to the misery of the  opioid epidemic. This legislation will continue that fight, and I urge  my colleagues to support it.                            ____________________     Madam President, yesterday we voted to advance  Jim  Bridenstine's nomination to lead the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration.   Jim is a decorated pilot and combat veteran. His tenure in the House  of Representatives testifies to his understanding of the issues facing  today's space program and to his advocacy of NASA modernization. But,  as is often the case, this well-qualified nominee has waited too long  for a vote. NASA has been led by an Acting Administrator for a record  15 months. So I hope my colleagues will join me in voting to confirm   Jim Bridenstine today.  [[Page S2290]]                                ____________________     Madam President, speaking of personnel business, I  wish to say a few words this morning about Mike Pompeo, our CIA  Director and the President's extraordinary choice to serve as Secretary  of State.   In recent days, the world learned that Director Pompeo had undertaken  initial conversations with Kim Jong Un directly, over the Easter  weekend, to discuss denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. Obviously, he  has the confidence of the President--engaged in the most sensitive  undertaking one could imagine in today's world--and yet so many on the  other side are suggesting they have reservations about this outstanding  nominee.   Pursued with clear-eyed realism and clear objectives, this is a  worthy effort. North Korea has been a perplexing problem for President  after President after President, and Mike Pompeo is on the point of  this effort, which hopefully will finally lead to some outcome.  Although every Commander in Chief has insisted it would be unacceptable  for North Korea to obtain a nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic  missile, it is this administration that finds itself having to actually  achieve that objective because time has run out. So, as a matter of  policy, it would be hard not to be encouraged by the fact that there  were actually talks--direct talks--underway.   Based on Director Pompeo's impressive record at the CIA, the North  Koreans undoubtedly view him as credible, determined, and insightful.  Isn't that what we would want in a Secretary of State? The quiet nature  of these discussions reflect how serious they were. The mission also  speaks to Mike Pompeo's future as Secretary of State.   Here is a man who--through mastery of the daily briefings he  receives, counsel on our Nation's most sensitive intelligence  activities, and proven leadership in returning our CIA to the  aggressive gathering of foreign intelligence--has inspired the  confidence of not only the national clandestine service but, very  importantly, the Commander in Chief. Hallmarks of Mike's leadership are  listening, trusting career staff, acting decisively, and treating  everyone fairly.   I have recently heard some critics claim that the Trump  administration places too little emphasis on diplomacy. In truth, the  public statements of Secretary Mattis, former Secretary Tillerson, and  former National Security Advisor McMaster have signaled a clear  preference for aggressive, realistic diplomacy over potentially risking  American lives. I have heard Secretary Mattis say over and over again  that the last thing he wants to do is use the military. He wants to buy  time so diplomacy can work. But, regardless, in confirming Mike Pompeo  as Secretary of State, the Senate can ensure that the Nation has a  chief diplomat who enjoys the complete confidence of the President.  Isn't that what we should all want, regardless of party?   Those who claim to want a larger role for diplomacy should match  those words with action and vote to approve him. What would be a better  example of diplomacy than just what we were talking about--the visit to  North Korea and direct conversations with Kim Jong Un.   We all know Mike's resume. He is a graduate of the U.S. Military  Academy and Harvard Law School. He has served as a U.S. Army officer,  on the House Intelligence Committee, and as Director of the CIA. In my  view, Mike Pompeo is uniquely qualified to restore esprit de corps  throughout the ranks of the Foreign Service. It is hard to imagine a  better choice for Secretary of State than Mike Pompeo.                            ____________________     Now, one final matter. We have been talking all week  about a big philosophical difference between Democrats and Republicans.  Tax reform has thrown it into stark relief.   On the one hand, the Democrats' governing philosophy is about  consolidating as much money and power as possible right here in  Washington, DC. Under President Obama, we watched Democratic leaders  turn every challenge the country faced into an excuse to raise taxes  and impose regulations. Our dear friends on the other side are the  party of taxation, regulation, and litigation as well. We saw who wins  under this top-down philosophy and who loses.   America did not recover quickly enough from the great recession, and  the unimpressive growth we did see during the Obama administration was  extremely uneven. According to one study, nearly three-quarters of the  job growth and 90 percent of the net population growth from 2010 to  2016 went to metropolitan areas with more than 1 million residents. The  occupant of the Chair and I represent a lot of rural and smalltown  folks. They didn't benefit from whatever job creation there was; it  went to the big cities all across America. In the wealthiest coastal  cities, there was some improvement, but the simple fact is that the  Democratic policies left the rest of the country behind. In small towns  and smaller cities and rural areas, opportunities dried up, paychecks  stayed flat, and hope for a more prosperous future began fading.   That is what President Trump and this Republican Congress were  elected to change. Our governing philosophy is very different. We think  that more of the American people's hard-earned money should be left in  their own hands--their hands--to spend or save as they see fit. We  think government needs to give workers and job creators some breathing  room. We think every American community deserves to flourish. So we  passed record-setting rollbacks of harmful Federal rules that had  thrown a wet blanket on the economy, and we enacted sweeping tax reform  to help families and reignite growth.   What are the early results? Consumer confidence hit a 14-year high,  jobless claims a 45-year low--jobless claims, a 45-year low--and  millions of Americans receiving bonuses, pay raises, and new benefits.  Ninety percent of wage earners expected to see lower income taxes than  last year. Ninety percent of wage earners--lower income tax rates than  last year.   The philosophical difference is especially stark in States where one  Senator votes to let all of this good news happen, but the other  Senator tried to stop it from taking place.   Bonnie Brazzeal from Missouri told President Trump last month that  she is using her tax reform bonus to save for retirement.   In West Virginia, Sean Farrell says he is using expanded 529 savings  eligibility to afford Catholic school tuition for his children.   Chelsee Hatfield from Indiana is using her permanent raise to pay for  community college classes, working toward her associate's degree.   At some point, the Democratic Senators from these States I just  mentioned will have to explain why they voted to stop all that from  happening. They will have to tell Bonnie and Sean and Chelsee that they  agree with the Democratic leader, who has said Washington knows how to  spend money better than citizens do.   But, my Republican colleagues and I will stay on the side of the  American people.   Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 624.
