 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage my  colleagues to vote to protect my constituents who were scammed by for- profit colleges.   Both the House and the Senate took bipartisan votes to protect these  students, but the President overruled our votes, siding with Secretary  DeVos and her billionaire donors.   This issue hits home for me. I met a woman named Artemisa, who  attended a corrupt college in my district. She studied to be a nurse  and graduated with $40,000 in debt, but no one would hire her. She is  still paying off that debt to this day.   And it is not just Artemisa. Thousands of students at scam colleges  across the country have similar stories. And if Secretary DeVos' new  plan isn't stopped, these student borrowers may never get the justice  they deserve.   That is not what we do in this country.   If Secretary DeVos is concerned about cost, she should talk to her  billionaire friends in the corrupt college industry. The criminals  should not be putting the financial burden on the victims of this  fraud.   I encourage everyone to vote to overturn the President's veto.
