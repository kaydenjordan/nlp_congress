 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate Committee on  Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize an  outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize  Glauber's Sports, a family-owned small business in Carrollton, KY, as  the Senate Small Business of the Week.   In 1863, a young shoemaker, John Glauber, established Glauber's Shoes  in Carrollton, KY. Opening up shop on Main Street, the business  provided quality footwear to residents of Carroll County and the  surrounding area. Over the next 140 years, Glauber's Shoes became the  oldest shoe store in Kentucky and over time expanded its offerings to  include hunting supplies. Passing through multiple generations, by the  early 2000s, John Glauber, a fourth-generation descendant of the  original owner, ran the business alongside his son, Randy, who started  helping out around the shop when he was in the sixth grade. After  graduating from high school, Randy worked in the store full time and  learned how to run the family business. He later took over when his  father retired in 2005. Since taking over, Randy further expanded the  store's hunting inventory and renamed the store to Glauber's Sports to  more accurately reflect its inventory.   Today, Glauber's Sports is lauded as a one-stop-shop for hunting and  shooting sports enthusiasts in Northern Kentucky. Praised for great  customer service, Randy has demonstrated a dynamic approach to managing  the store, actively responding to local market demands by expanding its  stock and ensuring the needs of the community are met. To accommodate  its growing inventory, Glauber's Sports moved locations from Main  Street to Fourth Street in 2007. With over 1000 firearms in stock, the  store carries a wide range of rifles and shotguns. Additionally,  Glauber's Sports sells other supplies like muzzle loaders, crossbows,  outdoor wear, hunting blinds, and scopes. Looking to the future, Randy  is committed to continuing the family tradition of serving Carrollton  and is training his son, John, to take over the 158-year-old business  for decades to come.   A pillar of the community, Glauber's Sports is actively involved with  various local organizations. Over the decades, Glauber's has supported  area schools' sports teams and events like the Carroll County Fair.  Furthermore, Randy regularly volunteers with local shooting sports  organizations by coaching the Carroll County High School trap club and  4-H shooting sports clubs and by doing so passes on a lifelong passion  for shooting sports, gun safety, and his support for the Second  Amendment. Additionally, like many other small businesses, Glauber's  Sports is a member of the National Federation of Independent Businesses  and the Chamber of Commerce.   Glauber's Sports is a remarkable example of the resilience and  adaptability of family-owned small businesses. Small businesses, like  Glauber's Sports, form the heart of towns across Kentucky by regularly  stepping up to support the needs of their communities. Congratulations  to Randy, the Glauber family, and the entire team at Glauber's Sports.  I wish Glauber's Sports the best of luck and look forward to watching  this family-business' continued growth and success in Kentucky.                            ____________________
