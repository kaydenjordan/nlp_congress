 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Saint Marys Area Middle School in Saint Marys, Pennsylvania.   On March 17, students and staff participated in the Mini-THON. This  is a smaller service of Penn State University's THON.   Throughout the day, students participated in various activities to  raise money for the Four Diamonds fund to assist children and families  in their battle with cancer.   One of the many ways students raised funds was through the ``duct  tape your principal'' challenge. This brought in over $900. Dom Surra,  the assistant principal, was duct-taped to the gymnasium wall.   Due to the tremendous support from students, staff, and the  community, Saint Marys Area Middle School raised more than $12,237.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating the students and staff  for this tremendous achievement for such a righteous cause.                            ____________________
