 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak  about a bill to eradicate hazing on college campuses.   This morning, Congresswoman Marcia Fudge will introduce the END ALL  Hazing Act. I am proud to lead this bill with her to increase  campuswide transparency and accountability for all student  organizations.   For too long, hazing has threatened the health and the safety of  students and undermined the educational mission of higher education  institutions.   No student on any campus should have their well-being put in jeopardy  because of a dangerous and life-threatening situation as part of a  sports team or a club ritual.   Parents who have lost children to incidents of hazing have been  working with fraternities and sororities to engage in aggressive  student education, outreach, and advocacy efforts to end tragic hazing  incidents. Their work has included successfully pursuing legislation  with transparency requirements in several States, including my home  State of Pennsylvania.   A Federal solution will more quickly address the problem and ensure  students across the country can enjoy a safe collegiate experience with  involvement in extracurricular activities and student organizations  without fear of being hazed.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.                            ____________________
