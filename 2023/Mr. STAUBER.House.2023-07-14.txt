 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of Deb Slatten  who tragically passed away recently.   Deb served honorably for both the Carlton County Sheriff's Office and  St. Louis County Sheriff's Office for 36 years, eventually retiring as  a sergeant. She was the first female sheriff's deputy on patrol in  Duluth and the department's first female sergeant in Duluth.   Following her retirement, she continued to selflessly give her time  and talents to our community as a member of the St. Louis County  Sheriff's Volunteer Rescue Squad. This squad is one of the very best in  the Nation because of Deb and others' commitment to our region.   Please take a moment to reflect on how precious life is and how  critical these local heroes are to our communities.   Rest in peace, faithful servant.                            ____________________
