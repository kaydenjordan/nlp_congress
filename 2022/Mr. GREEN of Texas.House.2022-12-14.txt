 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding  the time.   And still I rise today, a proud graduate of the Thurgood Marshall  School of Law, a son of the segregated South, and a person who believes  that this is a great day in the history of this country.   To have this legislation pass means a lot to my generation. To those  of us who had to sit in the back of the bus, the balcony of the movie,  and go to the back doors of restaurants, it means a lot.   It means a lot for me to simply say this: I associate myself  completely, totally, and absolutely with the words of the Honorable  Steny Hoyer.   I heard his speech. I was moved by what he said, and I came to the  floor to let the world know that we have made a large, gigantic, huge  step in terms of bending the arc of the moral universe toward liberty  and justice for all.   I am grateful, and I thank the gentlewoman again for yielding time.
