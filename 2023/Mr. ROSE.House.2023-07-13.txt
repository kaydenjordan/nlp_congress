 Mr. Speaker, one of the key tenets of House Republicans'  Commitment to America was restoring our Nation's safety and security.  That means passing a strong and fiscally responsible National Defense  Authorization Act, otherwise known as the NDAA, which is our country's  primary legislation authorizing spending levels and providing  substantive policy directives for the United States Armed Forces and  the Department of Defense.   Thankfully, that is exactly what House Republicans will be doing this  week when we consider and pass the fiscal year 2024 NDAA. The NDAA for  the coming year being considered by the House this week includes many  priorities and provisions that middle Tennesseans can be proud to  support.   For starters, it ends the radical woke ideologies being forced on our  servicemembers by prohibiting funding for teaching critical race  theory. It repeals the authorization for the Department of Defense's  unnecessary chief diversity officer and eliminates funding for drag  shows and similar events.   Along with these commonsense measures that passed the House Armed  Services Committee by a 48-1 vote, the National Defense Authorization  Act gives our military the tools they need to counter the Chinese  Communist Party's aggression, increases oversight of the Biden  administration after their disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, and  saves taxpayers $40 billion by cutting inefficient defense programs,  obsolete weapons systems, and unnecessary Pentagon bureaucracy.   All in all, I believe this bill contains good provisions that return  our military's focus back on readiness and the defense of our Nation,  not wokeness and progressive posturing.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, ``What did the President know and when did he  know it?''   That famous question was from former Tennessee Senator Howard Baker,  and it is as important today as it was during the Watergate  investigation. This time, the question is: What did the former Vice  President and now-President know and when did he know it?   As House Republicans continue to dig into Hunter Biden's foreign  business dealings, it is becoming more apparent that President Biden  not only likely knew about these corrupt exchanges but he may have even  been in the room for some of them.   Republicans have proven tens of millions of dollars were funneled to  the Biden family from foreign nationals. Republicans have also  uncovered an effort by his administration to cover up Hunter Biden's  Federal crimes and his father's involvement while they continued  targeting his top political opponent.   The American people deserve answers, and we are committed to finding  them.  [[Page H3494]]
