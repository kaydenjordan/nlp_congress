 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank both of my colleagues  from California. I want to thank the chairman and ranking member of the  committee for their leadership and working together with me, the  National Park Service, the State of Iowa, Pottawattamie County, and the  city of Council Bluffs on this bill.   The National Park Service holds reversionary rights to a small parcel  of land in Council Bluffs in Pottawattamie County which highlights  Lewis and Clark's travels with an interpretation center, as well as  highlighting the California National Historic Trail and the Mormon  Pioneer National Historic Trail. However, the National Park Service has  limited resources and a limited desire to effectively operate this  property with the hundreds of properties it already maintains across  the country.   So by listening to the Park Service, the State of Iowa, Pottawattamie  County, the city of Council Bluffs, and local leaders and residents, a  consensus and commonsense solution evolved to allow the city of Council  Bluffs to accept responsibility for the property in determining its  best use while still recognizing and highlighting the spirit and  history of these historic trails.   I thank my colleagues from California, the ranking member, and the  chairman of the committee.
