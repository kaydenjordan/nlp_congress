 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to  congratulate the men and women from Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional  District who have received appointments to our Nation's service  academies. Through their academic work, their commitment to physical  fitness, and their readiness to serve, these students have demonstrated  that they are ready to begin the training that will ultimately lead to  their commissioning as officers in our Armed Services.   This morning, I am proud to recognize:   Elizabeth Pfisterer of Adams County, who will attend the United  States Military Academy at West Point;   Brian Johnson of Blair County, who will attend the United States  Naval Academy at Annapolis;   Eli Burtner of Somerset County, who will attend the United States  Military Academy at West Point;   Nathan Kirkwood of Franklin County, who will attend the United States  Naval Academy in Annapolis; and   Meagan McHale of Franklin County, who will attend the United States  Merchant Marine Academy in Nassau County, New York.  [[Page H4578]]    Thanks to these excellent young men and women, their commitment to  our Nation and to our military must be recognized. The soldiers, the  sailors, the airmen, and marines that you will one day be asked to lead  deserve officers who are disciplined and thoughtful.   Thank you for your commitment to our country, and may God bless you  and your families as you begin this new chapter of your lives. Today, I  congratulate you.                            ____________________
