 Mr. Chief Justice, on behalf of myself, Senator  Cardin, and Senator Van Hollen, I have a question for the House  managers that I will submit to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senator Klobuchar and Senators Cardin and Van  Hollen is directed to the House managers:         Could you please respond to the answer just given by the       President's counsel, and provide any other comments the       Senate would benefit from hearing before we adjourn for the       evening?    Mr. Manager NADLER. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, what we  have just heard from the President's counsel is the usual nonsense. As  we draw to a close tonight, there are only three things to remember.   One, this is a trial. It is a trial, and as any 10-year-old knows, we  should  [[Page S739]]  have witnesses. We are told we can't have witnesses because, after all,  the House says we proved our case, as we have. So why should we need  witnesses? Well, that is like saying that, in a bank robbery, the DA  announces that he has proved his case. He has had all the witnesses.  Then an eyewitness shows up, and he shouldn't be allowed to testify  because, after all, the DA was sure he proved his case first. That is  absurd, and any 10-year-old knows it is absurd.   That is the President's case against witnesses, that we have had  enough. There is always more. There aren't too many more here. The fact  is, when there are witnesses to be asked, they should be asked.   Second, there is only one real question in this trial. Everything  else is a distraction--a three-card Monte game being played by the  President's counsel--distractions. Don't look at the real question.  Look at everything else. Everything else is irrelevant. Look at the  whistleblower--irrelevant. Look at the House procedures--irrelevant.  Look at Hunter Biden--irrelevant. Look at whether President Obama's  policy was as good as or better than President Trump's policy with  respect to Ukraine--irrelevant. Look at the Steele dossier--irrelevant.   There is only one relevant question: Did the President abuse his  power by violating the law to withhold military aid from a foreign  country and extort that country into helping him--into helping his  reelection campaign--by slandering his opponent? That is the only  relevant question for the trial.   The House managers have proved that question beyond any doubt.   The one thing the House managers think the President's counsel got  right is quoting me as saying ``beyond any doubt.'' It is, indeed,  beyond any doubt.   That is why all of these distractions. That is why the President's  people are telling you to avoid witnesses--because they are afraid of  witnesses. They know the witnesses--they know Mr. Bolton and others  will only strengthen the case.   And, yes, we hear: Well, if the House managers say their case is so  strong, why do you need more witnesses? Because the truth can be  bolstered.   I yield back.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.
