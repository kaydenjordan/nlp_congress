(viii) Date Report Delivered to Congress: March 25, 2019.        *As defined in Section 47(6) of the Arms Export Control       Act.                             POLICY JUSTIFICATION         Belgium--MQ-9B SkvGuardian Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA)         The Government of Belgium has requested to purchase four       (4) MQ-9B, RPA; two (2) Fixed Certifiable Ground Control       Stations; five (5) AN/DAS-4 Multi-Spectral Targeting Systems       (4 installed, 1 spare); fifteen (15) Embedded Global       Positioning System/Inertial Navigation Systems (EGI) (12       installed, 3 spares); five (5) AN/APY-8 Lynx Synthetic       Aperture Radars (4 installed, 1 spare); and five (5) Detect       and Avoid Systems (4 installed, 1 spare). Also included are       an Initial Spares Package (ISP) and Readiness Spares Package       (RSP) to support a 5-year period of performance; spare and       repair parts; support and test equipment; publications and       technical documentation; personnel training and training       equipment; U.S. Government and contractor engineering;       technical and logistics support services; and other related       elements of logistical and program support. The total       estimated program cost is $600 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security of the United States by helping to improve       the security of a NATO ally. It is vital to the U.S. national       interest to assist Belgium to develop and maintain a strong       and ready self-defense capability. This potential sale       enhances the intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance       (ISR) capability of the Belgian military in support of       national, NATO, United Nation-mandated, and other coalition       operations. Commonality of ISR capabilities increases       interoperability between the U.S. and Belgian military and       peacekeeping forces.        Belgium intends to use these defense articles and services       to provide for the defense of its deployed troops, regional       security, domestic security, and interoperability with the       U.S./NATO partners. The current fleet of Belgian Air       Component aircraft have proven insufficient to support       sustained and persistent ISR operations. The proposed sale       will enable the Belgian Air Component to conduct persistent       and wide area ISR, including target acquisition, target       designation, providing precision coordinates for Global       Positioning System (GPS)-aided munitions, battle damage       assessment, signal intelligence, communication, and data       relays. Belgium will have no difficulty absorbing this       equipment and support into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be General Atomics       Aeronautical Systems, Inc., San Diego, California. There are       no known offset agreements proposed in connection with this       potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale may require multiple       trips to Belgium and potentially a deployed location for U.S.       contractor representatives to provide initial launch,       recovery, and maintenance support.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 19-27       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The MQ-9B SkyGuardian Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) is       a weapons capable aircraft designed for Medium-Altitude Long-      Endurance (MALE) Intelligence, Surveillance and       Reconnaissance (ISR) and Target Acquisition and strike       missions. The MQ-9B SkyGuardian RPA is not a USAF program of       record but has close ties to, and builds upon, the proven       success of the MQ-9A Reaper. The MQ-9B RPA is a Missile       Technology Control Regime (MTCR) Category 1 system with a       designed maximum payload of 4,800 pounds (800 pounds internal       and 4,000 pounds external) and is capable of carrying       multiple mission payloads aloft with a maximum range of       greater than 5,500 nm. The MQ-9B provides up to 40 hours       endurance, speeds up to 220 knots true air speed (KTAS) and a       maximum altitude of 45,000 feet. The system is designed to be       controlled by two operators within a Certifiable Ground       Control Station (CGCS). The CGCS is designed to emulate a       reconnaissance aircraft cockpit, giving users extensive means       to operate both the aircraft and sensors. The MQ-9B is able       to operate using a direct Line-of-Sight (LOS) datalink or       Beyond Line-of-Sight (BLOS) through satellite communications       (SATCOM). The design enables unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)       control to be transferred between multiple CGCSs, thus       allowing remote-split operations and centralized mission       control with other assets. The MQ-9B system can be deployed       from a single site that supports launch/recovery, mission       control, and maintenance. The system also supports remote-      split operations where launch/recovery and maintenance occur       at a Forward Operating Base and mission control is conducted       from another location or Main Operating Base (MOB). The basic       MQ-9B Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) is UNCLASSIFIED. However,       inclusion of various subsystems, capabilities, and potential       weapons results in a maximum classification of SECRET.        2. The Belgian MQ-9B system will include the following       components:        a. A secure Certifiable Ground Control Station (CGCS) with       workstations that allow aircrew to operate the aircraft,       execute the mission, and record/exploit downlinked payload       data.        b. The AN/APY-8 Lynx He Block 20A Synthetic Aperture Radar       and Ground Moving Target Indicator (SAR/GMTT) system provides       an all-weather surveillance, tracking and targeting       capability. The system operates in the Ku-band, using an       offset-fed dish antenna mounted on a three-axis stabilized       gimbal. It has a large field of regard, produces a strip map,       and can image up to a 10km wide swath. Swaths from multiple       passes can be combined for wide-area surveillance.        c. The AN/DAS-4 Multi-Spectral Targeting System (MTS-D) is       a multi-use highly advanced EO/IR sensor providing long-range       surveillance, high altitude, target acquisition, tracking,       range finding, and laser designation developed and produced       for use by the U.S. Air Force.        d. COMSEC is necessary for full functionality of the       Embedded GPS-INS (EGI) and the AN/DPX-7 Identification Friend       or Foe (IFF)/Transponder.        e. The Detect and Avoid System (DAAS) with Active       Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) Due Regard Radar (DRR) is       a multi-sensor system that detects and tracks cooperative and       non-cooperative air traffic, and enables an autopilot       response for deconfliction maneuvers.        f. The Belgium MQ-9B is intended to be used in the near-      term only for ISR-type missions. As such, the system is not       requested to be armed, but is requested to preserve the       option to arm the systems should the need arise at a later       time. If weaponized, the system is capable of being equipped       with the U.S. Army AGM-114 Hellfire missile and various       guided and unguided bombs.        3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures or       equivalent systems which might reduce weapon system       effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with       similar or advanced capabilities.        4. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S.       foreign policy and national security objectives outlined in       the enclosed Policy Justification. A determination has been       made that Belgium can provide the same degree of protection       for the sensitive technology being released as the U.S.       Government.        5. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       Belgium.                            ____________________     Madam President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.
