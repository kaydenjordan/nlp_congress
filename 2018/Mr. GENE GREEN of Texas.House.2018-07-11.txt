 Mr. Chairman, I thank my longtime friend,  Congressman Young, our dean of the House, for yielding me the time.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 200, the Strengthening  Fishing Communities and Increasing Flexibility in Fisheries Management  Act. This bipartisan bill reauthorizes one of the most successful  conservation programs in Magnuson-Stevens in a way that recognizes many  of the successes of the program.   Magnuson-Stevens was established in 1976 with one primary goal: to  reduce overfishing. With a successful update in the 1990s and 2000s, we  have now met many of the goals the program was established to meet.   Compared to when the law was established, 84 percent of the stocks  are no longer overfished, according to the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration. Yet we still treat many of these healthy  fish stocks as if nothing has changed.   I am an avid sportsman. I have hunted and fished with both my son and  my grandchildren. There is no one who  [[Page H6075]]  cares more about conservation and protection of endangered species than  hunters and recreational fishers. It is time that Magnuson-Stevens  reflects a healthy balance between commercial and recreational  fishermen.   All too often, recreational fishers take a backseat to the commercial  interests. This bill recognizes the unique space that recreational  anglers occupy and gives them the certainty they need to enjoy our  natural resources.                                time  1545    Saltwater anglers contribute $70 billion annually to the Nation's  economy and support jobs all over the country, and there is no one who  cares more about the health of our oceans either. In 2016, anglers,  through excise taxes, contributed $628 million in support of  conservation programs and resource management.   This bill will set catch limits in 3-year time periods to give  anglers certainty so they know when to plan trips. All too often,  arbitrary changes to seasons have caused problems up and down the Gulf  Coast of Texas.   This bill recognizes that technology has advanced in many ways in  measuring the health of our fish stocks. State agencies, universities,  and local conservation groups have come with up with many innovative  ways to measure the health of fish stocks. I am glad that this bill  includes language that I worked on to make sure that we had the most  scientifically accurate data possible when it comes to determining the  number of certain stocks.   Mr. Chair, I am proud to be a cosponsor to this bill and urge all of  my colleagues to support it. I thank the gentleman from Alaska for the  time.
