 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank our servicemen and - women, our military personnel who are stationed all around this world  who are standing in the gap and who are ensuring that our freedoms are  protected--not only our freedoms, but those of our kids, our kids'  opportunity to grow up in the greatest country in the world.   We all know there are enemies out there all around who would like  nothing better than to see this country, our freedoms, and our way of  life be destroyed and taken away.   That is why, Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the veterans  appropriations bill that will support our troops overseas and will let  them know that we have their backs.   You see, Mr. Speaker, House Republicans are providing over $800  million above the President's budget request for new military  construction that is focusing on the Indo-Pacific theater to counter  China.   H.R. 4366 also funds new barracks and other quality-of-life projects  just so our men and women in uniform can perform at their best while  out there defending our Nation.   Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker, our troops and their families make  great sacrifices in defending our country, and it is our duty to  support them and give them that support they deserve.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss how the Military  Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies appropriations  bill will honor those who paid the ultimate sacrifice in defense of  freedom here and abroad.   Arlington National Cemetery is the final resting place of hundreds of  thousands of veterans who died fighting for us.   It is a tremendous honor to be buried at Arlington, but the cemetery  is running out of space and is currently undergoing an expansion that  requires funding from Congress to be completed.   The Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies  appropriations bill fully funds the cemetery's Southern Expansion  Project, which will increase burial capacity until at least 2060.   Those who pay the ultimate sacrifice for our Nation must be honored,  and the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies  appropriations bill ensures America's most hallowed ground can continue  to be the final resting place for our fallen heroes.                            ____________________
