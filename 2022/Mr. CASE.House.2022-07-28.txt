 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1256, I call up  the bill (H.R. 263) to amend the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 to  clarify provisions enacted by the Captive Wildlife Safety Act, to  further the conservation of certain wildlife species, and for other  purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 263.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H7389]]    Mr. Speaker, the question that this bill addresses is whether the  private, unregistered ownership and exploitation of big cats, meaning  lions, tigers, leopards, jaguars, cougars, and hybrids of them should  continue considering significant and real animal welfare, public  safety, and law enforcement safety concerns.   H.R. 263, the Big Cat Public Safety Act says no, and would end the  ownership of big cats as private pets and prohibit exhibitors from  allowing public contact with big cats, including cubs.   This bill is a culmination of over a decade of bipartisan effort. The  Big Cat Public Safety Act, in one form or another, has been introduced  by, cosponsored by, and generally supported by Republicans and  Democrats alike for well over a decade. Since the 112th Congress, Big  Cats have garnered 933 bipartisan cosponsors. It was initially  introduced by three different Republicans over a number of Congresses,  as well as the current Democratic sponsor.   We have continued to refine the bill in the decade since its first  introduction. We passed it by suspension last Congress, and I urge my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support it again now.   The Big Cat Public Safety Act is endorsed not only by numerous  environmental, animal welfare, and other organizations, but by  countless law enforcement agencies and associations, including the  National Sheriffs' Association, the Fraternal Order of Police, State- specific sheriffs' associations, and individual law enforcement  officers.   We need to look no further than the compelling testimony from Sheriff  Matt Lutz before our Natural Resources Committee to understand the  broad concerns with the status quo.   In 2011, specifically, more than 50 exotic animals, including 38  lions, tigers, and cougars were released into the public from a private  residence in Zanesville, Ohio, shutting down a highway and terrifying  the neighbors.   Sheriff Lutz led the law enforcement response to the crisis. He  testified at our hearing this year that his department didn't have any  inventory of how many animals there were, they barely even knew that  they were there to start with, and his officers weren't trained,  obviously, to deal with big cats and other exotic animals released into  a public setting en masse.   Incredibly, no one was killed or seriously injured in Zanesville that  day, but as Sheriff Lutz testified: ``The outcome could have been much  worse if any single condition had been just slightly different, and it  could be far worse the next time.''   Precisely because private ownership is unregulated and largely  unknown, we don't know how many big cats are currently kept in private  ownership in the U.S., but estimates are as high as 20,000.   Privately owned big cats are often purchased or bred as cubs for  photo ops, and as they grow larger, they are sold into the exotic pet  trade or on the black market for wildlife parts. Adult big cats in  private ownership typically live in inhumane conditions that threaten  public safety.   Since 1990, around 300 dangerous incidents involving big cats have  resulted in human injuries, mauling, and death. In many cases, the  animals are shot and killed, as first responders are not equipped for  these situations.   In 2003, Congress unanimously passed the Captive Wildlife Safety Act,  which amended the Lacey Act to prohibit importing, exporting, buying,  selling, transporting, receiving, or acquiring big cats across States  and the U.S. border.   Though State laws vary, there is no Federal policy regarding the  private possession or use of big cats, and one is critically needed.   This bill narrowly focuses on privately owned animals. It includes  exemptions for exhibitors with U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA,  Class C licenses, and current owners are grandfathered in as long as  they register with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and abide by  listed regulations.   H.R. 263 will protect first responders and the public, as well as the  animals themselves.   In addition to public safety concerns, the exotic cat trade fuels  other criminal behavior that we in Congress should not be supporting.   As just one example, the TV series ``Tiger King'' showed us that  there is a dark and dangerous side to keeping lions, tigers, and other  big cats in captivity. In fact, Joe Exotic from that series is in jail  for violating the Lacey Act and the Endangered Species Act.   Now, some opponents of this bill argue that we need to make changes  to the bill to help small zoos stay in business. This bill would not  affect small zoos. The reality is that most zoos, whether they are big  or small, already have policies in place that reflect the Big Cat  Public Safety Act standards. They are not going to be asked to do  anything that they are not doing already. They don't allow public  contact or cub petting, and they already keep cats at a safe distance  away from the public. There are only a small few who still allow it,  and they shouldn't.    Now, we may hear claims from my colleague on the other side this is a  USDA, U.S. Department of Agriculture issue, not a U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Service issue. The fact is that the USDA does not regulate  private ownership of animals like big cats.   The Fish and Wildlife Service has long been responsible for  regulating big cats' interstate transfer and commerce under the Lacey  Act and has the authority to regulate the possession and breeding of  endangered species, including big cats.   While the USDA provides basic requirements for preventing cruelty to  exhibited animals, the Fish and Wildlife Service is the one that must  provide stringent standards to ensure that threatened and endangered  species are managed to actively promote conservation, regardless of  whether the animals are exhibited to the public.   The Big Cat Public Safety Act merely strengthens and expands an  already existing framework under the Lacey Act. It is a commonsense,  and, again, uniquely bipartisan solution to address public safety and  animal abuse concerns.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a July 26, 2022, letter from the  Congressional Budget Office.                                        Congressional Budget Office,                                                   U.S. Congress,                                      Washington, DC, July 26, 2022.      Hon. Raul M. Grijalva,      Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has       prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 263, the Big Cat       Public Safety Act.        If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be       pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Lilia       Ledezma.            Sincerely,                                                 Phillip L. Swagel.        Enclosure.             H.R. 263, Big Cat Public Safety Act--July 22, 2022                    [By fiscal year, millions of dollars] ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                          2022      2022-2027   2022-2032 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Direct Spending (Outlays)...........          0           *           * Revenues............................          0           *           * Increase or Decrease (-) in the               0           *           *  Deficit............................

Statutory pay-as-you-go procedures apply? Yes.        Increases on-budget deficits in any of the four consecutive       10-year periods beginning in 2033? No.        Mandate Effects:        Contains intergovernmental mandate? Yes, Under Threshold.        Contains private-sector mandate? Yes, Under Threshold.        Current law prohibits the import, export, purchase, sale,       transport, or acquisition of big cats, such as lions and       tigers, across state lines or the national border. H.R. 263       would generally prohibit the breeding and possession of those       animals, although wildlife sanctuaries, veterinarians,       colleges and universities, zoos, exhibitions, and other       entities that meet certain requirements would be exempt. In       addition, people who already own such animals would be       permitted to keep them if they register with the U.S. Fish       and Wildlife Service (USFWS).        For this estimate, CBO assumes that H.R. 263 will be       enacted late in fiscal year 2022. The bill would direct USFWS       to issue regulations to implement the prohibition on breeding       and possession. In addition, CBO expects that under the bill,       the Department of Agriculture (USDA) could revise existing       regulations on the licensing of entities that possess,       exhibit, and breed big cats. Based on the costs of similar       tasks, we estimate that developing those regulations would       cost $1 million over the 2022-2023 period.        Many states already prohibit ownership of the affected       species and CBO expects that people who currently own such       animals would register with USFWS. Thus, violations under the       bill would probably occur infrequently. On that basis, CBO       estimates that  [[Page H7390]]       USFWS would incur costs of less than $500,000 annually after       2023 to maintain the registry and conduct enforcement. In       total, we estimate that implementing H.R. 263 would cost       about $3 million over the 2022-2027 period; such spending       would be subject to the availability of appropriated       funds.        Under H.R. 263, violators would be subject to criminal and       civil penalties, which are recorded in the budget as       revenues; some of those penalties could be spent without       further appropriation. Thus, enacting the bill would increase       revenues and direct spending, but CBO estimates that those       increases would be insignificant over the 2022-2032 period       because we expect the number of violations would be small.        Because H.R. 263 would either prohibit the possession and       breeding of big cats or require owners, exhibitors, and       breeders to take actions that would exempt them from the       prohibitions, the bill contains intergovernmental and       private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates       Reform Act (UMRA).        Although CBO cannot estimate the cost to comply with some       of the bill's mandates, we expect the aggregate cost of the       mandates, which would include both lost income and additional       expenses to comply with the bill's requirements, would not       exceed the annual threshold established in UMRA for       intergovernmental and private-sector mandates ($92 million       and $184 million respectively, in 2022, adjusted annually for       inflation).        The bill would establish different requirements for       entities licensed by USDA to possess, exhibit, and breed big       cats; for wildlife sanctuaries; and for all other owners to       be eligible for an exemption from the prohibitions.       Approximately 340 facilities, both public and private, are       licensed by USDA to possess, exhibit, and breed big cats.        To qualify for an exemption from the bill's prohibitions,       exhibitors would be required to:        Prohibit public contact, with limited exceptions, with the       big cats; and        Maintain a 15-foot gap between the public and the animals       or erect a permanent barrier.        Approximately 30 exhibitors, including public zoos, allow       physical contact with big cats through seasonal encounters       with the animals, and about 150 mostly privately-owned       facilities host or participate in special fundraising events       that allow some form of encounter with the animals.        CBO expects that prohibiting contact with the cats (or       keeping the 15-foot gap) would decrease the financial success       of these events. Using information provided by conservation       groups and industry sources, CBO estimates that the cost of       prohibiting or limiting these activities, in the form of       foregone income, would be about $80 million each year.        CBO has no data about the physical characteristics of       exhibition settings or the ability of licensed exhibitors who       wish to continue public exposure to the big cats to meet the       new setback and barrier requirements. Thus, CBO cannot       estimate the cost to comply with the exemption.        H.R. 263 would prohibit wildlife sanctuaries from       transporting and displaying their big cats off site. CBO has       no data on the number of sanctuaries that transport and       display big cats, or the income stemming from that activity,       and thus cannot estimate the cost of this prohibition.        The bill would require all other entities that possess big       cats born before enactment to register the animals with USFWS       if they want to be exempted from the bill's prohibitions. CBO       cannot precisely estimate the cost of this mandate because       regulations implementing the bill, including the cost to       register the animals, have not been developed and the number       of animals that would need to be registered is unknown. But       based on information from animal welfare organizations, CBO       expects the aggregate costs to be small.        Finally, to be eligible for the exemption, those owners       also would be prohibited from breeding or selling their cats.       Approximately 200 cubs are traded or sold each year at value       of roughly $8,000 per animal, according to industry sources;       many of those cubs are born in facilities that would be       unable to continue breeding big cats. CBO estimates the cost       of the breeding prohibition would be less than $1.6 million       per year.        The CBO staff contacts for this estimate are Lilia Ledezma       (for federal costs) and Fiona Forrester (for mandates). The       estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director       of Budget Analysis.     Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague from Illinois, Mr.  Quigley, on his work on this bill, and I urge all Members to vote  ``yes.''   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, first of all, to my colleague's initial comments as to  energy and the economy, nobody denies the critical importance of those  issues, and, yes, of course, we all should be working collectively on  those particular issues.   But by that measure, frankly, I would have wished that more of my  colleagues on the other side would have voted for the bill immediately  prior to this, which is a major issue and initiative to solve our  supply chains and to take care of our national defense in terms of our  chips. Also, by the measure that he outlines, we should not have  addressed other critical issues in our country--for example, gun  violence, women's rights, and civil rights. Of course, we should have  done that.   The fact of the matter is that this Congress must and can address the  many challenges of our country, and, yes, those challenges include, for  this particular hour, the danger posed to our public and our law  enforcement communities by unregulated big cats.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Quigley), the author of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, first of all, to the comments of my colleague and friend  from California, he says that this situation of private possession of  big cats is already covered by current law. That is incorrect. They are  not regulated under Federal law. The private possession is not  regulated, nor is the private utilization and exploitation covered by  current law.   He complains that this would set up a duplicative environment.  Neither USDA nor the Fish and Wildlife Service is regulating in this  area right now.   So, it is a question, if one accepts the premise of which way you go  in terms of who is best to regulate it, it is not going to duplicate  anything that either of them does, but it will complement more  accurately what the Fish and Wildlife Service is responsible for, which  is, number one, enforcement of the Lacey Act, which this is a natural  extension of, in which we focus on the trade and endangered species and  the impact of that trade not only on the public safety but on the  survival of those species around the world.                                time  1545    Number one, the Fish and Wildlife Service does, in fact, deal with  endangered species. In fact, it is our primary agency for doing so. So  this is a judgment that the Fish and Wildlife Service is the  appropriate agency as opposed to the USDA which has a different  direction that it takes.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Grijalva), who is the chair of the full committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in response to my friend and colleague from Georgia, I  simply want to read a list of some of the endorsers of this particular  legislation.   These are all members of law enforcement: The National Sheriffs'  Association, the Fraternal Order of Police, the Sheriffs' Association  of Texas, the Maine Sheriffs' Association, the West Virginia Sheriffs'  Association, the Arkansas Sheriffs' Association, the Kansas Sheriffs'  Association, the Louisiana Sheriffs' Association, the Buckeye State  Sheriffs' Association of Ohio, the Vermont Sheriffs' Association, and  the Iowa State Sheriffs' Association.   I have gotten to four lines of a whole bunch of other endorsements  from law enforcement.   Clearly, they regard this as one of the areas that we should address  for this country out of the many challenges that we face. So I do think  it is appropriate that we devote just a little bit of time to what is  concerning them.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Castor).    Mr. Speaker, first of all, to the ranking member's  comments, this is an informed judgment about which of two existing  Federal agencies is more appropriate to manage and administer what, I  believe, if I hear the ranking member correctly, is our common goal,  our common goal of ending the status quo as to the private possession  and exploitation of big cats.                                time  1600    So this is a judgment that we disagree on. I have articulated our  reasons why Fish and Wildlife is the better one. He has his view of  USDA. It is a policy call for us to make. But we are not disagreeing  with the overall goal, I don't believe.   His amendment, by the way, not only--his proposed amendment not only  proposed to put it in USDA, but also to essentially preempt the  preemption of Federal law. So, in other words, there is a jumble of  State laws out there, ranging from good, solid State laws, to no State  laws; and that creates a real complicated and very confusing puzzle for  all kinds of people, again, including law enforcement.   So you cannot apply a Federal standard across the country with one  sentence, and then, in the next sentence say, oh, by the way, any State  can do anything it wants. That doesn't make any sense at all.   So either we go in with the Federal standard, or we don't go there at  all. Our judgment under this law is that we need to go there with a  Federal standard.   As to my colleague's comments on priorities, I would, again, refer to  my earlier comments. Those are critical priorities that we are all  trying to address.   Certainly, I haven't checked the roll call vote on the bill that we  just passed, CHIPS, but I hope, if they are truly interested and  focused on inflation, on energy, on self-sufficiency in our country,  then I would hope that I saw a ``yes'' vote for them on one of the most  major pieces of legislation that we will be passing and the President  will be signing shortly to end our supply chain reliance on places like  China.   My colleague also knows that we have coming up a major wildfire bill  to address that challenge that we all agree is a critical challenge for  our country, and I certainly hope that he will view that bill favorably  as well, if, in fact, we all have that shared goal.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time. I am  prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   First of all, I do want to thank my colleague, the ranking member of  the full committee. He is a very good ranking member and a very good  person to work with on many challenges on our Natural Resources  Committee.   I appreciate his comments at the outset of this debate which, I  believe, reflected an agreement as to the problem and as to the goal.  We may be sitting here debating some of the implementation, but in this  Congress, if we can  [[Page H7395]]  agree on the problem and the goal, that is a step forward, and I  appreciate at least that we have that common agreement.   Yes, we do have disagreements in terms of the exact way to approach  this; specifically, which Federal agency should actually have the con  on this. We have outlined our arguments here and elsewhere, and we have  a disagreement, and that is part of the democratic process. We believe  we have the better view of that, given the Fish and Wildlife Service's  focus.   I do want to take issue with his comment that it took 2 days to  debate this bill in the Natural Resources Committee. Actually, the  debate having to do with this particular issue in the Natural Resources  Committee was far less than 2 days. In fact, I didn't add it up. It  probably amounted to 2 hours of those 2 days. The rest of it was really  debating other issues in the context of this bill.   So this is not a particularly complicated problem to grasp from the  law enforcement, from public safety, from an animal welfare  perspective, and it is not a particularly difficult problem to identify  very concise options and to make a decision on those. Those things were  vetted in the Natural Resources Committee and are being vetted on the  floor here. But to say that this took 2 days, in all due respect, is  not accurate.   I do want to comment briefly on the comment having to do with State  laws are already handling this. Yes, of course, this is always an issue  that we have in determining whether, in the context of our work here,  we should have the Federal Government apply standards or leave it to  the States.   In this particular case, we have the worst of all worlds. We have  differing State laws in terms of the private ownership and exploitation  of big cats; and we also have both Federal and State laws that both  preempt and leave it to the States.   But I would submit that the Captive Wildlife Safety Act, which is  where we started on this almost 20 years ago, a Federal law that said  that we were going to, as a country, state that you can no longer  import these big cats from their homes; thus, decimating their  populations where they came from, and encouraging a trade that has led  them to the brink of extinction in most cases. We said that that is a  Federal matter, and that is what we are trying to follow.   This is only an extension of that particular act. So I think it is a  particularly worthwhile area for us to develop Federal standards and  end a lot of doubt among the States and among the Federal Government  and the States collectively and get on with the goal of protecting our  people, protecting our animals, and protecting our law enforcement.   I urge adoption of this bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
