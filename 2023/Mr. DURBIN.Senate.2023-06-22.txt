 Mr. President, I want to follow the remarks of the  majority leader. Last Saturday night, there was a Juneteenth  celebration in Willowbrook, IL. There was music and people gathered in  a parking lot of a strip mall, and they were having a generally good  time. And then gunfire erupted. At the end of just a few minutes, 1  person was dead and 22 had been wounded--Saturday night.   That wasn't the only gun violence in the region over the holiday  weekend. We estimate that at least 14 were killed and another 61  injured from gunfire. It is a common occurrence, sadly, across America.  We have felt it in Illinois. Some estimate that we have had over 50  mass shootings so far this month, and we are only at June 22.   What is going on in America? It is a serious question.   But what has happened every weekend in communities across this  country is a reminder that Americans cannot gather to celebrate a  holiday, a graduation, or even a funeral without the ever-present  threat of gun violence.   It goes without saying, but I am going to repeat it: Gunfire is the  No. 1 killer of America's children. Gunfire is the No. 1 killer of  America's children.   Many of my constituents beg me to do something as chairman of the  Senate Judiciary Committee. They say: Can't you at least regulate the  use of some of these guns so that they don't get in the hands of people  who will misuse them?   I tell them that I want to do that and I share their sentiments but I  don't have the votes to do it. You need 60 votes on the floor of this  100-Member Senate to get anything of that nature passed, and it is hard  to do.   One in five Americans say they have lost a loved one to gun  violence--one in five. That is unthinkable in other countries around  the world. Yet it has become the American way, sadly.   Yet, today, we are facing an incredible effort by the Senate  Republicans a little later this morning. They are trying to take a gun  safety provision off the books. They want to weaken a law that has been  on the books for 90 years--90 years.   They want to overturn a regulation by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,  Firearms, and Explosives that prevents people from turning pistols into  short-barreled rifles. This regulation is on devices known as  stabilizing braces. They convert pistols into a weapon that can be  fired from the shoulder, but they still only have a barrel under 16  inches long so they can be easily hidden under a jacket.   For almost 90 years, short-barreled rifles have been controlled under  the National Firearms Act, along with machineguns and sawed-off  shotguns. Why? Because they combine the accuracy of a rifle with the  concealability of a handgun. It is a deadly combination.   Pistols with stabilizing braces have a reputation in this modern  America. The mass shooter who killed 9 people and injured 17 in Dayton,  OH, in 2019 used one of these weapons. One was used by a mass shooter  in Boulder, CO, in 2021, who killed 10 people, including a policeman,  and by another mass shooter who killed 5 and injured 19 in 2022 in  Colorado Springs.   The Covenant School shooting in Nashville, TN, this past March--that  horrible scene that we remember, teachers and children being killed at  their school--that shooter had one of these weapons as well.   So a Republican Senator is going to come to the floor today and say  that we should weaken a safety measure that has been on the books for  almost 90 years, to make it easier for people to wield short-barreled  rifles that have been used in mass killings in America.   What are we thinking?   The Fourth of July is just around the corner. I remember the last  Fourth of July. My wife and I were vacationing in Michigan when we  heard the news that there had been a mass shooting in Highland Park,  IL, at the Fourth of July parade. A gunman got on top of one of the  downtown buildings where the crowd had gathered for this parade, and he  used an assault weapon and fired 83 rounds in 60 seconds, firing  randomly into a crowd, killing 7 innocent people who just came out for  the Fourth of July parade and wounding almost 55 others.   Think of that for a moment: in 60 seconds, that kind of damage with  those kinds of weapons.   And here we have, leaving for the Fourth of July break this year, an  effort by the Senate Republicans to authorize the use of a piece of  equipment that has been used over and over again in America in mass  shootings, killing innocent people, including schoolchildren in  Nashville, TN.   What are they thinking? At a time when gun violence is the No. 1  killer of children, at a time when we read about it day in, day out,  they want to make it easier to have a weapon that serves as a short- barreled rifle, that makes so many people vulnerable and kills them in  such a rapid fashion. This makes no sense whatsoever, but it defines  the Republican Party's attitude toward gun control.   We have had one exception to what I just said, and that was last  year. After the Uvalde incident, we finally did something. I think it  was positive, and it was bipartisan. I salute the Republicans who  joined in on that, but I hope today they come to their senses and don't  weaken this 90-year-old law and make it easier for people to use these  weapons in a violent way, in a deadly way.   The ATF rule gives law-abiding gun owners plenty of options to comply  with the law: removing the stabilizing brace which is at issue here,  attaching a longer barrel to the gun, or registering the weapon like  other short-barreled rifles because that is what it is. So there are  plenty of ways that you can comply with the rule, but our colleagues  want to throw it out and make it easier to buy these weapons,  equipment, that can be used to make a more deadly weapon.    The rule is common sense, and the last thing we should do is wipe it  off the books. I urge my colleagues to vote no on the resolution.                                 Pride Month    Mr. President, on a separate issue, this weekend, cities around the  globe, including Chicago, will be hosting their annual Pride parades.  It will be a chance to join together in celebrating the LGBTQ community  and to honor the history of the Pride movement.   Sadly, today, even during Pride Month, extremist politicians  throughout America are trying to rewrite that proud history. Since the  start of the 2022 school year, Republican lawmakers in more than 30  States have introduced bills banning or limiting access to books in our  Nation's libraries and classrooms, and many of these books focus, at  least in part, on LGBTQ identity and history.   This is not a coincidence because these book bans are not only an  affront to the First Amendment; they are a shameful and deliberate  effort to erase the LGBTQ community from the American story. Well, try  as these politicians might, the truth is that you can't erase the  history or the progress when it comes to human rights. You cannot erase  the courage and sacrifice of Pride pioneers like Marsha P. Johnson and  Harvey Milk, and we cannot erase our LGBTQ colleagues who have broken  barriers and who are proving to young people like them that they are a  vital part of the Nation's history.   I am going to ask that the remainder of my statement be placed in the  Record because I have to go to the Appropriations Committee, but I want  to salute the people who participated in yesterday's hearing in the  Senate Judiciary Committee. It was a hearing that, really, I was proud  of at the end. I didn't know going in how it would work.   There was a 16-year-old transgender girl from Alabama with her father  who appeared, and she did an extraordinarily good job testifying and  answering questions. There was a doctor from Texas who has been  involved in gender-affirming care for more than 10 years. She talked  about the difficulties in dealing with children who are searching for  answers in their lives, looking for a place in this world, and hoping  that they can find someone whom they can talk to--parents and medical  professionals.   It struck me that there are decisions being made every single day  across America by parents and families, life-and-death decisions and  decisions that are critical. We need to say to these families: You make  the best decision for your child.   But when it comes to gender affirming care, many States have stepped  in  [[Page S2200]]  and said to the doctors involved and the parents involved: Stop the  conversation. You are not going to discuss it with children who are  troubled and need some help.   That is wrong. Medicine and science should prevail, not prejudice,  when it comes to transgender people. The hearing yesterday was a good  one, and I think it was an indication that Pride Month is taken  seriously by the U.S. Congress and particularly the Senate Judiciary  Committee.   The history of Pride is the history of America--hard-won progress,  that may come in fits and starts, but over time, brings us closer to  fulfilling the promise of equal justice under law. And if we truly want  to honor Pride's history--then we need to do more than celebrate the  month of June; we need to draw from the Pride movement's legacy and  spirit of resistance.   Yesterday, as I mentioned, the Judiciary Committee, which I chair,  held a hearing on the urgent need to defend the rights of LGBTQ+  Americans. You see, the very same politicians who are at this moment  trying to ban books in schools and libraries are also introducing laws  targeting our LGBTQ+ youth, along with the medical professionals who  care for them and the parents who love them.   Since the start of 2023, more than 525 of these bills have been  introduced in 41 States, many specifically targeting trans youth. Some  bills seek to ban gender-affirming care, while others are designed to  dictate what sports kids can play or what bathrooms they can use. But  all of them are part of the same, concerted effort: using the powers of  government to target children and their families.   Put yourself in the shoes of these families for just a moment.  Imagine being the parent of a trans child and meeting with a doctor who  is helping guide you through potentially life-and-death decisions.  These are the most personal moments imaginable. They are hard enough as  is. And the last thing you need is a politician forcing themselves into  the doctor's office and telling you how to care for your child, a child  who is already struggling--and who is only asking for the freedom to  live as who they are in their hearts.   The Committee heard from one of those young Americans: Harleigh  Walker. She is a 16-year-old transgender girl from Alabama, which has  enacted laws threatening her ability to access the care she needs to be  happy and healthy. Ms. Walker told the committee, ``I want all of you  to look at me, here and now, and hear my words. I am a VERY happy 16- year-old. I have wonderful friends who accept me . . . for who I am.  I'm active in my school's debate team and other extracurricular[s]. . .  .   ``I'm just trying to be a teenager in America. Same as any other  teen, but I keep having to jump through hoops that other people my age  don't have to. . . . I'm here in front of this Committee instead of  enjoying summer vacation, just to try and ensure that my right to exist  isn't taken away.''   Ms. Walker identified an urgent need for new policies that support  transgender children and protect them from bullying and harassment.   Parents and families of transgender children are facing fundamental  questions about their children's health, identity, and future. They are  asking for Congress to step up and protect their children from  discrimination in schools, businesses, and hospitals. And this Senate  has a chance to do so by passing the Equality Act, which was  reintroduced this week by Senators Merkley, Baldwin, and Booker and  which I am cosponsoring.   Let us show these families--and every LGBTQ+ American--that they are  not alone. Let us show them our support and solidarity--not just during  Pride month, but every day of the year.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Coons) is  necessarily absent.   The result was announced--yeas 49, nays 50, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 171 Leg.]                                  YEAS--49       Barrasso      Blackburn      Boozman      Braun      Britt      Budd      Capito      Cassidy      Collins      Cornyn      Cotton      Cramer      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Ernst      Fischer      Graham      Grassley      Hagerty      Hawley      Hoeven      Hyde-Smith      Johnson      Kennedy      Lankford      Lee      Lummis      Marshall      McConnell      Moran      Mullin      Murkowski  [[Page S2205]]        Paul      Ricketts      Risch      Romney      Rounds      Rubio      Schmitt      Scott (FL)      Scott (SC)      Sullivan      Thune      Tillis      Tuberville      Vance      Wicker      Young                                  NAYS--50       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Brown      Cantwell      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Cortez Masto      Duckworth      Durbin      Feinstein      Fetterman      Gillibrand      Hassan      Heinrich      Hickenlooper      Hirono      Kaine      Kelly      King      Klobuchar      Lujan      Manchin      Markey      Menendez      Merkley      Murphy      Murray      Ossoff      Padilla      Peters      Reed      Rosen      Sanders      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen      Sinema      Smith      Stabenow      Tester      Van Hollen      Warner      Warnock      Warren      Welch      Whitehouse      Wyden                               NOT VOTING--1               Coons           The joint resolution (H.J.

Mr. President, last week the Senate passed legislation I  helped lead with Senators Cruz, Menendez, and others that renames the  street in front of the Cuban Embassy for Oswaldo Paya.   Paya led a heroic and decades-long effort to bring basic democratic  reforms to Cuba, which resulted in years of harassment that culminated  in his death in 2012 when his car was run off the road by government  thugs.   And also last week, after years of urging by me and several  colleagues, the InterAmerican Commission on Human Rights released its  verdict on this tragic event, confirming what we suspected all along,  that the Cuban Government was responsible for his tragic death.   This important judgement is a reminder that Paya's work and that of  so many other brave Cubans fighting for basic freedoms remains a work  in progress, one which I will continue to support.                            ____________________     Mr. President, earlier this month, my state of Illinois  lost one of our most dedicated public servants. Her name was Mary Ann  Lamm. She was a trailblazer and a changemaker in Illinois politics.  Most importantly, she was a dear friend of mine.  [[Page S2214]]    During her many decades of service to our State, Mary Ann made  history as the longest serving county recorder in Sangamon County. And  really, it is no wonder why she was elected--and reelected to this  position a record-breaking eight times. Every single day, Mary Ann  lived up to the motto that she created, and affixed to the letterhead  for the county recorder's office: ``Public Service. Working for you.''   And Mary Ann's tenacious spirit was only surpassed by her  selflessness. Even though she was a giant in Sangamon County, there was  no problem too small for her to solve. Whether you were starting a  business or buying a home, her doors were always open--and she was  always ready to help. From making sure your paperwork was filed on  time, to protecting your personal financial information, Mary Ann  mastered the complexities of local government to make it work for the  people. Mary Ann also was a pioneer in building a bench of political  talent in Central Illinois. And today, there is a generation of leaders  throughout our State who look to her legacy as the model for public  service.   Like me, before moving to Springfield, Mary Ann was born and raised  in East St. Louis. And to really understand how she developed her  tireless work ethic, look no further than her mother Dorothy, who  worked past the age of 100. Dorothy was a warden for the Sangamon  County jail--and would even prepare meals for her fellow employees and  county prisoners. Like Dorothy, Mary Ann not only had incredible  culinary talents, she used those talents to bring people together  through delicious, home-cooked meals.   Mary Ann's career in public service began in 1963. At the age of 25,  she was elected clerk for the village of Southern View, located smack  dab in the heartland of Illinois. With fewer than 1,500 residents,  Southern View was the perfect proving ground for Mary Ann's neighborly  approach to public service. Whenever you needed her help, it was all  hands on deck. Four years later, Mary Ann made her way to Springfield,  where she was elected capital township trustee. And it was during this  period that the two of us met for the first time. We were fast friends.   When I first ran for office, Mary Ann was one of my most loyal  supporters--and was among the first of my friends to help dust me off  after a tough loss. And she was also among the first to celebrate in  1982, when I won my race for Congress.   And Mary Ann always had a way of bringing people together. Whenever  she hosted an event, just about everyone in town would show up--and not  for the networking opportunities, but the food. She would prepare a  seemingly endless supply of her homemade mostaccioli, a fan favorite.  People would practically leap from their seats to get a taste. And  everyone would leave with a full belly, along with a home-baked  brownie, gently placed atop a napkin, for the road.   As I mentioned, the crown jewel of Mary Ann's career in public  service was the 32 years she served as Sangamon County Recorder. As  county recorder, she ushered the office into the digital age, leading  the transition from microfiche and microfilm to modems and modern  computing. Under Mary Ann's leadership, the county recorder's office  emerged as a nimble, accessible public asset that all of our residents  in Sangamon County rely on to this day.   Whenever I campaigned with Mary Ann, I was always surprised by not  only how many people knew her, but how eager they were to shake her  hand. She was humble, hard-working, and a hero to everyone she  represented. Everything she touched, from every political campaign, to  every elected office she held, turned to gold. She was one-of-a-kind  and extended kindness to everyone who crossed her path.   Loretta and I join Mary Ann's children Robert, Therese, and Melissa;  her grandchildren Laura, Alyssa, Nick, Libby, Eric, and Sophia; her  siblings Bob, John, Ginny, Kepp, and Tom; and all of her nieces and  nephews in mourning her loss. We miss you dearly, Mary Ann, and I speak  for everyone in our State when I say: Thank you for your service.                            ____________________     Mr. President, for nearly 20 years, Scott Laughlin lit up  the radio, welcoming WJBC listeners in the Bloomington, IL, area to a  new day. It has been a few years since I have had the pleasure of being  on the radio with Scott since he retired in 2019, but I would like to  take a moment to wish him a happy birthday. We used to catch up monthly  on his show, chatting about the big news of the day or the latest Cubs  game. I like to think he had as much fun during those interviews as I  did.   On the air, I could always count on Scott to ask me thoughtful  questions about the on-goings in Washington. And he was never shy about  letting me know where he stood. On more than one occasion, he let me  know I voted against his opinion. But with each political discussion we  broached on the radio, he did so with the utmost respect and  willingness to understand the other side--and with a good sense of  humor, too. He was a gracious host to both his guests and listeners.   Sadly, Scott cut his time at WJBC short, retiring a year ahead of his  own schedule, when he discovered he had kidney cancer. In the 4 years  since his diagnosis, Scott has fought hard, and his resolve continues  to serve him today. His story, along with those of the nearly 82,000  Americans who receive this same diagnosis annually, reminds us why we  faithfully advocate for medical research funding in hopes of finding a  cure for cancer.   While he has many fans from his time as a radio host, Scott's  favorite listeners have always been his wife Lori; his two kids Casey  and TJ; and his granddaughter Lucy. In his retirement, he has enjoyed  extra time with them, sometimes spent on the golf course or  relentlessly cheering on his teams: the Chicago Cubs and Bears, as well  as the Illinois State University Redbirds.   I miss chatting with Scott over the radio, but I am sure he has found  new joy in retirement. As his birthday approaches--July 5th--I am  wishing Scott a very happy birthday, hopefully spent celebrating with  friends and family, and maybe a round of golf or two.                            ____________________
