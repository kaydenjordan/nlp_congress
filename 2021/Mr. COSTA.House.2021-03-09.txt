 Mr. Speaker, a year into this pandemic and the world is  still reeling. It has created a deep economic crisis for American  families and small businesses, and economic disparity continues.   Now that vaccines are being administered, with millions inoculated so  far, hope for gaining the upper hand over this disease is on the  horizon.   Last weekend, I saw firsthand the smiles on teachers' faces as they  lined up for their first dose of the vaccine. Desperate to see their  students, they hold out hope that these shots can get them safely back  into the classroom for the first time in a year.   Food workers, those who we deem essential to putting food on  America's dinner table every night, need to be vaccinated as well. I  talked to them about their desire to do their jobs without fear of  getting sick, and getting back to a life of normalcy, but we must do  more to help Americans.   Our communities are hurting. Families, businesses, cities, and States  need economic relief now.   This week, we will pass the American Rescue Plan to get immediate  relief to struggling Americans. It provides the resources needed to  help people get by and return to work. This bill will help our economy  move again, and I am proud to support it.                            ____________________
