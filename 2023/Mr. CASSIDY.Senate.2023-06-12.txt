 Madam President, Social Security is a sacred trust  between the American people and the American government. For the worker  who is  [[Page S2044]]  about to retire with no savings other than Social Security, the woman  who relies on Social Security to pay for medications, they need to know  that the government is not going to break this sacred trust.   That is why I have been leading a bipartisan group of over a dozen  Senators to develop a solution. And we have what we call the Big Idea.  But before describing the Big Idea, I have to tell you, right now, it  does not matter what big ideas--or any idea--are being discussed.  President Biden made it clear in his State of the Union speech that he  was going to run for reelection attacking Republicans on the issue of  Social Security.   Now, by the way, he has not introduced legislation on Social Security  himself. He spoke about one in his previous campaign, but it was not  serious. And the money he said he would use for his unserious plan he  has already spent on other priorities, or at least proposed to spend.  President Biden was not even willing to acknowledge the problem that  Social Security faces.   But, in a bipartisan sense, let's be fair; he is not alone. Former  President Trump refuses to acknowledge the issue. He never introduced  or sought to work with Congress when he was President, and now he  criticizes anyone who suggests that Social Security might be going  insolvent. But, unfortunately for us all, Social Security is going  insolvent.   It is not me who says this; it is the actuaries, those who are told  to come before the American people and tell what is the current state  of Social Security. They tell us that in 9 years, it is insolvent. At  that point, beneficiaries will see a 24-percent cut in the amount they  are receiving. There is no grandfathering in. You might be already  receiving, but when that deadline hits--2033, 2032--boom, 24-percent  cut for those who are currently receiving. Poverty among the elderly  doubles.   And even though it is against the law to borrow money to pay the  difference between what is coming in and what is going out, let's  imagine that we did. If we do decide to break the law and borrow that  money, it would end up causing a $562 trillion debt to pay these  benefits over the next 75 years. That would give us a debt-to-GDP ratio  similar to that of Greece and Venezuela, and that is independent of the  money that would be required for Medicare benefits and other such  benefits.   So what does our Big Idea do? Our Big Idea avoids this problem by  setting up an investment fund separate from Social Security--no Social  Security money whatsoever--an investment fund in which we place money  and allow it to grow over 75 years; and, in so doing, we address 75  percent of the issue.   We don't raise the retirement age to 70, as people suggest. We don't  touch the way Social Security benefits are distributed. We make sure  that no one has a disruption in their benefits that they are promised  to receive. And in our plan, we have work incentives and we work to  address issues of WEP and GPO and poverty among the elderly.   It is an idea that could work and pass Congress, but there has been  zero Presidential leadership. And we have had no engagement from this  President, and there was no engagement from the previous President.   So a few weeks ago, we decided to take our issue to the people, and  we called it Bill on the Hill. Kind of a nice rhyme, huh? I took a walk  around the Capitol grounds and spoke to Americans from across the  country who were visiting the Nation's capital. There was a couple from  Louisiana, a family from Pennsylvania, a veteran who is also a pastor  from Massachusetts, and several others who gave their unvarnished  opinions on what they want Washington to do about Social Security.   The bottom line: Americans want to see Social Security saved. They-- we--deserve a real solution, not grandstanding. One blue-collar worker  I spoke to from rural Pennsylvania told me--I am going to try and  imitate his voice:         Jobs that I have had haven't necessarily had retirement       plans.    He said it was ``very discouraging'' to hear a 24-percent cut was  coming if we do nothing.   There was a doctor from Opelousas. Now, this doctor has as much gray  hair as I do, but, if you can imagine, he was once one of my former  students. The doctor from Opelousas--Opelousas, LA, for those who don't  know about that--he put it in stark terms when I told him that doing  nothing means that poverty among his patients would double--among the  elderly in general, but he has got a patient population a little bit  older. He said the people he knows ``would have to start choosing  between their medicines and food.''   Now, these are people who rely on Social Security, who put faith in  that sacred trust that they would not have to choose between medicine  and food. Yet that is the choice they are going to be forced to if we  do nothing.   And then there was Dr. Paul Kim--a pastor, a veteran--who was up here  for a convention from Massachusetts. And he told me what he wanted from  a President:         He has to be honest and keep the promise [of Social       Security].    Dr. Kim is right. The President needs to be honest with the American  people about Social Security; but this President is not. He refuses to  even acknowledge that the problem exists.   The fact is, as I have already mentioned, Social Security--according  to the actuaries, the people we entrust to tell us the state of it--is  going insolvent in 9 years. But President Biden is steadfast in his  position that there is nothing wrong, there is no need for a serious  plan. Oh, yes, he introduced a plan when he was on the campaign trail;  has done nothing since. And the money that he would use to pay for this  unserious plan he has already proposed to spend on other things.    By the way, $4.5 trillion he has proposed in new taxes and not a dime  going to Social Security. And as I mentioned, it isn't just President  Biden; it is former President Trump, who did nothing while he was  President and, even now, criticizes people who wish to do something. It  appears that the Biden-Trump plan is the same plan. It is a plan to do  nothing and demagogue those who choose to responsibly address the  issue.   When I told one of these folks, the woman from Opelousas, LA, that  President Biden and Donald Trump have the same plan, she was going:  Whoa, whoa, that is something. But when she heard it was a plan to do  nothing, her reaction was:         I want to laugh, and I want to cry at the same time.    Americans are watching as Washington flounders, as the deadline until  retirees get a 24 percent cut approaches. By the way, we have seen  polling on this. When people understand that the program is going  insolvent in 9 years, 75 percent--from the very liberal to the very  conservative and every point in between--think that we should address  the issue now. That is the American people speaking, but that is not  our leading Presidential candidates.   We owe it to the American people to take this sacred trust seriously.  We owe it to them to save Social Security before it is too late.   Now, I am open to discussing my big idea, anyone else's idea. You  name it. But there has to be a serious conversation. And since it has  to be signed into law, a participant must be the President of the  United States. We need the political courage from those who aspire to  be our Nation's leader to actually show leadership.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Gwyn  Shelley, an intern in my office, be granted floor privileges until June  13, 2023.
