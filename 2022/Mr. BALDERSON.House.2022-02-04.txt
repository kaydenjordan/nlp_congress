 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the amendment  offered by Representative Steel.   This amendment is simple. It demands that China, the world's worst  producer of greenhouse gas emissions, meets the same emissions  standards that are imposed on the United States.   CO2 emissions in the United States have steadily declined  since 2010 and drastically decreased during the pandemic. In 2020,  China somehow managed to increase their emissions. Meanwhile, nearly  every other country reduced theirs.   If my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to be serious  about the climate, let's start by creating a level playing field for  U.S. businesses to compete and require the world's largest polluter,  China, to step up to the plate.
