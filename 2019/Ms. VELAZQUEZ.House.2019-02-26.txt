 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule and the underlying  resolution.   We should be absolutely clear: There is no crisis at our border. In  fact, apprehensions of illegal border crossings are at a 40-year low.  This is a fake emergency being used as a pretext for Donald Trump to  build a monument to hate on our southern border.   But this is more than that. This administration's actions would do  violence to our Constitution, undermine our separation of powers, and  set a terrible precedent for the future. Every single Member of  Congress, regardless of party, needs to stand up and make their voice  heard.   To all my Republican colleagues who so frequently extolled the  Constitution's virtues, I say to you: Make your voice heard today. Now  is the chance to show your true colors, to defend Article I, and to  stand up for Congress' constitutionally vested powers of the purse.   Vote ``yes'' on the rule; vote ``yes'' on the resolution; stand up  for the Constitution; and reject this illegal power grab by this  President.
