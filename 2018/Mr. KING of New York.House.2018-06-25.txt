Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5094, the Enhancing  Suspicious Activity Reporting Initiative Act.   I have been a long-term proponent of the If You See Something, Say  Something campaign, which was begun in New York City in 2002 by the  Metropolitan Transportation Authority.                                time  1915    This program, along with the Suspicious Activity Reporting  initiative, SAR, helps Federal, State, and local law enforcement piece  together sometimes seemingly disparate pieces of information to  prevent, detect, and interdict terrorist threats to the homeland.   During a recent subcommittee hearing on SARs, a witness from the New  Jersey State Police explained that a SAR triggered a law enforcement  investigation where a copy of ``Inspire'' magazine was found in a  residence, in particular, an article on how to construct a pressure  cooker bomb. The suspect admitted to planning a major attack in New  York City.   This SAR was instrumental in thwarting a potential terrorist attack  against our Nation.   While the FBI reviews, nationwide, SARs for investigative leads, DHS  largely manages the efforts to provide information and training to  State and local law enforcement, fusion centers, and other emergency  response providers.   H.R. 5094 strengthens this effort by requiring the Secretary of  Homeland Security to develop a strategy designed to improve the  operations and activities of the Nationwide Suspicious Activity  Reporting Initiative, NSI.   This includes training; outreach; information sharing with key  partners, including law enforcement officers, fusion centers, emergency  response providers, and the private sector.   H.R. 5094 also empowers the Secretary to establish an NSI working  group that includes representation from State and local stakeholders,  the private sector, and privacy experts.   The working group will provide advice and recommendations to the  Secretary on improvements to the SARs initiative. Additionally, the  reporting requirement to Congress promotes transparency in these  efforts and rigorous oversight by my subcommittee and others.   Last week, the Secretary of Homeland Security noted that DHS was in  the midst of ``refreshing'' the SARs initiative. While I am pleased to  hear that DHS is moving to enhance ``See Something, Say Something'' and  SARs, the legislation before us today will ensure that the refresh is  done strategically and includes input from the very stakeholders  responsible for investigating and reporting SARs.   Shortly after an attack or tragedy in our Nation, leaders of both  parties urge our citizens to be vigilant during their commutes and in  their neighborhoods, and to report suspicious activity to law  enforcement. It is important to turn public statements of support into  legislative action.   This bill received strong bipartisan support in committee. The  passage of this legislation will demonstrate Congress' commitment to  provide commonsense legislation to help DHS continue to provide  important SARs training and outreach.   I would also like to emphasize that a Secret Service detailee to my  subcommittee, Pete Murphy, was very instrumental in working with other  staff members in putting this legislation together.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I again want to thank my  colleague, Mr. Langevin, for his bipartisan support on this  legislation, as in so many other pieces of bipartisan legislation, and  for the outstanding work he does on the subcommittee and the committee.   Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
