 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support this  appropriations bill, which provides funding for the Department of the  Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency, and related agencies.    This bill would provide vital funding for water infrastructure, State  drinking water systems, national parks, and  [[Page H490]]  Everglades restoration projects. Yet we have been locked in a  nonsensical shutdown because President Trump continues to insist on his  ineffective and offensive border wall scheme.   While the President throws a tantrum, people are suffering and our  environment is suffering.   Many of us have seen the pictures of the piles of garbage. Our  environment cannot withstand this onslaught. They are overflowing in  many of our national parks.   Our national parks are the crown jewels of our Nation's natural  heritage. In 2017, the National Park System drew more than 330 million  visits, including more than 10 million in my home State of Florida.   These visits are not just from Americans, but also from people all  around the world who came to see the natural wonders America has to  offer.   In 2017, national parks contributed $35.8 billion to the Nation's  economy and $613 million to Florida's economy, and they supported  306,000 jobs nationwide. Yet, today, many are closed or short-staffed,  and a diminished law enforcement presence puts the well-being of  visitors and wildlife at risk.   This is not the only major consequence of President Trump's and  congressional Republicans' efforts to block funding for the shuttered  agencies that would be restored by this legislation.   EPA has stopped making inspections of drinking water systems,  hazardous waste management sites, and chemical facilities. During the  last long shutdown in 2013, EPA stopped inspecting more than 1,200  sites of environmental importance and concern.   Now more than ever, we need the EPA to provide rigorous guidance and  support for State drinking water agencies.                                time  0945    No one knows this more than the residents of Flint, Michigan, whose  water is still not safe to drink. And closer to my home, Floridians in  Ocala face the contamination of their water by harmful fire retardants  used at the nearby fire college. Halting inspections leaves communities  like these more vulnerable. These cuts can truly impact the people we  are elected to serve.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill so that the  Senate can once again pass it and the government can be reopened.
