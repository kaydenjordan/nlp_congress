 Madam Speaker, if you were to attend any public event in  Rockingham County, it is likely that you would have the privilege of  meeting Pablo Cuevas.   Today, I rise to recognize Pablo because, after seven terms and a 30- year tenure on the Rockingham County Board of Supervisors, he has  recently retired.   Cuevas encapsulates the meaning of public service. An immigrant from  Cuba, Mr. Cuevas has not taken lightly the privilege it is to live in  America. Over the years, Pablo has given back to his community by not  only serving on the board of supervisors but also on the Broadway Town  Council, the Broadway Planning Commission, the Rockingham County  Planning Commission, and the James Madison University Board of  Visitors.   Some of his greatest accomplishments include constructing new school  buildings and expanding industries important to the area, such as  agriculture. His dedicated service on the board of directors at the  Virginia Poultry Growers Cooperative was invaluable to our region.   His passion for making his community a better place for all who live  and visit the valley is going to be sorely missed on the board of  supervisors. However, I am sure his wife, Elaine, and his daughter,  Erika, will welcome the opportunity to have such a good man back home.   Madam Speaker, I wish Pablo a happy retirement and thank him for  sharing his wealth of knowledge and passion for community service with  Rockingham County for the past 30 years.                            ____________________
