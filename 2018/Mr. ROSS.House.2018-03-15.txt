 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Colorado for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the rule and my underlying  legislation, H.R. 4061, the Financial Stability Oversight Council  Improvement Act of 2017.   Madam Speaker, when folks back home save for retirement, college, or  a down payment on a house, they expect that the system is both safe and  geared towards maximizing their benefit.   A beautiful thing about America's free enterprise system is how  anyone can participate in the marketplace, strengthen the economy, and  earn a dividend of the American Dream. That opportunity, however, is  not guaranteed, and, as lawmakers, we have a duty to protect it.   My bill will help us do just that by improving the Financial  Stability Oversight Council's process for reviewing nonbank financial  institutions for potential systemic threats. We must be clear that  simply designating more companies as systemically important financial  institutions doesn't make our system safer.   The FSOC can better serve the American people by working with  prudential regulators and the private sector to address threats to our  economy before they transform into calamities.   Would you say it is sufficient for firefighters just to identify a  house that is on fire?   Of course not. The key is preventing the fire in the first place.   This is the problem that we face with the FSOC's oversight of nonbank  financial institutions. The FSOC may be able to identify tinderboxes,  but fails to explain how they might be made less flammable, and,  instead, the Council defaults to what should be the heavyhanded  regulations of last resort.   To be sure, the FSOC has begun to recognize the benefits of  leveraging the expertise of prudential regulators, as well as providing  increased transparency. In recent years, they have taken steps to  improve the designation process, including the February 2015 guidance  providing increased transparency in the nonbank SIFI designation  process.   These 2015 reforms were welcome, and this legislation will codify  many of  [[Page H1622]]  them into law, as well as provide a path for a nonbank financial  company to eliminate risk rather than be designated.   Importantly, our legislation will ensure a company's primary  regulator has a meaningful role in the SIFI designation process. After  8 years, if we don't take steps to address the obvious shortcomings of  the FSOC, like the nonbank designation process, the regulator intended  to protect financial stability could very well become a liability.   The American Action Forum has found that additional capital  requirements resulting from a SIFI designation of asset management  firms could affect American retirees in the amount of at least $100,000  in potential savings over the lifetime of their investments.   That is why these reforms included in H.R. 4061 are critical to the  more than 90 million investors who rely on the services of asset  management firms to achieve their most important financial goals.   Companies must have a chance to de-risk before the FSOC can saddle  their customers with such extraordinary losses. This bill will give  them that opportunity. I am proud to have worked with my colleague and  friend across the aisle, Representative  John Delaney, on this strongly  bipartisan piece of legislation. I want to thank Chairman Hensarling  for his support and leadership in moving this bill through our  committee and onto the House floor.   This bill has 58 original cosponsors: 29 Democrats, 29 Republicans.  Our bill demonstrates that there can be broad bipartisan support for  increased transparency of the FSOC designation process.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this rule and  the underlying bill.                                time  1300
