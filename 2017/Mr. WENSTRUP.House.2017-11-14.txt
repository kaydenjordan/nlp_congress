 Mr. Speaker, providing for the common defense, that is  a constitutional duty that this governing body was tasked with. By  passing the NDAA, we are working to ensure that our country keeps faith  with those who bravely serve and their families.   While the world has grown more dangerous, our military has grown  smaller. Our men and women in uniform and their equipment have been  stretched thin after years of war, billions in budget cuts, downsizing,  and continued funding uncertainty. The 2018 NDAA reverses these trend  lines.   Passing this bill fully funds the 2.4 percent pay raise our troops  have earned so we can support our troops and they can support their  families.   This legislation brings attention to maximizing our military health  systems and includes a study on safe opioid prescribing practices for  our troops so our warfighters receive the best possible treatment.   Rebuilding our readiness along with acquisition reform, equipment  modernization, and increased end strength will better prepare our men  and women as they put on the uniform and fight for us. Our troops serve  so that we can sleep well at night, and they ask for nothing in return.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the full House to vote in favor of the NDAA.
