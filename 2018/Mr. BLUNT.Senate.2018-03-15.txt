 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, in the next few days, we will begin to  debate this important bill on sex trafficking. This is something that,  for whatever reason, the country turned its back on for too long. As  the ways to communicate and the ways to offer so-called adult services  grew, the government and law enforcement didn't have the new tools they  needed to fight back.   This is a bill that Senator Portman and others have worked so hard  on, on this side of the building. We are actually taking up the House  bill. The principal sponsor of the House bill is Missouri Congresswoman  Ann Wagner, with whom I have worked closely and who has been a good  friend of mine--she and her family--for a long time.   When the House passed this bill overwhelmingly, Ann Wagner said that  they ``sent a clear message to trafficking victims: you are not alone,  and justice is no longer out of reach.'' It is hard to imagine a more  lonely place, I would think, than someone who is being trafficked, some  young woman, young child, boy or girl, who has fallen into the hands of  traffickers and who, for drugs or whatever reason, has been sold into  this or become dependent in a way that put them into this.   Congresswoman Wagner went on to say about this bill that ``FOSTA will  produce more prosecutions of bad actor websites and more convictions  and put more predators behind bars.'' She said: ``It will give victims  a pathway to justice and provide a meaningful criminal deterrent, so  that fewer businesses will ever enter the sex trade and fewer victims  will ever be sold.''   The whole idea that people are being sold to be used in whatever  terrible way someone else wants to use them is so offensive. The idea  that we have websites that people can go to that have some description  of some person who is helplessly in this system and how they would be  used--that is something Congress should stand up on. By voting for  Congresswoman Wagner's bill, the House has already done that.   On our side of the building, Senator Portman and others have worked  so hard to draw attention to the fact that we need to find time to get  this bill on the floor. Now we have a bill that has already passed the  House, and all we have to do is pass that bill and send it right to the  President, or we can make  [[Page S1760]]  some changes that Senator Portman and others may want to suggest, and  then we can send the bill back to the House, where hopefully it can be  dealt with in the same overwhelming way they passed it the first time.  Then we can get this bill on the President's desk and do exactly what  Congresswoman Wagner said this bill will do. It is time for us to do  everything we can to end this.   We would be foolish to think that one piece of legislation will end  this problem. By working with law enforcement, looking at trafficking,  looking at locations like the intersections of major interstate  highways, where it is easy to bring people, to pass people along to  somebody else, to get them to where not only are they disoriented, but  your actual contact with that person doesn't last very long before you  give them to somebody else or sell them to somebody else who could use  them in a terrible way--this needs to stop. I am confident the Senate  will pass this next week, and I will just say that it is about time.                            Funding the Government    Mr. President, also next week we are going to move forward on an  appropriating process that has gotten way out of control. I am glad the  leaders have decided to appoint a special committee to look at this.  The Presiding Officer and I are on that committee. We will be looking  at the budgeting process and looking at what has happened. Instead of  bringing these bills to the floor one at a time and letting every  Member of the Senate have an opportunity to amend any bill in any way  they want to as long as it deals with spending and as long as you don't  add new money--every amendment you want to come up with where you want  to take some money here and spend it here instead and have a debate  about why that should happen--that is what the Congress did for a  couple of hundred years, and it is time we did it again. This idea that  all the bills come together in one big, what we call an omnibus-- ``ominous'' might be a better word--an omnibus spending bill that  includes everything, plus all the legislation that it can possibly  carry, is not the way this process should work. It is the way this  process is going to have to work this year because we missed all of  those opportunities that are now behind us.   As soon as we get this done, we need to start on this year's process.  We know what the top-line spending number is going to be. There is  every reason to believe that this year's process could be a big step in  the right direction, but some guidelines from that special House and  Senate committee will do even more.   I would like to say, as the chairman of one of those appropriating  committees--the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education  Subcommittee--that one bill of the 11 left after the Defense bill is  decided on--that one bill has about a third of all of the money to be  appropriated of the discretionary money. Senator Murray, my counterpart  on the other side, and I have worked hard on this committee for 3 years  now. In the House, Chairman Cole and Congresswoman DeLauro, the chair  and the ranking member on that side, have worked hard as well.   These are big decisions to be made. These programs matter, but some  of them matter more than others, and part of our job should be and  needs to be setting priorities, doing things that increase the  commitment to the programs that are working and eliminate the programs  or change the programs that don't work. Hopefully, we will continue to  do more of that this year and even more of that next year.   Some of the programs touch the lives of so many Americans, such as  apprenticeship programs. Medical research clearly touches the life of  virtually every American and every American family. What we could do to  develop a flu vaccine that actually hits the mark every year instead of  misses the mark often, things we can do in special education--these are  all parts of this one part of the bill that Senator Murray and I and  Congressman Cole and Congresswoman DeLauro have been working on.   Frankly, everybody should have had a chance to work on this. I think  we know a lot about these topics. I think that our debate is a good  debate, but it is not nearly as good of a debate as if every single  Senator got to be a part of working on this, not just the three dozen  or fewer Senators who are on the Appropriations Committee.   There are a wide variety of programs here that need to be funded. I  want to spend just a few minutes talking about some of the priorities  that we are looking at that need to be part of this bill and create a  sense that this is really a process that matters.   First, we are on track to increase the third straight year of  significant increases for the National Institutes of Health and health  research. What do they do? In the last decade, we failed most of the  time to make any increase at all. In fact, 2 years ago, when I started  chairing this committee and Congressman Cole started chairing the  committee on the other side of the building, it had been 12 years since  there had been a one-penny increase in health research. During that 12  years, we figured out so much more about the human genome. We figured  out so many more ways to figure out how I am different from you and how  you are different from me and how that makes a difference and how  whatever is attacking my system we can fight back.   There was not one penny of an increase in 12 years. In fact, the  research people said that we were 22 percent below, in research buying  power 3 years ago, where we had been 12 years earlier. Young  researchers who had never gotten a research grant before weren't likely  to get one when they had less effective money to spend than they have  had for over a decade. So hopefully that 22 percent--our goal would be  to get most of that 22 percent back in 3 years. We have also already  restored 13 percent of it. I hope we have a big number next week that  gets us back to where we are--at least back to where we were in 2005 or  so.   We made a commitment at the end of the last century to double, in a  short period of time, the National Institutes of Health funding, and  then somehow we thought we were done. We would be done anytime there is  no more research to be done. We will be done as soon as we have  developed a cure for cancer and found out what to do about Alzheimer's  and determined what we can do to lessen heart attack risks and found  the answer to every orphan disease, diseases that only a few people  have. Let me tell my colleagues, we are a long way from doing that. In  the last 3 years, we have tripled the amount of dollars going to  Alzheimer's research. Without a cure for Alzheimer's or a way to slow  down the onset of Alzheimer's, the projection is that by 2050, we will  be spending twice as many tax dollars on Alzheimer's-related care and  dementia-related care as we are spending now to defend the country. If  I had said we would spend $1.1 trillion, I don't know about everybody  who is listening, but in my case, it is pretty hard to get a handle on  that. What does that really mean? How much bigger is that than $1.1  billion? Well, $1.1 trillion is twice what we spend to defend the  country. Every military base everywhere in the world, every ship, every  plane, every paycheck for every soldier, sailor, airman, marine; the  National Guard, the Coast Guard; training dollars--that is about $500- and-some billion, approaching $600 billion. We would be spending twice  that in today's dollars, in tax dollars--not what families would spend  to try to deal with the tragedy of Alzheimer's but twice that in just  tax dollars if we don't find something to do. A cure would be great.  Just figuring out how we could determine early, in an effective way,  that you were likely to get Alzheimer's and try to begin to delay the  onset of Alzheimer's so it either doesn't affect you at all because  some other health concern does or you get it a few years later. If we  could delay the onset of Alzheimer's by 5 years on the average, that  $1.1 trillion in today's dollars--in 2015--would be reduced by almost  half, by 46 percent. So knowing how to detect this--there have been  some great studies going on that have been funded in better ways over  recent years. This has continued.   I think what we are looking at in the Brain Initiative--the Cancer  Moonshot, as Vice President Biden referred to it--diabetes--again,  these diseases that maybe not very many people get are particularly the  diseases that the National Institutes of Health needs to be doing  research on because there is not much of an economic driver for private  [[Page S1761]]  sector research on a disease that almost nobody has. So a lot of the  money that we put into NIH research we specifically try to put in there  without any specific category, where we are saying: You take this  money, and you do what you think needs to be done, and we are going to  have oversight to talk about what you did. A bunch of Members of the  Senate and the House aren't going to try to become the research  deciders for the United States of America--and, by the way, for the  world--when you do that.   In this bill, we are also looking at the crucial fight on the opioid  epidemic. The President says it is a crisis, and he is right. It is the  No. 1 cause of accidental death in the country today. It has exceeded  car accidents as a cause of death in the country and in Missouri and in  many other States.   The last two funding bills have put almost an additional $1 billion  into opioids from where we were just 3 years ago, but the Presiding  Officer will remember that in the last continuing resolution, some  specific money--about $3 billion more--was given to this cause, and it  is the job of our committee and then the Congress to decide how to  spend that $3 billion.   We need more resources. There is no reason to think that the opioid  addiction epidemic, leading to heroin and other drugs, is slowing down,  so we need to do things that improve treatment and prevention efforts.  Prevention, obviously, is better than treatment, but if prevention  fails, we need better treatment systems than we have now.   We need to look for alternative pain medications that aren't  addictive. I will say that in the 1970s and 1980s, I am told, in  medical schools, they thought opioids weren't addictive. So we need to  be sure that when we have an alternative that seems to be nonaddictive,  that it really isn't addictive.   We need to think of the workforce needs and what happens when people  become addicted to pain medicine and their pain doesn't go away,  probably because their addiction doesn't go away. Then there is  behavioral health that impacts so many families and so many  communities.   If you are going to recover from opioid addiction, you have to have a  place to go. Too many programs and policies say: We will work with you  for 14 days. A lot of them say: We will work with you for 28 days--4  weeks. Not many people get this behind them in 28 days. So we are doing  that.   In this bill, we are also looking at ways to support students and  parents and teachers. Obviously, a safe environment--what can we do to  provide more flexibility to schools to spend the money they currently  have from the Federal Government to create a safer environment, and  what can we do to increase the money available for that?   We need to be doing things that prepare people not just for college  but for careers. If you can get a certificate that puts you to work in  a job you love quicker than you can get a college degree that maybe  doesn't do those two things--we ought to be thinking about whether our  post-high school dollars are equally available to both college and  other kinds of training.   We need to see that people have access to higher education. We are  doing that by increasing funding for the Pell grant--this is not a  loan; it doesn't have to be paid back--given specifically based on  economic need and performance in school. You have to stay in school;  you have to get passing grades. But in many colleges in my State of  Missouri--in community college and in several of our 4-year schools--if  you qualify for the full Pell grant, that is more than enough to pay  tuition, books, and fees.   If you are putting yourself through school or if you are returning to  school as an adult, if you are the first person in your family to  graduate from college, year-round Pell means that if you have something  working, you need to stick with it as long as you can, as quickly as  you can.   Summer break is always well-intended. For 10 years Pell didn't pay  for school in the summer; it does now, starting last year. This will be  the first year that students and colleges and universities can really  prepare for summer Pell. But if you don't break the rhythm you are in  where things are working for you, you are much more likely to graduate  from college than you would otherwise.   We need to be sure we prioritize funding for elementary and secondary  education grant programs so that they are fair across the country, so  that we are not only supporting STEM education, but we are also  supporting IDEA for students with learning disabilities, an obligation  the Federal Government has taken on itself.   We are going to have a chance next week to deal with this important,  long-awaited bill on trafficking. I think there will probably be one  vote that covers more things than it should on funding the government  for the year we are already in. But, as I have talked about today,  there are many reasons for Americans and American families to be  focused on the job we do. Frankly, we need to spend our time figuring  out how, in the future, the American people can watch the Congress more  closely and watch the Congress openly debate the priorities of the  government, which the government sets nowhere else quite the way it  does when it decides how to spend the money we have been entrusted  with.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
