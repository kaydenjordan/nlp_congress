 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3388, the SELF  DRIVE Act.   The bipartisan bill we are considering today is vital not only to all  Americans, but especially individuals with disabilities.   My wife, Sidney, and I have an adult son, Livingston, who has special  needs. He wants to go everywhere. He has a job Monday through Friday,  but he can't drive, so he is dependent on his family and friends to get  him around. In the disability community, the lack of transportation is  the number one obstacle to employment and security in society.   I previously introduced the Disability Mobility Advisory Council Act,  which creates a forum for individuals with disabilities to work with  manufacturers, suppliers, and regulators to identify impediments and  ways in which the needs of this community can best be met by self- driving car technology. I appreciate the chairman including the general  intent of my bill in the SELF DRIVE Act.   Self-driving vehicles can open the door for the disability community  to access new job markets and opportunities and to have an even more  active role in our society.   I urge support of this bill.
