 Mr. President, let me open my remarks by saying that  from the very beginning of this ill-starred healthcare misadventure the  Republicans have been on, Democrats have over and over again offered to  help and to participate. Over and over again, we have spoken to, for  instance, Chairman Alexander on the HELP Committee, saying: Give us a  shot. Try something. We can do this. You have talked all these years  about regular order.   How many times have we heard the majority leader say that regular  order is the way to go and talk about how important the Senate is  because it follows regular order? It looks as though all of that was  nothing but a lot of bunkum because when he had the chance to come here  and actually trust the Senate to work through regular order, what did  he do? The very first day, he jammed through reconciliation to open a  purely partisan pathway to undoing ObamaCare.   Well, people have discovered that a lot of what they thought was  their  [[Page S4145]]  good healthcare is ObamaCare. So people on Medicaid, people whose  private policies now don't have preexisting condition limits, caps on  how much can be spent in a year or in a lifetime, folks who will get  their money through the exchange, suddenly they have all discovered  ``Oh my gosh, that was ObamaCare. Don't take that away from me.'' That  is one of the reasons we see all of the groups who come here concerned  about healthcare lined up against this bill.   This bill, other than the creepy cabal of billionaires who are behind  it, doesn't have a friend. And it just shows how narrow the Republican  Party has now become that they will follow the creepy billionaires off  the cliff against the advice of so many respected American  organizations.   How about the American Cancer Society? The American Cancer Society  says that the Republican bill would leave patients and those with  preexisting conditions paying more for less coverage. They have come  out against the bill.   I have a constituent home in Rhode Island, and her name is Patricia.  She and her daughters live in a beautiful place in Rhode Island,  Wakefield, RI. Like a lot of people I have heard from, Patricia is  afraid. She is afraid that what this Congress is going to do is to  repeal the Affordable Care Act and let health insurers go back to  discriminating against people with preexisting conditions.   What is hers? Well, Patricia and her daughters have a genetic  mutation, and that genetic mutation increases their risk of cancer.  They would ordinarily be counting on the American Cancer Society to  argue for them, and sure enough, the American Cancer Society has come  out against the Republican health legislation.   Well, it got real for Patricia last year when her 34-year-old  daughter was battling breast cancer. Fortunately, her health insurance  covered her treatment, and it worked. She is now cancer-free. But  because of their genetic mutation, Patricia and her daughters will need  to be screened frequently for the rest of their lives. Under the  Affordable Care Act, these potentially lifesaving screenings are  covered, and Patricia and her daughters are not penalized for having a  preexisting condition. Why on Earth would you want to go back to a  world in which those two things weren't true?   Patricia wrote:         A genetic mutation is not caused by an unhealthy or       careless lifestyle, as some members of Congress seem to       think. You can do everything ``right'' and still end up with       cancer or another debilitating disease.    So she urged me to consider all the people who would be affected by  the new healthcare bill, not just looking out for the rich and the  healthy.   Another group who came out against this was the American Association  of Retired Persons, the AARP. This bill may have changed, but the  results are the same. The results are higher costs and less coverage  for older Americans. Why would you want to do that? And this isn't just  language from the AARP; it comes home again.   Lisa from Pascoag, up in northern Rhode Island--a bucolic, rural part  of Rhode Island--wrote to share her experience with the Affordable Care  Act. This is her and her husband's third year on their ACA plan. Like  many Rhode Islanders, they qualify for financial assistance to help  them afford their health insurance. You would think that would be a  good thing. Lisa thinks it is a good thing. She wrote to me that she  thanks God every day that they have quality health insurance they can  afford.   Her husband is a welder fabricator--a job that takes a toll. He has  had several blood tests this year and recently began seeing a  hematologist. Lisa knows that this type of specialty care would have  been out of reach for their family without their current coverage, and  so she is worried. She is frightened by the Republican health plan.   She and her husband are 56 and 62 years old. They are within AARP's  interests. And she understands that because of their age, under the  Republican plan, their premiums could go up five to eight times what  they are paying today--five to eight times what they are paying today-- and the tax credits that have been proposed, in Lisa's words, ``won't  cut it.''   Doctors know a little bit about healthcare, and the American College  of Physicians has come out in opposition. ``The BCRA . . . will not  preserve and improve essential coverage, benefits and consumer  protections, and access to care'' is their concern. Of course, why  would you want to listen to the doctors about healthcare when you have  a little pack of creepy billionaires who are telling you what to do?  Never bother to listen to the doctors.   Well, Judith from Riverside, RI, is a doctor. She is a physician who  works at a community mental health center in Providence. Judy told me  that she sees the benefits of the Affordable Care Act every single day.  She treats patients with serious mental illnesses, and they have what  she called ``tremendous'' healthcare and social service needs. Prior to  the Affordable Care Act, almost all of her patients were uninsured, and  she spent her days scrambling to try to find different avenues to get  them free care, to get them whatever they could scrounge. Since the  expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, she said, almost  all of her patients have health insurance and they are able to get the  medical care they need. As Judy put it, with all of their life  challenges, at least they don't have to worry that they can't afford  care.   Planned Parenthood is a favorite target of our Republican friends,  and Planned Parenthood is strongly opposed to these measures. Women get  a lot of their healthcare from Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood  said: ``With this latest version of TrumpCare, women will pay the  biggest price of all.''   Olive is a young woman living in Providence who shared her experience  with me about how Planned Parenthood has been a reliable source of  healthcare for her throughout her life. As a college student, Olive  went to Planned Parenthood for birth control and well-woman care. She  had a routine exam, and a doctor at Planned Parenthood found a lump in  her breast. Twenty years old and far from her family, Olive said she  was worried but never felt alone. Planned Parenthood connected her with  the followup care and testing that she needed. She was treated by their  doctors. Fortunately, the mass turned out to be benign, but Olive says  she is forever grateful to Planned Parenthood for their help to her  during a scary situation for a young woman.   Olive is still a patient at Planned Parenthood, and she even  volunteers at their health clinic in Providence. She knows firsthand  how important Planned Parenthood is for healthcare for millions of men  and women across the country--particularly women--and, like the other  people who have written to me, she is afraid of what will happen if  Republicans succeed in defunding Planned Parenthood.   Small business folks have spoken to me about this. There is a lot of  talk about how you need more freedom not to have insurance and freedom  to be told you can't have insurance if you are sick. That is not the  kind of freedom I think we really want to support around here. The  freedom we want to support is for somebody to be able to follow their  dreams, and over and over again, I hear from people who are able to get  free of being linked to their employer healthcare plan and go out on  their own because of the Affordable Care Act.   Laura is a small business owner in our capital city, Providence. She  and her husband own an architectural design and construction firm that  builds homes around Rhode Island. Construction is not a line of work  you want to be in without health insurance. Well, because of the  Affordable Care Act, Laura and her husband have affordable health  insurance and dental coverage, and they have it for the first time.  They can see the doctors they want to see, and their out-of-pocket  costs are reasonable.   The Affordable Care Act has allowed small business owners like Laura  and her husband to pursue their professional dreams, boosting our local  economy and creating jobs for others without having to risk their  livelihoods and life savings if an illness or an injury befalls them.   Just last night, I was in Narragansett, RI, and a woman came up to me  to say: When you get back down there, please fight for us on the  Affordable Care Act.  [[Page S4146]]    She said: The Affordable Care Act has given me two things. One, it  has given me my freedom. Because of the Affordable Care Act, I was able  to leave my employer-supported program and have the confidence to go  out on my own and become an illustrator.   Her business is so successful that she has actually started hiring  people to support her business.   She said: That freedom to be an entrepreneur, to succeed, would never  ever have happened if I had been chain-locked to my employer program  and did not have an affordable option like the Affordable Care Act  provides.   Second, she said: Once I did this, once I started my business, I then  went for checkups. I was able to get tests that I could not have gotten  before, and what they found was a tumor behind my eye. Luckily, it was  not cancerous, but had they not caught it, she said, I would have lost  my sight.   If you are an illustrator, being blind is a very tough proposition.  She said: I have my freedom, and I have my sight because of this law.  Sheldon, fight for me.   Janice from Cranston is the last person I will mention tonight. She  wrote in to share how important the Affordable Care Act has been to her  and her husband and how important our Rhode Island marketplace has been  for her.   She said: There may be marketplaces that aren't working in different  places around the country. Fine, go fix those. Don't mess with mine.   It is working in Rhode Island, and Janice is one of the beneficiaries  of it. She is now retired. She lives with her husband Bob in Cranston.  Before the Affordable Care Act, she tried to buy health insurance in  the individual market, and it was quoted to her at $800 per month--not  affordable to her, not with limited income like that. So Janice and Bob  have quality affordable insurance through Rhode Island's health  insurance exchange, and they are happy about it. Don't disrupt their  lives.   Janice actually told me that her health insurance premium actually  went down this year, and so she splurged with the savings and bought  dental insurance as well. That was a success. She wrote to me: ``I  wouldn't have been able to afford healthcare if it wasn't for  ObamaCare.''   Like so many of these other people who have written in, Janice says  that she and Bob are scared to death that they will lose their  insurance if the Affordable Care Act is repealed. She doesn't  understand how some Members of Congress can claim to care about their  constituents and still try to repeal their healthcare coverage. Janice  said: ``They have money and they have good insurance, and they must not  know what it is like for people like us.''   Well, we need to remember those real people out there who are getting  the Medicaid benefit, who are getting affordable insurance through the  exchanges and getting help with the premiums and the people who are on  private insurance but no longer have to face lifetime caps or annual  caps or preexisting conditions. Even people who are still on Blue Cross  have gotten a benefit from this. Why would we want to take that all  away?   The last thing I want to mention is this. Those are all personal  stories, and it is really important to remember that behind this creepy  billionaire effort to perform some kind of ideological experiment on  people by taking away their healthcare, there are actually real people  who are really going to suffer in their real lives, and it will have  been deliberately done to them by people here who simply couldn't say  no to the creepy billionaires.   There is another piece of this. It is a little more complicated, but  I will close on this.   I love to use this graph. I use it all the time. This axis of the  graph shows how long people live in different countries. The range is  from 72 to 86. This part of the graph shows how much people pay in  different countries for healthcare per year. Virtually everybody that  we compete with is right in here--Japan, Greece, United Kingdom,  Germany, and France. They are right in here. They do pretty well on  life expectancy, and here they are in this cross of the $2,000 to  $6,000 per year range. The most expensive other country in the world is  Switzerland, at $6,000 per year. Look at where the United States is. We  spend $8,500 per year--way more, double more than what the average is  of the other countries we compete against. For that we get super killer  life expectancy. I guess killer life expectancy isn't the right phrase  to use. But do you get great life expectancy on that vast expenditure  of healthcare? No. We compete with the Czech Republic. We compete with  Croatia. Part of what the Affordable Care Act did was to try to focus  on this.   Here is the punch line. One of the things we do in the Budget  Committee is that we look at things in 10-year chunks. If you look at  the 10-year chunk from 2018, which is this year right here, to 2027,  here is a 10-year period. What this graph shows is that, back here in  2010, the Congressional Budget Office did a prediction of what the  healthcare costs for the country was going to be in this 10-year  period. They said this is how much we are going to have to spend on  Federal healthcare.   What happened is that we passed the Affordable Care Act and costs  started to go down. They came in below expectations. Around here, they  rebooted the test, and they did a new projection based on the new  information for this same 10-year period. As you will notice, the costs  that we have projected for that 10-year period from 2018 to 2027,  inclusive, have fallen. They have fallen by $3.3 trillion.   If you want to talk about savings on our debt and deficit, if you  want to talk about savings in healthcare, this red line was projected  before the Affordable Care Act, and the green line--the difference--was  the projection after the Affordable Care Act was law and after the  results began to come in.   I can't promise you that every single one of those $3.3 trillion in  savings was a direct result of a provision in the Affordable Care Act,  but when we have delivered $3.3 trillion in savings, why would we never  want to talk about that? Why would we want to put any of that at risk?  Why would we want to go back to the preexisting condition of this  prediction and pile $3.3 trillion back into that out-year period? It  makes no sense.   So whether you are a person who has constituents who are real and who  are going to suffer, who are going to suffer in real life as a result  of the decision and the vote that you cast tomorrow, or whether you are  a propeller-headed budget hawk who just wants to figure out how you can  reduce America's costs, why would you vote for a bill and put any of  this at risk? Why the fear of your constituents? Why the $3.3 trillion  in savings? It makes no sense.   I will end where I began. If people will come to their senses and  want to do this in a bipartisan fashion, during regular order--boy, did  we hear a lot about regular order until regular order wasn't wanted any  longer--we are here. We want to work with you. There are tons of ideas  out there. We can work to improve the healthcare system for the real  people in the real world, and not just do what we are told by a cabal  of creepy billionaires who are yanking the chain of the Republican  Party.   With that, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.
