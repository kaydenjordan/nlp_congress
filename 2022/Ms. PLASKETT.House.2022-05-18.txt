 Mr. Speaker, this Sunday, in the State in which I was  born and raised, New York, a man drove 3 hours and 200 miles to  terrorize members of a local Black community. This man shot 13 people,  11 of which were Black.   This was not a random act of violence. This was a domestic terrorist  attack, an act of hate ignited by replacement theory rhetoric that is  fueled by white supremacists, FOX News, and, indeed, some of my  Republican colleagues.   This false, ignorant, race-baiting theory, called the great  replacement, has been used in multiple race-based domestic terrorist  acts, including the synagogue attack in Pittsburgh and the El Paso  shooting attack in 2019.   There are a number of my Republican colleagues who spew this vile and  venomous rhetoric. The silence of Republican leadership and their ranks  in condemning this rhetoric that is not just ripping our country apart  but contributing to the death of Americans shows that they are no  longer the party of Lincoln or even the party of Ronald Reagan.                            ____________________
