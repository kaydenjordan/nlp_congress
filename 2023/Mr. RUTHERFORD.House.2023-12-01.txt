 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with great pride to honor  five students from my district who were selected to perform at the 2023  National Youth Orchestra.   Each summer, Carnegie Hall's Weill Music Institute invites some of  the brightest young musicians from across the country to travel the  world in a free, multi-week training residency with world-class  professional musicians.   The National Youth Orchestra participates in a platform to shine on a  global stage. Today, I recognize five of the 2023 National Youth  Orchestra participants from my district.   They are Beckett Miles from Jacksonville; Leila Warren from Ponte  Vedra Beach; Nelson Keakopa from St. Johns County; and Luke Valian  Malobay from Jacksonville; and Theodore ``TJ'' Shistle from  Jacksonville.   Thanks to countless hours of practice, determination, and dedication,  these students have participated in performances which have touched the  hearts of audiences around the world and demonstrated an outstanding  proficiency, grace, and commitment to excellence.   On behalf of Florida's Fifth Congressional District, congratulations  to each of these young musicians for their contribution to the field of  music performance, their passion for their craft, and their willingness  to share their talent.   Mr. Speaker, our community is behind them as they go on to accomplish  their future accolades.                            ____________________
