 Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Pallone for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the TEACH to Combat Addiction Act,  which I joined with my friend from Ohio, Representative Bill Johnson,  in introducing.   One of the biggest challenges that is facing us in the midst of this  opioid epidemic is the lack of high-quality addiction treatment in many  parts of our country.   Only one in five individuals with opioid use disorder is able to  access any type of treatment. In many instances, individuals struggling  with addiction can be placed on waiting lists for months or years  before they are able to see an addiction professional. That is simply  not right.   When we place barriers and roadblocks between patients and their  care, we know that these delays can be deadly. We need to move toward a  system of treatment on demand so that, when an individual is crying out  for assistance, when that person has that moment of clarity, there is a  helping hand ready to meet them.   This legislation helps us in a way that moves us in that direction by  investing in our addiction infrastructure. The TEACH to Combat  Addiction Act would create centers of excellence in substance use  disorder education that would be charged with developing and  disseminating model curricula to train our next generation of medical  professionals on the practice of addiction.   Empowering our healthcare workforce to better understand and  effectively prevent and treat substance use disorder will yield  dividends in our fight against the opioid epidemic.   I am proud to work with Representative Johnson on this critical  legislation that will strengthen the tools and information we use to  educate the next generation of healthcare professionals, and I strongly  urge all Members to support this critical legislation.
