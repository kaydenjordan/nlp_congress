 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  DeFazio) for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, as we in California and the West prepare for more  scorching wildfires, the Southeast is in the heart of hurricane season,  and the Midwest is still drying out from historic flooding. Across the  country, natural disasters have taken the lives of loved ones,  destroyed livelihoods, and caused irreparable damage to communities and  businesses.   Disasters are becoming larger, more dangerous and frequent, and  significantly more expensive. According to the Federal Emergency  Management Agency, there have been more than 2,400 federally declared  disasters since 2000, totaling hundreds of billions of dollars in  relief aid.   However, when the Federal Government helps communities recover from  these disasters, it does not calculate one comprehensive number of how  much we spend on disasters per year. Those funds could come from 29  different accounts across 11 different agencies, which exacerbates  delays in disaster recovery and hinders future planning and future  accountability. That is why I introduced the bipartisan Disclosing Aid  Spent to Ensure Relief, or DISASTER Act with Representative Mark  Meadows of North Carolina.   This transparency bill is common sense. It requires the Office of  Management and Budget, OMB, to publish an annual total of disaster- related assistance categorized by disaster type, location, and purpose.   With this and other smart reforms Congress is considering today,  taxpayers will know where their dollars are going, and the Federal  Government can be a better steward of those resources and will be  better able to plan for the next disasters.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass this legislation today  before the next big natural disaster hits.
