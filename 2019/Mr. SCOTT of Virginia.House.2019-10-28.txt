 Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives Bonamici,  Stefanik, Lee of Nevada, Comer, Wild, and Johnson of South Dakota for  their work on this bipartisan bill.   I want to specifically recognize Ms. Bonamici, who serves as the  chair of the Subcommittee on Civil Rights and Human Services for the  Committee on Education and Labor. Because of her leadership, we are  here today to consider the Dignity in Aging Act and to reauthorize the  Older Americans Act and, thereby, support and invest in our Nation's  seniors.                                time  1445    Congress first passed the Older Americans Act in 1965, along with  Medicare, Medicaid, and other civil rights legislation as part of  President Johnson's great society.   Fifty-four years later, this act continues to support a range of  programs that now help 11 million aging Americans retain their  independence and avoid costly institutional care. This includes 3  million Americans who regularly use OAA services to address their basic  needs, especially food, transportation, and social interaction.   Unfortunately, the OAA funding has not kept pace with inflation and  the growing population of aging Americans. In 2010, the annual funding  was $42.95 per senior in today's dollars. Today, it is not $42.95, it  is only $27.25.   This disinvestment has weakened the OAA programs at a time when  services are in high demand. According to a 2015 GAO report, OAA  services fail to reach a vast majority of low-income Americans who  experience food insecurity.   The investments we make through this legislation will not only allow  us to help seniors, but also help us save money. OAA services allow  older Americans to delay or altogether avoid costlier care by promoting  healthier behaviors and promoting critical supportive services.   The bill funds OAA services at record levels. It focuses on the vital  role of family caregivers, as well as direct care workers, and allows  those with early onset Alzheimer's to benefit from the act.   As the number of older Americans continues to increase, the Dignity  in Aging Act is an opportunity for us to strengthen essential services  that allow millions of Americans across the country to age  independently and with dignity. I urge my colleagues to support the  Dignity in Aging Act of 2019.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  holding this Special Order and recognizing the legacy of Congressman  John Conyers. I want to join those who are honoring his legacy.   He served in Congress longer than any other African American. He  represented Michigan and the Nation for over 50 years. He was a  founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus, and he served as  dean of the House.   He was a giant in civil rights. He often bragged about being the only  candidate for elective office ever endorsed by Dr. Martin Luther King,  Jr.   Also, for many years Rosa Parks worked in his Detroit district  office.   As a legislator, he was a true champion of civil rights and leaves  behind a legacy of fighting for transformative change that continues  today. His five decades of service in Congress are marked by a core  fundamental belief in equity and justice for all.   For many years, I worked with Congressman Conyers on the Judiciary  Committee, and most recently, we worked together to address segregation  in our public schools. We also fought together for equity in education,  as well as criminal justice reform, voting rights, and breaking down  barriers to employment.   I want to send my condolences to his family, his loved ones, the  entire Detroit community, and all who are mourning the loss of a  lifelong champion for a better America.
