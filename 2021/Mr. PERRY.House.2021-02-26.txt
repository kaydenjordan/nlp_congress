 Mr. Speaker, we all want to help. This is the American  Rescue Plan--the American Rescue Plan. Somehow, $8.6 billion of the  American Rescue Plan is headed overseas.   This isn't a rescue plan. This is a grift. This is theft.   We are digging tunnels. We are building bridges. That has nothing to  do with the pandemic. Ninety percent of this money goes everywhere but  the pandemic.   I mean, it is not going to help schools. It is not going to help  people who have been put out of their jobs. It is not going to help  people who need a vaccination or healthcare, none of that.   Ninety percent of about $2 trillion, this is a payoff. It is payoff  to political friends. That is why it is partisan, because we don't  think we should be paying off political friends. We want to help the  American people.   Mr. Speaker, this doesn't help the American people. This is a grift.  They are abusing people who are sick and have died and are hurting.  This is abuse. I vote ``no.''
