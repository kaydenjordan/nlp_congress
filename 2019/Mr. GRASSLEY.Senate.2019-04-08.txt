 Mr. President, for 1 minute before I speak about what I  came for a longer period of time to the floor to speak about, I want to  address a trade issue. Congress needs to pass the United States-Mexico- Canada agreement this year to give farmers and businesses the certainty  that they need and the certainty they deserve.   The past year has brought rising costs, lost markets, and uncertainty  for the farmers and businesses. We need to focus on creating  opportunities instead of erecting barriers. I would like to see a  resolution with Canada and Mexico on steel and aluminum tariffs, one  that would acknowledge that we need our allies to help us deal with the  source of the overcapacity problems, and that source of the problem is  China.   I urge President Trump to lift the 232 tariffs so that we can forge  ahead with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement and eliminate the  uncertainty that is present in the American market.    Mr. President, first, I ask unanimous consent that  Charles Pankenier, a detailee on my Senate Finance Committee staff, be  given floor privileges for the remainder of the 116th Congress
