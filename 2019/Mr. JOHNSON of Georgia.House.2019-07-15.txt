 Mr. Speaker, with respect to the remarks made  this weekend about the squad ``going back to where they came from,'' it  reminded me of some lyrics by Neil Diamond.       Far,      We've been traveling far,      Without a home,      But not without a star.      Free,      Only want to be free,      We huddle close,      Hang on to a dream.      On the boats and on the planes,      They're coming to America.      Never looking back again,      They're coming to America.    And it ends with:       They're coming to America.      They're coming to America.      They're coming to America.      They're coming to America.       Today, today, today, today, today.      My country `tis of thee,      Today,      Sweet land of liberty,      Today,      Of thee I sing,      Today,      Of thee I sing,      Today.    That is the America that we know, and we are all here contributing to  what makes America America, and I thank the body for listening.                            ____________________
