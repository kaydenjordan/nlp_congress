 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with great  concern for our Nation's current economic trajectory.   Inflation is spiraling out of control, unemployment numbers continue  to disappoint, and millions of small businesses are unable to fill job  openings. This pattern is increasingly alarming; and for anyone who is  paying attention, it is not a surprise.   The Biden administration's plan to throw money at problems is failing  the American people. This so-called rescue plan is stunting our  economic recovery and impeding our Nation's comeback from the COVID-19  pandemic.   As President Biden makes even more plans to squander our taxpayer  dollars, prices are skyrocketing. American families are experiencing  this firsthand. As they see every day, the staggering 5 percent  increase in inflation is affecting nearly everything, including  essentials. Together, food and energy prices have increased nearly 4  percent. And with the current cost of materials, not even the kitchen  sink is safe.   At home in Pennsylvania, no one is shocked that gas is more than 50  percent more expensive today than a year ago. Our Commonwealth already  has one of the highest gas taxes in the Nation, burdening workers and  families alike. We cannot afford to keep paying more at the pump.   For hardworking families in Pennsylvania and around the country, the  cost of inflation is real. It is real at the grocery store. It is real  at the gas pump. It is real at the hardware store and at the local  diner. It is real for every Pennsylvanian every day of the week.   As a nation, we cannot ignore the sound and source of this alarming  trend. This is rooted in President Biden's and the Democrats' broken  economic agenda. From higher taxes and fewer jobs, to more regulations  and burdens on American industries, their plan is not working.   Day after day, we see more evidence of this. Just last week, the  developers of the Keystone pipeline stopped this project after the  Biden administration effectively eliminated its opportunity to succeed.  Not only will this decision hinder America's energy independence and  security, it is also killing family-sustaining jobs for American  workers.   The Biden administration already killed the pipeline. What will be  next?   As inflation rises, the unemployment rate remains disappointingly  high and our work force is suffering. This should be a major warning to  all of us that we must stop this trend now. We cannot afford to stay  entrenched in President Biden's 1970s-era economic crisis.   We must advance pro-work, pro-growth solutions that will jump-start  America's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, and it starts with  getting Americans back to work, supporting our small businesses, and  strengthening the workforce. It also requires ending the current  administration's infatuation with Big Government intervention.   The American people don't want more of the same. We simply cannot  afford more of it. This is a time to invest in American workers, to  promote the dignity of hard work, and restore our Nation to the path of  recovery.                             National Dairy Month     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and  celebrate a truly essential industry at home in Pennsylvania and around  our country.   Dairy farmers go to work every day of the year to produce safe and  healthy food for all American people. Despite mounting regulations and  obstacles, these hardworking men and women continue to persevere.   Dairy products, including nutrient-rich whole milk, are good for our  kids and good for our families, and they are essential for our region's  economy.   I have the distinct privilege of representing nearly 20 percent of  Pennsylvania's dairy farms, which are home to more than a quarter of  our Commonwealth's dairy cows.   This robust industry is a key part of our local community and our  economy. It is truly my privilege to stand up for dairy farmers and to  serve as their voice here in Congress as we seek to eliminate barriers  to the dairy industry's success.   As we mark National Dairy Month, I thank dairy farmers in  Pennsylvania and across the country for their steadfast dedication to  our communities and to American families.                            ____________________
