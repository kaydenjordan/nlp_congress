 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, the Senate begins this week with votes  to confirm two more highly qualified Biden nominees--one to serve in  his administration and another to serve on the Federal bench.   First, we will vote to confirm Mr. Douglas Parker to serve as an  Assistant Secretary of Labor for OSHA. A veteran of the Labor  Department from the Obama administration, Mr. Parker will be the first  Senate-confirmed OSHA head since the Obama Presidency.   He has a proven track record of protecting everyday Americans in the  workplace--more important now than ever before--and I look forward to  his confirmation later today.   The fact that the previous administration left OSHA empty for 4 years  shows how little they cared about worker safety and protecting our  workers, as many of them often do difficult jobs.   Second, the Senate will also proceed to the confirmation of a truly  outstanding judicial nominee, Myrna Perez, to serve as circuit judge  for the Second Circuit, which includes my home State of New York. It is  a good day for the Second Circuit and for the entire Federal judiciary.   If confirmed, Myrna Perez would be a remarkable, remarkable addition  to the bench. She would be the only Hispanic jurist to sit on the  Second Circuit and the first since Justice Sonia Sotomayor.   And just as I was proud to support Justice Sotomayor's nomination--I  even suggested her name for the Supreme Court to President Obama, a  fact I am proud of--I am also, today, proud to champion Myrna's  elevation to the bench.   Myrna's life was the embodiment of the American dream. The daughter  of Mexican immigrants, she grew up in San Antonio, TX, where her father  was an Army veteran who worked as a consultant with Bexar County, while  her mother worked in the post office.   As Myrna herself will tell you, growing up in a family of immigrants  often meant breaking through linguistic, cultural, and racial barriers.  And of all places, perhaps nowhere else did these barriers leave an  important imprint on Myrna than when her aunt took her to the polls on  election day. It was there where Myrna realized how an election system  built from Byzantine rules shut out countless citizens from the  political process. This experience instilled in Myrna a thirst for  making our democracy work for all, and that has become her life's work.   After graduating from Yale, Harvard, and Columbia, Myrna eventually  joined the Brennan Center for Justice, becoming the director of its  Voting Rights and Elections Program. Over the course of her career,  Myrna has become one of the Nation's top voting rights and elections  lawyers, playing a key role in making sure Americans could vote safely  in the 2020 election. She also has fought unlawful purges of voting  rolls, spoken out against long wait times at polling locations in  diverse neighborhoods, and has played major roles preparing six amicus  briefs before the Supreme Court, including one for the Shelby case in  2013.   But Myrna's qualifications are not limited to her experience as a  voting rights litigator. She is also a brilliant attorney with  experience in fair housing law, disability rights, and employment  discrimination. In the words of one former colleague, her skills as a  lawyer are simply ``off the charts.''  [[Page S7324]]    The cupboards of the Federal judiciary have long been filled with  attorneys who have taken the traditional route on their way to the  bench--a big law firm, corporate experience, prosecutorial experience.  Many of those jurists have done commendably on the bench, and I have  been proud to support many of them over the years. But Myrna Perez  represents something different, something wonderfully different: a  sorely needed boost in both the personal and professional diversity of  the Federal bench.   Especially now, we need more election lawyers in black robes. We need  more Federal defenders in black robes. We need more immigrants and  civil rights lawyers and diverse candidates assuming positions on the  bench. We need, in other words, for our courts to reflect the rich  mosaic that is the American people. With Myrna Perez's nomination, I am  glad we are taking a step closer to that goal, and I hope she is  confirmed later today.                            ____________________     Madam President, now, in addition to Myrna Perez's  nomination, I have also filed cloture on five additional judicial  nominations, which we will begin working on tomorrow. It is my hope  that we can work to process these nominees through the Chamber quickly.  They are all outstanding individuals with proven records of fidelity to  the rule of law.   As we keep making progress on many pressing issues to help the  American people, Senate Democrats will also continue working swiftly to  fill judicial vacancies with qualified, mainstream jurists who, again,  add to the bench's diversity, both demographic and occupational. All  year long, that is precisely what we have done.   This year, the Senate has already confirmed the first Native American  and Muslim Americans to the Federal bench, as well as multiple civil  rights attorneys, public defenders, voting rights experts, and more.  This is how we work to strengthen not only diversity in our judiciary  but the public's trust that it truly represents all Americans.                            ____________________     Now on Build Back Better, we had a productive weekend as  we continue to close in on a final agreement for President Biden's  Build Back Better plan.   Yesterday morning, I traveled to Delaware to meet with the President  and Senator Manchin about our agenda. It was a very good meeting. I  thank the President for his leadership, and I also thank my colleagues  in both Chambers for their shared commitment to getting this  consequential and desperately needed legislation across the finish  line.   No one ever said passing transformational legislation like this would  be easy, but we are on track to get this done because it is so  important and it is what the American people need and what they want.  The progress of last week illustrated that if we stick together and  work toward finding that legislative sweet spot, then we can get big  things done for the American people.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, before I get into the procedural stuff,  I just want to say what a great judge Myrna Perez will be, so I am so  glad that she passed tonight. She is an amazing person, an amazing  history: one of the leading voting rights lawyers in America and will  be the second Latina on the Second Circuit, the first being Sonia  Sotomayor.   So it is a very good, good vote.                            ____________________     Now, Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.
