 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 290) to provide for transparent licensing of commercial remote  sensing systems, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 290         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Commercial Remote Sensing       Amendment Act of 2023''.       SEC. 2. ANNUAL REPORTS.         (a) Deadlines.--        (1) In general.--Section 60121(c) of title 51, United       States Code, is amended by striking ``120'' and inserting       ``60''.

(e) Sunset.--Section 60126 of title 51, United States Code,       is amended by striking ``September 30, 2020'' and inserting       ``September 30, 2030''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include  extraneous material on H.R. 290, the bill now under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 290, the Commercial Remote  Sensing Amendment Act.   I introduced this bipartisan legislation last Congress and that  measure passed the House by a voice vote. I reintroduced the same bill  this year, along with my colleague, the ranking member, Ms. Lofgren. It  updates the reporting requirements for NOAA's Office of Commercial  Remote Sensing Regulatory Affairs so that Congress can monitor how  regulations are impacting the growth and improvement of the commercial  remote sensing industry.   Remote sensing uses data collected from satellites to produce images  of the Earth. It has become a critical resource for fields like  agriculture, finance, trade, and energy.   For instance, imagery and data from commercial remote sensing allows  us to improve crop production by helping farmers more efficiently apply  water and fertilizer. It informs future commodity prices by actively  monitoring weather and crop health.   Commercial remote sensing also improves our ability to prepare for  and respond to natural disasters by informing flood plain mapping,  tornado tracking, and drought monitoring, topics that are very  important to my constituents in Oklahoma.   It can also be helpful in humanitarian relief efforts and monitoring  treaty compliance, among other applications.   As you can see, commercial remote sensing provides us with critical  information for many important applications. This technology is  constantly evolving, and the industry is seeing tremendous growth.   To effectively support and manage remote sensing activities, it is  critical that Congress receives timely and comprehensive reports so we  can evaluate the state of the industry and how regulations are  affecting this growth.   The Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act of 2015 established a  reporting requirement from the Department of Commerce on the status of  commercial remote sensing licensing and regulation. This requirement  expired in 2020.   H.R. 290 will reinstate that reporting requirement and keep Congress  informed of agency actions, their impact on licensees, and the state of  the commercial remote sensing industry. These reports to Congress will  give us the information we need to ensure that the U.S. remains the  global leader in this important field.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 290 is a no-nonsense, bipartisan bill that will  help ensure that the U.S. remains the global leader in the commercial  remote sensing industry.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Lofgren for joining me in  advancing this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H496]]         Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, as I have said previously, commercial remote sensing  provides us with critical information related to a number of fields,  like agriculture, finance, trade, energy, and more. This, in turn,  allows us to be better stewards of our resources.   H.R. 290, the Commercial Remote Sensing Amendment Act will help us  ensure that Congress receives the updates necessary to monitor  industrial regulations. By updating these reporting requirements, we  can ensure that the U.S. remains the global leader in an important  field.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  thank the ranking member for her help in this effort.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 342) to amend the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to require reporting  relating to certain cost-share requirements, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 342         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Cost-Share Accountability       Act of 2023''.       SEC. 2. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.         Section 988 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C.       16352) is amended by adding at the end the following new       subsection:        ``(g) Reporting.--Not later than 120 days after the date of       the enactment of this subsection and at least quarterly       thereafter, the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on       Science, Space, and Technology and Committee on       Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the       Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and the Committee       on Appropriations of the Senate, and shall make publicly       available, a report on the use by the Department during the       period covered by the report of the authority to reduce or       eliminate cost-sharing requirements provided by subsection       (b)(3) or (c)(2).''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include  extraneous material on H.R. 342, the bill now under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 342, the Cost-Share  Accountability Act  [[Page H497]]  of 2023 introduced by my friend, Representative Obernolte.   H.R. 342 is a good-government bill that does exactly what it says it  will: it improves accountability.   When making awards, the Department of Energy is subject to cost-share  requirements for most research, development, demonstration, and  commercial application activities.   DOE can modify or eliminate those requirements when necessary, an  authority which has been critical to supporting and developing new  technologies.   This bill is very simple. It requires DOE to submit a quarterly  report to Congress describing the instances where they have modified or  waived those cost-share requirements. The bill also makes those reports  publicly available.   H.R. 342 doesn't prevent DOE from waiving cost-share requirements. It  just ensures that those decisions are made public. This transparency  and accountability is important because it allows us to ensure we are  making the best possible use of taxpayer resources. It is a smart,  bipartisan policy.   I thank Representative Obernolte and Representative Foster for  working on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Obernolte).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 342 will create more transparency around  the DOE awards and help us better oversee our investments in cutting- edge energy technologies. It is bipartisan, commonsense legislation,  which is why it passed the House on suspension last year.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill once again,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
