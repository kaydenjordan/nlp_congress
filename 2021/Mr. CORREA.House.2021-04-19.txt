 Mr. Speaker, the SAFE Banking Act can be summarized in  three basic points. First of all, this measure does not legalize  anything at the State level. Today, 47 States, four U.S. territories,  and D.C., representing 98 percent of the U.S. population, have  legalized cannabis in one form or another.   Second, this is essentially a States' rights issue. This measure  essentially says that when a State legalizes cannabis, the Federal  Government will respect that decision when it comes to banking.   Finally, this measure is essentially about helping our local police  officers back home do their job safely and effectively. We already give  our local police officers the impossible job of taking care of the  homeless and the mentally ill, and now we are asking our police  officers to protect the legalized cannabis industry, a cash business,  from those criminals that would prey upon them. This just doesn't make  sense.   Today, because of Federal law, the cannabis industry can only operate  on a cash basis. They pay their Federal, State, and local taxes with  cash. Let me repeat. Today, the cannabis industry pays their Federal  taxes with cash. They pay their employees with cash. They pay their  rent with cash, and they pay their bills with cash. This is no way to  keep our streets safe.   Let's help our local police officers keep our communities safe. Let's  get the cash out of the cannabis industry, and let's pass H.R. 1996.
