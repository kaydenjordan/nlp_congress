 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Visclosky for his  hard work here.   I rise in support of this en bloc package, which contains two  amendments I introduced.   My first amendment will give all of Congress access to weekly updates  on inventory in our Strategic National Stockpile. We all need current  information on our Nation's supply chain and our inventory of PPE,  vaccine materials, and supplies as we respond to this crisis,  especially for my district, which has been hit so hard in northern New  Jersey.   My second amendment prioritizes clean drinking water, because every  child should have access to lead-free water at school.   I am proud my other two amendments were included in other en bloc  packages to increase investment for broadband infrastructure, so we can  address the challenges facing underserved areas, especially as families  are working and learning online.   My final amendment, which has been adopted, supports improving our  Nation's manufacturing supply chain to address the challenges caused by  COVID.   I have worked closely with the New Jersey Manufacturing Extension  Program as we help ensure small and mid-size manufacturers in New  Jersey have the equipment they need.   Madam Speaker, I urge support for this bipartisan en bloc set of  amendments.
