 Mr. Speaker, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle  who believe that the Build Back Better Act is going to make this  country better are trying to sell snake oil to the American people.  There is an old saying, Mr. Speaker: You can fool some of the people  all of the time, all of the people some of the time, but you can't fool  all of the people all of the time.   Frankly, the American people--some of them--have seen the light, and  they understand that Build Back Better is going to bankrupt this  country and that is not the way most Americans want to go. So we will  see if the people who vote for Build Back Better have the real support  of the American people next year if that bill passes.   Mr. Speaker, this is National Apprenticeship Week, and it is fitting  that as the lead Republican on the Education and Labor Committee that  we talk about the importance of apprenticeships.   As we know, apprenticeships have been around since the beginning of  time and they have been much more used in other countries. They were  much used in our country for a long, long time. Then the numbers of  them decreased. However, in recent years more and more Americans have  found that apprenticeship programs are an effective option to help  achieve their career goals.    I have had people in my family go through apprenticeship programs,  and I know for a fact how valuable they are. These earn-and-learn  programs offer students and workers a viable path toward the American  Dream, and it is very fitting that we should celebrate National  Apprenticeship Week and highlight the apprenticeship programs across  the country.   However, unfortunately, the Biden administration is proposing to end  the program dedicated to expanding apprenticeships, cutting off this  important pathway to sustainable and rewarding careers. By ending  Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship Programs, or IRAP, President Biden  is hurting workers and businesses nationwide. This decision moves our  country backward and will keep many Americans from being able to  prepare for their future.   Instead of ending IRAPs, we should be working to inject innovation  and flexibility into the apprenticeship model so that more Americans  can get back to work and achieve the American Dream, no putting  roadblocks in their way. Unfortunately, it is becoming more and more  clear with every action of the Biden administration that the American  worker is always going to take a backseat in President Biden's America.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank him for leading this Special Order tonight.   Madam Speaker, the Biden administration's unprecedented OSHA vaccine  mandate is a massive power grab. This national diktat was recently  found likely to be unlawful by the Fifth Circuit and it stretches the  power of the Federal Government beyond recognition. Requiring employers  to be the vaccine and testing police and telling them who they can and  cannot employ is a bridge too far.   Further, this mandate will crush businesses with exorbitant costs  while exacerbating the worker shortage. Why would the Biden  administration make this crisis worse? It is clear that the Biden  administration is using this pandemic as an excuse to inflate the power  of the Federal Government as far as possible. That is what we must  resist.   To get our economy back on track, we don't need more crippling  mandates and regulations, we need to support workers and job creators.
