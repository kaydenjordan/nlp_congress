 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, on January 20, the Biden-Harris  administration will begin its work with a mandate secured by the  largest number of votes ever received by a Presidential ticket in  American history. Its task, of course, will be daunting. The darkest  days of the COVID-19 pandemic are, unfortunately, ahead of us. More  than 100,000 Americans are being diagnosed with COVID-19 a day, and  more than 1,000 Americans are dying.   Soon, thankfully, we will have an administration that actually  acknowledges this healthcare crisis--an administration that takes its  job seriously and that will listen to the counsel of scientists and  doctors and work to improve the lives of all Americans, regardless of  whom they voted for.   Already, the incoming administration is preparing to hit the ground  running. Yesterday, the President-elect announced his COVID-19 task  force, a group of the Nation's top public health experts and scientists  who will advise the incoming administration on policy.   Today, Senate Democrats will receive a briefing from one of  President-Elect Biden's scientific advisers, former Surgeon General Dr.  Vivek Murthy. I expect it will be the first of many conversations about  how the Senate and the incoming administration can work together to get  COVID-19 under control and on the retreat, because the truth is, the  executive and legislative branches are going to have to work together  in the coming months to crush this virus and put our economy back on  the right track.   Nearly 15 million Americans have now lost their jobs, and, by  extension, many of them have lost their healthcare coverage. Medicaid  enrollment has spiked across much of the country, adding new stress to  State programs already beleaguered by the demands of COVID-19.  Democrats have a plan, through the Heroes Act, to strengthen and secure  Medicaid for the duration of the crisis.   Congress should pursue a strong, comprehensive COVID-relief bill that  actually meets the needs of the American people. Yesterday, however,  the Republican leader suggested the Republican majority will continue  to pursue its policy of targeted relief--in other words, inadequate  relief. He seemed to suggest that the development of a possible vaccine  was actually a reason to pare back on aid to the American people.   Let's be very clear. Getting this country vaccinated will be a  massive undertaking, and while I share in the hope that yesterday's  news brings, we cannot pretend this pandemic is nearly over. Regardless  of this news, it is likely the coming winter months will be the worst  yet.   The Nation is suffering from the uncontrolled spread of the virus  now. With hospitalizations and fatalities on the rise all across the  country, hospitals and healthcare providers are again overwhelmed.  Temporary morgues are, once again, sadly, being pressed into service.   We all look forward to the day when vaccination is widely available,  but we do not have the luxury of waiting to grapple with the current  effects of this crisis until then. We have to act now to prevent the  immediate crisis that is coming this winter.   So while the incoming administration prepares to take on a resurgent  COVID-19, Congress must as well. Leader McConnell and Senate  Republicans must come to the table in good faith and work with us on a  bipartisan bill that meets the needs of all our country. The House, of  course, is Democratic, and the Senate needs a bipartisan bill to pass  something. We have to work in a bipartisan way, and we owe it to the  American people.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, I don't think many of  us expected President Trump to leave the Office of the Presidency with  grace--a quality he has not once demonstrated during his long career in  business or his very short career in public life. But the extent to  which the Republican  [[Page S6629]]  Party is legitimizing the President's assault on our democracy is  infuriating and deeply, deeply wrong.   The President is not merely bringing forward well-founded legal  challenges. He is not simply taking advantage of the ability to request  a recount in States where one is possible. He is declaring himself to  be the winner of an election that he lost. He is claiming to win States  that he lost. His legal team is filing scores of frivolous,  unsubstantiated lawsuits. He is undermining faith in our elections and  poisoning our democracy during one of the most delicate moments in our  constitutional system, something we treasure: the peaceful transfer of  power.   The President has fired the Secretary of Defense, threatening the  continuity of our national security policy because he is having a  temper tantrum. Not only does this put at risk a smooth transition in  one of the most sensitive and critical areas of our government, it  creates an opening for our adversaries to take advantage of instability  and inexperience.   The current Attorney General of the United States has made a show of  authorizing Federal probes into supposed election fraud, lending a  veneer of false credence to the President's delusions. It violates the  longstanding tradition of avoiding even the appearance of law  enforcement interference in our elections. Almost immediately, Attorney  General Barr's decision prompted the Chief of the Justice Department's  elections branch to resign in protest.   The Government Services Administrator, GSA, has still not signed the  paperwork necessary for the Biden transition team to begin its work.  And here in the Senate, the Republican leader and several Republican  Members are trying to give their President air cover.   Yesterday, in the same breath that Leader McConnell celebrated the  reelection of certain Republican Senators, he declined to congratulate  the winner of the Presidential election because the election results  have not been officially certified. The political right seems eager to  celebrate the results it approves of while delaying judgment and  casting doubt on the results it doesn't. Indeed, the Republican leader  could not even mention two words, ``Joe Biden,'' who, regardless of  what Republican Senators may think, will be the next President of the  United States.   Two Republican Members of this Chamber have called on their own  secretary of state--a fellow Republican--to resign for no other  apparent reason than the fact that President Trump did not win their  State. They allege the secretary of state did not deliver honest and  transparent elections. That is really a stunning charge in the United  States of America. That is the kind of thing you hear about in banana  republics and dishonest elections. Surely, U.S. Senators would have  some evidence that in the world's premier--premier--democracy an entire  State's election was not conducted ``honestly,'' as they say. Surely,  you must think that those Senators have incredible, substantial, and  weighty proof of such a scandalous and alarming allegation, but you  would wrong. Those two Senators provided no evidence--not even a  shred--to back up their claims.   Three lonely Republican Senators--three in total--have congratulated  the next President and Vice President of the United States on their  victory and called on the Nation to come together. The rest have been  silent or outright sympathetic toward the President's completely  unsubstantiated claims of election fraud.   So look, here is where we are. Every major media outlet, including  FOX News, has projected that Joe Biden will be the next President of  the United States, and Kamala Harris will be the next Vice President of  the United States--not because the media declared them to be but  because more than 76 million Americans voted them into office. There  has been no evidence of widespread voter fraud or any indication that  results might flip in not one but several States.   The country is ready to move on from 4 years of tumultuous and  incompetent administration. The institutions of our government will  ensure it on January 20, no matter what the current President claims.  But they cannot ensure faith in our democracy in the hearts and minds  of the American people. That is a project for both parties to confer  legitimacy on an election in which, yes, half the country will be  disappointed but after which the entire country must pull together.   Every day that goes by without the Republican Party acknowledging and  accepting the results of the election is another day Americans' faith  in our democracy declines                            ____________________     Mr. President, finally, on Veterans Day, tomorrow, we  will all proudly observe Veterans Day, a chance to honor our veterans-- heroes who come from every walk of life, every color and creed, joined  by a common love of country and an uncommon love for their fellow  Americans. This week, we say again thank you, thank you, thank you to  every veteran for their service.   Like so many things this year, Veterans Day will be different. We  cannot come together as we would normally do. We hold in our thoughts  and prayers the veterans across the United States whose lives have been  touched by this awful disease, and we give special thanks to many  veterans who work as teachers, healthcare workers, doctors, nurses, and  community leaders--the very heroes, in a different sense, who are  keeping our communities going during these tough times. We in the  Senate have a solemn responsibility to make sure they continue to get  the help they need.   Finally, it is always a little different when we observe a Veterans  Day in the aftermath of an election. We must never forget our  freedoms--to speak freely, to assemble peaceably, to choose our  leaders, and forge our destiny--have been secured, time and time again,  by the sacrifice of Americans who have worn the uniform.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
