 Mr. President, earlier this week, a Federal judge in  Washington, DC, outlawed the continued use of title 42 pandemic-related  authority for the expedited removal of aliens who enter our country  illegally. The judge found that the policy should be updated because  the COVID-19 pandemic has changed since 2020. I agree. The pandemic is  over. But the border crisis is not over. In fact, it is worse than  ever.   That is why I have introduced legislation that provides a far  stronger reason for invoking title 42 authority--the deadly drug  smuggling crisis at our southern border that is killing a record number  of Americans.   The Biden administration has dismantled our Nation's most effective  border security policies. When I led a group of Tennessee sheriffs and  mayors to the border this past April, Border Patrol agents in Laredo  told me that the Migrant Protection Protocols, which are also known as  MPP, or ``Remain in Mexico,'' were a painful illustration of the Biden  administration's destruction of these border security tools.  [[Page S6760]]    MPP required that migrants seeking asylum in the United States remain  in Mexico until it has been determined whether they were actually  entitled to asylum. The vast majority of those claiming asylum are not  entitled to it.   When MPP was implemented in 2019, the agents said it was like  flipping a switch because people stopped coming when they learned they  couldn't get in. Once the Biden administration halted this policy,  illegal immigration catapulted to record numbers.   In fiscal year 2021, more than 1.7 million known illegal border  crossings occurred--a new record. That record was short-lived, however,  because in fiscal year 2022 that just ended in September, nearly 2.4  million illegal crossings were documented, exceeding the 2021 record by  37 percent. And that doesn't take into account the got-aways. Last  month set a new record for October, with more than 230,000 illegal  aliens. These figures are just the crossings that the agents see and  document.   When I traveled to the border in April, Border Patrol agents told me  that title 42 was the last tool that they had to at least partially  stem the tide of illegal border crossings. If we allow a DC judge to  remove title 42 authority, our Border Patrol agents will have no tool  to stem the massive increase in illegal immigration that is certain to  follow. And that is why, given this recent court ruling, passing my  legislation today is imperative.   To illustrate, Border Patrol currently has capacity to process a  maximum of roughly 5,000 illegal immigrants per day. Right now, they  are already overwhelmed, processing nearly 8,000 per day. Predictions  from agents and former immigration judges are that, without title 42  authority, this number would likely double to between 15,000 and 18,000  per day.   This would overwhelm processing capability, and the border would  effectively cease to exist. Such a surrender of American security and  sovereignty is intolerable.   The Department of Homeland Security itself said in response to this  week's court decision:         We will prepare for an orderly transition to new policies       at the border. We know that smugglers will lie to try to take       advantage of vulnerable migrants, putting lives at risk.    Yes, it is true that we need policies to replace title 42, and it is  true that smugglers will use this court ruling to entice thousands more  migrants per day to cross the border illegally, which will risk lives  and will magnify the humanitarian crisis at our southern border in a  variety of ways.   If swift removal under title 42 is a possibility, would-be border  crossers may decide not to embark. But without title 42, there is  nothing left to dissuade them.    Further, without title 42, the drug cartels send migrants across the  strategic points to bog down Border Patrol agents with paperwork  processing. And the paperwork processing timeframe is five times longer  without title 42. Do the math. Removing title 42 will collapse what is  left of our Border Patrol's capacity. And with Border Patrol bogged  down further, the cartels will use the resulting enforcement gaps to  move their fentanyl, which they produce with the help of the Chinese  Communist Party, across our southern border. We cannot allow more  enforcement gaps for deadly drug smuggling.   That is why I have introduced legislation to add drug smuggling as an  additional basis for title 42 authority. It is called the Stop Fentanyl  Border Crossings Act. Overdoses have become an epidemic in America.  This legislation would allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services  to use title 42 to combat substantial dangerous drug trafficking across  the border. This bill would give Border Patrol a necessary tool to  focus on stopping drug traffickers.   According to the CDC, drug overdose deaths reached another record  high last year. Nearly 107,000 Americans died, many from fentanyl and  other synthetic opioids coming across this southern border. We  desperately need title 42 to aid in the fight against this drug  epidemic.   Without this authority, the recordbreaking border crisis, and the  deadly drug overdose crisis that it fuels, will become unimaginably  worse.   Therefore, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions be discharged from further  consideration of S. 3959 and the Senate proceed to its immediate  consideration; further, that the bill be considered read a third time  and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table.    Mr. President, my Democratic colleague is objecting to  legislation that simply gives the Secretary of Health and Human  Services the authority to limit border crossings when necessary to  combat substantial, dangerous illicit drug smuggling.   It doesn't provide authority to stop all asylum claims. It only  applies where substantial illicit drug smuggling is endangering public  health. More than 100,000 Americans are dying annually of drug  overdoses, many of which result from drug smuggling at our southern  border.   The legislation isn't a mandate. It is a tool to help save American  lives whenever that is possible. Everyone acknowledges that an already  recordbreaking crisis will get far worse without title 42. American  lives and communities hang in the balance. Yet my colleagues across the  aisle are categorically opposed to a commonsense policy to address this  glaring problem. It begs the question: What do Democrats propose that  we do in response to this title 42 ruling? refuse to deal with the  problem? hope this crisis won't spiral further out of control? These  are not acceptable answers.   More broadly, is any volume of illegal immigration or drug overdose  deaths adequate to get this administration to secure the border? How  much longer will we allow our broken border policies to be manipulated  by a criminal alliance between the Chinese communists and the billion- dollar Mexican drug cartels that are shipping huge quantities of deadly  illegal drugs into the United States across our southern border?   I yield the floor.
