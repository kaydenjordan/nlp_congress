 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman and the gentlewoman  from California for her leadership.   Access to safe and legal abortion is about trust--trust in those  seeking reproductive care, trust that they will know what is best for  their bodies and their families, and trust in them to make a choice  that only they can make about their own future.   What we are seeing in Texas and in the Supreme Court is what happens  when government wants to make the choice for you, and I am hearing from  Floridians who are terrified that the Governor of Florida wants to  bring Texas-style tyranny to the Sunshine State.   Not on our watch. Vote ``yes'' on the Women's Health Protection Act.
