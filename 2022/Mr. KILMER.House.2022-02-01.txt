 Mr. Speaker, the word ``legendary'' gets thrown around in  this place a fair amount, but back in my hometown of Port Angeles,  Washington, we have had the opportunity to see a local legend in action  for seven decades.   Scooter Chapman has been the voice of Port Angeles sports for  decades, working at radio KONP since the 1950s. He has been a  sportscaster, a referee, an umpire, but he has been more than that. He  has been someone who cared about young people and their success. He has  been someone who built pride in our community, and for every PA High  Roughrider, pride in his or her school.   Back in 1992 I had the honor of presenting him a letterman's jacket  on behalf of our graduating class. In the decades since, he has racked  up more honors, recognitions, and hall of fame entries than you could  possibly count.   Now, 30 years later, I am honored to recognize Scooter Chapman from  the floor of the United States House of Representatives, as he prepares  to sign off from KONP and hang up his microphone after 70 years at the  station.   Scooter Chapman has touched so many lives. He has made our community  stronger. Mr. Speaker, he is, in a word, legendary.                            ____________________
