 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I think we need to ask ourselves: What is this bill all  about? Why are we here today?   H.R. 6311 is the final of three bills regarding health savings  accounts and health taxes that we will be considering this week. I find  it sad we are not spending our time today addressing the most pressing  concerns of Americans struggling to make ends meet because of the  Republican sabotage of healthcare coverage.   Nothing in H.R. 6311, or any other bill we have considered this week,  undoes the ongoing harm caused by the actions of the Trump  administration or this Republican Congress.   For example, earlier this month, the administration created needless  confusion by refusing to make legally required risk adjustment payments  until, when there was major protest, it reversed course last night  under public pressure. But in June, the Justice Department refused to  defend protection for the 130 million Americans living with preexisting  health conditions.   Last fall, the President terminated cost-sharing reduction payments  for Americans earning 100 to 250 percent of the Federal poverty level.  The GOP tax bill gutted the individual responsibility requirement,  causing a 15 percent spike in premiums, according to CBO.   Recently, the administration again cut funding for navigator  organizations to just $10 million for the upcoming open enrollment  period. I saw at home what these navigator provisions meant to  nonprofit organizations that were reaching out to people who wanted  information and healthcare.   Cut, cut, cut is the administration's answer. And this Congress'  response to that administration action is zero, silence, silence,  silence.   These and so many other actions by Republicans have led to direct  increases in premiums and out-of-pocket costs for middle class  families.   Expanding HSAs and shifting more Americans into catastrophic  coverage, as H.R. 6311 does, will not meaningfully help middle class  families harmed by Republican sabotage of ACA. Instead, it will  primarily benefit wealthy Americans and large insurance companies.   According to data from the Joint Committee on Taxation, more than 80  percent of the tax benefit for health savings accounts goes to  individuals earning more than $100,000 annually. We pointed that out in  committee.   What was the response? Obfuscation, obfuscation. That is a fact and  analysis given to us by the Joint Committee on Taxation. So all these  crocodile tears for mainly middle class families, I think, are shown  for what they are.   Very few families with modest incomes can afford the high, out-of- pocket expenses required in order to participate in a HSA. Doubling the  amount that individuals can contribute tax-free--tax-free--as this bill  does, will make no difference to the millions of working families who  don't have thousands of dollars available to contribute to an HSA in  the first place.   I suggest that everybody go home and talk to the general public.   In addition, a 2-year delay of the health insurance provider fee will  have only a minimal impact on premiums. Indeed, this provision will  mainly benefit insurance companies, while adding more than $25 billion  to the deficit.   Not only do the bills we have considered this week not address these  pressing issues, they also recklessly add to the deficit. Republicans  have failed to produce even $1 for the enormous cost of these bills. So  I said to the chairman of the committee that I once chaired, I was  sometimes asked that question: Will you pay for it? And I said yes.   I asked the chairman: Will you pay for this? At first, it was said:  Well, we don't have to do that in committee. So I said: Will you do it  on the floor, yes or no? He said no.   So here we are. Although we do not yet have a final analysis from the  Congressional Budget Office or the Joint Committee on Taxation, past  estimates of similar provisions have shown us this:   H.R. 184, which would repeal the medical device tax, will cost about  $20 billion over 10 years.   H.R. 6199, which would expand HSAs to include over-the-counter  medications and gym memberships, will cost roughly $20 billion.   And this bill, which expands HSAs and delays a tax on the health  insurance industry, would increase the deficit the most. This is, in a  few words, a Risky Roskam bill that would cost up to $50 billion, $50  billion.   When all is said and done, our actions this week could add up to $90  billion to our Nation's debt, increasing pressure to cut vital programs  like Medicare. This comes just months after a tax cut bill that would  add an additional $2 billion to the debt.   So, look, we need to come and ask ourselves: Why are we here?   These bills will not likely pass the Senate or become law, so here we  are. We are going to recess, adjourn tomorrow for 5 weeks or so. I  think the reality is that these bills, which will not likely pass the  Senate, will not ever become law.   I think it is likely that they have a different purpose, and I think  that was described in a recent article in The Hill. I read it because I  want the public to question what we do, and I quote:   ``The bills on the House floor next week could give victories to the  bill  [[Page H7661]]  sponsors who are also vulnerable in November.'' The chairman of the  subcommittee, where I am ranking member, is facing, this article says,  ``a tough reelection race in his suburban . . . district.''   ``But overall, the measures slated for consideration are minor and  won't make a major dent in premiums, according to Joe Antos, a  healthcare expert at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute.''   I want to quote that again: ``These measures slated for consideration  are minor and won't make a major dent in premiums, according to Joe  Antos, a healthcare expert at the right-leaning American Enterprise  Institute.''    So I think that is really what this is all about. It is a political  exercise. It is aimed to help people who are in a vulnerable political  position. But that is not a reason to bring up these bills today, when,  as I described earlier, there are so many issues relating to healthcare  coverage.   The Republicans have undertaken these last months under this  administration to do everything they can to sabotage healthcare for  Americans. As a result, 3 million people less have healthcare  insurance. But ACA works so well that 20 million people received  healthcare coverage they did not have.   So, this is kind of a sad moment. We are turning this place into a  campaign entity. We should not be doing that when it comes to  healthcare coverage. We tried, in recent times, to say to the  Republicans, if you want to improve ACA, we are ready. Never has there  been any offer to do that. Instead, it was repeal, repeal, repeal. I  won't say that 55 times, but that is how often it happened. More  recently, it was sabotage, sabotage, sabotage. That isn't what we  should be doing for what is so dear to Americans, healthcare coverage.   It is a sad day, as I said earlier, that, here we are, when so much  needs to be done, and this, essentially, is a political exercise.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I have heard the so-called fact that more people have  HSAs than those who are covered by ObamaCare. That simply is not true.   ObamaCare includes expanded Medicaid. So if you want to talk about  more than in the exchanges, we can discuss that and argue it, but don't  come here and minimize the impact of ACA.   We worked hard on it. We meet so many people who have benefited from  what we Democrats did, and the public, more and more, is expressing  that. You were on the wrong side of history, and you are now on the  wrong side of public opinion.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes, or more if he would like, to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Higgins), an active member of our  committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Judy Chu), who is so active and there all the time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Doggett), a true fighter.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence), my colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, as I close, I think back some years ago when we were  working on ACA. It was one of our proudest achievements. The  Republicans, from day one, were determined to destroy it. ACA can be  made better, but destruction is not improvement.   This bill, when you put it together, is not only unpaid for, but  would be a step to try to undermine the basic thrust of the ACA, to  replace these basic provisions with something much less.   In a word, the Republicans are on the wrong side of history, and the  clock is ticking.                                time  1730    These bills, when you put them all together, essentially say, these  are another way to undercut ACA. This is a very, very weak--and I think  worse than a weak set of alternatives. They have never been able to  come up with a comprehensive bill, and this effort is the opposite. As  we have mentioned, relatively few people with lower income can access  these. So many of the people who access HSAs are people who can afford  it.   We can make it better. But don't come here when you have had no  alternative to say that this is something that could replace ACA. You  don't pay for it. You are reckless. This, as I said earlier, is a  reckless bill of the chairman of our subcommittee.   So I urge my colleagues to reject this and to not be fooled. We  Democrats come to the floor with a sense of being on the right side of  history. What is happening in this country is that more and more of the  public acknowledge it. Compared to when we first started, I remember  going back home, there was so much opposition, so much misguided. But  when people--20 million--for the first time, in most cases, had  healthcare, the clock began to tick in the direction of universal care.   You are trying to turn back the clock, you Republicans, but it is  ticking more and more towards universality. That is what is happening  in this country. And this is becoming part of the bedrock, the  foundations of care and of provisions for the benefit of the American  people as Social Security was, as Medicare was, and as Medicaid was.   You are going to pay the price for your blind opposition. The public  is more and more aware, as their eyes have been opened and as their  health has been protected, what this has meant to millions of families  in this country--millions. I run into it every day I go home, people  who come and say: Without healthcare coverage,  [[Page H7665]]  where would I be? Not only financially, but where would I be and what  is so dear to me, my health and the health of our families and the  health of our kids?   I urge we Democrats to stand up tall and say to the American public:  The ACA was a major historic step in the right direction. The  Republicans continue to try to destroy it. History is showing that,  once again, they were moving in the wrong discretion.   Mr. Speaker, I urge that we reject this bill and move proudly  forward. We put together this step. We are going to continue to move  forward.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
