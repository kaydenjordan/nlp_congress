 Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct honor and  privilege to yield to the gentlewoman from South Dakota (Mrs. Noem), an  extremely effective Member of the House of Representatives, the former  assistant majority leader of the South Dakota House of Representatives,  and a distinguished member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for her  very eloquent statement.   Mr. Speaker, last Friday, the Trump administration announced its  intention to re-assert and promulgate portions of President Ronald  Reagan's modest but necessary life-affirming title 10 rule; a policy  designed to ensure that taxpayers don't fund, facilitate, or promote  abortion in America's $286 million per year family plan program.   This new old policy comes at a time when huge majorities of  Americans, over 60 percent, according to major polls, strongly oppose  the use of taxpayer funds for abortion.   The Trump/Reagan policy, now called the Protect Life Rule, comes at a  time when the high utilization of ultrasound imaging of the child in  the womb has provided spectacular clarity and empathy, and even love,  for the baby.   First baby pictures today, the kind you put on the door of your  refrigerator, are of unborn babies. Seeing is believing.   No one can seriously deny anymore that unborn children are alive,  dynamic, precious, a miracle, and defenseless.   Title 10 was intended to be about family planning, prevention, not  the hideous dismemberment or chemical poisoning or deliberate  starvation and forced expulsion of a defenseless unborn baby. There is  nothing benign or compassionate about killing a defenseless child.   Mr. Speaker, created by Congress in 1970, title 10 of the Public  Health Service Act authorized taxpayer funds to assist ``voluntary  family planning projects,'' but made absolutely clear in the status  that Federal funds were prohibited from being spent on ``programs where  abortion is a method of family planning.''   As title 10 was administered, however, that didn't happen. So to  faithfully implement both the spirit and the letter of the law,  President Ronald Reagan issued a rule in 1988 that included physical  separation of abortion activities from federally funded family planning  projects.   In response, the American abortion industry sued to get hundreds of  millions of taxpayer dollar subsidies, and they lost. On May 23, 1991,  27 years ago this Wednesday, the U.S. Supreme Court, in Rust v.  Sullivan, affirmed the constitutionality of the Reagan title 10 rule.   Tragically, President Bill Clinton, by executive order, reversed the  Reagan policy. He not only authorized abortion clinics and family  planning activities under the same roof, co-location, but went further,  mandating, made it a condition of receiving title 10 funds, that title  10 recipients refer for abortion, an egregious violation of conscience  rights protected under Federal law.   Thus, by requiring abortion referrals, family planning service  providers who oppose abortion, were and are today, precluded from all  participation in the Federal program.   Today, hundreds of abortion clinics are co-located as title 10 family  planning facilities. For example, 266 of Planned Parenthood's abortion  clinics are subsidized by U.S. taxpayers in the title 10 program, to  the tune of $56- to $60 million each year.                                time  1945    Planned Parenthood is an organization, let's not forget, that is  directly responsible for over 7 million deaths of unborn children--a  staggering loss of children's lives.   Mr. Speaker, if past is prologue, I fully expect an organized,  aggressive, willful distortion of the Protect Life Rule. Nevertheless,  in the spirit of honest debate and civil discourse, I urge opponents  and the news media to be clear what this rule actually does and what it  doesn't do.   According to the White House, the new Protect Life Rule will: one,  physically and financially separate family planning clinics from  abortions, and will make other important reforms. It will also  safeguard the conscience rights of providers by eliminating the  egregious illegal mandate that requires all participants in the program  to refer pregnant women to abortion.   The Protect Life Rule will not, however, prohibit counseling that may  include conversations about abortion. This would be in keeping with  guidance issued by George H.W. Bush's administration that affirmed  that:         Nothing in these regulations is to prevent a woman from       receiving complete medical information about her condition       from a physician.    Finally, Mr. Speaker, Cardinal Timothy Dolan, chairman of the  Committee on Pro-Life Activities, really summed it up when he said:  ``For too long, title X has been used to subsidize the abortion  industry. We need to draw a bright line between what happens before a  pregnancy begins and what happens after a child has been created.''   He goes on to say: ``Abortion always takes the life of a child and  often harms the mother, her surviving children, and other family and  friends as well.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly),  my good friend. He serves on the Committee on Ways and Means and is a  former member of the Butler City Council.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Kelly so  much for his comments and his leadership for many, many years. I deeply  appreciate it.   Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Estes), a  good friend and colleague, who is a distinguished member of the  Education and the Workforce Committee and also serves on Homeland  Security.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for his  comments and his leadership, especially on this important issue. I  deeply appreciate it.   Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the distinguished gentleman from Iowa  (Mr. King), a member of the Agriculture Committee, the Small Business  Committee, and a force on the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, it is now an honor and  privilege to introduce a former member of the Colorado General Assembly  and a member of the House Armed Services and Natural Resources  Committees, Doug Lamborn.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).    Mr. Speaker, Doug LaMalfa is the  distinguished gentleman representing California's First District. He  serves on the Committees on Agriculture and Natural Resources.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for his  eloquence and his principled and very courageous stand.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
