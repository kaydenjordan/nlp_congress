 Madam President, tomorrow I will cast my vote against the  removal of our duly elected President. I will do so based upon my  understanding of the duty conferred upon me  [[Page S818]]  by the Constitution of the United States.   I do not believe the House managers have proved the allegations  contained in the Articles of Impeachment, nor do I believe the articles  allege conduct that may be used as grounds for removal. I find the  President's counsel to be persuasive in this regard. Significantly,  much of the American public, without the benefit of learned  constitutional instruction, has come to the same conclusion.   During the 2\1/2\ weeks of this trial, we have received more than  28,000 pages of documents, we have seen 192 video clips of 13 different  witnesses, we had the opportunity to question each side for a total of  16 hours, and we have listened to literally hours and hours of  argument. Clearly, I am unable to discuss every aspect of the trial in  the time allotted me. Some facts in this case are in dispute, but many  are not. Here is what we all know beyond a doubt:    First, we know that voices on the left have been calling for the  impeachment of Donald Trump since day one--literally day one. The  Washington Post on January 20, 2017, published an article titled ``The  Campaign to Impeach President Trump Has Begun'' on Inauguration Day.   Secondly, we know that the yearslong $32 million Mueller  investigation failed to reveal sufficient ammunition for those who  desired impeachment.   Third, the impeachment of this President in the House was the result  of a narrowly partisan vote, with no Republican Representatives--zero-- voting in favor of the articles.   And fourth, a guilty verdict this week would not only immediately  remove the President from office, but it would also remove his name  from the ballot in an election, which is already going on, and the  first caucuses of which were conducted only yesterday. The words are  right there in articles I and II, on pages 3 and 4 of the resolution:  ``disqualification to hold . . . any office.''   The Founders of this country entrusted Congress with the power of  impeachment as a check and balance on the executive branch. This power  was never intended to settle policy differences or political  disagreements--even intense disagreements. It was not designed so that  Congress could get rid of a President they found odious or obnoxious or  with whom they vehemently disagree.   The Constitution gives Congress this extraordinary authority as a  remedy only for what it calls ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' And  making it clear what an extreme action of impeachment is, the Framers  required the support of two-thirds in this Chamber in order to convict.   These standards intentionally set a very high bar to prevent abuse of  the impeachment process. Meeting these standards requires this process  be used to try only the most serious allegations and requires broad  consensus in the Senate. Members of both parties have, in the past,  warned about the dangers of a narrowly partisan impeachment.   As late as last year, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi cautioned:         Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless       there's something so compelling and overwhelming and       bipartisan, I don't think we should go down that path because       it divides the country.    Congressman Nadler, one of the impeachment managers, said in 1998:         There must never be a narrowly voted impeachment or an       impeachment substantially supported by one of our major       political parties and largely opposed by the other. Such an       impeachment would lack legitimacy, would produce divisiveness       and bitterness in our politics for years to come.    This wide approach has been supported in the past by House Manager  Zoe Lofgren, by Senator and future Vice President Joe Biden, and by our  own colleagues, Senator Menendez and Schumer, who feared that  impeachment would become a routine tool.   These leaders had good company in taking this position. In Federalist  No. 65, Alexander Hamilton warned of the danger that the decision to  impeach ``will be regulated more by the comparative strength of the  parties than by the real demonstrations of innocence or guilt.''   Many of our Democratic friends who once sided with Hamilton have  apparently changed their minds. They have also reversed themselves on  the urgency of doing so--a rather sudden and abrupt change of heart on  that question.   House advocates of impeachment have argued that President Trump is  willing to cheat in the ongoing election and amounting to such an  imminent threat to our democracy that he must be removed at once.  Unless he is out of office and out quickly, they assert, we cannot have  any confidence that the 2020 election results will be trustworthy.   I ask: Does any Senator really believe that; that America cannot have  a fair election if Donald Trump is in the White House? But that alleged  danger was the reason for the abbreviated House procedure. The lead  House manager, Congressman Schiff, said in an interview last year that  the timing of impeachment was driven by the urgency of removing the  President. Congressman Nadler agreed, saying that ``nothing could be  more urgent.'' Speaker Pelosi repeated the same argument many times to  explain the rushed process in the House and why there was not time to  give the President a fair hearing. Senators heard the words repeated  and repeated on video clips shown during this trial--``urgent,''  ``urgency.''   What happened to that urgency once the House voted? Did the Speaker  then rush the papers to the Senate so we could address this imminent  threat? Hardly. Speaker Pelosi held the articles for more than a month.  If this trial was so urgent, why not send the articles without delay?  Some might conclude that by withholding the articles, the Speaker  exposed that she did not, in fact, believe that this case was so  urgent. Perhaps it was an effort to influence our procedural decisions.  I do not impugn motives here. Our rules prohibit me from doing so. I  merely note an obvious change for whatever reason.   As I consider the high bar of impeachment tomorrow, I will vote not  to convict. I will do so because there is not overwhelming evidence,  because no high crimes are shown, because there is not a broad  consensus among my countrymen, only articles passed on a narrowly  partisan basis, and because removing President Trump on these charges  at this time would set a dangerous precedent.   I conclude by reminding my colleagues that we are the trustees of the  Constitution of 1787. We have the privilege and responsibility of  standing on the shoulders of our remarkably perceptive Founders, but we  also act as trustees for our Republic on behalf of future generations.  With that in mind, we have an enhanced obligation to be careful, to  resist the passions of the moment, and to remember that what we do  today establishes precedence for decades and centuries to come.   Manager Schiff closed his remarks yesterday with an ominous reference  to nefarious midnight decisions somehow threatening the freedom or  welfare of Americans. His hopeful conclusion was that it is midnight in  America, but the Sun will rise tomorrow, a sentiment I happen to share,  though my concept of what amounts to a beautiful sunrise may differ  from his.   Over a century ago, during the depths of World War I, Vachel Lindsay  composed ``Abraham Lincoln Walks at Midnight,'' imagining an agonized,  sleepless Lincoln walking the streets of Springfield, dismayed over the  carnage in Europe.   Let us ask ourselves today, do Hamilton and Madison and Franklin walk  these venerable halls at midnight? Do these Founding Fathers traverse  the stone corridors of these great building, this symbol of stability  and rule of law? If they do, they caution us, as they always have, to  be careful, to avoid rash decisions, to resist the urges of  partisanship, and to let the Constitution work. I hope my colleagues  will heed their counsel.   I yield the floor.
