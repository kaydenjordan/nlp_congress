 I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum  call be rescinded.    Madam President, last week we had some great  conversations on the floor of the Senate about the Great American  Outdoors Act and the combination of two important pieces of  legislation--the Land and Water Conservation Fund, first authorized 55  years ago, and the Restore Our Parks Act--both of which would be  combined in the Great American Outdoors Act and the most significant  piece of conservation legislation Congress has passed in nearly 50  years or more.   The Land and Water Conservation Fund, of course, is funded by taking  offshore oil and gas revenues, and that is how the Restore Our Parks  Act would be funded as well. Both of them would take dollars generated  from offshore oil and gas production. There are a few other ways that  it is funded, like boat fuel excise tax revenues and others, but  primarily that is the source of funding, and, after a series of formula  distributions out of the Treasury, the Land and Water Conservation Fund  is appropriated about $1 billion, and eventually the Restore Our Parks  Act, under this legislation, would be appropriated dollars as well.   Ninety-nine percent of the dollars used by the Land and Water  Conservation Fund is used to purchase inholdings to complete national  parks and to work on wildlife refuges and other types of important  public land designations across the country.   We all know that our national parks are suffering from the amount of  visitors that they receive. We are grateful for the visitors, but that  is a tremendous strain on roads and trails and the visitor centers  across the country. For instance, in Rocky Mountain National Park, the  third most heavily visited park in the Nation, there is an about $85  million backlog, including trail maintenance, visitor centers, the  sewage systems, the campgrounds, and some other challenges that they  could help fix with the use of these dollars.   Last week I also talked about some important letters we had received,  letters of support for the Great American Outdoors Act, including a  letter from the outdoor recreation industry. I ask unanimous consent  that this letter from the outdoor recreation industry be submitted for  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:       June 8, 2020.        Dear Leader McConnell and Leader Schumer: The outdoor       recreation industry is extremely encouraged by recent       announcements that the Senate plans to hold a vote on the       Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA) in June. As outdoor       recreation business leaders, we know investments in       recreation access and infrastructure are vital to the outdoor       recreation industry and economies across the country.        Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, the outdoor recreation       industry contributed $778 billion in economic output,       accounted for 2.2 percent of United States Gross Domestic       Product, supported 5.2 million jobs and was growing faster       than the economy as a whole in every indicator.       Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and shutdowns       necessary to slow its progression, America's outdoor       recreation economy was hindered when we needed the outdoors       more than ever. Outdoor Recreation Roundtable's April survey       of the sector shows that 79 percent of outdoor businesses       have had to lay off or furlough employees, and 89 percent are       seeing decreased revenue. However, we know there is a bright       future for outdoor recreation ahead, as several sectors of       the industry are already experiencing rapidly increasing       demand.        These outdoor businesses are the backbone of our industry       and range from specialty retailers, apparel, gear and vehicle       manufacturers, outfitters and guides to campground and marina       operators. They are often foundational to a community's       economy. With rising unemployment and Americans eager to       experience the outdoors, investment in our industry's core       infrastructure--public lands and waters--will allow our       businesses to get back to what we do best: stimulate local       economies, put people back to work, and allow Americans to       benefit from time spent outside.        This is why we respectfully ask you to pass the Great       American Outdoors Act as soon as possible.        GAOA will fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund       (LWCF) at $900 million annually, providing more recreation       access for communities across the country and fueling more       outdoor recreation economic activity. In a nutshell, if       Congress invests the intended amount of $900 million into       LWCF recreation access projects on local, state and federal       lands, it will create much-needed close-to-home recreation       opportunities while revitalizing the outdoor recreation       economy.        Additionally, GAOA dedicates up to $9.5 billion over the       next five years to maintenance backlog projects that have       been devastating our public lands and waters. Investing in       these projects will improve outdoor recreation-related       facilities such as docks, restrooms, campgrounds, trails,       roads and more that have deteriorated significantly from       decades of underfunded maintenance. As business leaders, we       understand the need to make sure customers have good       experiences when they visit stores or facilities, it ensures       they come back again. Funding the maintenance backlog will       also ensure that adequate infrastructure for all types of       recreation on our public lands and waters exists so more       people who are seeking the benefits the outdoors has to offer       can get outside safely and grow our industry sustainably.        Passing GAOA now would stimulate the outdoor recreation       industry made up of thousands of businesses that support       communities in all 50 states, support rural economies, create       jobs to carry out essential work, and provide opportunities       for millions of Americans to recreate on our public lands and       waters for generations to come. We know this vital       legislation is slated for a vote in the coming weeks and we       urge you to move as quickly as possible to get this       legislation across the finish line. Your support of GAOA is a       vote for American jobs and health, community resiliency and       the outdoor recreation economy. Thank you for your       leadership.

This letter is written by a number of some of the most notable names  in the outdoors that people around the country would recognize:  Polaris, Patagonia, and Colorado's own VF, headquartered now in  Colorado.   In a State like Colorado, the outdoor economy is a huge driver of our  State's economy, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs and billions of  dollars of  [[Page S2965]]  economic activity. This letter from the outdoor recreation industry  says they are extremely encouraged by the Great American Outdoors Act,  and they note that this is an incredible opportunity to invest in  recreation access and infrastructure, both of which are vital to the  outdoor recreation industry and economies around the country.   Earlier today, we received another very important letter--a letter  that I think a lot of people will find very important. This letter,  dated June 15, 2020, begins with this paragraph:         From east to west, America is home to incredible lands,       waters, and cultural treasures. Now, more than ever, we are       relying on our public lands to get outdoors, to connect with       the world, to support jobs, and to strengthen our       communities. In this time of uncertainty, we have been given       a once in a lifetime opportunity to protect our public lands       and waters for all generations to come.    This letter was written by Theodore Roosevelt IV. This letter in  support for the Great American Outdoors Act comes from the great- grandson of President Teddy Roosevelt.         Passing the Great American Outdoors Act would be taking a       page from President Theodore Roosevelt's book: protecting the       quintessence of who we are as Americans in the stewardship of       our natural places, great and small. President Roosevelt set       conservation as a priority--a duty--for a great and far-      sighted nation in recognition that our national bounty is the       foundation for all else. Without it, we cannot prosper.        I am glad to see strong bipartisan support for the GAOA in       the House, Senate, and from the President. We are counting on       you to protect and preserve our public lands. And we need       your continued leadership to secure this monumental       legislation.        Sincerely, Theodore Roosevelt IV.    I have talked often about the legacy President Roosevelt left our  country when it comes to our lands and conservation. In fact, the  genesis of the Great American Outdoors Act comes from a meeting Senator  Daines and I had, along with the majority leader, Senator McConnell,  talking to the President in the Roosevelt Room at the White House about  these two programs, which people like Mark Warner, Richard Burr, Angus  King, Joe Manchin, Martin Heinrich, Maria Cantwell, Rob Portman, and  Lamar Alexander worked so diligently on. We talked about the legacy  Theodore Roosevelt has, and now we have this letter from his great- grandson securing that legacy for this country.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this letter from  Theodore Roosevelt IV printed in the Record   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                      June 15, 2020.        Dear Majority Leader McConnell, Speaker Pelosi, Minority       Leader Schumer, and Minority Leader McCarthy: From east to       west, America is home to incredible lands, waters, and       cultural treasures. Now, more than ever, we are relying on       our public lands to get outdoors, to connect with the world,       to support jobs, and to strength our communities. In this       time of uncertainty, we have been given a once in a lifetime       opportunity to protect our public lands and waters for all       generations to come.        I write to you today to urge swift passage and enactment of       the Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA)--legislation that will       provide much needed support to the outdoor places we all       depend on. This bill will fully and permanently fund the Land       and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), our nation's most       important conservation program, to ensure protection and       increased access to public lands in every state and county in       America. Additionally, GAOA will fund priority repairs in our       National Parks and on other public lands to address an ever-      growing backlog of maintenance needs.        This outstanding bipartisan legislation will ensure every       American has access to the outdoors, no matter where they       live. It will also help our communities and nation recover by       creating jobs and economic growth across the country--in both       cities and rural areas. Nationally, outdoor recreation       contributes roughly $778 billion in consumer spending and       supports 5.2 million jobs. Moreover, economic analysis shows       that every $1 million invested in LWCF could support between       16 and 30 jobs, while national park funding in GAOA could       support 100,000 jobs, $17.5 billion in economic output, and       contribute $9.6 billion to the US GDP. At a time when small       businesses are struggling, GAOA would provide much needed       stimulus to get Americans outdoors and back to work.        Passing the Great American Outdoors Act would be taking a       page from President Theodore Roosevelt's book: protecting the       quintessence of who we are as Americans in the stewardship of       our natural places, great and small. President Roosevelt set       conservation as a priority--a duty--for a great and far-      sighted nation in recognition that our natural bounty is the       foundation for all else. Without it, we cannot prosper.        I am glad to see strong bipartisan support for GAOA in the       House, Senate, and from the President. We are counting on you       to protect and preserve our public lands. And we need your       continued leadership to secure this monumental legislation.            Sincerely,                                             Theodore Roosevelt IV.     I know tonight we will have continued conversations  about the legislation and the cost of the legislation. There are some  who will say that this bill isn't paid for or perhaps that the revenues  aren't accounted for properly. I would like to speak to the contrary.  Again, I will be speaking about this later this evening.   If you look at how this bill, the Great American Outdoors Act, is  funded, it doesn't cost the taxpayer money. It comes from offshore oil  and gas revenue. That is revenue generated from oil and gas production  on Federal land in fiscal year 2019, which totaled $11.6 billion. This  is just an example of one of the years of funding.   In 2019, the revenue generated from oil and gas was about $11.6  billion; $11.6 billion went into the Treasury.   Right off the top of that, $2.4 billion went to the States. We don't  change that. The $2.4 billion goes to the States. This bill does not  change that.   Another $1 billion of that $11.6 billion from back in 2019--the same  formula would apply every year--another $1 billion went to Tribal  entities right off the top.   So $2.4 billion went to States, and another $1 billion went to Tribal  entities. After that, $1.7 billion of this amount of money went to the  Reclamation Fund. To get this straight, there is funding that goes out  to the States, funding that goes out to Tribal entities, and funding  that goes to the Reclamation Fund.   Then fourth in line for this, $1 billion went to the Land and Water  Conservation Fund.   A curious thing happened on the way to the forum, as they say. Only  $495 million got appropriated to the Land and Water Conservation Fund.  So $1 billion gets taken out of the money in 2019, the $11.6 billion,  with $1 billion to the Land and Water Conservation Fund, but only $495  million gets appropriated. That is because even though it was  authorized to get more, that money has been syphoned off and spent on  other things.   And $150 million went to the Historic Preservation Fund.   That is a total of $5.25 billion from 2019. That is what we accounted  for so far out of that revenue: money to the States, money to Tribal  entities, money to the Reclamation Fund, $1 billion to the LWCF fund  even though only $495 million got appropriated, and $150 million to the  Historic Preservation Fund. That left $5.35 billion that went directly  into Treasury. That is the money that would be used--at least a portion  of it--for the Restore Our Parks Act.   You can see this is paid for. Congress just has bad habits that need  to be corrected around here. We will have additional time to have that  conversation this evening and obviously others about the merits of this  legislation and what it means.   There has been more and more talk around the country about how this  isn't just about national parks and it isn't just about national  forests; it is about our urban parks and urban centers. Some of our  colleagues made passionate, eloquent statements about the need for  access in all of our communities, to make sure we have more access for  communities across the country--our urban settings, our rural settings,  whether it is a ballpark or some other kind of recreation activity at a  park.   This is the opportunity for us to get to work, with no cost to the  taxpayer, to do something we can all be proud of. I am grateful that  Mr. Roosevelt would send a letter highlighting the work this Congress  is doing that can stand, generations later, the test of Teddy  Roosevelt's leadership and the opportunity for us to build on the  leadership of President Roosevelt.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and the waiver provisions of  applicable budget resolutions, I move to waive all applicable sections  of that Act and applicable budget resolutions for purposes of amendment  No. 1617, and I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, just to talk a little about bit how this  bill is funded, again, the legislation relies on the use of the oil and  gas revenues from both onshore for part of the bill and offshore for  other parts of the bill, and that has been the tradition of the  legislation since its passage in 1965 until 5 years ago, since we have  had the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Of course, the new Historic  Preservation Act provisions rely on these revenues as well.   To give you kind of a run-through or an example of how this would  have proceeded in 2019--and thanks to my colleague Senator Alexander  for really pointing this out and highlighting how this funding works-- it would have been the total revenues generated from offshore  production and the revenues that the Federal Government would have  received from that. This gives us, I think, a good example of how this  works.   The revenue generated from oil and gas production on Federal land in  fiscal year 2019 totaled about $11.6 billion. Of that $11.6 billion,  $2.4 billion went to the States. First out of the gate was the $2.4  billion. Now, this may change from year to year, but the formula  distribution is the same. So $2.4 billion of that went to the States.  Another $1 billion went to Tribal entities. Then another $1.7 billion  went to the reclamation funds.   First, the money comes into the Treasury. It goes out to the States.  Then it goes out to the Tribal entities. Then it goes out to the  reclamation fund. Then $1 billion goes to the Land and Water  Conservation Fund. In this last year, Congress appropriated, though, to  the Land and Water Conservation Fund $495 million, and the rest of the  money got siphoned off and went somewhere else. Then $150 million went  to the Historic Preservation Fund, which was a total of $5.25 billion  in 2019 for this distribution. That left about $5.35 billion to go  directly to the Treasury.   These dollars that we are using help to fund the Restore Our Parks  Act to catch up with deferred maintenance. I think our colleague  Senator Portman has done an outstanding job of explaining that this  deferred maintenance is also considered debt. So we are actually using  these dollars that have been collected from oil and gas revenues that  have gone to the Treasury and have been distributed out to go to the  debt and the deferred maintenance projects at national parks across the  country: Colorado National; $85 million for Rocky Mountain National  Park, $75  [[Page S2971]]  million for Mesa Verde; $8 million for the Great Sand Dunes; $7 million  for Black Canyon National Park; and the list goes on and on. That is  not even including the Forest Service, the BLM lands, and other efforts  by the Bureau of Indian Education. That is how this revenue would work.    I also wanted to point this out again to my colleagues, some of whom  may have heard this before and some may not have. Today, June 15, 2020,  we received a letter that was written to Senator McConnell, Senator  Schumer, Speaker Pelosi, and Leader McCarthy from Teddy Roosevelt IV.  This is the great-grandson of President Teddy Roosevelt. I will read it  here:         From east to west, America is home to incredible lands,       waters, and cultural treasures. Now, more than ever, we are       relying on our public lands to get outdoors, to connect with       the world, to support jobs, and strengthen our communities.       In this time of uncertainty, we have been given a once in a       lifetime opportunity to protect our public lands and waters       for all generations to come.        I write to you today to urge swift passage and enactment of       the Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA)--legislation that will       provide much needed support to the outdoor places we all       depend on. This bill will fully and permanently help fund the       Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), our nation's most       important conservation program, to ensure protection and       increased access to public lands in every state and county in       America. Additionally, GAOA will fund priority repairs in our       National Parks and on other public lands to address an ever-      growing backlog of maintenance needs.    The letter goes on and talks about the principles of President  Roosevelt and the public lands protections that this Congress continues  to build upon, standing on the shoulders of those generations past so  that we can preserve and protect our generations to come.   I know it has been said by some of the opposition to the legislation  that there are no people who live in the areas where the Land and Water  Conservation Fund and Restore Our Parks Act helps, that this goes to  protect States that apparently don't have enough people to merit it.   Look, every State in the Union has benefited from legislation covered  by the Great American Outdoors Act. Every county--nearly every county-- across the country has benefitted from programs within the Great  American Outdoors Act. It is not just national parks. My town in  Colorado, in the Eastern Plains, is 40 miles away from the Kansas- Nebraska border. We don't have a national park in our county. It is  several hours to get to Rocky Mountain National Park. But even that  little town that I live in, in that little tiny county in the Eastern  Plains of Colorado, has benefited from the Land and Water Conservation  Fund--whether it was decades ago, the purchase of water rights that  went along with the reservoir, called Bonny Reservoir in the Eastern  Plains, to help protect those water rights or recreation opportunity  for youth. This is a farming community. We live in the High Plains.  There are no mountains around us. There are no ski areas around us. Yet  this has helped us too. It helps all Americans. It helps corner to  corner across this great Nation.   Tonight, we are going to be given a choice and a chance to vote on  three different efforts. I hope my colleagues will join me in waiving  the budget point of order, as I have laid out in my objection and in my  request for a waiver. I hope my colleagues will join me in the next  votes following that--one of which will require a simple majority and  one of which will require, yet again, a 60-vote threshold.   This is an opportunity for us to work together on a bipartisan  basis--the House and the Senate, Republicans and Democrats coming  together, and with the White House. They have announced their support.  The President announced his support for this legislation several months  ago. We come together to do something that we can build upon for this  country--the greatest ideas this country has ever put forward--our  public lands, our public places, and most special spaces in America.   In Colorado, Wyoming, Louisiana, California, New Mexico, and in every  State, we see dollars coming in and jobs being created because of this  legislation--the land that this legislation represents and the policies  that this legislation will cover.   It is estimated that this legislation will create 100,000 jobs--over  100,000 jobs, quite frankly--just in the national parks section alone.  And the way the economy is right now, every one of those jobs matters.  For every $1 million that is spent in the Land and Water Conservation  Fund, it supports nearly 16 to 30 jobs. For every $1 million, it  supports another 16 to 30 jobs.   I think one of the most important factors in the jobs analysis is  where we are at in the country with the economic crisis we face. When  the coronavirus came into Colorado--that first wave, the initial step-- it hit our Western Slope communities the hardest. You had a lot of  international visitors coming to ski the best skiing areas in the  country. You had a lot of travelers from the Front Range coming up to  enjoy the weekend, and it created some big challenges from COVID-19 in  those communities as a result. Some of those towns have 20 percent, 22  percent, 23 percent unemployment in the immediate aftermath of the  pandemic and the shutdowns of restaurants and hotels, and the ski areas  shut down a couple of months earlier than they normally would have.    Of course, it didn't just impact the winter ski season and the winter  recreation season. It impacted the summer recreation season. Outfitters  who had their trips canceled, who had their reservations yanked because  you couldn't travel or you couldn't go out, decided it wouldn't be  right to stay at a hotel or maybe the hotel was closed. If you were out  camping, the parks were closed as well. I think that became one of the  reasons why this legislation is so important too. It is not just about  the resources. It is not just about protecting the public lands. It is  about the jobs that can be created in these public land communities  that were hit hardest and first by that initial wave of coronavirus.   That is all the more reason I hope my colleagues will join me in  voting to waive the budget point of order, as well as the procedural  votes that we will have this evening and the eventual passage of the  legislation itself, the Great American Outdoors Act, which most likely  will occur sometime Wednesday morning, maybe around noon or so.   I am grateful for the support of people like Teddy Roosevelt, great- grandson of President Roosevelt. I am grateful for the support of my  colleagues and the work of Senators Heinrich, Manchin, Cantwell, King,  and Warner, who have been so diligent across the past several months as  this legislation moves its way to passage, and of Richard Burr, who has  been an incredible stalwart champion of the Land and Water Conservation  Fund. I thank Senator Alexander for his work.   It goes to show you this didn't happen alone. It didn't happen in a  vacuum. It didn't happen because one person or one party decided to get  behind it. It happened because of a group effort of people in both  Chambers and at the White House to support it.   Today, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce reiterated their support of this  legislation. The American Petroleum Institute supports this  legislation. Countless environmental and conservation organizations  support this legislation. Some 850-plus groups support this  legislation.   We have an opportunity to do something good for our country, to do  something good for future generations.   With that, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 462, S. 712.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  committee-reported substitute amendment be agreed to; that the bill, as  amended, be considered read a third time and passed; that the  committee-reported title amendment be agreed to; and that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res 619, submitted earlier today.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to and that the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 620, submitted earlier today.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, with no  intervening action or debate.
