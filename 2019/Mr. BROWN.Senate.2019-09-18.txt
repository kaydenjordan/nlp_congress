 Thank you, Senator Casey, for speaking out on such an  important issue.   He and I talked yesterday about the number of people who now have  insurance in our States. In his State it is over a million; in my State  it is over 900,000 because of the Affordable Care Act, because of  Medicaid expansion, because of other things.   Seniors have more. Seniors are getting more preventive care, and the  cost of drugs is less in spite of the fact that this institution and  the President do nothing to keep the prices of drugs down. We know the  White House looks like a retreat for drug company executives, so this  body has not done nearly what it should.   The Affordable Care Act is so important. I appreciate Senator Casey  always standing up for kids and standing up for Medicaid and standing  up for the Affordable Care Act and the impact it has made on our  States.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
