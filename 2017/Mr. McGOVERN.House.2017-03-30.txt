 Madam Speaker, Rise Against Hunger, under the  leadership of Rod Brooks, is a charitable organization committed to  ending global hunger by 2030. They partner with other charities, faith- based organizations, and corporations to host meal-packaging events  across the country where volunteers assemble nutritious meals that are  sent to over 40 countries.   On Tuesday, I had the opportunity to participate in a Rise Against  Hunger meal-packaging event sponsored by The Kraft Heinz Company. I  joined 100 volunteers to package 7,500 meals that will reach hungry  families across the globe.   Last year alone, Rise Against Hunger engaged over 387,000 volunteers  at over 3,000 events nationwide to assemble over 64 million meals that  reached nearly 1.1 million hungry people.   I applaud Kraft Heinz and its CEO, Bernardo Hees, for their  commitment to packing 1 billion meals over the next 5 years. I  appreciate all that Rise Against Hunger does to address chronic  malnutrition and alleviate poverty worldwide.   Working together, we can end hunger now.                            ____________________
