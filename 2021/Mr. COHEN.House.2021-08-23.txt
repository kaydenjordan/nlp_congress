 Madam Speaker, the coronavirus has gotten to levels in  Memphis not known since last January; it is dangerous. Fortunately,  today, the Pfizer vaccine was given final full approval by the FDA for  all people 16 and over.   This weekend, Phil Valentine, a conservative radio host in Nashville,  passed away. Also, one of the greatest football players in Memphis,  Danton Barto, 50 years of age, passed away. Both passed because they  got COVID; neither had the vaccine. Both said toward the end of their  life they wished they would have encouraged everyone to get the  vaccine.   I ask you, please get the vaccine. Let America continue its  activities and culture and lifestyle as we have known it in the past.                            ____________________
