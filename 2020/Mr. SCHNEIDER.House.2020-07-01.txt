 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2,  the Moving Forward Act.   At home we have seen firsthand the effects of our Nation's aging and  overburdened infrastructure in crumbling roads, inadequate public  transit, and more frequent floods.   Today's package is not simply about rebuilding our roads, bridges,  and rail, though it does all that. The Moving Forward Act is about  making smart, transformative investments in our future: investing in  rebuilding school infrastructure to help them safely reopen; expanding  internet access to underserved communities to close the digital divide;  and creating millions of good-paying jobs in the process, lifting up  entire communities.   I am particularly proud this legislation has been designed with  addressing the climate crisis as a top priority.   Climate change is an existential threat. We see it in rising lake  levels, a record level in Lake Michigan. We see it across the country  in stronger storms and longer hurricane seasons, longer fire seasons,  and disrupted growing seasons.   We have to act now. We have to reduce emissions. We have to build  resiliency.   To that end, I am proud that this act includes two clean energy  provisions I have previously introduced to promote electric vehicle  charging stations and incentivize waste heat to power projects.   This comprehensive package is transformative legislation that will  ensure our Nation's infrastructure is built to ensure our success in  the 21st century.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleague to join us in support of this  important legislation.
