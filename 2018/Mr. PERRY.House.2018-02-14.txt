 Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``Yea'' on rollcall No. 72.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Fortenberry). The question is on the  resolution.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.                                Recorded Vote
