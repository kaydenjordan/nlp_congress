 Mr. Speaker, this week, I had the privilege of  taking some of our young high school students and visitors throughout  the Capitol.   What a sense of pride I had in the beauty of this Capitol, the beauty  of this building, but what it symbolizes is democracy.   As I walked through the Halls, I was reminded of the important  hearings that are going on in the January 6th Committee. The most  recent hearing made it very clear that the Oath Keepers and the Proud  Boys came specifically at the calling of President Trump. The terrorism  that occurred was driven by his lack of accepting the peaceful transfer  of government. It was the big lie.   What we saw on that day, January 6, was domestic terrorism on  steroids, destined to commit mayhem, bloodshed, and death. It was an  attack on democracy, and it is being evidenced every day that the  hearings proceed methodically, block by block, evidence by evidence. It  is clear in the injury of law enforcement officers and loss of life  that we have to say to those of this Nation: You have to take ownership  of protecting the values and the sanctity of democracy.   Yes, someone must be held accountable. The President must be held  accountable because what happened was not only an attack on democracy  and the peaceful transfer of government, but loss of life and death,  and that cannot go unanswered.                            ____________________
