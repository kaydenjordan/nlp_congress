 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, first, briefly, I am pleased that  Leader Schumer and I were able to reach an agreement on a fair process  and estimated timeline for the upcoming Senate trial.   This structure has been approved by both former President Trump's  legal team and the House managers because it preserves due process and  the rights of both sides. It will give Senators, as jurors, ample time  to review the case and the arguments that each side will present
