 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate  the appropriations package we will pass this week because this document  respects the dignity and humanity of women in this country and around  the world.   For the first time in over 40 years, the Appropriations Committee  passed a spending bill without the Hyde amendment. For decades, the  Hyde amendment has prevented women of color and low-income people from  receiving basic healthcare. Hyde forces one in four women under  Medicaid to carry a pregnancy to term.   Twenty percent of the women in this country rely on Medicaid,  including half of all American people living below the Federal poverty  line, and millions of women of color. Yet, they are denied their  constitutional right to healthcare, including an abortion.   This is discrimination. The legal right to an abortion is meaningless  if  [[Page H4255]]  you are unable to afford one. Abortion is healthcare. The legal right  to an abortion is based on access, and that should not be denied based  on your income or insurance coverage.   Budgets are documents that represent our values, and that is why I am  so proud to put forward a spending package that rejects Hyde, and also  provides a directive to the VA to implement a comprehensive sexual  assault and harassment policy, $1.2 billion for maternal and child  health, a repeal of the restrictive Helms amendment and global and  domestic gag rules, and so much more.   This is a good day for women here and around the globe. I thank Chair  DeLauro and I thank the millions of activists who fought to make this  moment a reality. We will continue our march for equity shoulder to  shoulder with you.                            ____________________
