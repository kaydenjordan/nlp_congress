 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (S. 2089) to amend title 38, United States Code, to  ensure that grants provided by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for  State veterans' cemeteries do not restrict States from authorizing the  interment of certain deceased members of the reserve components of the  Armed Forces in such cemeteries, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2089         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  [[Page H5838]]  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on S. 2089.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, S. 2089 was amended to replace the language of that  bill with the language of H.R. 8150, the bipartisan and bicameral Keep  Kids Fed Act of 2022, in order to send the bill to the Senate for  expedited passage.   Roughly 2 years ago, our communities experienced an unprecedented  surge in child hunger, spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic. Just weeks  into the pandemic, more than one of every three households with  children, and nearly half of all mothers with young children, struggled  with food insecurity.   In response, Congress took decisive action to ensure that child  nutrition programs, our best tools for addressing child hunger, could  continue feeding hungry children during the pandemic.   One of the most important steps we took was providing child nutrition  programs with the flexibility they needed to expand access to school  meals and address the challenges of serving students who are not  physically in the school buildings.   This relief made a measurable difference in our fight against child  hunger. By expanding access to child nutrition programs, we allowed an  additional 10 million students to receive free school meals each day.  From January 2021 to April 2021, food shortages among households with  children fell by more than 40 percent.   Regrettably, unless Congress acts, these key flexibilities would  expire at the end of this month.   The bipartisan and bicameral Keep Kids Fed Act of 2022 is likely our  best and last opportunity to preserve relief for child nutrition  programs. This legislation would:   Maintain school meal flexibilities that do not increase costs;   Continue flexibilities to support summer food programs this year;   Provide additional support for child and adult care feeding programs;  and   Increase school meal reimbursement rates for this upcoming school  year.   As we continue to recover from the pandemic, the Keep Kids Fed Act of  2022 would take a critical step to support child nutrition programs and  prevent children from going hungry during the ongoing public health  emergency. This is a step well worth taking.   I thank the ranking member of the full committee, Dr. Foxx, and  Senators Stabenow and Boozman for working with me on this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. Omar), a distinguished member of the  Committee on Education and Labor and a leading advocate to reduce and  eliminate child hunger.                                time  1230     Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Adams), a member of the Committee  on Education and Labor and chair of the Subcommittee on Workforce  Protections.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Mrvan), the distinguished member of the  Committee on Education and Labor.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record two letters from No Kid Hungry  and the Food Research and Action Center, better known as FRAC.                         [From Share Our Strength]   Share Our Strength's Lisa Davis on the Introduction of the `Keep Kids                 Fed' Act To Extend Child Nutrition Waivers         Washington, DC.--This afternoon, leadership from the Senate       Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry and the       House Committee on Education and Labor announced an agreement       to extend nationwide child nutrition waivers, which are set       to expire on June 30. The Keep Kids Fed Act would extend some       of these waivers through the 2022-2023 school year and       provide school nutrition programs with additional funding to       help address food price inflation and supply chain       challenges. The following is a statement from No Kid Hungry       Senior Vice President Lisa Davis:        ``We are grateful that a deal has come together to help       address the immense challenges facing schools and community       organizations working tirelessly to feed kids this summer and       during the school year. This issue couldn't be more urgent       with waivers expiring in nine days and summer meals programs       already up and running.        ``Time is of the essence, especially for those operating       summer meals sites without the certainty and flexibility of       the waivers who will face difficulties turning on a dime. We       know these waivers are needed and that they work. The reach       of the summer meals program increased dramatically with them,       doubling in 2021 and even tripling in 2020.        ``While these waivers don't solve supply chain issues,       lower the rising cost of food and gas, or solve our nation's       inflation problem, they do help soften their impact on       schools and community organizations and, ultimately, keep       kids fed and nourished.        ``As we know with legislation like this, there can be miles       to go before it gets across the finish line. We urge Congress       to move quickly on the Keep Kids Fed Act before nationwide       child nutrition waivers expire on June 30.''                                   ____     [From Luis Guardia, president, Food Research & Action Center (FRAC)]  Hungry Children Can't Wait: Congress Must Act Quickly To Pass Critical                                Legislation         Washington, June 21, 2022.--FRAC commends the bi-partisan       legislation introduced today by Senate Agriculture Chairwoman       Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Ranking Member John Boozman (R-AR)       and House Education and Labor Chairman Bobby Scott (D-VA) and       Ranking Member Virginia Foxx (R-NC), to help support       children, families, schools, and child care providers as they       struggle to recover from the fallout of the pandemic.       Provisions in the Keep Kids Fed Act would increase       reimbursements to schools and child care, support access to       summer meals by extending the summer waivers, allow children       eligible for reduced-price school meals to receive free       school meals, and streamline access to healthy meals for       children in family child care.        We and our network of anti-hunger advocates all across the       country call on Congress to pass this legislation immediately       as time is running out. The child nutrition waivers that have       been available since the onset of the pandemic are set to       expire on June 30. This legislation would help mitigate the       impact of the loss of the waivers and also would be critical       to supporting children's access to summer meals and meals at       childcare. The provisions in the legislation are only       temporary and do not go as far as we would like, but they are       a critical first step to help shield some of the impact of       inflation, supply chain disruptions, and labor shortages.        Still, more must be done. FRAC looks forward to working       with Congress to make much-needed, long-term improvements to       the child nutrition programs to more fully address our       nation's hunger crisis.        Hungry children can't wait.     Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Madam Speaker, as I said at the beginning of the debate, the  legislation before us is likely our last and best opportunity to  protect millions of students' access to nutrition programs, which have  been critical to feeding hungry children during the pandemic.   The simple reality is that schools, children, and families are still  dealing with the impacts of COVID-19. As school meal programs continue  to endure supply chain disruptions, inflation, and other challenges,  the Keep Kids Fed Act of 2022 would provide school meal programs that  are urgently needed for stability and will help continue providing  students with nutritious meals that they need.   We know this bill alone will not end all hunger in America, but it  will be an important step to stand up for our Nation's children and  fulfill our basic responsibility to keep them from going hungry.   Again, I thank the ranking member of the committee, Dr. Foxx, and I  thank the gentlewoman from California, Mrs. Steel, for helping to bring  [[Page H5840]]  this bipartisan, bicameral legislation to the floor. I also thank  Senators Stabenow and Boozman for their work in bringing this  legislation to reality.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support S. 2089, as amended,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  [[Page H5841]]  and pass the bill (H.R. 5407) to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965  to promote comprehensive campus mental health and suicide prevention  plans, and for other purposes, as amended.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the measure under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, over the last 2 years, our Nation's college students  have grappled with a mental health crisis that was significantly  worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic. A national survey last year found  that 65 percent of students reported having poor or only fair mental  health. And according to the CDC, suicide attempts amongst females aged  15 to 23 increased by 87 percent from 2007 through 2020.   The surging mental health needs of students on college campuses have  further strained campus-based mental health care providers. Since the  start of the pandemic, campus counseling centers have been forced to  respond to an increased demand for services without the funding,  staffing, and resources that they need.   Regrettably, insufficient access to mental health care during the  pandemic has exacerbated preexisting mental health inequities. A 2015  survey indicated that students of color are significantly less likely  to be diagnosed or treated for mental health conditions than White  students. The gaps between the increased mental health needs of  students and the limited capacity of institutions to address them  demand urgent action.   In response to this crisis, the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms.  Wild), along with the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Keller),  introduced a bill, Enhancing Mental Health and Suicide Prevention  Through Campus Planning Act.   This bill will help institutions of higher education develop  comprehensive mental health and suicide prevention plans to better  support mental health needs of college students.   Specifically, the legislation directs the Department of Education to  build on existing mental health programs to create evidence-based  approaches to suicide prevention and mental health care. And it would  encourage the Department to collaborate with State agencies, nonprofit  organizations, and stakeholders to help ensure that these programs  fully meet the needs of students.                                time  1245    In other words, the Enhancing Mental Health and Suicide Prevention  Through Campus Planning Act is a critical opportunity for each of us to  stand up for the healthcare needs of our Nation's students and ensure  that we care for their well-being.   I thank Ms. Wild and Mr. Keller for their work on this critical  priority, and I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may  consume to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Wild), the sponsor of  this legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Madam Speaker, the evidence is clear that our Nation's students are  continuing to grapple with an ongoing mental health crisis. Even as we  continue to recover from COVID-19, we are still seeing far too many  students suffer from depression, anxiety, and stress without the  support and services they need to get back on their feet.   Madam Speaker, students in this country should not have to grapple  with serious mental health challenges on their own. However, we cannot  expect campus mental health care providers to support students if we do  not support them with the resources that they need.   The Enhancing Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Through Campus  Planning Act is legislation that we need to help ensure that our  institutions of higher education are equipped to support students'  mental health, both during the pandemic and into the future.   I, again, thank the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Wild) and the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Keller) for their leadership and  cooperation on this bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 6493) to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to  prevent certain alcohol and substance misuse, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6493         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on the measure under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, across the country, students on college campuses are  facing an increased incidence of substance misuse.   Even before the pandemic, there was a rising demand for substance  prevention and recovery programs on campuses. Unfortunately, the  pandemic has only exacerbated the mental health and student well-being  crisis.   In fact, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, a study found that 89  percent of college students experienced increased anxiety, and one in  four students surveyed said their depression significantly increased.   College-aged students misuse substances more than any other age  group. In a lot of cases, substance misuse in college can lead to lower  academic performance and unemployment after graduation. Tragically, in  the worst cases, substance misuse can lead to illness and death.   That is why the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Leger Fernandez)  acted and introduced the bipartisan Campus Prevention and Recovery  Services for Students Act.   This bill brings together the Departments of Education and Health and  Human Services to encourage institutions to develop evidence-based  substance misuse prevention and recovery programs for students with  substance use disorders.   This bill also encourages institutions to holistically address  substance use and mental health concerns. Importantly, it reauthorizes  grants to help institutions carry out these efforts.   Madam Speaker, if we want to tackle the mental health crisis head-on  and help our students reach their full potential, then we must invest  in their well-being. This legislation will help deliver on that goal.   I thank the gentlewoman from New Mexico for leading this effort, and  I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may  consume to the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Leger Fernandez), who  is the sponsor of the legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Madam Speaker, as lawmakers, we have an opportunity to make a  difference in students' lives and protect their health, including their  mental health. The benefits of doing so are clear. Students with higher  rates of well-being have higher GPAs and are more likely to graduate  and be engaged in our community. Unfortunately, mental health issues  and substance misuse are rising, and that is a concern for our college  campuses.   The Campus Prevention and Recovery Services for Students Act will  provide both guidance and funding to help make sure that students have  the tools that they need to reach their full potential.   Again, I thank the chief sponsor of the bill, Ms. Leger Fernandez;  the lead cosponsor of the bill, the gentleman from South Dakota (Mr.  Johnson); and Mr. Keller for their leadership on this important bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6493, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
