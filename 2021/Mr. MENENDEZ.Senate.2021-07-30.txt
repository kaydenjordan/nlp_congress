This proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy       and national security objectives of the United States by       improving the security of a Major Non-NATO Ally in Southeast       Asia. The Javelin Weapon System will replace the obsolete       106mm Recoilless Rifles that the Royal Thai Army (RTA)       acquired as part of the Military Assistance Program (MAP)       from the Vietnam era. This proposed sale will allow the RTA       to modernize their light anti-tank capability and maintain       its current force posture, as well as enhance       interoperability with the U.S. during operations and training       exercises. Thailand is a strategic partner committed to       contributing to regional security.        The proposed sale will improve Thailand's capability to       meet current and future threats by improving Thailand's long-      term defense capacity to defend its sovereignty and       territorial integrity. Thailand will have no difficulty       absorbing this equipment into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.  [[Page S5215]]         The prime contractors will be Raytheon/Lockheed Martin       Javelin Joint Venture of Orlando, Florida, and Tucson,       Arizona. Offsets have not been included. Any offset       agreements will be defined in negotiations between the       purchaser and the contractor(s).        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of U.S. Government or contractor representatives       to Thailand.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 21-53    Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to Section                  36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The Javelin Weapon System is a medium-range, man       portable, shoulder-launched, fire and forget, anti-tank       system for infantry, scouts, and combat engineers. It may       also be mounted on a variety of platforms including vehicles,       aircraft and watercraft. The system weighs 49.5 pounds and       has a maximum range in excess of 2,500 meters. The system is       highly lethal against tanks and other systems with       conventional and reactive armors. The system possesses a       secondary capability against bunkers.        2. Javelin's key technical feature is the use of fire-and-      forget technology, which allows the gunner to fire and       immediately relocate or take cover. Additional special       features are the top attack and/or direct fire modes, an       advanced tandem warhead and imaging infrared seeker, target       lock-on before launch, and soft launch from enclosures or       covered fighting positions. The Javelin missile also has a       minimum smoke motor, thus decreasing its detection on the       battlefield.        3. The Javelin Weapon System is comprised of two major       tactical components, which are a reusable Command Launch Unit       (CLU) and a round contained in a disposable launch tube       assembly. The CLU incorporates an integrated day-night sight       that provides a target engagement capability in adverse       weather and countermeasure environments. The CLU may also be       used in a stand-alone mode for battlefield surveillance and       target detection. The CLU's thermal sight is a second       generation Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) sensor. To       facilitate initial loading and subsequent updating of       software, all on-board missile software is uploaded via the       CLU after mating and prior to launch.        4. The missile is autonomously guided to the target using       an imaging infrared seeker and adaptive correlation tracking       algorithms. This allows the gunner to take cover or reload       and engage another target after firing a missile. The missile       has an advanced tandem warhead and can be used in either the       top attack or direct fire modes (for target undercover). An       onboard flight computer guides the missile to the selected       target.        5. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        6. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware or software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        7. A determination has been made that Thailand can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This       proposed sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign       policy and national security objectives outlined in the       Policy Justification.        8. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal are authorized for release and export to the       Government of Thailand.                            ____________________     Madam President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export  Control Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of  certain proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.
