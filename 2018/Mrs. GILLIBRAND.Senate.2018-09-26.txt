 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise to speak about Judge  Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court.   I urge my colleagues to actually listen to Dr. Blasey Ford and treat  her with the respect that she deserves. She deserves better than the  setup she is walking into tomorrow.   I want to take a step back for a second and look at the big picture  of what is actually going on with this nomination. We have a nominee  for a lifetime appointment to the highest Court in the land who has  been accused, credibly, of sexual assault. Dr. Blasey Ford reluctantly  came forward out of civic duty and said that Brett Kavanaugh tried to  rape her in high school. She is now facing death threats for her  courage, and her worst fears of how she would be treated by this body  have come to fruition.   Another woman, Deborah Ramirez, agreed to tell her story after being  contacted by a reporter--again, risking her career and her safety--and  said that Brett Kavanaugh exposed himself to her face in college while  laughing, as part of a game.   These accusations are disturbing enough by themselves, but the  response to these allegations by our colleagues are so disappointing.  Take a look at how Dr. Blasey Ford is being bullied because she told  her story. Listen to how she is being patronized and dismissed by some  Members of the Judiciary Committee. Look at how our President belittled  and demeaned Dr. Blasey Ford and Ms. Ramirez, reminding us once again  that he has been credibly accused of committing sexual assault himself  and denigrates not just women who accuse him but survivors everywhere.   That is not all. The chief counsel of the Senate Judiciary Committee  tweeted after Dr. Blasey Ford's sexual assault allegation: ``Unfazed  and determined. We will confirm Judge Kavanaugh.''   According to Ms. Ramirez's lawyer, the Judiciary Committee isn't even  interested in taking her claims seriously or getting information from  her about her claims. Instead of getting the facts--instead of even  wanting the facts--they try to dismiss this as a smear campaign and  plow right ahead.   For anyone who has ever wondered why so many survivors of sexual  assault don't come forward--obviously, there is trauma, but there is  also the fear of this very kind of retaliation and scorn. The question  I have, that I know you have: Do we value women in this country? Do we  listen to women when they tell us about sexual trauma? Do we listen to  their stories about how their lives have been forever scarred? Do we  take their claims seriously or do we just disbelieve them as a matter  of course?   I want to echo the words of my colleague from Alaska: ``It is about  whether or not a woman who has been a victim at some point of her life  is to be believed.''   I believe Dr. Blasey Ford. Here is why I believe her. She has risked  everything--her own safety--to come out on the record to say Brett  Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her. She told her therapist and her  husband about it 5 years ago. She told a friend about it a year ago.  She told a reporter about it before Kavanaugh was ever named. She has  even taken a lie detector test.   Why are my colleagues moving so fast, as fast as they possibly can,  to confirm this judge?  [[Page S6318]]    This process is sending the worst possible message to girls and boys  everywhere. It is telling American women that your voices don't matter.  It is telling survivors everywhere that your experiences don't count,  that they are not important, and that they are not to be believed. We  are saying that women are worth less than a man's promotion. That is  not how the world is in 2018, and we cannot allow this Senate, this  body, to take us back to before 1991.   To those whom I hear say over and over that this isn't fair to Judge  Kavanaugh, that he is entitled to due process and to the presumption of  innocence until proven guilty and that Dr. Blasey Ford has to prove her  case beyond a reasonable doubt, those are the standards for a trial.  Those are the standards in criminal justice. We are not having a trial.  This is not a court. He is not entitled to those because we are not  actually seeking to convict him or to put him in jail. We are seeking  the truth. We are seeking facts. We are seeking just what happened.   We, Senators--not staff members, not female lawyers--are being asked  to assess his honesty. Is he an honest person? Is he trustworthy? Can  we trust him to do the right thing for decades? To rule on women's  lives for decades to come? Can we trust him to do that right?   This is not about whether he should be convicted. This is about  whether he has the privilege to serve on the highest Court of the land  for a lifetime. This is not a court of law. This is a job interview,  and it is our job as Senators to assess if he is honest. Has he lied  about his past? Has he misled members of the Judiciary Committee? Is he  trustworthy?   One point, I think, that our colleagues are somewhat blind to, which  I know the Presiding Officer is not, is that the last 2 weeks have been  so painful for women who have experienced sexual trauma. Women have  lived through this. So, when they are watching some of the most  powerful people in this country disregard, distrust, disbelieve,  minimize, devalue, unfortunately, it is painful for all of them. It is  painful because you are tired of seeing the same old outcome every  single time. You are tired of the scenarios in which the men are  believed and the women are not. They can't believe their eyes when they  see two women being treated with less respect and having less of a  process than even Anita Hill received.   I quote a friend of mine, Amina Sow, who just disclosed today that  she is a survivor. Her words are powerful and truthful and describe  exactly the way many people feel:         The truth is our strength. We are each other's strengths.       To the women who are struggling: I see you. I am sorry we       have to go through this. Thank you for trusting us with your       stories. I am heartened by them and honored to know about       you.    I believe Dr. Blasey Ford because she is risking everything--her  safety, her security, her reputation, her career--to tell this story at  this moment for all the right reasons. If we allow women's experiences  of sexual trauma to be second to a man's promotion, it will not only  diminish this watershed moment of the societal change we are in, but it  will bring shame on this body and on the Court.   I yield the floor.
