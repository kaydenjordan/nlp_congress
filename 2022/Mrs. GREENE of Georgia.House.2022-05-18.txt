 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this  bill.   I find it shocking to hear language coming from my colleagues across  the aisle accusing Republicans of the horrific shooting in Buffalo,  when in fact, the shooter's manifesto itself stated he acted as a lone  wolf. No Republican had anything to do with that.   I also find it shocking to hear these accusations coming from the  party that supported BLM riots that caused over $2 billion in damages  in cities and communities across the country.   Now, when we are talking about identity politics, we should remind  one another that there were 6 people murdered and 62 others injured by  a Black American who drove his car through a Christmas parade in  Waukesha. There was also a Black American that shot and injured 23  people on a New York City subway. I am not hearing any of those  examples as domestic terrorism from my colleagues across the aisle, and  I don't understand why. I think these acts should be blamed on the  people that are doing them, not on people's identity and their skin  color.   Another thing that is wrong with this bill is it provides unlimited  money to profile Americans that the Department of Justice says are  white supremacists. That is why Democrats want to pursue every single  conservative in America, simply because they want to choose who is a  white supremacist and not.    Mr. Speaker, the Speaker, herself, has called  Republicans enemies of the State.   If the Speaker does not like Republicans' politics and considers us  enemies of the State, we all know what domestic terrorists will mean to  Democrats. That will mean anyone who stands in their way in their  lustful quest for power. This would be parents that are trying to hold  people accountable with their tax dollars for how their children are  taught, or anyone else that they want to blame for something they want  to use for politics.
