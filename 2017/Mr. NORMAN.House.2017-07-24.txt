 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2333, the  Small Business Investment Opportunity Act of 2017.   As a businessman, I am keenly aware of how vital small businesses are  to keeping our Nation's economy moving forward.   Small businesses alone employ nearly half of America's private sector  workforce. However, the dreams of many small business owners in South  Carolina can't be fully realized because of the serious obstacle of  accessing capital. This burden prevents the creation of more jobs and  better opportunities for the hardworking American people.   H.R. 2333 will allow the SBIC program, offered by the SBA to help  tackle lending roadblocks, to be utilized to its full potential by  increasing the individual leverage limit from $150 million to $175  million. With this legislation, small businesses will have a greater  chance to grow and help spur our economy.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of H.R. 2333  and for all of the small businesses nationwide.
