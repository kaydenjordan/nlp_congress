 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the  CR. The American people are $29 trillion in debt, thanks to Congress.  And this Congress wants to borrow more money and more time to figure  out how to run the government and how to pay for it. That is an outrage  to the American people.   You want to talk about courage and responsibility? Do you know what  courage and responsibility is?   It is learning how to manage the people's money. The people work hard  every single day. They have to pay the taxes. And then they have to  trust this House, this body, and the Senate to create a budget, but  every single time, it is the budget that puts them further and further  in debt.   It is the audacity of Congress to borrow more money and not be able  to come up with a budget that makes sense and that we can pay for.  [[Page H6889]]    What an outrage. What an irresponsibility. That isn't courage. That  is not responsibility. That is out-of-control behavior that this  Congress needs to rein in. This government should be shut down. You  want to know why it should be shut down? Because the people in here  cannot control themselves. The people in here do not understand how to  balance a checkbook. And the people in here do not deserve the  responsibility on how to spend the American people's money.   Madam Speaker, $29 trillion. Shut it down. Do not pass the CR. Shut  it down.
