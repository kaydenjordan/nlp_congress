 Mr. Speaker, the west Michigan community is mourning the  loss of Richard DeVos, a man whose spirit touched millions of lives and  helped shape Grand Rapids into the thriving city it is today.   Rich passed away on September 6 at the age of 92, survived by 4  children, 16 grandchildren, and 6 great-grandchildren. Rich follows his  late wife, Helen DeVos, who passed away at the age of 90 in October of  last year.   A World War II veteran, an entrepreneur who never feared failure,  Rich was a larger-than-life presence whose Christian faith and love for  America were evident in all that he did.   I greatly admired Rich, as did countless others, not just from west  Michigan, but from around the world, for his optimistic and caring  approach to family, friends, business, and philanthropy alike.   Anyone who knew Rich will tell you that he was an incredibly  charismatic, encouraging, and kind person. I was fortunate enough to  have a personal glimpse into this legend of a man who did so much for  the west Michigan community while his work at home and abroad was  changing the world.   While no one can fill the void that Rich's passing leaves, our  community takes comfort in knowing that his legacy of generosity,  entrepreneurship, and kindness will have a lasting impact.   May the memory of him be eternal.                            ____________________
