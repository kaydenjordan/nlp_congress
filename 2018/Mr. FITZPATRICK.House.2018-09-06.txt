 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a school in  Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, that has played a critical role in  molding the lives of countless young citizens.   Bridle Path Elementary, located in Lansdale, is part of the North  Penn School District. The staff at this school understands that the  elementary age group encompasses some of the most formative years of a  child's life. As such, Bridle Path provides a myriad of opportunities  for students to grow, thrive, and explore their interests.   One area in which Bridle Path consistently shines is in the area of  music education. Just last year, Bridle Path Elementary School Chorus,  under the leadership of band director Michael Klenk, won the 101.1 FM's  ninth annual Christmas Choir Competition.   From my experience with this community, I have witnessed their warmth  and their dedication to helping each other, and I applaud the work of  Principal Heather Mann and her dedicated team of educators and staff,  and I wish them continued success.                        Recognizing Pebble Hill Church     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a house of  worship in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, that last month celebrated its  50th anniversary.   Pebble Hill Church in Doylestown was founded in 1968. In its first  decade, the church became known for its fierce advocacy for peace and  its willingness to show independence from conventional norms.   In 1983, the Reverend Gary Culp joined the congregation, quickly  cementing the church's reputation of community service and mutual  understanding.   Each year, Pebble Hill Church honors an individual with the Harold  and Alma Able Peace Award. This year's winner was Janet Berkowitz for  her work with the organization Suicide Anonymous. September, Mr.  Speaker, is Suicide Prevention Month, and I commend Pebble Hill for  recognizing Janet and for her work in shining a light on the plight of  mental illness.   I applaud the entire Pebble Hill Church family for their sustained  commitment to making our world brighter and more peaceful. I wish the  current celebration coordinator, the Reverend Larry Hall, and all  dedicated members of the staff, volunteers, and worshippers continued  success for years to come.                   Honoring the Memory of Richard Stricker     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of a  community icon in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania.   Richard Stricker, who passed away in late 2015, spent decades  dedicated to public service. A former council member who served on the  Lansdale Cemetery Board of Directors for over 50 years, Richard was a  fixture in Lansdale.   He was fittingly recognized on this year's Founders Day, receiving  the Lansdale Borough's Lifetime Achievement Award. Throughout his  storied career as a small businessman and a contractor and a  politician, and as a driving force in the revitalization of the  Lansdale Cemetery, Richard always treated all of his fellow citizens  with kindness and with respect.   Said Lansdale Historic Society officer Dick Shearer, you would be  ``hard-pressed to find someone who gave as much to Lansdale as he  did.''   I am proud to honor Richard Stricker for a lifetime of service, and  would like to thank the Lansdale Borough Council and Councilwoman Mary  Fuller and all of the ceremony attendees for their work in honoring the  life of this fine citizen.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I am doing something a little bit  unconventional here. I am actually speaking from the left side of the  aisle in a sign of solidarity with our good friend and colleague, Ro  Khanna, on an issue that, as Jodey Arrington pointed out,  [[Page H7910]]  doesn't just unite Americans, it unites 80 percent of Americans. Eighty  percent. How many issues are out there that enjoy the support of 80  percent of the American people?   A lot of our colleagues here, when you are dealing with the rigors of  this job, say one thing, give you one piece of advice: Never forget why  you ran. Just remember that theme that caused you to make that  difficult decision.   I think that the reason we all ran was this: term limits to fix a  broken system. The genesis of that desire, the genesis of that belief  may vary amongst many of us. I can tell you where it came from with me,  Mr. Speaker, and that was my time running the political corruption unit  at FBI headquarters right down this road here, where you are  responsible for a lot of cases.   Like many jobs, when you go home at night, sometimes you take a step  back and you think: Well, if I were ever given the opportunity to have  a policymaking role to change this brokenness, what would I do?   At the top of that list, Mr. Speaker, was legislative term limits.   You heard my friend and colleague, Jodey Arrington, talk about George  Washington, my favorite President ever, for this very reason: he set  this tradition in motion. He said he only wanted to serve one term, go  back to his farm in Mount Vernon, live under the laws he helped pass,  make way for a new generation of leadership. That is the most organic  way to serve a democracy. It is the healthiest form of democracy.   They talked him into a second term. He said: No more. It was a  tradition that every single President honored, up until FDR served four  terms, at which point Congress passed the 22nd Amendment to the  Constitution. But true to form, they applied it to the executive. They  did not apply it to themselves.                                time  1745    We need a constitutional amendment for term limits in this country.   Is there anybody in this Chamber who does not agree with this very  basic principle, this very basic premise, that more organic change in  this organization, in this body, is a good thing?   Mr. Speaker, in the FBI, we had term limits in the Bureau. If you  were a supervisor, you had to serve up to 7 years--no more, not a day  longer than 7 years.   Do you lose some good people? Of course you do.   Overall, did it benefit the institution? You bet you it did. You bet  you it did. It brought people in from different places, different  perspectives, different educational backgrounds. They had an  opportunity to serve and lend their area of expertise.   That is a good thing for this institution. It is a good thing for our  country. It is not just from the corruption standpoint; it is from the  getting along standpoint.   I can tell you how proud I am of this freshman class--so proud. I am  particularly proud of Ro Khanna, mostly because he is from Bucks  County--the most special place in America, I might add--and now  representing Silicon Valley.   Here you have an issue. Ro and I come from different parties. We  checked different boxes on our voter registration form when we were 18  years old. We grew up in the same community; we care about the same  things; and we have an issue here that unites us.   Jodey Arrington, a very wise man, identified this--and I couldn't  agree more--as a root issue. So much of what we deal with in this  House, so much of what we deal with in this country are symptoms. It is  symptomatic of what the root issues are. The root issues get to the  functionality of this body.   The Problem Solvers Caucus introduced a Break the Gridlock package  essential to changing the way things operate here. The government  reform, anticorruption legislation that several Members have  introduced, myself included, on term limits, on dealing with things  like no budget, no pay, these are important things that will  fundamentally change the way this body works. And when we do that, we  will win back the trust and support of the American people, too many of  whom have lost faith in this institution--and for good reason.   We can make those changes. This is Exhibit A of what we need to do to  fix a broken system, to restore that trust. Mr. Speaker, it is an 80  percent issue.   How dare we not address, on the floor of this House, an issue that  addresses the root cause of our problems that is supported by 80  percent of the American people. We have to get this done.   I want to thank my colleague, Jodey. This is an issue that fires both  of us up. We talk about it every single day we are on the floor of the  House of Representatives: my friend  Mike Gallagher from Wisconsin, who  did the first Special Order on term limits shortly after we got sworn  in, and my friend Ro Khanna, who has shown incredible courage. This is  a man who could serve here for a long, long time, but he is making a  courageous decision to stand for what is right, what is good for this  institution, what is good for this country. God bless Mr. Khanna for  doing that.
