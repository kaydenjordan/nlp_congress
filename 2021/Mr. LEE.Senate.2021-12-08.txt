 Mr. President, Congress, not the Executive, makes the laws  in this country. National laws have to be passed by the legislative  branch. Our Constitution makes that very clear. In fact, it is the very  clause of the first section of the first article of the Constitution.  It states unambiguously:         All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a       Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a       Senate and House of Representatives.    You cannot make up Federal law without going through that formula-- passage in the House, passage in the Senate, followed by presentment to  the President.   In the case of COVID-19 vaccine requirements, the President of the  United States has decreed mandates--mandates that threaten the jobs and  the livelihoods of 45 million Americans, including over half a million  Utahns whose jobs are on the line.   Now, courts across the country have started--quite correctly--to  recognize that these mandates are offensive to the Constitution. They  are not authorized by the law. But that doesn't diminish in any way,  shape, or form our duty here as Members of the U.S. Senate, as part of  the legislative branch, to assert clearly, unambiguously, and swiftly  that these mandates are unconstitutional, illegal, and morally  indefensible.   I have heard from hundreds of Utahns who are themselves at risk of  losing their jobs and therefore their ability to provide food for their  children, specifically due to these mandates. Their stories are nothing  short of heartbreaking. I have heard from countless businesses in my  State, businesses that are afraid of losing key workers and having to  shut their doors and no longer operate specifically due to these  mandates. I have heard from people who happen to have medical or  religious concerns over the vaccines, and their pleas are falling on  deaf ears.   These Americans aren't asking for anything extravagant or unusual or  unreasonable--far from it. These are Americans who are simply worried  about their ability to put food on the table and gifts under the tree  during challenging economic times--economic times that are difficult  enough as it now stands, economic times that have been worsened by  excessive government spending, economic times that are about to get a  whole lot more difficult for a whole lot more people specifically  because of these mandates. President Biden seeks to make them not only  unemployed but also unemployable, second-class pariahs.   Well, it is true the courts have offered temporary relief to some,  but these Americans and these businesses look to Congress for  immediate, lasting, and permanent relief. We do, after all, make the  law. We are the only branch of the Federal Government authorized to do  so.   So this will be one of the easiest votes that I have ever cast in my  11 years in the Senate. The American people agree. Only 14 percent of  those polled support firing those who are unvaccinated. Fourteen  percent of all Americans say that, yeah, somebody who doesn't get the  vaccine ought to be fired as a result of not getting the vaccine. Even  some Democratic politicians are starting to change their tune. They are  souring on the mandates.   Americans understand that conditioning employment on personal medical  decisions is callous, it is cruel, and it is immoral. It is certainly  not something that these people want to face. It is not something that  Democrats or Republicans want. It is not something they agree with. It  is not something they are going to tolerate.   The economic impact of firing half a million Utahns would be  disastrous,  [[Page S9030]]  and when you replicate the effects of doing that on State after State,  where we see--according to many datasets, anywhere from a quarter to a  third of the workforce in most States is being threatened by this. In  some States, it is higher. It is more like 40 percent in places like  West Virginia, 37 percent in Alabama, and 31 percent in Utah.   Now, in the healthcare sector alone, where keeping doctors and nurses  and technicians at work has been particularly difficult, the Nation  risks losing countless thousands of key professionals while the need  for their very services remains most dire.   This isn't acceptable. It is not something we want to see. It is not  something we should have to face.   When you add all of this up, the cumulative effect across different  industries and in different States across the Nation would be  catastrophic as we face supply chain troubles, inflation, rising gas  prices, a labor shortage, and so, so much more. The very last thing our  economy needs is to have tens of millions of Americans unemployed.   I am very, very much against these mandates. I am for the vaccines. I  have been vaccinated. My family has been vaccinated; and I have  encouraged people everywhere to get vaccinated, but when someone  chooses not to be vaccinated for whatever reason--whether it is a  medical reason or a religious reason or a reason related to a personal  belief or due to a specific concern about a specific reaction they have  had to something else--it is still their decision. It still doesn't  warrant the overpowering hand of the Federal Government's coming in and  threatening to force their employers to fire them under the threat of  crippling penalties--penalties that any employer, no matter how big or  wealthy or otherwise lucrative, would find incapacitating.   I have come to the Senate floor now 20 times to speak specifically  against President Biden's vaccine mandates. I have offered more than a  dozen bills to reduce their harms on millions of Americans and hundreds  of thousands of Utahns.   Today, with my colleagues, I encourage the Senate to use the  Congressional Review Act as it was intended. There is no clearer  example in the history of the Congressional Review Act of such an  egregious overstep by the Executive. There is no more blatant abuse of  delegated authority or usurpation of authority that was never granted.  The Congressional Review Act provides us with the opportunity to strike  down this offensive mandate and make sure that neither President Biden  nor any subsequent President can institute a similar rule.   I encourage my colleagues to think of the half a million Utahns, of  the almost 5 million Californians, of the 300,000 West Virginians, and  of the tens of millions elsewhere across the Nation. Forty-five million  livelihoods are at stake of the workers and families in each of our  States. These Americans demand that we take action. Today, we have that  choice. I implore each and every one of my colleagues to stand with the  American people, the American worker, the American family by supporting  this resolution.
