 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 9, and I ask that  it be reported by number.    Mr. President, there is no responsibility we have as  Members of Congress more serious than protecting the men and women who  defend this Nation. We are facing a national security crisis due to Joe  Biden and his administration, which have repeatedly been unwilling to  act against repeated hostilities from the nation of Iran. They have  looked repeatedly for excuses to justify that inaction.   Now, I want to be clear. I am not where some Members of this body are  who want to maintain this authorization for use of military force. I  want to vote to repeal this authorization for use of military force.  The Iraq war was a long time ago, and I believe the Iraq war was a  mistake at the time it was fought. I would be enthusiastic about  Congress reasserting its war-making and war-declaring power by  repealing the AUMF.   But, at the same time, I don't want the repeal of the AUMF to be used  as an excuse by the Biden administration to roll over and do nothing if  and when Iran attacks and murders American soldiers, sailors, airmen,  and marines in the Middle East. And this is not hypothetical.   Just last week, General Milley, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff, testified before the House that from January 2021 until last  week, there were 78 attacks against American forces in the Middle East  by Iranian-linked fighters--78. The Biden administration responded 3  times; 75 of them went unresponded. Tragically, but predictably,  appeasement doesn't work.   On Thursday morning, the CENTCOM Commander was testifying in front of  the House. Here on the floor of the Senate, we were debating this very  issue of the AUMF and Iranian aggression. We now know that, at 6:30 in  the morning eastern time on Thursday, Iran attacked U.S. forces,  murdered a U.S. citizen--a U.S. contractor--and wounded six other  Americans. That happened at 6:30 in the morning eastern time on  Thursday.   The Presiding Officer didn't know that on Thursday. I didn't know  that on Thursday. None of us knew that on Thursday. Why? Because the  Biden administration kept it a secret for 12 hours because they didn't  want to tell the Senate, while we were debating this issue, that an  American had just been murdered by Iran. That is disgraceful. The  Presiding Officer should be angry about it; I should be angry about it.   My amendment is very simple. My amendment restates that under article  II of the Constitution, the President has the authority to defend U.S.  troops and to respond to Iranian aggression.   The opponent of this bill, my friend Senator Kaine, will speak  shortly. What he said to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was  that the amendment is unnecessary; that article II already does that.  Well, good. If it is unnecessary, then the Democrats ought to support  my amendment and add it. Because I will tell you what it will get: If  we add this amendment, I will vote yes on the AUMF repeal. If we don't  add this amendment, I am a no.   Here is why: I don't want to give an excuse for the Biden  administration, the next time Iran attacks, to do nothing. If it is  unnecessary legally, it ought to be an easy give to say, ``Let's add  it, to be clear, that if you attack U.S. forces, the President has the  authority to respond,'' because I don't  [[Page S983]]  want the Biden administration using the repeal of the AUMF as an excuse  for their weakness or as an excuse for their appeasement.   There are some in the political world who are in favor of unending  wars. I am not one of them, but I am in favor of the United States  defending our soldiers and sailors and airmen and marines.   Let me say this: I don't know if the amendment is going to get the  votes or not to pass. I think we will get most of the Republicans, and  I don't know if any Democrats will vote for it or not. But if this  amendment is defeated and the Congress goes on to repeal the AUMF and  Iran takes that as encouragement that the Biden administration will not  retaliate, I believe the consequences will be lives lost. I believe we  will be back on this floor with American soldiers and sailors and  airmen and marines having lost their lives due to Iranian aggression  because the Ayatollah believed the Biden administration would not  respond. The Presiding Officer doesn't want to see that. I don't want  to see that. I believe no Member of this body wants to see that.   If it is legally redundant, all the better to say: Let's send a  message to the Ayatollah that if you attack American forces, the  President--the Commander in Chief--has the authority to respond and  defend American forces.   That is the No. 1 responsibility of every Member of this body.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I respect my friend from Virginia, but he is  mistaken. This amendment is not a new authorization for military force.  It restates current law. The language in the finding is, word for word,  the finding that President Trump put in place when he authorized the  strike that took out General Soleimani.   After that strike against General Soleimani, I introduced an  amendment on this floor to commend President Trump and the Armed Forces  for taking out General Soleimani; and we voted on this, commending  President Trump and our Armed Forces for taking out Soleimani. This is  not breaking new ground. This is reiterating the proposition that the  Commander in Chief has the authority to defend U.S. Armed Forces.   To my friend from Virginia, I would note, by the way, earlier last  week, we voted on Senator Graham's amendment that would have been a new  authorization for use of military force. Many Senators voted against  it. This is a much narrower amendment. This says if Iran attacks U.S.  troops, the Commander in Chief can defend those troops. That is current  law, but it is important for Iran to hear. It is important for our  troops to hear. It is important for the Biden administration to hear.   Nowhere in my friend from Virginia's remarks did he dispute that Iran  has attacked the United States 78 times in the last 2\1/2\ years and  that the Biden administration has responded only three times. We owe  our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines to have their backs.   I urge support of this amendment.                           Vote on Amendment No. 9     I ask for the yeas and nays.
