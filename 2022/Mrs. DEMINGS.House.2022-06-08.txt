 Madam Speaker, as a police chief, I was expected to get  things done, to do everything within my power to keep people safe.   Offering thoughts and prayers is fine. My grandchildren do that. But  if that was all I did as a police chief after mass shootings, no one  would have let me get away with that. Well, there is an expectation for  Congress, too, to do more.   Madam Speaker, what is painfully wrong with this tragic moment in our  history are the people who want the power of the position but not  really the responsibility.   Congress failed that little girl who could only be identified by her  green tennis shoes. Congress failed the loved ones in Buffalo, at the  Pulse nightclub, and in Newtown.   After the Parkland shooting in Florida, Republican legislators helped  pass red flag laws and other meaningful legislation to keep guns out of  the hands of dangerous people.   Will we do something? Haven't we had enough, or is it just too scary  to do the right thing?
