 Mr. Speaker, last Friday, straight from the  train, I had the opportunity to join fellow Delawarians for a rally in  support of DREAMers in our State and across our country. These are  young adults who were brought to America as children. This is the only  home they know.   I have had the opportunity to hear from some of the 75 DREAMers at  Delaware State University. Every single one of them is excelling. They  are part of our future.   Ending DACA will cost Delaware's GDP $88 million, and create a loss  of nearly $460 billion for our country.   America thrives on our diversity. We have a moral obligation to stand  up for these young Americans, and I will continue to join my colleagues  in fighting to reinstate DACA.                            ____________________
