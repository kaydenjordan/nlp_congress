 Madam President, I rise today to talk on two issues.   First, I would like to talk about the criminal justice reform act  that Senator Durbin just spoke of. Rather than repeating all that has  been said and all of the positive things--and Senator Durbin did an  outstanding job outlining all of the issues and how important this bill  is for the criminal justice system and for the American public--I would  like to take a moment just to commend my colleagues--particularly  Senator Durbin and Senator Grassley, Senator Lee, Senator Booker,  colleagues in the House of Representatives, and those at the White  House who worked so tirelessly over the years to achieve this result.  This is a remarkable achievement for the people of this country.   I have worked, as most people in this body know, for a number of  years as both a prosecutor and as a defense lawyer. In that capacity, I  have seen firsthand the problems in a system of justice that seems to  have gotten out of whack and that has incarcerated so many people--more  than just about any civilized country in the world--and yields very  little results.   So what I see is an effort of Republicans and Democrats coming  together. When I ran for this office last year, I talked consistently  about a country and the State of Alabama that had more in common than  we have to divide us. I talked more about reaching across the aisle and  having dialogues, instead of monologues. This bill is the perfect  example of that, and I hope the people of America see what this bill  does and see how this body and the House of Representatives and the  administration came together to pass this historic legislation.   This is a historic moment, Madam President. This is one for the ages,  there is no question. Sometimes it is so disappointing to go back home  to Alabama and hear people say: ``All I want you to do is work  together.''   All they see are dueling press conferences among the leaders and  dueling talk shows on Sunday mornings and on CNN and MSNBC and FOX  News, and they think that all we do is stand here and fight each other.  That is not the case. We have done some great things in the Senate  since I have been here on January 3. Our appropriations process has  been rolling on a bipartisan level. We passed the opioid crisis bill.  We also have the farm bill done. Now, with criminal justice--it is the  crowning achievement on what has been, over the years, one of the most  contentious issues in America. Every year, I used to say that the  system of justice in America that was damaged the most in election was  our criminal justice system because it seemed that everybody wanted to  demagogue it today. That is no longer the case in what has been done in  this body, the House, and with the support of the White House.   I want to commend all of those who have been involved in this over  the years before I got here, both in and out of government. I worked  for a number of years with the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU-- particularly the law enforcement leaders--to reduce crime and  incarceration. We put in countless hours, and this is the culmination  of a number of years of work. They should be commended for all they  did.   (Mr. MORAN assumed the Chair.)                          Remembering Giles Perkins    Mr. President, I want to talk about a matter that is a lot more  personal. The last couple of weeks have been somewhat difficult for me  on a very personal level. Not only have I been saddened that several of  my colleagues whom I admire so much will be leaving this body, but 2  weeks ago, I lost a dear friend and trusted adviser, Giles Perkins of  Birmingham, AL.   I so appreciate the fact that the day after his death, when I just  could not hold up and hold it together to do so myself, Senator Schumer  noted his passing in floor remarks. Giles' family appreciates those  remarks as well, but because he meant so much to his adopted State of  Alabama and the Birmingham community and the fact that he is the one  who guided the effort to elect me to this office, it is only fitting  that I honor his memory on the floor of the Senate.   Giles was a former director of the Alabama Democratic Party and  someone who worked for the last two Alabama Democratic Governors.  Originally from Texas, he came to Alabama after marrying the love of  his life, Hillery Head, in the early 1990s. Together, they have three  children: Barton, Hugh, and Beverly. For all that he did in life and  all that he accomplished, which was quite a lot, Giles was first and  foremost a husband and father, a family man whose greatest love and  source of pride were his wife and children.   When he arrived in Alabama, he immediately began to get involved in  the community and in politics. He got involved in the Folsom campaign  for Governor, telling people that he simply wanted to make a  difference. Over the next 25 years, he did just that. What a difference  he made.   While Giles was actively involved in numerous civic groups and  projects, his greatest accomplishment was turning a few blighted blocks  of real estate in the heart of the city of Birmingham into a stunning  outdoor recreational area known as Railroad Park, which has not only  provided a space for family enjoyment but spurred economic development  and became a catalyst for revitalization in downtown Birmingham.   Giles was an outstanding lawyer and community organizer, but he had  politics in his blood, and he learned the ins and outs of the shark  infested waters of Alabama politics like no other.   It was Giles whom I first approached about running for a statewide  office because I knew he shared my frustration with the state of  politics and government in the State of Alabama. It was Giles and Doug  Turner who sat me down to explain about running for the U.S. Senate-- where my heart has always been, having worked here just out of law  school--why it was important to run for that office; why, given my  background as a U.S. attorney and as a lawyer known for civil rights  work, the special election would be so important. It was also Giles who  brought in Joe Trippi, everyone else on my campaign team, and helped me  staff my Senate office.   But rather than calling him a political mentor, which just doesn't  seem to capture all that he was, I often referred to him as ``Yoda,'' a  political Jedi master, because of his vision and intuition for politics  and how politics should translate into public service. He was certainly  a master in teaching those around him how they could be wise in the  ways of the force of politics. His strategy for my campaign and my  Senate office and tenure was molded out of a vision of how Alabama and  the South can move beyond the issues that have divided us and how we  can lead the Nation in coming together and healing the partisan divide.   Many think that my election was his greatest political achievement,  but knowing him as I did, he would more likely say that it was not the  election per se but the reaction that the election gave to so many  people in Alabama and around the country who simply said that it gave  them hope. That hope for a better Alabama, for a better South, and for  a better America was his No. 1 priority.   He was brilliant, philosophical, tenacious, stubborn, funny, and so  straightforward that you thought he was sometimes just a little bit  mean--a trait you often have to have in order to have a successful  campaign.   The absolutely remarkable thing about Giles, though, was that he  managed my campaign on a daily basis--all of the calls, emails, and all  of the meetings knowing he was living on borrowed time. At the time we  began the campaign, he was a 2 year survivor of  [[Page S7647]]  pancreatic cancer, an aggressive form of cancer that takes no  prisoners. Through it all, he suffered through a number of treatments,  often texting or emailing orders or streams of consciousness while  being hooked up to chemotherapy.   When asked why he was doing all of this under the strain and pain of  his cancer and his treatments, he matter of factly said: ``Because I  want to show my children what is important and how to live.'' I am  confident that his children got that, as did I and everyone else  associated with our campaign.   Giles lost his battle on December 2, having survived for 3\1/2\ years  after being told he only had 1 month to live. In the world of  pancreatic cancer, a 3\1/2\-year survivor is remarkable in itself, but  Giles Perkins was a remarkable human who made such a positive impact on  all who knew him.   As a friend recently wrote me, ``It is because of unsung heroes such  as Giles that democracy is sustained in America'' and that we are  ``grateful for his commitment and life's work to maintaining integrity  in government.''   I know this: When the history of Alabama and the politics of my State  and the region are written, it will be Giles Perkins who will be  credited for beginning a political change that will be felt for a long,  long time.   On a personal level, he will never leave my heart and soul.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the remarks I made at  Giles' memorial last Friday be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:          Giles Perkins, Railroad Park Memorial, December 14, 2018         It is, I believe, a rare occasion when someone stands       before a grieving crowd in an effort to memorialize more than       a relative or close friend but someone who was the driving       force behind making a lifelong dream come true. That folks is       the challenge I have faced the last twelve days-Giles was my       dear friend but as you all know he was also the person       primarily responsible for making my lifelong dream of being a       United States Senator become a reality.        I have also faced the double challenge of not having Giles       around to help with my remarks. For the last 18 months or so       he helped me craft so many of my speeches, from the campaign       stump speeches to my maiden speech on the floor of the       Senate, to a broad speech about the South and our place in       history that could be adopted in a number of contexts. He was       always thinking of a bigger picture than most of us were       thinking of and regardless of who the messenger was going to       be, Giles wanted to control the message to the extent that he       could. He had the confidence and self assurance, and let's       face a little bit of arrogance--to craft the message that he       believed should be delivered. Giles knew he his fate several       weeks ago and was able to help plan this day, but when he       really started to go down, he went down rather fast. So that       is why I am convinced that he is looking down on us today and       somewhat cringing with anxiety of not really knowing what any       of us are going to say. For me in particular, knowing how he       has helped manage me the last 18 months my guess is that when       Hillery and the kids start going through his papers or his       notes on his IPad there will be something titled ``Notes for       Jones to say at my memorial.''        Well my friend, I guess I will have to give it a shot       without you.        One of the people in history that Giles admired most was       Robert Kennedy and in many ways his life mirrored that of       Bobby's.        Giles was as tough as nails, who had as firm a grip on life       and people as anyone I have ever known. Louise often called       him a gunslinger who could quickly shoot you down with simply       an expression or comment. But he also had a very soft and       gentle side, especially with his family. Above all else Giles       was a family many totally devoted to Hillery and his children       Barton, Hugh and Beverly. He adored them all and no matter       what challenges he took on, from being a lawyer, a community       activist, a political candidate, a campaign strategist or a       warrior against cancer, Giles always made time for his       family. He not only loved them but he believed in them. For       all the successes he had in life, including the election of a       mayor, a Governor and a US Senator, his wife and children       were his greatest source of pride.        Giles was also a visionary. One of Bobby Kennedy's more       famous quotes was ``Some men see things as they are and say       why, I dream things that never were and say why not?''       Whether he did it consciously or subconsciously Giles was the       embodiment of that spirit. You only have to look around you       today and this magnificent park that has done so much for the       City of Birmingham and understand what I mean. Few could have       stood at the corner of an abandoned, almost blighted part of       town and see a vision of an outdoor park where people from       all walks of life can come and enjoy the outdoors, that would       be a safe gathering spot for fun and creativity, that could       attract the kind of development that allows a city to thrive.       But Giles did, simply seeing that vision and saying why not.       You can see it in the zoo, where he and others saw the       potential of having a world class attraction free from the       constraints of being owned by the city. But Giles, did and he       said why not. And today the zoo is on the verge of a       renaissance like it has never experienced. And I am standing       before you today as a Unites States Senator because along       with his political partners of many years, Doug Turner and       Joe Trippi, Giles saw an opening for a new Alabama, an       Alabama that puts aside the divisions of the past and       embraces our diversity and sense of respect and civility for       all people. An Alabama who could lead the South. When all of       the pundits looked at a Senate race in Alabama and dismissed       the idea saying that it was not possible for a Democrat to       win, saying why would anyone even try, Giles Perkins saw an       opening, with someone who shared his vision for a better       Alabama and a better South who could lead the nation out of       our divisiveness and he said why not.        Giles got into politics for the right reasons. Not for ego       or power but to do good things. He got that from his mother,       who was a progressive member of the Texas state board of       education. When he first moved to Alabama after marrying       Hillery he approached the Folsom campaign about getting       involved. He told Peck Fox that he was from Texas but was       settling in Alabama and that he wanted to get involved in the       campaign because he wanted to make a difference. And for the       next 25 years what a difference he did make. Electing Don       Siegelman Governor. Re-electing Richard Arrington as Mayor.       Being Executive Director of the Alabama Democratic Party,       being a candidate for Attorney General and electing a US       Senator. But you can do all of those things when you are       in politics for the right reason, to make a positive       difference in people's lives. Giles believed that all       people, regardless of race or religion or gender of sexual       orientation or status in life should be treated equally       and with respect and he had no tolerance for those that       did not.        That drive to make Alabama and the South a better place is       what drove him to know and understand all things that could       bring about political success. I called him Yoda for a       reason. He taught me and so many others the ways of the Force       in politics, to stay in our lane and to focus on that which       was truly important. That was especially tough for me as I       also had that type A personality and was constantly veering       off course because I had become so concerned about minutiae.       So even though my calling him Yoda was a term of affection       and respect he called me Chicken Little as a reminder of just       how much I did not know.        He was a tough task master when it came to politics. His       firm grip on life and people became like a vise when he was       engaged in politics. He was smart, confident, efficient and       forgiving, at least to a point. He gave so many young folks a       chance but they had to perform and live up to his       expectations. They loved him and they feared him. Again, he       modeled himself after Bobby Kennedy who said about being the       campaign manager for JFK in 1960: ``I'm not running a       popularity contest. It doesn't matter if people like me or       not. Jack can be nice to them. I don't try to antagonize       people, but somebody has to be able to say no. If people are       not getting off their behinds, how do you say that nicely?''        I am told that when Giles began hiring young talent to run       the Alabama Democratic Party that the kids began to notice       that Fridays were often the days where Giles would politely       but pointedly explain to someone that they were just not       working out and should hit the road. Instead buckling down to       make sure they weren't next they just quit coming in on       Fridays. As you might imagine with Giles at the helm that was       relatively short lived and the party prospered because of his       leadership.        The same was true in our campaign last year. Because Giles       knew that we had to run a different campaign than any       Democrat had run in the last 20 years he did not rely on       those who had been in campaigns in the past, but a new       generation, one who understood social media and today's world       but yet could be taught the ways of the Force when it came to       old school politics. The kids we brought on had virtually no       real political experience but immediately set out to teach       them, bringing in books about RFK and Lyndon Johnson and the       modern political system. By his example of being engaged       everyday, whether in the campaign office or by phone or by e-      mail or text, while also battling cancer and chemotherapy       treatments he taught them, and all of us, lessons of both       politics and life. But make no mistake, while they loved and       admired him they were also scared to death of him. One of our       young men said that every time Giles walked into the room his       male body parts seemed to retreat into his gut. Believe me, I       get that. While Yoda could be a gentle teacher we also have       scars from his light saber that came in the form of his e-      mails or text messages or biting retorts if you were out of       line. I am quite sure that as word spread of Giles decision       to not seek further treatments for his cancer all of those       who worked with him or for him at any point in any of his       political endeavors were reminded of the words of Winston       Churchill who famously said: ``I am prepared to meet my       Maker. Whether my  [[Page S7648]]       Maker is prepared for the great ordeal of meeting me is       another matter.''        But it was that same young staffer who also said that as       our campaign folks called to check on each other after Giles'       death each call ended with ``Love `ya'' and it was clear that       Giles built more than a campaign, he built a family that       would long outlive him.        Over the last couple of years I came to love Giles like a       brother and came to know and appreciate him as a remarkable       human being who did so much for so many in his short time on       this planet. He died among the privileged but never, ever       forgot those less fortunate, constantly striving for a better       world for all. The words of Barack Obama at the funeral for       Ted Kennedy seem to have been written in advance for Giles       Perkins:        We cannot know for certain how long we have here.        We cannot foresee the trials or misfortunes that will test       us along the way.        We cannot know what God's plan is for us.        What we can do is to live out our lives as best we can with       purpose, and with love, and with joy.        We can use each day to show those who are closest to us how       much we care about them, and treat others with the kindness       and respect that we wish for ourselves.        We can learn from our mistakes and grow from our failures.        And we can strive at all costs to make a better world, so       that someday, if we are blessed with the chance to look back       on our time here, we know that we spent it well; that we made       a difference; that our fleeting presence had a lasting impact       on the lives of others.        This is how Giles Perkins lived. This world is better for       having pass here. We are better people because we knew him.       This is his legacy.        So my friend, may you find new challenges to meet and new       visions to share, to see things not as they are but how they       can be. May God bless you and may you Rest In Peace.        And for all eternity, May the Force be with you.   I thank the Senate for this personal moment.    I yield the floor.
