 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize and congratulate the American and global Sikh community as  they celebrate the 400th birth anniversary of their ninth Sikh Master  Guru Tegh Bahadur.   Master Guru Tegh Bahadur lived a very meaningful life. He was one of  the 10 gurus who founded Sikhism.   Islam was imposed during the reign of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. Hindu  temples were destroyed and turned into mosques, and the emperor  persecuted those who would not convert to Islamic law.   Guru Tegh Bahadur spoke out amid the persecution. He refused to  convert to Islam and, in 1675, he was beheaded in Delhi. He is  celebrated in the Sikh community because of his heroic efforts in  defending religious freedoms. Because of his efforts to protect human  rights, he is often referred to as Srishti Chadar, protector of  humanity.   Madam Speaker, Master Guru Tegh Bahadur's memory inspires us to work  even harder to support religious freedoms for everyone everywhere.                            ____________________
