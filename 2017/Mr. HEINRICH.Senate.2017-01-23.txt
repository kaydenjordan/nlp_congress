 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I thank my colleague Senator Wyden for  leading this important discussion. I joined the Senate Intelligence  Committee 4 years ago, just a few short months before the public  release of thousands of classified documents forced our country to have  a debate over the scope and reach of America's surveillance programs,  especially as they relate to American citizens.   That debate has formed the backdrop for national security policy  decisions ever since, and I am very proud of the positive steps we have  made toward reclaiming our civil liberties while still giving our  intelligence and law enforcement communities the tools they need and  deserve to anticipate threats, track down terrorists, and keep this  Nation safe. It is because of Congressman Pompeo's opposition to those  important reforms that I rise today to oppose his nomination to be the  Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Congressman Pompeo has a  long legislative and rhetorical history on surveillance, on torture,  and on other issues that I believe we simply cannot overlook in  considering his nomination.   In our conversations, in answers to written questions, and during his  confirmation hearing, Congressman Pompeo has often said the right thing  or tried to give answers that on their face give the impression that he  has changed his positions on these issues. But we need to carefully  review the Congressman's votes and public statements to be sure that he  understands the importance of protecting Americans' constitutionally  guaranteed civil liberties and meeting the needs of our national  security at the same time.   I was proud to help lead the effort to pass the USA FREEDOM Act in  2015 to finally end the government's overreach, their dragnet  collection of law-abiding Americans' personal information, and provide  the intelligence community with an updated legal framework that ensures  they have the tools they need to focus on the records of actual  terrorists, while at the same time protecting the privacy of innocent  Americans.   Although the Congressman voted to support the USA FREEDOM Act in  2015, within a year, he had backtracked, writing a column for the  National Review that stated:         Those who today suggest that the USA FREEDOM Act, which       gutted the National Security Agency's (NSA) metadata program,       enables the intelligence community to better prevent and       investigate threats against the U.S. are lying. I use that       word intentionally.    A few weeks later, Congressman Pompeo in the Wall Street Journal  wrote: ``Congress should pass a law reestablishing collection of all  metadata, and combining it with publicly available financial and  lifestyle information in a comprehensive, searchable database.''   I think I should read that one more time: ``Congress should pass a  law reestablishing collection of all metadata, and combining it with  publicly available financial and lifestyle information in a  comprehensive, searchable data base.''   Wow. I think we should unpack that sentence a little bit. First, when  asked by Senator Wyden and me to clarify what metadata he believes  should be collected, Congressman Pompeo made clear that he was  referring to a rollback of the USA FREEDOM Act and a return to the  warrantless and unnecessary collection of billions of communication  records for millions of innocent Americans not suspected of any crime.   Shortly after Congressman Pompeo's Wall Street Journal column was  published, the NSA's general counsel wrote in a column in Lawfare:  ``Largely overlooked in the debate that has ensued . . . is the fact  that under the new arrangement''--meaning the USA FREEDOM Act--``our  national security professionals will have access to a greater volume of  call records subject to query in a way that is consistent with our  regard for civil liberties.''   But, really, it is the second part of Congressman Pompeo's position  that gives me far more concern. What exactly does he mean by calling  for the collection of ``publicly available financial and lifestyle  information'' and placing it into a ``comprehensive, searchable data  base''? When asked to clarify his proposal, Congressman Pompeo  declined. However, I think it is clear from the context of both his  columns and his public statements that he believes the U.S. Government  ought to be collecting dramatically more private information from  innocent Americans who are not under investigation for a crime.   Let me be clear. The Federal Government has no business collecting  ``lifestyle information'' on its own citizens, and innocent Americans  should expect that their private financial data is just that--private.  This flies in the face of the Fourth Amendment.   On torture, Congressman Pompeo's record is also clear: He has  supported it. Congressman Pompeo thinks it was a mistake to stop the  enhanced interrogation program. He issued a very personal attack  against then-Committee Chairman Feinstein when the committee released  its report on the CIA detention and interrogation program. And while he  acknowledges that CIA interrogation techniques are currently limited to  those contained in the Army Field Manual, Congressman Pompeo said to  our committee that he will ``consult with experts at the Agency and at  other organizations in the U.S. government on whether the Army Field  Manual uniform application is an impediment to gathering vital  intelligence to protect the country or whether any rewrite of the Army  Field Manual is needed.''   One could easily infer that the Congressman would ask the CIA  officers who participated in the detention and interrogation program  whether they believe the techniques contained in the Army Field Manual  are sufficient. If he is told they are not, he has certainly left open  the option of literally rewriting the Army Field Manual. This is  problematic for a number of reasons and should be of deep concern to my  colleagues.   Finally, the day before his nomination was announced, Congressman  Pompeo tweeted that he was looking forward to ``rolling back'' the Iran  nuclear agreement, which ended each and every pathway for Iran to  develop a weaponized nuclear device, including a covert path. When I  asked him about this in our hearing, Congressman Pompeo said: ``That  communication was approved before I was aware that I was going to be  the nominee to the Central Intelligence Agency.'' The Congressman went  on to say that in his view, the Iran nuclear agreement was a ``mistake  for American national security,'' but as CIA Director, he would ``work  to make sure it is fully implemented and will endeavor to provide  straight information'' about the progress being made in reducing Iran's  nuclear capability. However, given his deep antipathy toward the Iran  agreement, I have serious concerns about his ability to be objective  about this issue, which is critical to the stability of the entire  Middle East and to our efforts to ensure that Iran never develops a  nuclear weapon.    Having said all of this, if the Congressman is confirmed, I hope he  will fulfill one of the commitments he made to me: to improve the  communications and relationship between the oversight committees in  Congress and the Agency itself. It is my hope that a CIA Director  coming from outside the Agency will give greater weight to informing  the Intelligence Committee of the CIA's activities than his immediate  predecessor has. Congressman Pompeo, if confirmed, will have an  opportunity to recalibrate this relationship, and, if given the chance,  I hope he seizes that opportunity.   Thank you. I yield the floor.
