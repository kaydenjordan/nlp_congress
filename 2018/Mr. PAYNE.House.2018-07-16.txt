 Mr. Speaker, now that the Manchurian President has come  back from meeting with his holders in Helsinki, we need to look at what  is going on here.   We were scolded today in another country by the President of the  United States telling us how: Well, Russia has made mistakes. Well, we  have made mistakes, too.   When has a President ever done that? And all my colleagues do is sit  over there and don't say a word.   Let this have been some other President, it would be holy water in  here.   He attacks women all the time--Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters, Elizabeth  Warren, Megyn Kelly, Hillary Clinton, you name it. But then stands  there next to the person that had everything to do with our elections  being rigged or held up, and he stands there and says: Well, he said he  didn't do it.   What is going on here? Is there any backbone?   The President of the United States doesn't have a backbone. What did  I see today?   It used to be being called a communist was the worst thing you could  call someone. Now they are our friends?   Wake up.
