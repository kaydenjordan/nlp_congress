 Mr. Speaker, extremists have waged an all-out war  against reproductive health freedom, and American bodies are being used  as political battlegrounds to advance their radical agenda.   Since Roe v. Wade was overturned, Americans have overwhelmingly  voiced their opposition, and we must not ignore them. I am determined  to defend reproductive healthcare rights of millions of Americans from  all racial and socioeconomic backgrounds, and I implore my colleagues  to join me in the fight.   A post-Roe America sets our country's five decades of progress  backward and threatens the health of marginalized communities who  already face systemic barriers to accessing healthcare. Extremists have  proven they will not stop until they have criminalized Americans for  their right to take ownership of their reproductive health.   It is time that we make Roe the law of the land.   I urge our colleagues across the aisle to prioritize the will of the  people and undo this grave injustice and protect it from being  overturned in the future.                            ____________________
