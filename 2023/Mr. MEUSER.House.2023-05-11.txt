 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Texas, who is  the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.   Mr. Speaker, anyone who is even slightly informed understands how  dire the immigration crisis is at our southern border.   Mr. Speaker, if you go to the border, as I have a few times, Customs  and Border Protection, the National Guard, and local and State  officials all say the same thing: the situation is out of control, our  border is not secure, and it is a human disaster.   Cartels and traffickers inform vulnerable people that it is seamless  to enter the United States illegally, putting people in terrible harm's  way.   Mr. Speaker, one-third of women are being raped, according to  reports. Hundreds are dying, perhaps thousands, and tons of fentanyl is  coming across, killing 300 mostly young Americans a day.   So what do we do?   We have a solution. It is called H.R. 2.   Mr. Speaker, it is really simple. A ``yes'' for H.R. 2 is for solving  the border crisis, and a ``no'' is for the status quo.
