 Mr. Speaker, over the past couple of  weeks I had the honor of visiting three high schools in my district,  the Richland High School, near Johnstown, Cambria Heights High School,  in Patton, and Purchase Line High School in Commodore, Pennsylvania.   As a senior member of the House Education and Labor Committee, I love  speaking with students about their learning experiences, and hearing  from faculty and staff as well.   Last week, the Richland School District invited me to join them for  their Teacher-in-Service event with award-winning educator and  principal, Salome Thomas-El. It was a pleasure to be with educators  from the Cambria County area to hear the ways that we can work together  to improve education in America.   I enjoyed hearing Mr. Thomas-El discuss the change in attitudes and  strategies of school staff, parents, and members of the community to  help the students in most need of guidance. He is currently the head of  the Thomas Edison Charter School in Wilmington, and before that, began  his career as a teacher and chess coach at Vaux Middle School.   Since then, he has published several books, received prestigious  awards, appeared on television, and Disney recently optioned the movie  rights to his best-selling book titled ``I Chose to Stay.'' He has  committed more than 20 years of his life to answering the question of  how to ensure that every child achieves their greatest potential.   The question is one that all educators seek to answer and even  policymakers in Congress; and that is why I will continue to support  legislation and initiatives that meet the needs and grow the potential  of every student.   We must also address family poverty, child nutrition, community  violence, and other barriers that affect student success.   As Mr. Thomas-El says, All children can and will learn as long as  they have adults who care enough. And he is right. In order for our  country's students to truly succeed, they need the support from adults  at home, in the classroom, and throughout their communities.   I left the in-service event with Richland School District encouraged  and  [[Page H2377]]  confident that our educators are providing essential support to their  students.   That feeling stayed with me the next day as I visited Cambria Heights  High School. There, I met with students representing music, athletics,  student council, and vocational programs at the school. Students showed  me the ongoing renovations to the high school building as part of a  major renovation of the classrooms and the cafeteria.   They also shared with me their many accomplishments that included  earning top scores in the county on the State's Keystone Exams for  literature and biology.   Earlier this week I participated in an assembly at the Purchase Line  High School in Indiana County. The students asked great questions about  civic engagement, and we had an open dialogue about the challenges and  the opportunities that are facing our Nation.   Meeting with all these students gives me great hope for the future,  and I know these students will become our next generation of leaders,  regardless of what fields they enter after graduation.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the Richland School District, Cambria Heights  High School, and the Purchase Line High School for inviting me into  their schools and sharing with me the ways they are transforming  education to help students not only graduate, but go on to earn a  higher degree or a certification or, quite frankly, go successfully  into the workforce.   A good education opens so many doors in life. I am tremendously proud  of the students, faculty, and staff of each of these outstanding  institutions.                            ____________________
