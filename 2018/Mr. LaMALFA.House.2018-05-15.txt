 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join so many of my  colleagues in recognizing National Police Week.   These days, it seems like our uniformed officers don't always receive  the respect and admiration they deserve, making this week all the more  important in my mind.   I am especially thankful for Officers David Bailey and Crystal  Griner, who, as everyone in this Chamber knows, saved many lives when  they took down an armed gunman at last year's baseball practice.   Our law enforcement officers now deal with this type of threat on a  daily basis, sometimes even from deranged individuals who specifically  want to kill cops. There were 135 officers killed in the line of duty  last year, but unlike me and you, they know the risks when they go to  work in the morning, and they accept them.   For these men and women who wear the badge each day and dedicate  their lives to making our communities a better place, it must often  feel like a thankless job.   Well, not today. I want every law enforcement officer around the  country to know that you are appreciated and you are admired. Thank you  for everything you do, and God bless you and keep you safe in your  duties.                            ____________________
