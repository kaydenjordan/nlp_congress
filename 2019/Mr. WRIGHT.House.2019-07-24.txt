 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 397. The  Rehabilitation for Multiemployer Pensions Act is nothing more than a  false promise to American workers, retirees, and their families. House  Democrats, instead of working together with us as they have done  historically, moved this bill through committee without one single  hearing or considering one single amendment.   The result? A bill that makes no structural reforms to prevent or  shore up future pension plan insolvencies. In fact, it incentivizes  pension plan managers to offer generous underfunded benefits while  taking risky bets at the cost of the American worker and retiree,  knowing full well they have a forgivable taxpayer-funded loan to fall  back on.   Mr. Speaker, I implore my colleagues to abandon this bill and instead  work with us so we can achieve forward-looking solutions to protect  workers and prevent future insolvencies.
