 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, Congress will depend on the expertise of Federal  agencies to tell us how much funding is needed by communities  recovering from disaster.   That was the case when the House passed H.R. 268 on January 16. We  set aside $10.4 million in that bill for water and sewer recovery for  areas impacted by Super Typhoon Yutu, and we relied on the  Environmental Protection Agency to verify that amount.   But, as happens in recovery situations, preliminarily estimates were  not completely accurate. When debris is removed, unseen damage is  revealed.   In March, after the House passed H.R. 268, EPA revised its estimate  of the cost for repairing sewer systems in the Marianas. But H.R. 2157,  the bill now under consideration, has not taken that new March estimate  from EPA into account. H.R. 2157 simply repeats what was in H.R. 268,  the January bill.   The amendment I am offering instead relies on EPA's new, updated  assessment of the true need.   Madam Chair, I include in the Record EPA's estimate.  EPA-Related Projects To Support Typhoon Yutu Recovery in CNMI Community  Planning and Capacity Building, Infrastructure Systems, and Natural and                     Cultural Resources, March 20, 2019         Smart, Safe Growth. Implement next phase of the ongoing       FEMA-funded, EPA-managed Smart, Safe Growth project which has       helped the CNMI identify policies and practices to encourage       sustainable growth and long-term resiliency. Using       contractors and direct assistance, help the CNMI government       analyze and implement recent International Building Codes and       incorporate smart safe growth practices into local permit       decisions and longterm planning. Cost: $1.5M        Treatment for PFAS-contaminated well. Provide Granular       Activated Carbon (GAC) treatment for 6 drinking water wells       contaminated by PFAS (associated with fire retardant).       Benefit: would add about one-half million gallons per day       (0.5 MGD) to Saipan's water supply; would significantly       improve the ability to recover drinking water availability       and safety in another disaster. Cost: $2.5M        New Dandan 1.0 MG water tank. Install a new 1.0 MG tank       next to the existing 0.5 MG Dandan water tank to enhance       water delivery during a disaster and meet projected long-term       system demand. Cost: $4.0M        Waterline and service line replacement. Replace       deteriorating waterlines (Texas Rd to Oleai, San Antonio/      Afetnas, and San Roque distribution systems), and       deteriorating service lines to homes and businesses (San       Roque, Tanapag service areas). Benefit: would significantly       reduce leaks and improve drinking water system integrity;       would improve drinking water resiliency during a disaster.       Cost: $7.5M        New Kagman Reservoir. Start construction of USDA NRCS-      proposed 75 MG Water reservoir, delayed 25 years due to lack       of funding. Benefit: would eliminate agriculture use of CUC       drinking water for farming, increase drinking water supply by       30 percent, reduce drinking water salinity, and improve       drinking water quality. Cost: $8M        SCADA (water and sewer). Expand Supervisory Control and       Data Acquisition (SCADA), an electronic network control       system, from the current pilot (serving one water tank       system) to a utility-wide system for drinking water and       wastewater. Benefit: would improve water monitoring, water       production, water billing, water distribution management, and       wastewater conveyance and treatment management; would       decrease water loss, waste, and energy consumption; and       facilitate better strategic planning and decisions. Cost:       $5.0M        Agingan Wastewater Treatment Plant upgrades. Numerous       upgrades are necessary for the WWTP to meet EPA permit       conditions. As a result of previous deficiencies and damage       inflicted by Typhoon Yutu, about 1 MGD of barely-treated       sewage effluent is discharged to the ocean on an ongoing       basis. Upgrades needed include: aerator replacement, VFD       drive installation, sludge dewatering screw press, headworks       rehab, electrical rehab, corroded pipe support replacement,       and hydrogen sulfide controls. Benefits: provide adequate       wastewater treatment to protect human health and the       environment. Cost: $2.4M        Sadog Tasi Wastewater Treatment Plant upgrades. Situation       is similar to Agingan  [[Page H3702]]       WWTP with even additional needed upgrades, including       clarifier retrofit and improvements to sludge digester. Cost:       $3.2M        Lift Station upgrades. Lift stations need new pumps, piping       and valves, VFD controls, generator overhaul, and wetwell       aeration to improve compliance, as well as gates, fencing,       and lighting to improve security. Backup generators damaged       by flooding and high winds also need improvements. Benefit:       would reduce sewage spills and overflows on land and       nearshore, both following a disaster and on a long-term       basis. Cost: $8.4M        Lower Base and Beach Road Sewer system replacement. Replace       the deteriorating old (pre-Trust Territories era) sewage       collection system in Lower Base (Saipan's main industrial       area), including installation of one new lift station Along       Beach Road, replace deteriorating old sewage lines as CNMI       DPW makes roadway improvements. (Note the Beach Road project       cost includes only Phase I at $2.5M; the entire project would       cost $12M.) Cost: $7.0M        Marpi Landfill improvements. Debris from Typhoon Yutu and       other recent typhoons are enough to ``fill half a Rose       Bowl.'' Much of the debris is lying on open ground next to       the existing Marpi Landfill, exacerbating an already non-      compliant situation. The landfill's Cell #1 is already       overcapacity. Cell #2 has been constructed but requires       repairs and additional enhancements before it is RCRA-      compliant and can accept waste. Cell #3 is designed but       requires construction in order to accommodate typhoon debris       as well as Saipan's regular municipal waste. Cost: $32M ($12M       for Cell #2 repairs + $20M for Cell #3 construction)        Tinian landfill construction. No landfill currently exists       on Tinian. A new landfill is needed to accommodate typhoon       debris as well as municipal waste. Cost: $12M        Rota landfill construction. No landfill currently exists on       Rota. A new landfill is needed to accommodate typhoon debris       as well as municipal waste. Cost $12M        Provide a Sustainability Advisor for recovery operations.       This position will advise the FEMA Interagency Recovery       Coordination team, Recovery Support Functions (RSFs),       Federal, territorial and local officials on sustainable       communities, climate change adaptation and low-impact growth,       materials and products for recovery planners in the       adaptation of sustainable, green, and resilient principles       and practices.        Access to EPA's Recovery/Sustainability HQ blanket purchase       agreement (BPA) capacity that can provide expect subject       matter assistance. This blanket purchase agreement is focused       on technical assistance related to assessing policy barriers       and facilitating planning workshops which covers a range of       topics related to community revitalization. The core subject       matter of the assistance will center upon community       revitalization, but the expertise required includes topics       such as:        Strategies for encouraging redevelopment in distressed       neighborhoods        Resiliency/hazard mitigation/sustainable long-term recovery        Green infrastructure and complete streets        Equitable development        Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and scenario planning       tools        Community wealth building strategies in collaboration with       anchor institutions,        Economic diversification through place-based local food       system expansion,        Improving human health through healthy community design        Broadband internet as a catalyst for workforce and small       business development        Revitalization strategies based on recreational assets        Public engagement, including with hard-to-reach or       environmentally overburdened populations.        Air Quality & Energy. Provide staff expertise on energy       efficiency (including EnergySTAR resources), renewable       energy, and electric vehicle readiness to assist with       rebuilding efforts.        Drinking Water Systems. Develop and increase the capacity       and resiliency of public water systems by supporting capacity       development and operator certification programs.        Brownfields and Land Revitalization. Help the CNMI identify       brownfields that support long-term sustainability planning       efforts and can be redeveloped for a higher public use.       Ensure brownfields redevelopment and land revitalization are       included as priorities in local planning efforts; advance the       reuse of sites perceived as being contaminated post- and pre-      typhoon.     EPA reports that funds will be needed to upgrade the  Agingan and Sadog Tasi wastewater treatment plants ``as a result of  damage inflicted by Typhoon Yutu,'' and for lift stations and backup  generators that were ``damaged by flooding and high winds.'' EPA says  these projects cost $14 million.   My amendment takes into account funding already in the base bill,  however, and asks only for an increase of $8.8 million. Again, this  requested increase is based on EPA's estimates only available after  passage of H.R. 268, the bill on which H.R. 2157 is based.   Madam Chair, I ask my colleagues for their support of my amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have no further speakers. I ask for  support of Sablan amendment No. 3 and the underlying bill, H.R. 2157.   Madam Chair, I thank my colleague and friend from American Samoa for  her support of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
