 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. Walorski for her hard work on  this particular piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1759, the BRIDGE  for Workers Act, also known as the Building on Reemployment  Improvements to Deliver Good Employment for Workers Act. I am also  proud to join Congresswoman Murphy, Congresswoman Torres Small, and  Congressman Davis, my colleague from Illinois, in being part of this  bipartisan legislation.   Since becoming a member of the Ways and Means Committee, I have been  focused on closing the JOBS Act, improving workforce development, and  removing barriers to employment.   It is incumbent upon our Federal Government, in coordination with  States and local governments, to ensure that those looking for a job  have the necessary tools and skills they need to get back into the  workforce.   Last Congress, we worked in a bipartisan fashion to codify into law  the Reemployment Services and Eligibility Assessments program,  bolstering its funding and improving the effectiveness. These  reemployment services include career counseling, resume support,  individualized reemployment plans, and access to trainings for those  receiving unemployment insurance.   The goal of this program is to promote rapid reemployment and,  ultimately, shorten benefit durations for all unemployment insurance  claimants, not just those most likely to exhaust all benefits.   This bill makes a technical correction to ensure that States have the  flexibility to provide reemployment services to all insurance claimants  from a variety of backgrounds and help them return to work more  quickly. This legislation builds on the recent law that improved the  reemployment service program and will ensure that those in need of  these services will be able to access them.   With over 7 million unfilled jobs in this country, it is crucial we  work with our States, including my home State of Illinois, to provide  the necessary resources to fill these jobs. Finding skilled workers is  one of the number one issues in my district and many districts across  the country: finding enough relief welders, truck drivers, construction  workers, machinists, nurses, technicians, just to name a few.   Empowering individuals to get off the sideline and back into the  workforce is something this body should always strive to achieve. Every  week that a person is out of work, through no fault of their own, is a  week too long. This bipartisan fix to reemployment will help these  individuals get back to receiving what they want most: a job and a  paycheck.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee  for their support on this legislation, and I urge its passage in the  House.                                time  1330     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1957,  the Taxpayer First Act. I thank Chairman Lewis and Ranking Member Kelly  for their hard work on the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight and  for introducing this important piece of legislation to modernize and  improve the Internal Revenue Service.   Since last Congress, our committee has focused on finding legislative  solutions to make needed changes at the IRS. Dealing with the IRS can  be frustrating, and ensuring an efficient and transparent IRS is key to  restoring the relationship between taxpayers and the agency, as well as  effective implementation of our Tax Code.   I am pleased that a bill I introduced with a Democratic colleague,  Congressman  Tom Suozzi, H.R. 1825, the Improving Assistance for  Taxpayers Act, is included in this bill. Currently, the Office of the  Taxpayer Advocate located within the IRS represents taxpayer interests  and helps address both individual and systemic issues at the agency.  When it comes to addressing systemic issues, the taxpayer advocate can  issue what is called a taxpayer advocate directive. Unfortunately,  these orders are not always responded to in a detailed or timely  manner.    Our bill aims to improve the process. Specifically, the IRS would be  required to respond to taxpayer advocate directives within 90 days. We  also establish an appeals process, when the advocate deems necessary.  If detailed and timely responses are not provided, then the taxpayer  advocate must report such instances to Congress.   This bill empowers taxpayers across the country by improving  transparency and ensuring substantive and timely answers for taxpayers  dealing with an issue at the IRS while improving congressional  oversight.   Our constituents sent us to Washington to make government more  effective, efficient, and accountable. These reforms included in my  bill and the Taxpayer First Act will do exactly that. This package  passed the House last Congress, and I hope to receive the same support  from my colleagues today.
