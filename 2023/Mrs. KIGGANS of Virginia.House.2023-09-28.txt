 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to stand up for  the men and women serving in America's armed forces. I am working day  in and day out to prevent a government shutdown in just over 48 hours.  If Congress can't reach deal on government funding before Saturday  night, those serving in our military will not receive their paychecks.   I will not allow the men and women who put their lives on the line to  protect our country to go without pay.   That is why I introduced the Pay Our Troops Act, which would ensure  our troops, including the Coast Guard, will be paid on time no matter  what. As we continue working to avoid a government shutdown, my  bipartisan legislation would give our troops the financial reassurance  they deserve.   Our servicemembers shouldn't suffer because of Washington  dysfunction, especially not at a time when inflation and interest rates  continue to hurt our military families.   I am a Navy veteran, a Navy spouse, and a Navy mom. I know first hand  that far too many of our service families live paycheck to paycheck. In  fact, one in three families have less than $3,000 in savings. For the  sake of those families and all of our military families, I am committed  to getting our economy back on track by cutting wasteful spending. I am  also committed to ensuring our servicemembers get a paycheck, no matter  what is happening here in Washington.   Mr. Speaker, if there is anything that can unite us, it should be  taking care of our troops. I believe that we can make commonsense  spending cuts, while still responsibly funding our government and  maintaining our national security. While we continue working to prevent  a government shutdown, I urge my colleagues to join me in providing  financial certainty to our military families by supporting our Pay Our  Troops Act.                            ____________________
