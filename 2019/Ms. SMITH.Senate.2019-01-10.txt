 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded    Madam President, today and for the last 19 days, men and  women across the country are being hurt by a government shutdown that  President Trump said he was proud to cause for the wall. I rise today  on behalf of Minnesotans, on behalf of more than 4,790 hard-working  Federal employees and low-wage contractors going without pay in  Minnesota right now, and I rise today on behalf of the taxpayers of our  country who just want the government to work for them.   Since I became a Senator, just a little over a year ago, the  government has been closed three times over the President's obsession  with building an expensive, ineffective wall on our southern border. I  am all for border security, but we need to focus on real solutions, not  symbols.   So let us start with the facts. In my home State of Minnesota, the  Federal Government employs about 32,000 people as food safety  inspectors, prison guards, postal workers, and more. Of this total  number, the Center for American Progress estimates that 4,790 people  are impacted by the shutdown today in Minnesota and are furloughed or  working without pay. Over 750 of these workers have already filed for  unemployment benefits, and hundreds more are being forced to make tough  decisions about how to cover basic expenses, feed their children, and  take care of their families.   A couple of days ago, I asked Minnesotans how they are being hurt by  this shutdown because I wanted to understand how this is affecting  people in their everyday lives. In just the last 48 hours, I have heard  from Minnesota farmers who can't cash checks because the Farm Service  Agency offices are shut down and Tribal law enforcement officers who  are working without pay.   I have heard from air traffic controllers in Minnesota who came by my  office earlier this week with dozens of handwritten letters full of  stories. The letters I am about to read come from these air traffic  controllers, and I really want to thank them for sharing their stories.  These are public servants who have dedicated their careers to making  our airports safe.   Tomorrow, January 11, marks the first day when these folks--Americans  who show up at work every day to protect us--will miss their first  paycheck. What is going to happen to these families? How will they be  able to cover their credit card bills, their childcare payments, their  mortgages? These are the questions that are keeping them up at night.   I wanted to share some of their stories with you today so that those  of us in Congress and the President can keep these people uppermost in  our minds and the human impact of what is a wasteful and increasingly  harmful shutdown.   The first story comes from Michael, in Rochester, MN. Michael writes:         My wife stays at home to care for our 3 year old daughter.       She is also currently obtaining a master's degree in       education so she can be a teacher when our daughter finally       goes to school.        I am the sole income in my home. Needless to say, the       prospect of not receiving a paycheck in a week has us       wondering how we will make mortgage payments, buy food, etc.       We are more fortunate than some of my coworkers, however.       Many of them are wondering how they will pay for day care       while they continue to go to work as unpaid, essential       employees.   [[Page S122]]     The next letter is from Jonathan, from Lino Lakes, MN. This is what  Jonathan wrote:         For the last two weeks, air traffic controllers have       remained on the job, dedicated to the safety of every flight.       But we don't know when we will receive our next paycheck. My       wife is due with our fourth child in two weeks and this       uncertainty only adds to an already stressful situation.    Here is another one from Mike, from Minnetonka, MN. He is describing  the impact of the shutdown on his family's future.         I am a father to twin four-year-old boys (Jax and Finn) and       had to close their college fund account in order to pay bills       through the end of the month. The shutdown has also prevented       me from training and certifying on my last few positions to       receive a $5,000 pay raise. These hardships are going to       affect my family for years to come. The replenishment of my       boys' college fund alone could take years as a single income       family.    Mike goes on to say:         This is going to have a lasting negative impact on me and       my family. Please help stop the shutdown to lessen the       already great impact it has had on me and my family. My kids'       future and our current financial hardship depends on it.    Next is Christopher, from Dundas, MN. He writes:         As a cancer survivor, I have a huge stack of medical bills       on structured and negotiated payments. My colleagues and I       have suffered the sudden loss of our income due to this shut       down. It will be very hard to meet all of my financial       obligations.    Finally, I want to share this really heartbreaking note that I  received from a brand-new father, Joe, from Lakeville, MN. Joe enclosed  two photos of his beautiful brand-new baby boy, Oliver. Here is a  picture of Oliver. This is the picture Joe sent to me. This is what he  wrote:         This is a picture of my son, Oliver. He was born on New       Year's Eve, 10 weeks early. The only local hospital to take       babies born before 32 weeks is not in network for our       insurance. I cannot change our insurance with this qualifying       life event because those government services are closed due       to the shutdown.        Further, because there is no paid leave during a shutdown,       I am spending my days in the NICU on unpaid furlough status.       I don't know when I'll be able to change my insurance, or       when I'll get paid again. I take solace in what matters most:       Oliver is getting a little stronger and a little closer to       home every day.    Joe closed by saying:         Please do what you can to reopen the government and leave       us with one less worry.    President Trump and my Republican colleagues, listen to these stories  and think about the consequences of this reckless and increasingly  harmful shutdown.   The Senate could put an end to this right now. We could take up and  pass the bipartisan bills passed by the House--bills that have already  passed the Senate, bills that would help baby Oliver and his dad Joe  and the hundreds of thousands of other people around the country who  never asked and don't deserve to be pawns in this fight. It is our job  to do this.   Colleagues, we can do this. I don't just sit in this Chamber and say  whether my vote is what the President wants me to do. I think about  what Minnesotans want me to do. We must reopen government.   I know, colleagues, that each of you has thousands of families with  stories like this in your State and I know that you are hearing them.  Let's resolve this. Let's end this shutdown now and not let American  families down.   To the Minnesotans who are speaking up and sharing your stories, I  want to thank you, and I want to tell you to keep it up. You deserve to  be heard by our President, and you deserve a government that works for  you.   I yield the floor.
