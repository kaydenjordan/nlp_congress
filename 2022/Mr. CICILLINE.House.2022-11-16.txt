 Madam Speaker, I rise today to mark Transgender  Awareness Week.   In recent years, we have seen increased transgender visibility,  whether on our TV screens with Angelica Ross on ``Pose'' and ``American  Horror Story'' and Amy Schneider's success on ``Jeopardy!'' or in the  Federal Government with the confirmation of Admiral Levine, the  Assistant Secretary for Health.   Transgender people want and deserve the same thing we all want: to be  treated with respect and to be equal members in our communities under  our laws.   To the transgender community, I am standing here on the floor of the  House of Representatives today to tell you that you are valued, you are  loved, and your stories matter. Your identities should not just be  affirmed but celebrated.   As chair of the Congressional LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus, I will never  stop fighting for your ability to reach your full potential without  fear of discrimination, violence, or stigmatization. You deserve full  equality, nothing less.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, this bill is proof of the extraordinary  leadership of Chairman Nadler and the Judiciary Committee. He has led  our committee in a principled, determined way. I think as a result of  his leadership, the Judiciary Committee has been the most productive,  impactful, and effective committee in the Congress. While my colleagues  on the other side of the aisle look forward to a different chairman, I  acknowledge the extraordinary leadership of our current chairman.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S. 4524, the Speak  Out Act. I applaud the sponsors, Ms. Frankel, Mr. Buck, and all the  other bipartisan leaders who were part of this effort, including you,  Madam Speaker.   This commonsense legislation will prevent the enforcement of  predispute nondisclosure and nondisparagement agreements in sexual  harassment and sexual assault disputes.                                time  1245    It will ensure that any survivor who wants to share their story  without fear of judicially enforced reprisals can do so.   In fact, it is unthinkable, I hope to all of us, that widespread  sexual misconduct can be covered up and swept under the rug because of  NDAs snuck  [[Page H8522]]  into these take-it-or-leave-it contracts. It is well beyond time for  this abusive practice to end.   Enacting the Speak Out Act will bring sunlight and transparency to a  system that relies on the shadows to hide horrific conduct. It will  make our society more just. It will help end the culture of silence  that allows predators to evade accountability.   I look forward to sending this bill to the President's desk and  taking another step in our critical and ongoing work to eliminate the  forced silence that prevents survivors of sexual misconduct from having  their voices heard.   Before closing, I want to address the argument raised by some of my  Republican colleagues that the Speak Out Act interferes with the rights  of States to establish their own laws on this issue. They are missing  the point. This legislation protects an American value by prohibiting  survivor censorship and defending the freedom of survivors to tell  their own stories. This baseline freedom should not vary from State to  State.   Finally, I want to say that the Speak Out Act creates a floor for the  basic protection of survivors' rights to speak out, not a ceiling.  States remain free to enact stronger protections for survivors.  According to reports, 15 States have done just that, with some States  like California banning the use of NDAs entirely. Federal legislation  is still necessary because survivors should not have to rely on a  patchwork of varying States, uncertain which might apply to them.   Finally, I end by noting that I am a little bit confused and, I will  be honest, disappointed by the opposition I have heard from some of my  Republican colleagues in light of their previous statements.   For example, during consideration of legislation that prohibited the  enforcement of forced arbitration clauses in the same kinds of cases,  Mr. Jordan, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, said:  ``Victims of sexual harassment and sexual assault must have their  claims heard. They must never be silenced or intimidated into  silence.''   The Speak Out Act provides precisely that protection. I strongly urge  my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation that was passed  unanimously in the Senate that builds upon the great work of you, Madam  Speaker, in H.R. 4445 so that, once and for all, we can no longer  provide protection to predators and abusers that are acting with  impunity in workplaces all over America.
