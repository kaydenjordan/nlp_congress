 Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Armed Services Chairman  Thornberry and Ranking Member Smith for their support of my amendment  to direct the Secretary of Defense to report on military cooperation  between Serbia and Russia. I would also like to thank the gentleman  from Alabama, Mr. Aderholt, for cosponsoring the amendment.   Countries of the Balkans are a part of Europe. Period. From the  former Yugoslavia, three have already entered NATO and two are now part  of the European Union. In the wider Balkans, even more countries have  joined NATO and the EU and others want to be part of both . . . . all,  except for Serbia, that is, which is unwilling to put itself on a path  to future NATO membership.   Frankly, Serbia is not only keeping NATO at arms' length. As we  speak, it is continuing to rearm with Russian weapons. In a deal  reached on December 21 of last year, Russia agreed to give Serbia six  surplus MiG-29 `Fulcrum' fighter aircraft, 30 T-72 tanks, and 30 BRDM-2  armored reconnaissance vehicles. Rather than forcing Belgrade to pay  for these items worth more than $600 million on the open market, the  Kremlin just gave them to Belgrade. And, now Serbia is seeking Russian- made S-300 anti-aircraft missiles. If I were sitting in one of Serbia's  neighbors, most of which are NATO members, I don't think I would be  comfortable with Belgrade's tilt toward Moscow.   Even more, only last month, Serbia joined Russia and Belarus in what  the countries' called `Slavic Brotherhood' drills very close to NATO- member Poland. This is only the latest in a series of military  exercises where Serbian forces are training with Russian troops.  According to RFE/RL, ``The first were held in 2015 in Russia's  Krasnodar Krai, which is close to Western-leaning Georgia and Ukraine's  Russian-controlled Crimean Peninsula. The second were held in November  2016 in Serbia, while NATO was staging a civil emergency drill in  neighboring Montenegro.''   If Serbia wants to become part of the West, this isn't the way to get  there. Frankly, I'm growing increasingly concerned with the choices  Belgrade is making on military and security matters. This is why I  wrote today's amendment. We need to take a closer look at Russian- Serbian military ties and judge their implications for US national  security policy, Serbia's membership in NATO's Partnership for Peace,  and the impact on Serbia's neighbors.   I know that Vice President Pence is meeting with Serbian President  Vucic on Monday. This occasion represents a good opportunity to present  our U.S. concerns about Belgrade's direction on security policy and a  variety of other matters.   Mr. Chair, again, I thank the Chairman and Ranking member for their  support, and I look forward to seeing the report required by the  amendment.   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chair, I am proud to have  introduced the Apollo I Memorial Amendment to H.R. 2810, the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018. This year is the 50th  Anniversary of the Apollo I spacecraft fire that claimed the lives of  three American heroes. With this Amendment we ensure that these three  courageous astronauts, who gave their lives in service to our great  nation, will be appropriately honored.   On January 27, 1967, Astronauts Virgil I. ``Gus'' Grissom, Edward H.  White II, and Roger B. Chaffee were killed in an electrical fire that  broke out inside their Apollo I Command Module on Launch Pad 34 at the  Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The accident led to a  detailed internal investigation and congressional hearings. As a result  of their sacrifice, NASA made needed changes to the Apollo program  which ultimately resulted in the successful Apollo 11 landing on the  moon two years later.   My Amendment requires the Secretary of the Army, in consultation with  the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  (NASA), to construct a memorial marker at Arlington National Cemetery  in their honor. This marker corrects an unfortunate omission, namely,  that these three fearless astronauts, who were set to be the ones to  fly the first Apollo mission into space, have not received a memorial  at Arlington as was done for the Space Shuttle Challenger and Columbia  crews. As Arlington National Cemetery is where we recognize heroes who  have passed in the service of our Nation, it is fitting that on the  50th anniversary of the launchpad accident we acknowledge the sacrifice  of the Apollo I Astronauts.   Mr. Chair, it is past time to install a memorial marker at Arlington  so that current and future Americans never forget their sacrifice as we  continue to reach for the stars.   Before closing, I would like to thank my colleagues on both sides of  the aisle who supported the original bill from which this Amendment was  drawn, H.R. 703, the Apollo Memorial Act. I would also like to express  my deep appreciation to both Mr. Hollingsworth of Indiana and Mr. Posey  of Florida who both offered to cosponsor this Amendment.   I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will continue to come  together to support this amendment honoring these heroes.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered  by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry).   The en bloc amendments were agreed to.
