 Mr. Speaker, since the start of the pandemic, the Federal  Government has taken historic steps to provide nearly $4 trillion in  financial and public health assistance to the American people with one  goal in mind: defeating the virus and getting our country back to  normal.   Unfortunately, President Biden and Washington Democrats' latest $1.9  trillion stimulus package focuses more on fulfilling partisan  priorities than combating COVID-19. Only 9 percent of their legislation  goes to public health spending, while the other 91 percent can be tied  to political items unrelated to the pandemic.   How can any Member of Congress who calls this legislation COVID  relief look their constituents in the eye and justify billions in  wasteful spending to foreign governments, bailouts, and liberal pet  projects?   Rather than borrowing trillions of dollars to spend on liberal wish  list items while more than $1 trillion in previously allocated COVID  relief dollars remain unspent, Congress should work on a bill that  provides temporary and targeted relief tied to COVID-19.   Mr. Speaker, the latest stimulus package fails on each account, and  for that reason, we should all be voting ``no'' on this measure.                            ____________________
