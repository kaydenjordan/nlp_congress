 Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer for the  recognition today and thank you very much for being here.   Today, the Senate is gathered in the middle of an unprecedented  pandemic. More than 220,000 Americans have died, millions more have  been infected, and millions more are out of work because of the  resulting economic crisis. These are some of the hardest times to fall  upon this Nation in decades. People are hurting. They are scared, they  are exhausted, and they are looking for help.   Millions of Americans are also looking around asking how they can  help in their communities. They are stepping up, whether it is as  members of the essential workforce, as healthcare workers, or by  donating their time or resources to a charity or local food bank. We  are seeing the best of this country.   Here in the Senate, we, too, have the power to do something to help.  On a much larger scale, we have the power and the duty. We could do  something big to help beat this virus, to help people and businesses  get back on their feet, get the kids back in school, to help make life  easier for the millions who are struggling.   Yes, the Senate is gathered in the middle of a pandemic, but we  aren't gathered here by the majority leader to do anything to help the  American people. We aren't gathered here to do the hard work, to  negotiate, to compromise, and to pass an urgently needed COVID-19  relief package that Americans are clamoring for--no. Instead, we are  gathered here today to fast-track the confirmation of a far-right judge  onto the U.S. Supreme Court, in the middle of a pandemic, 8 days before  the conclusion of a Presidential election, with tens of millions of  ballots already having been cast. It is shameful. This body has truly  lost its way.   The American people are looking on in anger and disbelief as the  Senate majority focuses on this nomination just 4 years after the  majority in no uncertain terms said that the Senate should not consider  a Supreme Court nominee 8 full months before the election. Yes, that is  what Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said--the Senate should not  consider President Obama's Supreme Court nominee a full 8 months before  the election. But now he says we should install President Trump's  nominee 8 days before the election. How did we get here? Why would  Republicans so flagrantly violate their own rules and violate the  legitimacy of the Court and Senate for this nominee? To solve that  mystery, we have actually got a clue. It is on the Supreme Court  schedule.   On November 10, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in a suit,  brought by Republican attorneys general and supported by the Trump  administration, to destroy the Affordable Care Act. Three years after  the Senate Republicans tried and failed to repeal the Affordable Care  Act in Congress, they are now trying to terminate the law in the  courts. Their relentless pursuit to destroy the Nation's healthcare law  knows no end, and they need to get their Supreme Court nominee onto the  Bench in time to hear their case.   You have heard it many times over the last few weeks, but it bears  repeating, what is happening right now, because it is stunning. Senate  Republicans are rushing another far-right judge onto the bench days  before the election and all in the effort to cement a conservative  majority on the Supreme Court to destroy the Affordable Care Act in the  middle of a pandemic.   This is all taking place under the direction of a President who has  stated that the coronavirus pandemic ``affects virtually nobody.'' That  is the President's direct quote--``affects virtually nobody.'' That is  what he is saying about the pandemic.   Republicans want to rip away healthcare from millions of people in  the middle of a public health crisis that has killed more than 220,000  Americans. They want to take away protections from millions of people  living with preexisting conditions in the middle of a pandemic--a  pandemic that has caused millions more Americans who have contracted  COVID-19 to now have a new preexisting condition.  [[Page S6546]]    The President openly admits he wants the Supreme Court to do what  Republicans in Congress couldn't do, and that is to demolish the ACA.  ``It will be so good if they end it.'' That is the President's quote.  He said that on 60 Minutes. ``It will be so good if they end it,''  speaking about what he wants the Supreme Court to do and what his  Justice Department is arguing.   And the President and Republicans in Congress won't have any plan to  replace what they want to destroy. After all these years of trying to  end the Affordable Care Act, including a 2-year period when the  Republican Party held control in the House, Senate, and White House,  they still don't have a replacement for the Affordable Care Act.   If Republicans succeed and this Supreme Court nominee joins an  increasingly conservative Court in striking down the ACA, the results  would be catastrophic for my home State of New Mexico. The estimated  834,700 New Mexicans with preexisting benefits would face higher costs,  fewer benefits, and could have trouble finding coverage.   Overturning the ACA would immediately end coverage for millions of  Americans who became eligible for Medicaid through the Medicaid  expansion. In fact, in my State of New Mexico, 250,000 people have  coverage under that expansion. Seniors getting prescription drugs could  no longer afford their medications.   It is people like Jeanne, an Albuquerque-based senior who told me  recently:         Now, like many seniors, I take a medication that is so       expensive that I would reach the donut hole every year. I       can't afford to pay for that medication out of pocket.        Rural hospitals, which are absolutely critical during this       pandemic, could close their doors. As Dr. Val Wangler, the       chief medical officer of Rehoboth McKinley Christian Health       Care Services told me:        The Affordable Care Act is critical to the health of       patients in New Mexico's rural communities. Threatening the       healthcare coverage of our communities in the midst of the       greatest public health crisis of our times is unconscionable.    For Indian Country and Native communities, ACA repeal would be  absolutely devastating. I have heard firsthand accounts from Tribal  leaders, Native families, and healthcare providers about how the ACA  has improved the healthcare landscape across Indian Country--literally  saving lives. The ACA has opened the doors for so many Native Americans  to access the care they need, whether it is an unplanned medical  emergency or routine wellness checkups and screenings.   Access to quality healthcare is critical for Native communities,  which face disproportionate impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. The  Federal Government has a trust and treaty obligation to consult with  Tribes and to provide Native Americans healthcare. With this rushed,  hypocritical process, Senate Republicans are violating our most sacred  duties to Indian Country.   We know that the Supreme Court will rule on the fate of the  Affordable Care Act. That much is certain. But what other cases might  this Court rule on in the near future, or in what other cases might  Judge Barrett cast the deciding vote?   Well, as you have heard me mention a few times now, we are in the  middle of a Presidential election--the most important election of our  lifetimes. Facing an uncertain outcome at the polls, President Donald  Trump has repeatedly sought to undermine the legitimacy of this  election. He has lied about the safety of mail-in voting, despite the  fact that he is a mail-in voter himself. He deliberately tried to  weaken the Postal Service, and President Trump, along with Members of  this very body are telegraphing that they want the Supreme Court, not  voters, to decide this election. They want to sow enough doubt about  the legitimacy of the democratic process that it has to go to the  courts, and they want their hand-picked conservative judge to tip the  scales for them.   You don't get to choose the judge who decides your own case. That is  not how we achieve true justice in a democracy. The core of our system  is having an impartial judge.   It has been shocking to watch as this President, aided and abetted by  Members of this very Senate, has been so overt about his desire to put  a judge on the Supreme Court who will rule in his favor in any disputed  election. That is a tactic of authoritarians, not a democracy.   But in her confirmation hearing, Judge Barrett wouldn't even comment  on whether a President should commit to the peaceful transfer of power,  as this President has refused to do. She called that a political  controversy. The peaceful transfer of power is not a political  controversy. It is one of the most sacred tenets of our democracy.   What else might Judge Barrett rule on in the coming years? No doubt  cases concerning the most urgent, existential crisis we are facing as a  Nation--climate change. Cases to decide whether we will let big  polluters do whatever they want to our air, water, and planet.   There is no denying the science of climate change. It is a real and  present danger to the lives and livelihoods of people all across this  Nation and the world. My home State of New Mexico is in the bull's eye,  with increasingly severe wildfires and droughts.   This President is one of the few public figures left in this country  who says he doesn't believe the scientists. You would hope a nominee to  the Supreme Court--the highest Court in our land--wouldn't follow his  lead. But Judge Barrett, again, wouldn't even comment on whether she  believes climate change is real. She again said that was a political  controversy.   The only place climate change is a political controversy is within  the White House and within the Republican Party, and the rest of us are  paying the price while they decide whether or not to believe the  overwhelming consensus of the scientific community--whether or not to  believe their very eyes.   There are so many other issues on which a Justice Barrett would  likely rule, including a woman's right to make her own healthcare  decisions. A leading advocate for women's rights to reproductive  health, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg would be replaced with a public  advocate against Roe v. Wade. The nominee signed her name to statements  against Roe that ran in full-page newspaper ads, undisclosed to the  Senate. She signed joint public letters against Roe. This was also  undisclosed to the Senate. She gave multiple speeches to organizations  dedicated to overturning Roe, undisclosed to the Senate. In a law  review article, she wrote that abortion was ``always immoral.''   And after promising for years only to nominate judges who will  overturn Roe, Senate Republicans suddenly are shy about it. They  suddenly don't have the courage of their convictions, and they won't  let the public in on their true, long-stated agenda--overturning Roe  once and for all.   There is so much else at stake in this fight--on voting rights, on  worker rights, and so much more, all with real human consequences for  the lives of people all across this country.   Let's not lose sight of the real people who will be affected by this  Republican march to overload the Court with loyalists.   With so much at stake, the American people deserve to have a say. It  is that simple.   So I urge my Republican colleagues to take a step back and think  about what you are doing. Think about the long-term damage you are  doing to the legitimacy of the courts and to the faith of the American  people that their voices are being heard.   What is at stake is more than Justice Ginsburg's seat. It is the  American people's seat   I yield the floor.    Madam President, 30 years ago this week, the Native  American Languages Act, NALA, was signed into law. As we celebrate this  momentous occasion, I would like to take some time to reflect.   Native languages hold within them the culture, history, and  resiliency of their communities, but they are not only crucial to the  communities that speak them. Native languages have influenced our  shared American history, contributed to our understanding of  environmental stewardship, and made the very fabric of our Nation's  identity richer. As just one notable example of the impact Native  languages have had, in World War I and World War II, Native American  soldiers known as Code Talkers used their Native languages to transmit  coded tactical messages. Code Talkers were able to improve the speed of  communications encryption during both wars, leading directly to  American forces out-maneuvering enemy troops in numerous military  operations.   Yet prior to enactment of the Native American Languages Act in 1990,  the United States' Federal policies and practices often resulted in  suppression and extermination of Native languages. Recognizing that  these past practices were in conflict with the principles of Tribal  sovereignty and self-determination, the Senate Committee on Indian  Affairs sought to reshape Federal policy to better align with these  principles. Under the leadership of Chairman Inouye and Vice Chairman  McCain, the paradigm-shifting Native American Languages Act became law,  and the United States formally acknowledged the rights and freedoms of  Native Americans to use, practice, and develop Native languages.   Under the Native American Languages Act, Congress set out our current  Federal Native language policy, declaring:         ``It is the policy of the United States to--        ``(1) preserve, protect, and promote the rights and freedom       of Native Americans to use, practice, and develop Native       American languages;        ``(2) allow exceptions to teacher certification       requirements for Federal programs, and programs funded in       whole or in part by the Federal Government, for instruction       in Native American languages when such teacher certification       requirements hinder the employment of qualified teachers who       teach in  [[Page S6594]]       Native American languages, and to encourage State and       territorial governments to make similar exceptions;        ``(3) encourage and support the use of Native American       languages as a medium of instruction in order to encourage       and support--        ``(A) Native American language survival,        ``(B) educational opportunity,        ``(C) increased student success and performance,        ``(D) increased student awareness and knowledge of their       culture and history, and        ``(E) increased student and community pride;        ``(4) encourage State and local education programs to work       with Native American parents, educators, Indian tribes, and       other Native American governing bodies in the implementation       of programs to put this policy into effect;        ``(5) recognize the right of Indian tribes and other Native       American governing bodies to use the Native American       languages as a medium of instruction in all schools funded by       the Secretary of the Interior;        ``(6) fully recognize the inherent right of Indian tribes       and other Native American governing bodies, States,       territories, and possessions of the United States to take       action on, and give official status to, their Native American       languages for the purpose of conducting their own business;        ``(7) support the granting of comparable proficiency       achieved through course work in a Native American language       the same academic credit as comparable proficiency achieved       through course work in a foreign language, with recognition       of such Native American language proficiency by institutions       of higher education as fulfilling foreign language entrance       or degree requirements; and        ``(8) encourage all institutions of elementary, secondary       and higher education, where appropriate, to include Native       American languages in the curriculum in the same manner as       foreign languages and to grant proficiency in Native American       languages the same full academic credit as proficiency in       foreign languages.''    Over the last 30 years, catalyzed by the Native American Languages  Act, Congress has promoted the maintenance and revitalization of Native  languages. In 1992, Congress amended the act to establish a grant  program at the Administration for Native Americans, ANA, to support  Native language projects.   During my time in Congress, I have worked to support Native American  languages revitalization efforts. In 2006, as a U.S. Congressman for  New Mexico, I helped lead a bipartisan bill to expand the ANA's grant  program to bolster Native language immersion education programs. I also  participated in an Education and Workforce Committee field hearing in  my home State to hear from Native language advocates, which solidified  support for the bill's passage in the House. Enacted as the Esther  Martinez Native American Languages Preservation Act, this legislation  was named after an Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo traditional storyteller and  Tewa language advocate who tragically passed away in 2006.   As the current vice chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian  Affairs, I had the honor of leading the most recent Esther Martinez  Native American Languages Programs Reauthorization Act, which was  signed into law this past December, to further enhance ANA's Native  languages grant programs.   I also convened a Native American Languages Listening Session last  year and worked with Committee Chairman John Hoeven to hold an  oversight hearing in 2018 to hear directly from Native language  revitalization stakeholders across the country. At those events, we  learned that, over the last three decades, great strides have been made  to rectify past injustices and move toward support of Native languages.  Sadly, despite our efforts, a number of Native languages are still  endangered today. The loss of even one Native language would deal a  significant blow to our shared American and global heritage. There is  still more work to do.   This anniversary is an important opportunity for Congress to reflect.  I hope my colleagues will join me and recommit to fully upholding the  policies set out in the Native American Languages Act.                            ____________________
