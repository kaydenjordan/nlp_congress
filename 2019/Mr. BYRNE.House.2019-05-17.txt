 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 5. As  many of my colleagues have stated, there are a number of very troubling  issues with this legislation. In my mind, perhaps none is more  troubling than the bill's explicit carveout from the Religious Freedom  Restoration Act, also known as RFRA.   Under the First Amendment, Americans are blessed with the freedom of  religion. This is much more than the freedom of worship. Not only do  Americans have the right to worship as they see fit, their faith is not  confined to what happens inside their place of worship. They have the  right to practice their religion every day as they see fit.   For many years, there was a strong, bipartisan agreement that  protecting this right was of the utmost importance. In the Civil Rights  Act of 1964, religious protections enjoyed bipartisan support.  Likewise, RFRA was heralded as an historic, bipartisan achievement.   In the wake of the Supreme Court's 1990 decision in Employment  Division v. Smith, which rolled back longstanding constitutional  protections for religious liberty, the Congress came together and  restored broad protections for religious freedom under RFRA.   RFRA was introduced by then-Representative Chuck Schumer and Senator  Ted Kennedy. It passed unanimously in the House and by a vote of 97-3  in the Senate, and it was signed into law by President Clinton.    For nearly two decades, RFRA has been the hallmark of protecting the  religious freedom of Americans against the weight of a powerful Federal  Government. Contrary to what some of its recent opponents claim, RFRA  is not an automatic opt out of any law for people of faith. Instead,  RFRA provides a commonsense balancing test between religious belief and  government action.   First, an individual challenging the government must show that they  have a sincerely held belief that is being substantially burdened by  the government--that is, there is a real matter of faith actually being  affected by the government's actions. If the individual successfully  shows that, they do not automatically win their claim.   The government may then show that it has a compelling interest--that  is, a good reason--to interfere with the individual's religious rights  and that the interference is the least restrictive means to accomplish  the government's goals--that is, the government doesn't have a better  alternative.   This test provides fairness for both sides. Unfortunately, today, the  House proposes to break this historic protection and say that RFRA will  not apply to the Equality Act. It is clear why they have done this.   Without RFRA, it is less likely that faith-based charities and  organizations will be able to uphold the faith of their organization  when it runs counter to evolving norms on human sexuality.   Without RFRA, it is less likely that Christian colleges and  universities will be able to teach and uphold a biblical understanding  of marriage and human sexuality.   Without RFRA, it is less likely that parents in public schools will  be able to opt their children out of mandated education that teaches  human sexuality contrary to their family's religious faith.   Unfortunately, the modern Democratic Party has decided that mandating  its beliefs on everyone is more important than upholding the rights of  people of faith and those who possess contrary beliefs.   Madam Speaker, that is truly radical and deeply troubling. It is  unprecedented. It is contrary to the values and foundational freedoms  of this country.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this legislation.  Protecting the rights of some cannot come  [[Page H3939]]  at the high cost of stripping away the rights of others, particularly  when it comes to protecting religious liberty.                                time  1000
