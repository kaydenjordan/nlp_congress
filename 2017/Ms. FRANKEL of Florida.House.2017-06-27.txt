 Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Engel and  Chairman Royce for their leadership.   Like my colleague, who just spoke, over the last 4 years, I have been  privileged to help represent the United States at the NATO  Parliamentary Assembly.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to borrow a line from a very well-known  poet who said, ``No man is an island,'' recognizing that human beings  do not thrive when isolated from others, a concept that is recognized  by all religions.   This is more true than ever as our world becomes increasingly  dangerous. And, more than ever, the United States of America needs  friends to stand strong and stand up for our mutual democratic values.   So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  resolution, committing the United States to NATO article 5 collective  defense.
