 Madam Speaker, for our economy to continue growing,  workers need technical skills, the right training, and education  funding.   Workforce development is a bipartisan goal, strongly supported by  both employers and employees. Small businesses, manufacturers, trade  unions, and industry groups are concerned about the shortage of skilled  trade workers.   Sadly, many seeking technical training are precluded from using  qualified 529 education savings plans, and many apprenticeships are not  eligible for 529 plans as well.   To solve this problem, I am proud to have introduced H.R. 4469, the  American Workforce Employment Act, and I would like to offer special  thanks to my colleagues, Representatives Jeff Van Drew from New Jersey,  Ron Estes from Kansas, and Paul Mitchell from Michigan, for coauthoring  this legislation.   Our bipartisan bill expands the application of 529 savings plans to  include expenses leading to postsecondary credentials, certain  apprenticeships, and the purchase of tools and equipment, which is very  important.   These programs have been identified as critical by trade unions and  manufacturers. Empowering men and women to utilize their own pretax  dollars will increase the number of highly trained individuals pursuing  high-wage vocations and filling workforce gaps in agriculture,  manufacturing, and skilled labor sectors.   I ask my colleagues to support our bipartisan legislation so that  Americans can receive education and technical training to pursue their  dreams and expand our economy.                            ____________________
