 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  leading and for all of her courageous leadership on this important  issue.   Madam Speaker, I have to say, we have been stunned here in the last  hour of this debate by a lot of what we have heard, not the least of  which is when one of our Democrat colleagues actually exclaimed on this  floor in the last hour: ``Thank God abortion is still legal.''   I just sat here and said wow. Thank God? Thank God for what? That  innocent, unborn children can still be killed in many States? Thank  God?   The other side in this debate has not only abandoned reverence, all  reverence, all morality, all reason, but they defied medical  technology.    They have also completely abandoned the first self-evident truth  boldly proclaimed in our Nation's birth certificate, the Declaration of  Independence, that all men are created equal--not born equal--created  equal by God, and it is He who gives our inalienable rights, beginning,  obviously, with the right to life.   I mean, seriously, please don't come on this floor and thank our  creator for  [[Page H6656]]  your zeal to terminate the innocent lives that He has created. God have  mercy on us.   Madam Speaker, today, the Democrats have brought two bills to this  floor. The first is a complete overhaul of all pro-life protections,  which will allow for taxpayer-funded abortion on demand through all  three trimesters of pregnancy.   The second bill, the so-called Ensuring Access to Abortion Act,  creates an open door for women to be preyed upon by traffickers and  does nothing to protect minors who are transported by predators across  State lines to obtain abortions.   In order to prohibit these heinous acts, I introduced the Child  Interstate Abortion Notification Act, which, by the way, I should note,  passed this House by a wide margin in 2005 in the 109th Congress. How  far the other side has devolved since then. Because of that, now more  than ever, we have to highlight why this bill is so important in  protecting the lives of minors and their unborn children.   The Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act will help cut down on  predators and traffickers taking advantage of minors by making it a  crime to knowingly transport a minor across State lines to obtain an  abortion without first satisfying State-level parental involvement  laws.                                time  1215     Madam Speaker, it is simple. A parent  should be involved in the life of their child, and State laws should  never be circumvented to benefit those seeking to take advantage of  minors.   When a State says a guardian or parent should be notified that their  minor is seeking an abortion, that law ought to be respected and  followed. Our States' parental involvement laws are well-written and  reasonable, and there are exceptions built into the statutes for  extreme circumstances.   We also know that forced coercion to abort an unborn child is real,  and it must be addressed. Predators, traffickers, and their accomplices  must be held accountable for the damage they have done to minors.   I am so glad that our side is offering tangible solutions to real  problems; but it is unfortunate that it is in response to such terrible  pieces of legislation that only further endanger the lives of minors  and their unborn children.   I urge opposition to the other side's callous and barbaric agenda and  their bill, and I support our motion to recommit.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include the text of the  amendment in the Record immediately prior to the vote on the motion to  recommit.    Madam Speaker, I have a motion to recommit  at the desk.  [[Page H6659]]     Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.
