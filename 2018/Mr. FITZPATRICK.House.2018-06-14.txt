 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a faith leader in  our community who has made a tremendous impact on individuals in our  home in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.  [[Page H5161]]    Rabbi Joel Simon of the Shir Ami Synagogue in Newtown, has been a  transformative force in providing spiritual guidance to his  congregants. During his tenure, Mr. Speaker, at the Reform  congregation, Joel has made great strides to enhance the educational  environment for the over 700 families who attend Shir Ami. A strong  proponent of strengthening Jewish identity, Rabbi Simon oversees  community building exercises such as yoga, youth groups, and theater  trips.   Rabbi Simon will be departing Shir Ami on Saturday to return to his  home in Florida. While he will be dearly missed by our community, we  are sure that he will flourish in his next chapter. We wish him; his  wife, Jacent; and their entire family all the best going forward.                             Bucks County Heroes     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize several  individuals from our community in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who  administered first aid that would ultimately save the life of a beloved  school bus driver.   In January, Janet Lapsley suffered a life-threatening medical  emergency. Discovered unconscious by fellow bus driver Bob Fay, Janet  was found to be lacking a pulse. With the help of Bob and drivers Brent  Briggs, Danny Shimp, and Jeff Randolph, Janet received CPR and oxygen.  With the assistance of school nurse Dawn Fulton and athletic trainer  Katie Holmes, Janet received the additional treatment she needed to  survive while first responders were on the way.   I would like to commend the first responders, who worked collectively  and professionally to save Janet's life. They are Ottsville Fire  Company Chief William Shick, Deputy Chief James Keogh, Firefighter and  EMT Jeff Lauble, and Junior Firefighter Evelyn Keogh.   The weekend following this health scare, Janet's brain activity  hovered between 3 percent and 5 percent. However, with the help of a  team of doctors and many prayers, Janet slowly recovered and is now  working as a monitor on bus 97, continuing to assist the children she  cares so deeply about.   I would like to thank Bob, Brent, Danny, Jeff, Dawn, Katie, William,  James, Jeff, and Evelyn for their courageous actions. Their knowledge  and quick thinking truly saved the life of a dedicated community  servant. I encourage all of my constituents to follow their lead and,  as an EMT, educate themselves on the power of first-aid techniques to  save lives every single day.          Honoring the Work of Teachers Marc Cutillo and Joan Savion     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a teacher in  Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who is working to break down barriers both  in and out of the classroom.   Marc Cutillo, a biology teacher and special education teacher at  William Tennent High School in Warminster, was recently a recipient of  the Teacher as Hero award from the National Liberty Museum and State  Farm Insurance. He was honored for his work teaching a science class  for students which doubles as an English language class. Additionally,  Marc has teamed up with fellow William Tennent teacher Joan Savion to  establish Aqui Para Ti, a community group that seeks to strengthen  relationships with the Latino community in the Centennial School  District.   I applaud Marc and Joan for their work in bridging the language and  learning gap for students in our community. By giving them the tools to  succeed, Marc and Joan are paving a brighter future for the next  generation.                            ____________________
