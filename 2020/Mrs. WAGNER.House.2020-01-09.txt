 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the  Democrats' dangerous resolution to undermine our national defense and  allow unchecked Iranian aggression against the United States and our  allies.   This resolution intends to cripple our ability to protect American  soldiers serving in the Middle East and attempts to forbid the use of  force against Iran, even if they are attacking Americans.   I am shocked and saddened by the partisanship of this Chamber. I was  proud when former President Obama succeeded in his decision to kill  Osama bin Laden in Pakistan. I am proud that President Trump ended  Qasem Soleimani's brutal reign of terror that killed and maimed  countless Americans and coalition forces and threatened many more to  come.   But, instead of uniting behind the President's defensive position to  strike one of the world's most powerful terrorists who was organizing  attacks against Americans in Iraq, instead, many Democrats are arguing  that the American President himself is guilty of aggression and  escalation. This, Madam Speaker, is unconscionable.   These are pictures from the Military Times showing the assault and  the burning of our Embassy in Baghdad.   I agree with the President that attacking Americans is never  acceptable and Iran should be held to account. When American lives hang  in the balance, Article II of the Constitution empowers the President  to use force to protect and defend our country.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this egregious,  partisan farce.
