 Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Missouri. I thank  him for his leadership and levelheadedness.   As he is on his way out, I will say that I think the current way we  deal with nominees is not tenable. I imagine a scenario where we have a  Democratic President, and it will take even longer than it is currently  taking to confirm nominees. I think there are a number of us on both  sides of the aisle who are open to modifying the way we operate.  [[Page S1521]]    For me, the blue-slip question is a redline. I think what they are  doing with the blue slips undermines the individual ability for any  Senator to have their say, especially as it relates to the circuit  courts, but I think there is an opportunity to have a conversation.   On climate generally, I am looking forward to a debate, but it is  very difficult to debate in the Senate when only one party proffers a  proposal. I don't mean this as rhetorical flourish. I don't mean this  as a personal accusation or a partisan attack. It is just a fact that  there are no climate proposals coming from the Senators who are  Republican. There are zero. So they are trying to have a debate about a  resolution which was nonbinding and which was signed by 12 Senators. I  get it, but I think, given that this is the world's greatest  deliberative body, we ought to have a proper debate about climate  change.   We are actually in a climate emergency. This is the most important  moment in the world's history as it relates to this particular crisis.  We are sitting here trying to score points about an FAQ that was posted  on a new Congresswoman's website and trying to make fun of each other  and say: They are going to ban cows and ice cream. It is very silly,  and it is not worthy of the seriousness of the moment.   I would ask my Republican colleagues--I see a number of them who take  the debt, foreign policy, cyber security, personal privacy, and the  rules of the Senate very seriously. They are very levelheaded human  beings with a seriousness of purpose. Yet when it comes to climate  change, it gets into this goofy thing where they are doing everything  except debating climate change and what ought to be done about it.   We spent 5, maybe 10 years trying to get most Republicans to concede  that this problem exists at all. Now a lot of them are feeling  comfortable saying: Yes, this problem exists, but all of the solutions  proposed by Democrats are wrong.   That is fine, but I ask this question in all sincerity: What do  Republican Senators propose to do about the climate crisis? What is  your plan? If you don't like cap and trade; if you don't like a fee on  carbon; if you don't like massive investment in green technology and  clean technology; if you don't like the extension of the investment tax  credit and the production tax credit; if you don't like our solution;  if you don't like being part of the Paris climate accord--which, by the  way, is nonbinding, which means we get to decide what our pathway is to  clean energy. It is not as though the U.N. gets to tell us what to do.  It gives us leverage to make sure that as we move forward toward clean  energy, the other countries don't cheat. It actually gives us leverage  in this situation.   If you don't like our solutions, that is fine. This is the world's  greatest deliberative body. This is where the greatest debates in U.S.  history have happened. Yet, maybe 19 times out of 20, I have come down  to the floor to talk about climate change, and there were Members on  this side of the aisle and zero Members on the other side of the aisle.  Again, I don't mean this as an attack; I just want a real debate.   I am looking at the Senator from Georgia. We have had robust  discussions about debt and deficits and the way we try to avoid  shutdowns and sequester and all the rest of it. When it comes to  climate change, everybody gets really goofy. Everybody puts on their  partisan uniform and refuses to engage. If this debate about the Green  New Deal offers us an opportunity to talk about the planetary crisis,  then I am happy for it.   We are in debate time on the nomination of Andrew Wheeler to lead the  EPA, so it might be helpful to know the origins of the Agency.   In the 1960s, the state of the environment was catastrophic. Millions  of freshwater fish and rivers around the country were being poisoned by  insecticides, hurting consumer trust and the countless fishermen and  families who made a living that way. Pollution was so bad that debris  floating in the Cuyahoga River actually caught on fire, causing  thousands of dollars in property damage. The water in Lake Superior  became so toxic from companies' dumping asbestos-laden waste that local  communities had to start filtering their own water. Think about that.  People could drink the water from their local reservoirs unfiltered  until industrial pollution came along.   This was the path our country was on. Pollution was destroying many  of the most beautiful places in the country and, maybe more  importantly, putting the health of the public at risk.    A scientist named Rachel Carson came along and changed everything  when she wrote a book that helped the United States see that we  couldn't go on like this. Her book was a call for change, and millions  of Americans, on a bipartisan basis, demanded change.   There was a predictable backlash. Here is what one industry spokesman  said as public opinion began to coalesce around addressing pollution:         The major claims of Miss Rachel Carson's book ``Silent       Spring'' are gross distortions of the actual facts,       completely unsupported by scientific, experimental evidence,       and general practical experience in the field. Her suggestion       that pesticides are in fact biocides destroying all life is       obviously absurd in the light of the fact that without       selective biologicals, these compounds would be completely       useless.    This controversy went on for the next few years. The public, the  science, and the reality pointed toward the truth, but a few loud  voices tried to stop the country from making progress. They said that  Rachel Carson distorted the facts, that the science wasn't there, and  that there was no need to rush judgment.   The U.S. Government moved forward anyway and began to lay the  foundation for a new America--one that would preserve and protect our  country and its resources for the next generation.   In 1970, President Nixon united several offices and bureaus already  in the Federal Government into one single agency, the EPA. The EPA was  charged with protecting the Nation's health and being the steward of  the environment. It has a legacy of fulfilling that mission. The Agency  ended the use of a dangerous pesticide called DDT. It found a solution  to acid rain, which was once a major issue for fish, forests, and  farming. It took on secondhand smoke, banning smoking in indoor public  places.   Thanks to the EPA, Rachel Carson's ``fable for tomorrow'' did not  become a reality, but here we are decades later facing another  environmental crisis, one that affects the United States and every  other Nation on this planet, and I am worried that we are not going to  do the right thing this time.   Instead of facing head-on and in a bipartisan way the biggest crisis  in the planet's history, the party in power is not just ignoring the  problem; they are making it worse. And they are doing it by nominating  and confirming people like Andrew Wheeler. This is someone who said:  ``Manmade global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the  American people.'' This is the guy to head the EPA. He says manmade  global warming is a hoax. This is someone who was formally the vice  president of the Washington Coal Club, who lobbied for coal companies.   We are in a planetary emergency, and Republicans want someone who is  advancing the interests of top polluters to be the Nation's chief  environmental steward so that he can continue to advance the interest  of the top polluters. Again, it is not just that they are ignoring  climate change, which would be bad enough; it is that they are  aggressively, proudly, gleefully sometimes, making it worse.   Researchers at Harvard found that the EPA's recent plans to gut the  Clean Power Plan will lead to more greenhouse gas emissions. Their plan  will be worse for climate than if they did nothing at all. Think about  that. If the EPA did nothing at all, it would be better than what they  are doing now. This is the result of Mr. Wheeler's leadership, which  has until now been in an Acting Director capacity.   During the Presidency of Ronald Reagan, the EPA was led by Anne  Gorsuch Burford, who ended up resigning in scandal. President Reagan  nominated as her replacement William Ruckelshaus, whom people trusted  to do the job and stabilize the EPA. He was a moderate. He was a steady  hand. The EPA could use a steady hand after Scott Pruitt, who promoted  the interests of polluters over the health of the American people and  who crossed many ethical lines. Yet Andrew Wheeler is no Ruckelshaus.  That much is clear from his time at the EPA. Under his leadership, EPA  inspections are at a 10-year  [[Page S1522]]  low. EPA fines are at a 25-year low. Restrictions on new coal plants  have been eliminated. Limits on methane pollution are in the process of  being rolled back. In other words, polluters are getting their way.  That is great news for people who own oil and gas companies, but it is  horrible news for people with asthma, for farmers who are trying to get  through the worst drought season seen in a century, and for small  businesses that are losing customers because of fires.    Listen, climate change is here. It is hurting everything from local  economies, to public health, to national security, and the Republicans  have decided that the best person to lead the Agency to do something  about it is a coal lobbyist. It would be funny if it were not so  outrageous.   The Democrats have a plan for climate change. We have ideas to invest  in clean air, clean water, and smarter infrastructure. We have bills on  investment and production tax credits, solar energy, wind energy,  conservation and efficiency, carbon pricing, and planting trees, and we  have stood together against nominations like this one. It is time for  the Republicans, if not to stand with us, to at least then stand on the  other side against us and engage in this great debate. What are we  going to do with climate change? We have proposals, and they have none.   I yield the floor.
