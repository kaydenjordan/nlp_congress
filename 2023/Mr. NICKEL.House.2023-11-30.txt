 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor Dr. James West, a  revered Wake County commissioner and a true champion for the people of  North Carolina. It is with deep sorrow that we mark his passing but  with immense gratitude that we celebrate his legacy.   His journey, from protesting segregation in the sixties along with  Jesse Jackson to serving as a Raleigh City councilman and Wake County  commissioner, was marked by a relentless commitment to justice and  equality.   Dr. West's legacy is not just in the numerous programs he initiated  or the pivotal policies he championed but in the countless lives that  he touched, mine included, the community leaders he inspired, and the  unquantifiable impact of his vision and compassion.   We remember Dr. West for his Dr. West-isms, his wisdom, and his  unwavering faith in the power of community.   As we mourn Dr. James West's passing, we also celebrate his  extraordinary life, a life dedicated to service, equality, and the  betterment of Wake County and its people.                      Celebrating Mr. Ira David Wood III     Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor and celebrate an icon of  North Carolina's cultural landscape, Mr. Ira David Wood III, as we  celebrate the 50th anniversary of his legendary portrayal of Ebenezer  Scrooge in Ira David Wood's ``A Christmas Carol.''   Mr. Wood's unique and comedic adaptation of this Christmas classic  has become a beloved holiday tradition for the Raleigh community.   His visionary leadership in theater, coupled with his remarkable  talents as an actor, author, singer, and playwright, has left a  profound impact on the arts in North Carolina.   As the founder and executive director of Theatre in the Park in  Raleigh, Mr. Wood has been a cornerstone of Raleigh's vibrant art scene  since 1972.   His leadership and vision have earned him prestigious recognitions,  including two Medal of Arts awards and The Order of the Long Leaf Pine,  the highest civilian honor in North Carolina.   As we celebrate this milestone, let's applaud Mr. Wood's  extraordinary contributions not only to the arts but to the heart and  soul of North Carolina.   Please join me in congratulating Mr. Wood on this remarkable  achievement and wishing him continued success.                                School Safety     Mr. Speaker, last week I visited the site of the 2018  Marjory Stoneman Douglas school shooting in Parkland, Florida. Meeting  the victims' families was a heartbreaking experience that I will never  forget.   There is no way to describe what it felt like to see the bullet- riddled, bloodstained classrooms and hallways that remain frozen in  time.   We owe it to each victim and family impacted by this tragedy to stop  the epidemic of gun violence plaguing our Nation.   Just this week, another act of senseless violence rocked my district  when a student was tragically killed and another seriously injured at  Southeast Raleigh Magnet High School. My thoughts are with the victims'  families and loved ones affected by this unspeakable tragedy.   I am sure a lot more details will be released in the coming days, but  for now our mission remains clear: We can and must do more to keep our  kids safe in school.   I remain committed to working with anyone on solutions to protect our  kids.                             Standing with Israel     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the No Funds for  Iranian Terrorism Act.   For years, the Iranian regime has aided and abetted terrorist  organizations, including Hamas.   On October 7, we saw Iranian-backed Hamas terrorists carry out a  brutal and barbaric assault against the Jewish people and the State of  Israel.   Both Iran and Hamas seek to destroy democracy, and we must hold them  accountable for their actions.   I am proud to support this bill coming to the floor today that will  ensure that not a single dollar of this funding, whether directly or  indirectly, goes to support Hamas or its efforts to destroy Israel.   We must continue to stand with Israel and ensure they have the  funding and resources to disarm and dismantle Hamas and every Iranian- backed terrorist threat.                            ____________________
