 Mr. Speaker, this week in 1773, Sam Adams and the Sons  of Liberty organized the Boston Tea Party, one of the most iconic  protests in American history. They dumped 342 chests of tea into the  Boston Harbor in an uprising against an oppressive government and  taxation tyranny.   Three years ago this month, Republicans built upon our Founders'  ideals and passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We delivered pro-growth,  pro-jobs, and pro-America policies to end the economic slowdown of the  previous administration.   Following tax reform, the middle class experienced record financial  growth, household incomes soared by nearly 8 percent, and Americans had  a greater say over their own paychecks.   Our Founders knew lower taxes would be better for the economy of  1773, and Republicans proved through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 3 years  ago that Sam Adams and the Sons of Liberty were correct.                            ____________________
