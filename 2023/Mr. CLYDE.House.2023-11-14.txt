 Mr. Chair, I rise as the designee of the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Granger), and I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chair, just a few weeks ago, the administration issued  a proposed rule which imposes radical sexual orientation and gender  identity policy on the child welfare system. I rise in strong support  of my colleague Representative Brecheen from Oklahoma's amendment which  prohibits funding for the finalization of this rule.   By requiring States to deem some foster care providers as safe and  appropriate, the administration has created a policy which implies that  faith-based providers who have traditional views of marriage and  sexuality are incapable of providing a safe environment for children  and adolescents.   I vehemently oppose such a notion and strongly believe that faith- based providers often fill gaps in a child welfare system and provide  quality, loving care rooted in a deep calling and conviction to care  for those in need.   The foster care system in the United States is in a deep crisis, with  over 400,000 in the system and over a 100,000 awaiting adoption.   We must stand up and support faith-based providers across this  country. We must object to the villainizing of these organizations, and  we must defund the imposition of radical political policies in the  child welfare system.   Mr. Chair, I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting this  amendment by the gentleman from Oklahoma, and I yield back the balance  of my time.
