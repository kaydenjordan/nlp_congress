 Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the en bloc amendment  which includes my amendment to prevent funding for the proposed  Commission on Unalienable Rights at the Department of State which has  been proposed by Secretary Pompeo in order to promote natural law and  natural rights.   Now, I would wholeheartedly support a concerted focus on human rights  by this administration.   Instead of any really coordinated human rights policy, this President  and the Secretary of State have cozied up to dictators and made excuses  for flagrant human rights violations, even by some of our supposed  allies.  [[Page H4678]]    No, unfortunately, it is clear that this proposed commission is an  attempt by the administration to co-opt American policy on human rights  to give preference to an ideology that has been associated with  discrimination against marginalized communities, including the LGBT  community, women, and religious minorities.   The State Department already has an entire bureau--the Bureau of  Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor--dedicated to defending human  rights, yet the Secretary is proposing to bypass the official structure  of the diplomatic corps to create an ideologically motivated  commission, without congressional approval or oversight, to promote  natural rights based on natural law.   These terms have no legal meaning and have deep associations with  homophobic and discriminatory movements.   There should be no place for this at our Department of State, which  should be a leading voice in the protection and promotion of human  rights for all.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the en bloc amendment, and  I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.
