 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  a very special individual from Brockway, Pennsylvania, Levi Lindemuth.   Earlier this year, Levi was watching ``Home Alone 2'' when he was  inspired to do something to help children who are in the hospital.  Combining his love of gardening and passion to help others, Levi  started Levi's Hope Blossoms.   Levi started selling flowers in his hand-painted pots and cans for a  $5 donation. All the proceeds from Hope Blossoms go to St. Jude  hospitals, and so far Levi has made over 100 hope blossoms, raising  nearly $1,000.   Levi's efforts to help St. Jude's stem from a serious complication  that required surgery when he was 5 days old. Now a happy and healthy  7-year-old boy, Levi is committed to giving back to children who were  once in his position.   Levi sells these colorful planters and can take personal design  requests via his Facebook page, Levi's Hope Blossoms.   When asked why he started Hope Blossoms, Levi's answer was simple:  ``I don't think kids should have to pay to be healthy.''   Mr. Speaker, Levi is an inspiration to all of us.                            ____________________
