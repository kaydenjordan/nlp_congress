 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, to honor the half million Americans who perished in this  pandemic and rescue the millions still struggling in its fiscal  chokehold, we must end this national viral nightmare.   The American Rescue Plan is our best hope and the most ambitious,  progressive legislation in scope and impact since the Affordable Care  Act. It delivers direct payments to families, helps our schools safely  reopen, and ensures small businesses and Main Street stay open. It also  ramps up testing and vaccine deployments, especially to underserved  communities.   This plan's tax changes likely cut child poverty in half. If we want  kids behind desks, shots in arms, and people in jobs, this American  Rescue Plan delivers vital relief now and lays a solid foundation for  the future.   Thankfully, the misers are no longer in charge, and help is on the  way.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise as both a mom and a Member of Congress in strong  support of H.R. 8.   Last month, my community marked the 3-year anniversary of the Marjory  Stoneman Douglas shooting that stole 17 innocent lives.   The anxiety and terror that came that day has never left us. Yet, too  many communities witness horrific gun violence every day. Commonsense  reform can end this agony and keep us safer mainly by requiring  background checks for gun sales. Yet, loopholes allow up to 80 percent  of firearms to be sold without background checks.                                time  1515    We must mandate universal background checks for firearm sales by  passing H.R. 8 and then pass Jaime's Law, my legislation that expands  that same mandate to ammunition purchases.   The pandemic made gun proliferation worse, and inaction is not an  option. We must do all we can to ensure guns and bullets don't end up  in the wrong hands.   Mr. Speaker, the outliers on this issue are Republicans whose fealty  to the NRA results in more people dying from gun violence. Enough is  enough.
