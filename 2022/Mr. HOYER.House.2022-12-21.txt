 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the proceedings  had during the recess be printed in the Record.  [[Page H9972]]     Mr. Speaker, I am announcing to the Members that this will       be the last vote, this vote coming up. We intend to keep the government       open, so we will stay here as long as it is necessary to do so.        We will convene at 9 a.m. tomorrow. I do not expect any votes before       11 a.m. There will be some rule bills that we will be considering,       additional suspension bills, and then we will go back to this process       that we are afflicted with.                                      ____________________
