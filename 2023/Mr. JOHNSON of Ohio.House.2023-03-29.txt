 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1, the Lower Energy  Costs Act.   With H.R. 1, we are working to lower energy costs for consumers  across America by unleashing American energy and strengthening American  supply chains.   H.R. 1 addresses regulatory red tape and permitting barriers to the  domestic development of energy without compromising environmental  protections.   The Lower Energy Costs Act also encourages domestic processing and  refining of critical energy resources to ensure that components for all  energy sources can be made right here in America.   As chair of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Environment,  Manufacturing, and Critical Materials, I am proud that H.R. 1 includes  seven bills that passed through our subcommittee and full committee  through regular order.   The bills encourage the domestic refining of critical energy  resources, allow for flexible approaches to permitting, support  national security, promote innovation that is currently stalled in EPA  red tape, repealed two sections of the Democrats' Inflation Reduction  Act, and protect American refining capacity from agency overreach.   I thank Representatives Carter of Georgia, Joyce of Pennsylvania,  Pence, Curtis, Pfluger, Palmer, and Crenshaw for their work on this  important legislation.   In addition, H.R. 1 includes my bill, the Unlocking Our Domestic LNG  Energy Potential Act, under section 10007. The section would amend the  Natural Gas Act to repeal all restrictions on the import and export of  natural gas. Removing such restrictions would help facilitate timely  exports of LNG and help our allies. A stronger LNG export industry also  means increased domestic production of natural gas and lower domestic  prices.   I have heard my Democratic colleagues across the aisle criticize H.R.  1 because they say it does nothing for clean energy. This could not be  further from the truth. H.R. 1 includes several provisions that  incorporate focused flexibilities into certain environmental statutes  in order to create an improved regulatory landscape for refining and  processing critical minerals.   Mr. Chairman, what are the industries that need critical minerals the  most? Those are the wind, solar, and battery technology industries--all  clean energy technologies.   We do almost no critical mineral refining and processing in the  United States. That must change, or we risk becoming dangerously  dependent on China for our energy and transportation systems.   The International Energy Agency estimates that the demand for  critical minerals will double by 2040. We want to meet that demand with  American resources and reduce reliance on China.   I will close by thanking Chair Rodgers for her leadership on the  Lower Energy Costs Act. Energy security is national security, and  through H.R. 1, we can unleash American energy dominance and lower  energy costs for American families, thereby lowering inflation.   Mr. Chairman, I urge all of my colleagues to support the Lower Energy  Costs Act.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Miller), my friend and colleague.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration data, the  average price for gasoline in 2022 was $1.80 per gallon more than when  President Biden assumed office.   H.R. 1 is not just about energy independence. That is the underlying  foundation, but what it is really about is the quality of life for the  American people here at home and the cost of energy that is feeding the  skyrocketing inflation.   The average price of gas in 2020 was $2.26 per gallon. The average  price of gas in 2022 was $4.06 per gallon, reaching a peak of over $5  per gallon in June of 2022.   According to the Department of Energy's Low-Income Energy  Affordability Data, the LEAD Tool, low-income households spend 8.6  percent of their income on energy expenses. Depending on location and  income, certain households spend as much as 30 percent of their income  on energy expenses. The energy burden for low-income households is  three times higher than non-low-income households.   In rural parts of the country, like where I represent in Appalachia,  you are very familiar with that area, it is a real problem when  families have to choose between putting gas in their car or groceries  on the table. It is a real challenge when they have to choose between  paying their heating bill or buying clothes for their kids to go to  school. This is what H.R. 1 begins to address for the American people.   Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.  Fry), my friend and colleague.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 15 seconds to  the gentleman from South Carolina.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to the time  remaining on each side?    Mr. Chair, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Good).    Mr. Chair, I proudly yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Lawler).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Mills).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Arkansas (Mr. Hill), my friend and colleague.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Nebraska (Mr. Flood).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from North Dakota (Mr. Armstrong).    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to the time  remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, we have said it over and over and over again, and there is  no denying it. Energy security is national security. That is what H.R.  1 is all about.  [[Page H1563]]    Unleashing American energy, production, permitting, put American  energy back into play to address the needs and concerns of the American  people, to lower inflation, and to ensure America's national security  on the international stage. That is what H.R. 1 is all about.   I look forward to closing here in a few minutes with some striking  comments about telling the truth. I heard the ranking member from our  Energy and Commerce Committee a little bit ago say, tell the American  people the truth, and I respect him greatly. I am going to tell the  American people the truth in just a little bit.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1530     Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Donalds).    Mr. Chair, I am prepared to close, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I continue to reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Throughout this debate, my Democratic colleagues have repeated  misinformation and engaged in fearmongering as a tactic to convince  American families to submit to their green agenda and just accept more  expensive and less reliable energy as the new normal to undermine our  economy, make the cost of living even higher, and, perhaps even more  troubling, severely undermine our national security.   Apparently, my Democratic colleagues are okay with making China great  again at the expense of the American people and the rest of the world.   I heard the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, my  colleague--again, who I have great respect for--say a few minutes ago:  Tell the American people the truth.   Well, let's tell the American people some truth. According to a  report by the LendingClub, at the end of 2022--that is 2 years into the  Biden administration--9.3 million more United States consumers were  living paycheck to paycheck compared to the prior year.   Of that group, 75 percent identified inflation as a reason for their  financial situation to be worsening.   By the end of 2022, China's oil refining capacity exceeded the United  States' oil refining capacity.   According to the International Energy Agency's oil market report,  U.S. refining capacity is at 17.6 million barrels per day.   According to the China Petroleum and Chemical Industry Association,  China's capacity is at 18.4 million barrels per day.                                time  1545    We are far more dependent on China today for the very rare earth  minerals and critical minerals that are needed to pursue the renewable  green energy plan that the Democrats are trying to push. You can't get  there in the timeframe that they are trying to get there, Mr. Chair,  without becoming more dependent on China.   There are those who say that Republicans are climate deniers. That is  simply not true. We simply believe that Republicans have better ideas  to unleash America's energy and to restore America's energy  independence. At the same time that those are good energy policies,  they are also good climate policies.   Let me give you an example. Everybody says that the goal of  addressing the climate problem is to reduce carbon emissions.   Mr. Chair, if that is truly the goal, why do we not want to export  more American natural gas around the world?   According to the American Exploration and Production Council, if we  would simply export four times the amount of natural gas that we are  exporting today--which we could do easily because we have got a wealth  of it--we could lower carbon emissions more than if we were to  electrify every vehicle in America, put a solar panel and a battery  backup on the home and the rooftop of every residential home in  America, and build 57,000 industrial-strength windmills, all combined.   American natural gas is the cleanest form of natural gas on the  planet. Our friends and allies in Europe sure wish they had some of  that today because they have become dependent on Vladimir Putin for  their sources of energy.   Look at the Germans, who decided to throttle their nuclear suite and  become dependent on Russia for their energy.   What did they end up doing?   Forest clearing, burning wood to cook their food and heat their  homes. We do not want to go the way of Europe. They have already tried  all of this.   I implore my Democratic colleagues: We are not arguing about the  goal. We agree with cleaner forms of energy.   What we are arguing about, it appears to me, is the timeframe in  which to accomplish that and the amount of money and the change in the  quality of life that it is going to require for the American people.   I am sure many of you went to college and you studied the business  triangle: time, cost, and quality. You can't affect one of those  without affecting the other two. With this rush to green, if we want to  do this so fast before renewable forms of energy are mature enough  technologically to be able to provide the baseload energy for our grid,  to put fuel in our automobiles, if we want to do it that fast, it is  going to cost a hell of a lot of money, and it is going to change for  the worse the quality of life for the American people.   H.R. 1 is a commonsense energy package. If you lower energy costs,  you are going to lower inflation. If you lower inflation, you are going  to allow the American people to keep more of their hard-earned money.  When American people keep their hard-earned  [[Page H1565]]  money, they come up with good ideas, and our economy begins to thrive.   Mr. Chair, H.R. 1 is not about politics. It is about the American  people. They are sick and tired of people inside the beltway taking and  taking and taking while they are always having to do the giving.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support  H.R. 1. It is the right thing to do for the American people. Let's  unleash American energy.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
