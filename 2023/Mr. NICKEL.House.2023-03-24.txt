 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 5, a  partisan effort to bring culture wars into our Nation's classrooms.   My grandfather had a way of saying no to me as a kid. He would hold  up his hand and he would say, when red hair grows right here in the  palm of his hand. That was his way of saying no. It is the same with  this legislation in the Senate which will go nowhere in the Senate.   It opens the door to more book bans in our local school libraries by  requiring schools to report each and every book in their inventory.   Let's be clear: Recent attempts to restrict access to books are an  attack on the fundamental values of our democracy. Banning books is not  only a violation of our First Amendment rights, but it also undermines  our children's education and intellectual growth.   As a father of two, I am disappointed by these partisan attempts to  restrict access to books that could inspire and educate our children.  We should be working together to build a better future for our kids,  instead of engaging in more partisan political games.                            ____________________
