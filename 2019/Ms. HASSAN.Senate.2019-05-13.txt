 Mr. President, today I would like to recognize the  retirement of Mr. Larry Gammon of Bedford, NH, after 47 years of  service to Easterseals.   Larry started his career with Easterseals New Hampshire in 1971,  serving as the facilities director and helping out with everything from  teaching to driving the bus.   In 1985, Larry was named president and CEO of Easterseals New  Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine and, for the past 33 years, has overseen  the programs and services offered to individuals who experience  disabilities in these states.   Under Larry's leadership, Easterseals has grown to offer 13 core  programs, including child development centers, a family resource  center, child and family services, early supports and services, autism  services, residential and educational services, special transit, camps  and recreation, community-based services, workforce development,  military and veterans services, senior services, substance misuse  treatments, and oral health services. The organization serves more than  32,000 clients annually with a staff of 1,800.   Larry has also done incredible work lending his expertise and  extraordinary kindness and energy as an active member of the Queen City  Rotary Club, the mayor's task force on human services, the NH State  Rehabilitation Advisory Council, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center  Assembly of Overseers, and YMCA task force on accessibility.   Whether on one of the boards that he serves or in his professional  life, Larry has made a real difference in the lives of so many and his  work has strengthened our families, communities, and State, and he has  done so with humility and humor.   I hope you will join me in honoring a dedicated Granite Stater, Larry  Gammon.                            ____________________
