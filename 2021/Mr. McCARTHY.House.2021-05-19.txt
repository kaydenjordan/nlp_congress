 Mr. Speaker, I rise to raise a question of the  privileges of the House and send to the desk a resolution (H. Res. 414)  directing the Attending Physician to take timely action to provide  updated mask wearing guidance applicable to the Hall of the House of  Representatives and committee meeting spaces for Members and staff who  are vaccinated against Covid-19, consistent with the public guidance  released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on May 13,  2021.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
