 Mr. President, I have been doing oversight of the  executive branch for a very long time. I have done it as ranking  member, I have done it as chairman, I have done it when my party held  the White House, and I have done it when the other party held the White  House.   Earlier this year, I stood up for the rights of my Democratic  colleagues to do oversight of the Trump administration, even while they  are in the minority. I did it because it was the right thing to do.  Lots of people give lip service to the notion of bipartisan oversight,  but very few actually practice it. It is tough. You have to be willing  to work with colleagues in the other party to ask tough questions of  your own political allies.   You can't just ask. If you actually want answers, you have to follow  through. True bipartisan oversight is impossible unless it is a two-way  street. If Democrats are unwilling to ask hard questions and force  answers from their own political allies, then there is simply no way to  move forward together in good faith. Both sides need to be committed to  getting the whole story--not just the half they think helps their side.  Regardless of whether my Democratic colleagues join me, I am interested  in that whole story.   There are two major controversies plaguing the credibility of the  Justice Department and the FBI right now. On the one hand, the Trump- Russia investigation, and then on the other hand, the handling of the  Clinton investigation. Any congressional oversight related to either  one of these topics is not credible without also examining the other.   Both cases were active during last year's campaign. Both cases have  been linked to the firing of the FBI Director. I have been trying to  explain this to my Democratic colleagues for months. The political  reality is, half of the country thinks our law enforcement  establishment gave Hillary Clinton and her aides a pass. These  questions go to the heart of the integrity of our Federal law  enforcement and justice system.   They are not going to go away just because Clinton lost the election.  The independent inspector general at the Justice Department certainly  isn't ignoring that issue. Democrats and Republicans in Congress have  asked the inspector general to look into a host of issues involving the  handling of the Clinton investigation during the campaign. His hard  work has already uncovered some pretty disturbing information.   Over the past week, the press has reported that an FBI agent was  removed from the special counsel's team and demoted at the FBI due to-- what do you think--political bias. The agent was at the very center of  both of these high-profile investigations. High-ranking FBI agent Peter  Strzok reportedly used his work phone to send anti-Trump and pro- Clinton text messages to another FBI agent with whom he was having an  illicit and immoral relationship.   This man was the Deputy Assistant Director for the FBI's  Counterintelligence Division. He worked on the investigation of former  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's use of a private server to  conduct--what do you think--official business.   According to news reports and according to documents, it looks like  he also helped draft Comey's controversial public statement ending that  case of Hillary Clinton and emails. Specifically, he apparently edited  out language that suggested legal jeopardy for Clinton. Press reports  state he opened the FBI's investigation of allegations of collusion  between the Trump campaign and Russia. It has been reported that he was  one of the two FBI agents who interviewed former National Security  Advisor Michael Flynn.    Can you imagine if the shoe were on the other foot? What if a high- ranking FBI official got caught expressing pro-Trump political bias on  his work phone while leading what is supposed to be a professional,  objective, and nonpartisan search for the truth? Why, of course, if  that were happening, Democrats would go ballistic, and they would have  every right to go ballistic.   This man held a crucial position of public trust, charged with  protecting this country from counterintelligence threats. He was a key  part of Director Comey's Clinton investigation and his Russia  investigation. I have been saying for months that these two cases are  forever linked. You cannot separate them.   The same people in the same agency handled both cases at the same  time, and now a huge segment of the American people have no faith that  these cases were treated, as they should be, impartially. I don't blame  the American people.   It is interesting that before he was fired, FBI Director Comey  lectured our Judiciary Committee and lectured the public about how the  men and women of the FBI ``don't give a rip about politics.''   I believe that for most of the hard-working, rank-and-file FBI  agents, that is absolutely true. Their jobs normally don't involve  controversial political questions, and their own political views aren't  relevant because they are professionals.   But no human is perfect, and no organization is immune from error. It  does no good for the leaders of the FBI to pretend that its senior  management is above all reproach, that they would never show any  improper political bias, and that they would never make mistakes.   The only way to protect against bias or misconduct is to recognize  that it exists and to confront it, not to hide it from Congress and the  American people.   The law and the facts, whatever they are, should guide the work of  the FBI and the Justice Department. If politics infected the  Department's decisions during a hotly contested national political  campaign, we would have to look at it. That is true whether it occurred  in the Clinton case, or in the Trump-Russia case, or if it included  both.   Anyone claiming to do bipartisan oversight of the executive branch  has to examine both. Ignoring either half of this story simply will not  be credible with the other half of the country.   Everyone thought Hillary Clinton was going to be President--everyone.  The perception of a huge segment of the public is that the whole  Washington establishment worked overtime to get her name cleared before  the Democratic Convention last summer. The FBI even called its case  ``Mid Year Exam.''   Director Comey testified that the former Attorney General refused  even to name the FBI's work and investigation. That is how political it  became. It was really the Attorney General who was at that time  insisting on calling it not an investigation but ``a matter''--m-a-t-t- e-r--whatever that means.   We have learned that Director Comey started drafting his exoneration  statement long before the investigation was done. It looks like there  was a rush to clear her. It looks like the fix was in. I know Democrats  don't want to hear that. They only want to talk about Trump.   There is a double standard here in the way they desperately want to  go after the President but ignore all other potential wrongdoing in the  previous administration. It stinks to high heaven.   But Democrats have visions of impeachment dancing in their heads.  Rather than reserve judgment and carefully examine the facts--all of  the facts--they are jumping to all sorts of conclusions.   The Judiciary Committee has an obligation to do a deep dive into the  firing of James Comey and both of the two controversial political  investigations that preceded it. Unfortunately, the Democrats are  preventing any truly bipartisan path forward. They appear to be  assuming the conclusion at the outset.   They complain publicly, and they complain privately that I am not  doing enough to investigate ``obstruction of justice,'' but  ``obstruction of justice'' is a legal term of art. It is a conclusion,  not evidence. That is not how I conduct my investigations.   I do not make my conclusions first and try to shoehorn the facts to  fit my conclusions. I try to get the facts and then go where those  facts lead.   Let's consider examples of where investigations have uncovered facts  that point to ``obstruction.''  [[Page S7884]]    Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon both lied to investigators. That is  obstruction, and that behavior got one of them impeached and forced the  other to resign.   We also recently learned that Hillary Clinton's lawyers used a  program called BleachBit to delete 33,000 emails under subpoena by the  House of Representatives.   Now, those government records--and they are government records--can  never be recovered. Those facts certainly look like obstruction, but we  don't have all of the facts here yet.   So far, I have seen no credible evidence that President Trump has  told anyone to lie. I also have seen no credible evidence that he or  his aides have destroyed records being sought by investigators.   Many people firmly believe that the President fired the FBI Director  in order to improperly halt an investigation of Lieutenant General  Flynn.   Now, I am not only willing but I am eager to delve deeply into all of  the circumstances surrounding Director Comey's removal, but to claim at  the outset that his removal was obstruction of justice puts the cart  before the horse.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  an article by the well-known liberal law professor Alan Dershowitz.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                   [From The Boston Globe, Dec. 5, 2017]    Senator Dianne Feinstein may be provoking a constitutional conflict                          (By Alan M. Dershowitz)         Senator Dianne Feinstein may be provoking a constitutional       conflict between the legislative and executive branches of       our government. The California Democrat has said that       Congress is investigating whether President Trump engaged in       obstruction of justice by firing FBI Director James Comey and       taking other actions to halt the Russian investigation.        Feinstein said: ``I think what we're beginning to see is       the putting together of a case of obstruction of justice, I       think we see this in the indictments--the four indictments       and pleas that have just taken place.        ``And I see it, most importantly, in what happened with the       firing of Director Comey, and it is my belief that that is       directly because he did not agree to lift the cloud of the       Russia investigation, that's obstruction of justice.''        No, it isn't.        Feinstein does not seem to understand that under our       constitutional system of separation of powers, the president       cannot be charged with a crime for merely exercising his       authority under Article 2 of the Constitution. This authority       includes firing the director of the FBI, for whatever reason       or no reason. It also includes the authority to tell       prosecutors who to prosecute and who not to. A president's       motives may not be the basis for a criminal charge. Nor is it       proper to psychoanalyze the president in a search for       possible evil motives. All presidents act out of mixed       motives, including self-aggrandizement, political advantage,       partisan benefit, and personal pique.        Consider, for example, President Barack Obama's benighted       decision, as a lame duck, to tie the hands of his successor       by unilaterally changing the longstanding American policy       with regard to the United Nations condemnation of Israel. The       president, over the objection of many members of Congress and       most Americans, instructed his UN ambassador not to veto a       Security Council Resolution that declared the Western Wall,       the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem, and the access roads to       Hebrew University and Hadassah Medical Center hospital, to be       illegally occupied territory. Why did Obama exercise his       authority in so pernicious a manner? I believe, and many       Americans believe, that he did it out of spite and pique: to       get even with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. If I am       right, and I am sure that this was at least one of his       motivating considerations, could he be charged with a crime       for abusing his authority for personal vengeance? Of course       not. We can condemn him, as I and others have. But we must       all acknowledge that he had the authority to do what he did,       regardless of his bad motives.        Ironically, it was the effort of the Trump administration       to prevent the lame-duck president from tying the hands of       the president-elect, by not vetoing the UN resolution, that       formed the basis for the lying charge levied against General       Michael Flynn. For whatever reason, Flynn lied--but what he       lied about was entirely lawful.        Trump would have been within his constitutional authority       to pardon Flynn, as Flynn hoped he would do. That would have       kept him from cooperating with the special counsel and       becoming a government witness. Had the president done that,       he would have acted entirely lawfully, as President George       H.W. Bush did when he pardoned Caspar Weinberger in order to       stop the Iran-Contra investigation. Although special       prosecutor Lawrence Walsh complained bitterly that the Bush       presidential pardon had the intent and effect of completely       closing down his investigation, no one suggested that Bush       had committed the crime of obstruction of justice. Why?       Because that was Bush and this is Trump--a pure ad hominem       distinction that should be given no weight by the law.        It would do violence to our constitutional separation of       powers if a president could be charged with a crime simply       for exercising his constitutional authority. Checks and       balances do not include the power to criminalize--through the       vague obstruction of justice statute--presidential actions       authorized by Article 2. Both Presidents Richard Nixon and       Bill Clinton were accused of obstruction of justice, but in       both cases they were accused of going well beyond the mere       exercise of their constitutional authority. Nixon was accused       of telling subordinates to lie to the FBI, paying hush money       to potential witnesses, and destroying evidence. Clinton was       accused of trying to get witnesses, such as Monica Lewinsky,       to lie. These charges constitute acts--independent crimes--      that go well beyond a presidential authority. Trump has not       been accused of any acts that would independently constitute       crimes. The entire case against him, as outlined by       Feinstein, consists of constitutionally authorized acts that       were well within the president's authority under Article 2.       That is an enormous and consequential difference under our       system of separation of powers.        So, until and unless there is proof that Trump has       committed an independent criminal act--beyond acts that are       within his constitutional prerogative--it would be       unconstitutional to charge him with obstruction of justice,       regardless of what Feinstein and others believe his motive       may have been.     Now, Professor Dershowitz is not a fan of Donald Trump,  and he and I probably would not agree on many issues, generally  speaking.   The title of his article is ``Senator Dianne Feinstein may be  provoking a constitutional conflict.'' Professor Dershowitz strongly  disagrees with the ranking member's statement on ``Meet the Press'' the  weekend that Comey was fired: `` . . . directly because he did not  agree to lift the cloud of the Russia investigation, that's obstruction  of justice.''   This is how Professor Dershowitz replied:         No, it isn't. . . . under our constitutional system of       separation of powers, the president cannot be charged with a       crime for merely exercising his authority under Article 2 of       the Constitution. This authority includes firing the director       of the FBI, for whatever reason or no reason.    That is not to say that the President can engage in illegal conduct.  But the professor's point, as I understand it, is that when a President  takes an action that is within the scope of clear constitutional  authority and discretion, it should be a political question not a  criminal one.   The Judiciary Committee still needs to investigate the circumstances  surrounding Comey's firing and the Flynn investigation. Those facts may  have nothing to do with the obstruction but could still provide  important insight about the potential reforms of how the FBI and the  Justice Department operate.   For example, he explains how President Trump could have halted any  investigation of Flynn if he really wanted to. This is what the  professor says:         Trump would have been within his constitutional authority       to pardon Flynn, as Flynn hoped he would do. That would have       kept him from cooperating with the special counsel and       becoming a government witness. Had the president done that,       he would have acted entirely lawful, as President George H.W.       Bush did when he pardoned Caspar Weinberger in order to stop       the Iran-Contra investigation. Although special prosecutor       Lawrence Walsh complained bitterly that the Bush presidential       pardon had the intent and effect of completely closing down       his investigation, no one suggested that Bush had committed       the crime of obstruction of justice.    Then, finally, Professor Dershowitz explains what real obstruction  looks like and how it is different from a President's merely exercising  his constitutional authority. So I, once again, quote the professor:         Both Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton were accused       of obstruction of justice, but in both cases they were       accused of going well beyond the mere exercise of their       constitutional authority. Nixon was accused of telling       subordinates of lie to the FBI, paying hush money to       potential witnesses, and destroying evidence. Clinton was       accused of trying to get witnesses, such as Monica Lewinsky,       to lie. These charges constituted acts--independent crimes--      that go well beyond presidential authority. Trump has not       been accused of any facts that would independently constitute       crimes. The entire case against him, as outlined by       Feinstein, consists of constitutionally authorized acts that  [[Page S7885]]       were well within the president's authority under Article 2.       That is an enormous and consequential difference under our       system of separation of powers.    But our constitutional system of checks and balances is too important  to throw it aside when it isn't politically convenient. You don't have  to be a Trump fan to worry about the consequences of taking shortcuts  in going after your political opponents. That is why bipartisan  investigations are so very valuable.   When it works, a bipartisan inquiry can provide comfort that all  angles have been explored and explored thoroughly.   But it takes two to tango, as they say.   Earlier this year, Ranking Member Feinstein expressed concerns about  reports that former Attorney General Lynch asked Director Comey to  downplay the FBI's investigation as merely, a ``matter'' instead of  using the term ``investigation'' during the campaign. Yet, since then,  the ranking member has told me plainly that she will not join in any  oversight of the FBI's Clinton email investigation.   Even on Trump-Russia oversight, where we have been able to cooperate  a great deal, there have been similar problems.   First, all year, I have wanted to learn more about the origins of the  dossier that largely kick-started the FBI's investigation of the Trump  campaign.   In July, the ranking member joined me in a bipartisan letter seeking  voluntary cooperation from the firm that produced the dossier. The  dossier was based largely on Russian sources within Russia and was put  together by a former British spy. It made salacious and unverified  claims about Trump. The company responsible for producing it--Fusion  GPS--was uncooperative.   In response to our bipartisan request, it dumped on the committee  about 32,000 pages of press clippings and 8,000 pages that were  entirely blank. Since then, it has provided zero additional documents.    The founder of Fusion GPS initially indicated that he would rely on  his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination rather than  testify at the committee hearing in July. He later agreed to a private  staff interview but refused to answer dozens of key questions.   I would like to compel him to answer questions and compel him to  provide the documents that Senator Feinstein and I both asked him in  July to provide voluntarily, but under our committee rules, I don't  have the authority to do that on my own.   Why would Democrats not want to follow up and get the documents from  Fusion GPS that we already asked for together--in other words, in a  bipartisan way? Do they not want to know more about how this company  put together its anti-Trump dossier from Russian Government sources?   Well, in light of recent news, the resistance from Democrats to this  line of Trump/Russia inquiry is now a little more understandable. It  turns out that the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National  Committee are the ones that paid Fusion GPS for the information they  gathered from Russian Government sources.   I don't know whether the ranking member or her staff knew the facts  earlier this year when I was trying to persuade her to do bipartisan  followup work with Fusion GPS, but I do know that unless both sides are  willing to ask tough questions no matter where the facts lead, there  can be no bipartisan oversight.   We have learned that the Democratic National Committee paid for an  anti-Trump dossier based on information from Russian Government  sources. Second, we have learned that the inspector general uncovered  evidence of partisan bias by a senior FBI official at the center of  both the Clinton and the Trump-Russia investigations, which led to his  dismissal from the Mueller team.   Before that news broke, back in October of this year, I wrote to the  FBI official requesting voluntary cooperation and a private transcribed  interview with the committee. The ranking member did not sign that  letter. The committee has received no letter in reply. We are still  waiting for documents from the FBI about his and other officials'  participation in the draft Comey statement.   The FBI should comply voluntarily, but if they don't, I would issue a  subpoena to require that the documents be provided and that the witness  sit for a deposition. However, under our committee rules, I don't have  the authority to do that without support from the ranking member.   Finally, I have long had concerns that the scope of the FBI Clinton  investigation was artificially narrow. Recent revelations about these  text messages showing political bias only heighten these concerns.   In recent Federal court rulings, the FBI said that the scope of the  investigation was limited in two ways. First, it was limited to two  issues dealing with the handling of classified information. Second, the  scope of the FBI review was limited to the time when former Secretary  Clinton was at the State Department. But what if there was evidence of  crime not related to the mishandling of classified information? What if  the facts showed some obstruction such as intentional destruction of  documents after she was Secretary of State? Why exclude those topics  from the scope of the inquiry? Who made those decisions? Why were those  decisions made? Was there any political bias in those decisions?  Certain areas should not be declared off limits beforehand in an  investigation. An investigation should go--common sense--where the  facts take it.   In multiple letters to the FBI last year, I raised concerns about the  scope of the FBI investigation. I asked Director Comey back in May of  2016 whether the Justice Department had improperly narrowed the scope  of the investigation to look at the mishandling of classified  information and ignore other important legal issues. I wish to quote  from that letter:         If federal records on the private server were hidden or       destroyed, then there may have been a violation of 18 USC       Section 2071, which prohibits concealing or destroying such       Federal records.        If any of the deleted emails were responsive to       Congressional inquiries or to agency inquiries, such as ones       from the State Department Inspector General, then there may       have been violations of 18 USC Sections 1505 and 1519,       respectively.    Later in my letter, I specifically asked whether the Justice  Department limited the FBI's investigation in any way.   Then-Director Comey eventually responded months later. He claimed  that the FBI did investigate whether the unlawful obstruction of  Federal records occurred. But an FBI agent said under penalty of  perjury that the FBI investigation did not include destruction of  Federal records. So which is it? Who is telling the truth? The FBI  agent who signed the affidavit, or is Mr. Comey right? Did the FBI  really examine whether Secretary Clinton and her associates used the  server to avoid Federal records retention requirements, or did Mr.  Comey simply pay lipservice to that concern and focus only on  classification issues?   Understanding what really happened is incredibly important, and let  me tell my colleagues why. During the course of the FBI's  investigation, it recovered thousands of work-related emails that were  not turned over to the State Department by Secretary Clinton. The FBI  also recovered work-related emails that Secretary Clinton and her  associates apparently deleted. All of this is clear evidence of  alienation of Federal records. Indeed, even the FBI's now-public  investigative files show that the FBI had knowledge that Federal  records were deleted.   The FBI's interview summary of Secretary Clinton said that she was  asked about ``a PRN work ticket, which referenced a conference call  among PRN, Kendall, and Mills on March 31, 2015.'' I am going to repeat  that. She was asked about ``a PRN work ticket, which referenced a  conference call among PRN, Kendall, and Mills on March 31, 2015.'' PRN  stands for Platte River Networks, the company that administered  Secretary Clinton's nongovernment server. Kendall is David Kendall, her  lawyer. Mills is Cheryl Mills, her former Chief of Staff at the State  Department.   Paul Combetta, the administrator of her server, was also on the  conference call and was interviewed multiple times by the FBI. He  admitted that he lied to the FBI in his initial interviews and got  immunity from the FBI in exchange for agreeing to tell them the truth.  According to the summary of that interview, Mr. Combetta deleted  Secretary Clinton's email archives on March 31, 2015.  [[Page S7886]]    So we have a conference call with Secretary Clinton's attorneys on  March 31, 2015, and on that very same day, her emails are deleted by  someone who was on that conference call, using special BleachBit  software. The emails were State Department records under subpoena by  Congress.   What did the FBI do to investigate this apparent obstruction?  According to affidavits filed in Federal court, absolutely nothing. The  FBI focused only on the handling of classified information. Maybe now  we know why.   Recently released FBI records show that by May 2, 2016, Mr. Comey  sent around a draft of his statement exonerating Secretary Clinton. The  FBI interview with Mr. Combetta hadn't even happened yet. The  exoneration statement was already in progress before the key witness  had coughed up the truth about deleting Federal records under subpoena  by Congress.   Did the FBI look at obstruction in the Clinton case? Mr. Comey said  the FBI looked very hard at obstruction, but that is hard to believe.  Director Comey began drafting an exoneration statement in April or  early May of 2016. That is months before he publicly announced that he  would not recommend charges on July 5, 2016.   According to the testimony of senior FBI officials, Comey began  drafting his statement early because the FBI knew where the  investigation was headed. That is according to testimony of senior FBI  officials. But at that point, the FBI had not yet interviewed 17  witnesses. That ought to be understood. They hadn't yet interviewed 17  witnesses. And one of those witnesses--can you believe it--was  Secretary Clinton. Others included her closest aides and associates.  How can you possibly know where an investigation is headed without  interviewing the main witnesses and the subject of the investigation?   Maybe none of this raises any concerns for Democrats, but it should.  The American people deserve to have the whole story. Congress and the  public have a right to understand whether the fix was in from the very  beginning. If so, then it must take steps to make sure it never happens  again.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, to help ensure that our Federal judicial  system remains free of corruption, bias, and hypocrisy, today I rise to  reintroduce the Judicial Transparency and Ethics Enhancement Act. This  important bill would establish within the Judicial branch an Office of  Inspector General to assist the Judiciary with its ethical obligations  as well as to ensure taxpayer dollars are not lost to waste, fraud, or  abuse. Ensuring a fair and independent judiciary is critical to our  Constitutional system of checks and balances.   During my many years in Congress, I've worked hard to strengthen the  oversight role of Federal Inspectors General who serve as the first  line of defense against fraud, waste and abuse. The facts demonstrate  that the institution of the Inspector General has been crucial in  detecting, exposing and deterring problems within our government. In  collaboration with whistleblowers, Inspectors General have been  extremely effective in their efforts to expose and help correct these  wrongs.   I've come to rely on IGs and whistleblowers to ensure that our tax  dollars are spent according to the letter and spirit of the law. And  when that doesn't happen, we in Congress need to know about it and take  corrective action.   During the past fiscal year, Congress appropriated roughly $7 billion  in taxpayer dollars to support the Federal judiciary. Put in context,  the Small Business Administration and the Corporation for National and  Community Service each received less funding than the judiciary but  both entities have an Office of Inspector General. If we in Congress  believed that these entities could use an Inspector General, doesn't it  make good sense that the Judiciary would deserve the same assistance?   Beyond fiduciary factors, the current practice of self-regulation of  judges with respect to ethics and the judicial code of conduct has time  and time again proven inadequate. In fact, in the past seven years, the  Senate received articles of impeachment for not one but two Federal  judges.   In the first case, former Judge Samuel B. Kent, although charged with  multiple counts of sexual assault, pled guilty to obstruction of  justice. It took a criminal investigation by the Department of Justice  to uncover his false statements made to his colleagues who were  assembled to investigated him as well as substantiate the horrendous  claims made against him.   In the second case, you will recall that the Senate found former  Judge G. Thomas Porteous, Jr. guilty on multiple articles of  impeachment, including accepting money from attorneys who had a case  pending before him in his court and committing perjury by falsifying  his name on bankruptcy filings. This Judge's misbehavior came to light  through a federal criminal investigation, after which another judicial  committee had to be organized to investigate their fellow judge.   Moreover, in each case the disgraced judge tried to game the system  in order to retain his $174,000 salary. Rather than resign their  commissions, each first tried to claim disability status that would  allow each to continue to receive payment, even if in prison. Then both  played chicken with Congress daring us to strip them of their pay by  impeaching and convicting them. I am pleased that we put our foot down  and said ``No.''   The Judicial Transparency and Ethics Enhancement Act would establish  an Office of Inspector General for the judicial branch. The IG's  responsibilities would include conducting investigations of possible  judicial misconduct, investigating waste fraud and  [[Page S7893]]  abuse, and recommending changes in laws and regulations governing the  federal judiciary. The bill would require the IG to provide the Chief  Justice and Congress with an annual report on its activities, as well  as refer matters that may constitute a criminal violation to the  Department of Justice. Further, the bill establishes important  whistleblower protections for judicial branch employees to help keep  the judiciary accountable.   Judges are supposed to maintain impartiality. They're supposed to be  free from conflicts of interest. An independent watchdog for the  federal judiciary will help its members comply with the ethics rules  and promote credibility within the judicial branch of government.

This  important bill would establish within the Judicial branch an Office of  Inspector General to assist the Judiciary with its ethical obligations  as well as to ensure taxpayer dollars are not lost to waste, fraud, or  abuse. Ensuring a fair and independent judiciary is critical to our  Constitutional system of checks and balances.   During my many years in Congress, I've worked hard to strengthen the  oversight role of Federal Inspectors General who serve as the first  line of defense against fraud, waste and abuse. The facts demonstrate  that the institution of the Inspector General has been crucial in  detecting, exposing and deterring problems within our government. In  collaboration with whistleblowers, Inspectors General have been  extremely effective in their efforts to expose and help correct these  wrongs.   I've come to rely on IGs and whistleblowers to ensure that our tax  dollars are spent according to the letter and spirit of the law. And  when that doesn't happen, we in Congress need to know about it and take  corrective action.   During the past fiscal year, Congress appropriated roughly $7 billion  in taxpayer dollars to support the Federal judiciary. Put in context,  the Small Business Administration and the Corporation for National and  Community Service each received less funding than the judiciary but  both entities have an Office of Inspector General. If we in Congress  believed that these entities could use an Inspector General, doesn't it  make good sense that the Judiciary would deserve the same assistance?   Beyond fiduciary factors, the current practice of self-regulation of  judges with respect to ethics and the judicial code of conduct has time  and time again proven inadequate. In fact, in the past seven years, the  Senate received articles of impeachment for not one but two Federal  judges.   In the first case, former Judge Samuel B. Kent, although charged with  multiple counts of sexual assault, pled guilty to obstruction of  justice. It took a criminal investigation by the Department of Justice  to uncover his false statements made to his colleagues who were  assembled to investigated him as well as substantiate the horrendous  claims made against him.   In the second case, you will recall that the Senate found former  Judge G. Thomas Porteous, Jr. guilty on multiple articles of  impeachment, including accepting money from attorneys who had a case  pending before him in his court and committing perjury by falsifying  his name on bankruptcy filings. This Judge's misbehavior came to light  through a federal criminal investigation, after which another judicial  committee had to be organized to investigate their fellow judge.   Moreover, in each case the disgraced judge tried to game the system  in order to retain his $174,000 salary. Rather than resign their  commissions, each first tried to claim disability status that would  allow each to continue to receive payment, even if in prison. Then both  played chicken with Congress daring us to strip them of their pay by  impeaching and convicting them. I am pleased that we put our foot down  and said ``No.''   The Judicial Transparency and Ethics Enhancement Act would establish  an Office of Inspector General for the judicial branch. The IG's  responsibilities would include conducting investigations of possible  judicial misconduct, investigating waste fraud and  [[Page S7893]]  abuse, and recommending changes in laws and regulations governing the  federal judiciary. The bill would require the IG to provide the Chief  Justice and Congress with an annual report on its activities, as well  as refer matters that may constitute a criminal violation to the  Department of Justice. Further, the bill establishes important  whistleblower protections for judicial branch employees to help keep  the judiciary accountable.   Judges are supposed to maintain impartiality. They're supposed to be  free from conflicts of interest. An independent watchdog for the  federal judiciary will help its members comply with the ethics rules  and promote credibility within the judicial branch of government. The  Judicial Transparency and Ethics Enhancement Act will not only help  ensure continued public confidence in our federal courts and keep them  beyond reproach, it will strengthen our judicial branch.
