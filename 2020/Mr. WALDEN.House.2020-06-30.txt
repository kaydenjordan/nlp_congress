 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Graves for yielding and for his  work trying to get this bill in a better place. And I thank Chairman  DeFazio for working with me on an amendment that will come up tomorrow  that will allow the Port of Cascade Locks to compete for funds to add a  path on the Bridge of the Gods to provide a safer place for hikers and  horseback riders on Pacific Crest Trail to cross the Columbia River. It  is nice when we can work together for the best interests of our  citizens.   I wish we had been able to work on all the infrastructure issues in  this bill in the same spirit. I won't waste my time dwelling on the  partisan process fouls that encumber this bill. Building better  American infrastructure is a public policy that has almost always  brought us together as a Congress and a country. Until this week and  until this legislation.    Republicans have proposals to make American energy infrastructure  more resilient and safeguard it from cyberattack.   Republicans have proposed more than two dozen policies, Mr. Speaker,  to help get high speed broadband to all Americans.   We have legislation to put America in the driver's seat of autonomous  vehicle innovation and production.   We could find common ground to remove unneeded but costly regulatory  barriers that stand in the way of important infrastructure improvements  and the jobs that come with them. But unfortunately, the work and ideas  of Republicans on the Energy and Commerce Committee were not included.  Heck, we weren't even consulted. What could be a bipartisan bill  destined to become law will instead likely never get to the President's  desk and never become law.   So I urge my Democratic friends and colleagues to work with us on a  bipartisan legislative package on infrastructure that can become law  and that will improve our Nation's infrastructure.
