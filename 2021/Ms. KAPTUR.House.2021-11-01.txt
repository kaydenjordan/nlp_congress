 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Section 232 steel  and aluminum agreement that President Biden's administration has  reached with the European Union.   This agreement is critical as a safeguard for national security, to  restore and improve our transatlantic alliances, and bolster the  American steel and aluminum industries that serve as the backbone of  this country.   Establishing a level playing field through robust enforcement  mechanisms will ensure that American companies are able to compete in  the marketplace, not forced to contend with the cheaper and shoddier  metals dumped around the globe by China and others.   President Biden is delivering for domestic manufacturers and our  union brothers and sisters who build up America. Together, we will  continue our work to create the good-paying middle class jobs our  families deserve. Let us rebuild our communities with the innovation  and ingenuity that only American industries can produce.                            ____________________
