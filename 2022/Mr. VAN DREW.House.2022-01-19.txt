 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and  thank him for his leadership.   The President's most important job is to lead, to lead and protect  our country. Yet time and again, all we have seen from President Biden  is a failure to lead.   Biden's handling of Afghanistan led to the death of 13 American  servicemembers and left hundreds more abandoned. This was a failure to  lead.   Biden's handling of the border has been a disaster with more than two  million illegal immigrants being apprehended at our border. This was a  failure to lead.                                time  1415    Biden failed to shut down COVID-19 and has allowed more Americans to  die from this disease, despite widespread access to vaccines. This was  a failure to lead.   Inflation is at a 40-year high; supply chains are crippled; and labor  shortages have hindered an economic recovery. This has been a failure  to lead.   Soft-on-crime policy has resulted in 16 of America's largest cities  suffering from new highs in homicide rates and a 115 percent increase  in attacks against our law enforcement officials, all while President  Biden and House Democrats demand to defund our police. This has been a  failure to lead.   This is not the America I know. The America I know is strong, and it  deserves a strong leader, not the worst President in our history, not  one that continues time and again to fail to lead.
