 Mr. Speaker, I am glad that President  Trump is meeting with his team to figure out how to save corporate  America from the economic fallout of the coronavirus outbreak. After  the worst economic collapse in over a decade, I would expect nothing  less. But a corporate bailout doesn't help the everyday workers I  represent.   What about the independent contractors working two or three jobs just  to get by? Or the warehouse workers who are laid off because China is  exporting fewer goods to the Port of LA or Long Beach? Or the Uber  drivers who lose business when a convention is canceled or are forced  to self-quarantine?   These workers don't have workplace benefits such as paid sick leave.  The option to self-quarantine isn't an option at all when you have to  work and live every day paycheck to paycheck.   Mr. President, these are the stories of real Americans who are  bearing the brunt of this crisis, and they deserve relief, too. They  deserve your attention, too. I urge you to work with Democrats in the  House to pass a real plan to help all Americans.
