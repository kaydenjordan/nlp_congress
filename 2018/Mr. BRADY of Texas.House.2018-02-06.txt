 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his  leadership and hard work on this effort.   For over a year, the Ways and Means Committee has been leading  efforts to advance smart, focused solutions to improve Medicare for the  American people. A number of these solutions are included in the bill  before us today. These policies take action on three primary goals:   First, expanding access to high-quality care;   Second, increasing efficiency in the way we deliver care--a key goal  that will help patients better receive the care they need when they  need it; and   Third, incorporating healthcare technologies that are focused on  patients, such as telehealth, and eliminating barriers to coordinating  care.   This means providing new tools to patients that healthcare providers  can use to better access care and deliver it and, at the same time,  reducing red-tape burdens that now make it harder for our local doctors  to provide the high-quality care our Americans deserve.   So many of these provisions have support from Republicans and  Democrats, and for good reason. These are smart, targeted improvements  that will go a long way in helping Medicare patients in Texas and,  frankly, throughout the country.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank all of the members of our committee and  throughout the House who have worked on these provisions. Improving and  strengthening Medicare for the long term is a major priority for the  American people. With this bill, we have an opportunity to take  meaningful steps toward this important goal.    Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting its  passage.
