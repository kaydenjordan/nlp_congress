 Madam Speaker, today, because federally regulated banks  and other financial institutions may face prosecution if they offer  their services to businesses selling legal cannabis products across 47  States, D.C., and four U.S. territories, many legal businesses are  forced to operate in a cash-only business, making them targets for  theft and creating opportunities for tax evasion and money laundering.   It is simply unfair to deprive legal, State-approved businesses of  financial services any longer. Social equity will go further by  allowing businesses to come out of the shadows.   As chair of the House Committee on Agriculture's Subcommittee on  Biotechnology, Horticulture, and Research, I am pleased that this  legislation was made inclusive of hemp as it moved through the process.  I have heard from a number of legal hemp businesses that have  experienced similar issues.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Perlmutter),  my colleague, for the inclusion of the territories.
