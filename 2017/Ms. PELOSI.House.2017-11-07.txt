 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I accept his compliment on behalf of the House Democratic Caucus,  which really developed the better deal. It sprang from our membership,  with consensus based on our values that keep us united for America's  working families. That is the unifying factor in our Democratic Caucus  in the House.   Mr. Garamendi, I thank you for your diligence in always coming to the  floor and speaking truth about the numbers, about what they mean to  America's future, and also about making it in America. So much of that  is violated by what the Republicans have put forth.   I thank you for starting with the budget, because a budget should be  a statement of national values. What is important to us as a nation  should be reflected in how we allocate our resources. That is how we  Democrats have always thought of it and acted upon it.   That is not what is present in the Republican budget on which these  taxes are predicated.   Would it be a statement of your values to take $1.5 trillion from  Medicare and Medicaid and give a $1.5 trillion tax cut to corporate  America while, at  [[Page H8592]]  the same time, saying to working families you are going to have to pay  what little--hit them on their deduction on SALT, the State and local  taxes, and rubbing salt in the wound by saying that corporations don't  have that deduction taken away from them and, at the same time, in this  tax plan, making it advantageous for corporations to send jobs overseas  by having them pay a lower tax for a factory they set up abroad than  they would pay in the United States?   It is just not right. It is just not fair.   You have been a champion, along with Mr. Hoyer, on making it in  America. Again, this tax proposal that the Republicans are putting  forth does violence to all of that.   And thank you for pointing out the structural nature of what they are  doing to the budget. The Republicans, our colleagues, are supposed to  be deficit hawks. We agree that we must pay as you go. That has been  our modus operandi until the Republicans came along and removed that:  You want something? Pay as you go.   Republicans contend to be deficit hawks, but that must be an  endangered species because none of them seem to recognize or  acknowledge the damage they are doing to our fiscal soundness as we go  out not just in the first 10 years, which is damaging enough and  structurally horrible enough, but in the following 10 years. And we in  Congress, when we make proposals that have a budget impact, have to  account for not only the first 10 years, but the second 10 years.   Mr. Speaker, in the second 10 years, the horror of what the  Republican tax bill does to the budget is a hemorrhaging--a  hemorrhaging. This tax bill, when Members vote for it, if they do, will  be an assault on our children's future. It is not only fiscally  unsound, it is morally ungrounded because it says to our children and,  in my case, our grandchildren: You are going to have to pay the bill.   The sad part of it is it has an impact on the budget. It comes back  and says, well, we have so much deficit and so much debt service, so  much interest on the national debt, we are now going to have to make  further cuts in education, in research and development, in all of the  initiatives that produce innovation.   Innovation begins in the classroom. They make an assault on the  classroom in this tax bill. It is going to get worse when they try to  pay for it.   Then, of course, it is fiscal engineering so that they can go after  Medicare and Medicaid, Social Security once again. They have never  really believed in Medicare. They say it should wither on the vine, and  in this bill, they do violence to it.   But let's just talk about what this does to the State of California,  my colleague, because our Golden State, which we are proud to  represent, is a great economic resource to the Nation--to the Nation.  It contributes enormously to our balance in trade, whether it is  agriculture from your area, innovation, entertainment, whatever it is.  California is a big producer of favorable balance of trade for America.   Without California and without the industries that it has spread  throughout the country, we would be in an even worse trade situation  than we are now for all the giveaways that the Republicans are giving  in the trade issue.   But let me just talk about this and what it means to people in their  homes at their kitchen table when they are trying to pay the bills,  establish their own priorities, make ends meet.   It is shocking, Mr. Speaker, it is absolutely shocking that 14 of our  colleagues from California voted for a budget, and now many of them are  proposing to vote for a tax bill, that will hurt their constituents to  the tune of tens of thousands of their constituents.   Doug LaMalfa, the First District of California, around 100,000  households in his district claim the SALT deduction to the tune of  thousands of dollars, and they will lose that.   Tom McClintock, around 100,000 or more claimed the deduction, and  that is 36 percent of the households in his district, and they will  lose thousands of dollars.   How does Paul Cook explain to his constituents, 57,000 of them who  have claimed the deduction, that he is going to cost them thousands of  dollars by increasing their tax bill?                                time  2015    Jeff Denham, he is really going to have to explain it very hard to a  large percentage of his constituents as to how he is increasing their  tax bill by thousands of dollars.   David Valadao, tens of thousands of his constituents will get the bad  news if he insists on voting for this bill, which will cost them  thousands of dollars.   Devin Nunes, tens of thousands of his constituents will pay the price  for his lack of courage in a vote to go down the line with the  Republicans to give a tax break to the wealthiest corporate America at  the expense of their constituents, a direct expense and cost to their  constituents.   Kevin McCarthy says to corporate America: We will give you $1.5  trillion tax cut, and guess who is paying for it? Around over 100,000  of my constituents to the tune of thousands of dollars.   Steve Knight: Don't worry, my constituents, we are giving the tax cut  to corporate America, $1.5 trillion, and we are taking it out of your  pocket, you are paying more.   Sadly, Ed Royce has the largest number of people who will be  affected, close to 100,000 people, and they will be spending thousands  of dollars more in the taxes that they pay because of SALT.   Ken Calvert, the same thing, tens of thousands paying thousands of  dollars more.   Mimi Walters, how does she explain to her constituents, tens of  thousands of them, that they will be paying thousands of dollars more  in taxes? Why? To give a tax break to the top 2 percent: 80 percent of  the tax break goes to the top 2 percent, 50 percent of it goes to the  top 1 percent, $1.5 trillion goes to corporate America.   Dana Rohrabacher, the same thing, tens of thousands of people will be  paying thousands of dollars more.   Darrell Issa. Hopefully Darrell won't vote for this. Hopefully some  of these constituents will make sure that their Member of Congress  knows that they see what is happening. Darrell Issa, well over 100,000  constituents paying thousands of dollars more.   Duncan Hunter, the same thing, around the same number. Well over  100,000--well over 150,000 paying thousands of dollars more. That  represents about a third of his district.   But, as I said before, to rub salt in the wounds, while they are  saying to their constituents, ``You are going to pay more because we  are taking away your deduction,'' they are saying to corporate America,  ``Your deductions for State and local taxes you keep.'' It is just  remarkable.    And I underestimated them because I know they would  question them, so I gave a conservative view. It is worse.   But you bring up the State and local, what SALT means, State and  local taxes. The State and localities, did you see there is a letter--I  don't have it right here--from the mayors of scores of cities in  California asking the Members of Congress not to vote for this because  of the provision that is in there that undermines their ability to  address the education needs of their constituents, of the people in  those towns and cities, the public safety issues? We had a firefighter  come testify as to what it means to public safety, to law enforcement,  to meeting the needs of people so that they can learn, that they can  work, that they can raise their families, and to do so in a way that  everyone pays his or her fair share. That is not the case here.   So, again, it is a boon to the megarich corporate special interest  and a bust to the middle class. It also is very harmful to small  business.   While the Republicans will say this is good for the middle class, it  is not. They give with one hand something and take with another, so  they can set the banquet table for the superrich corporate America and  throw some crumbs to the middle class and say:  [[Page H8593]]  Sucker. I am just telling it the way it is.   Instead, Democrats say: Let's go to the table, let's be respectful of  each other's views, let's have a clear objective debate on putting  growth in the middle table--what creates growth for our economy,  generating good-paying jobs, not stagnated wages, good-paying jobs, and  reduces the deficit, instead of taking us into a hemorrhaging state of  deficit in the years to come.   That is part of what is now. If time allows, and after the gentleman  says his remarks, I will go into some of the specific ways in which  cruelty is demonstrated in this budget. But right now, I just want to  say this is a letter to the California delegation from 24 cities with  their seals at the top and the signature of their mayors, some of them  Republican, who have asked not to pass a bill that has this provision  in it.    No. Well, what you see is they haven't really talked to  the American people because they don't want the American people to know  what is in this bill.   You would think that at the time when the bill is being marked up in  committee, when they came to the floor instead of engaging in their  conspiracy theories, they would, instead, brag about what they are  doing if they think it is right, but they are not. And the reason is  they are going so fast. This is the speed of light, in the dark of  night, so that nobody knows until it is too late, but we are going to  make sure that everyone does.   Let me correct my statement. I am not sure if any of the Republican  mayors signed this letter, but 24 mayors did. I see two prominent  mayors lacking on here, and I guess the discipline of the Republican  Party is extended to the mayors. But their cities will suffer, and they  know it.   Just another point, because you brought up process. I am not into  process. This is about what does this mean to America's families. But  because you brought it up, it is important to know that they don't want  people to know, and that is why their process is so behind closed  doors. Their members didn't even know what was in this until a couple  of days ago.    Every single one of them is voting to raise the taxes of  their constituents.   And in California--not that they were from California--but the  nonpartisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy estimates that  5.5 million California taxpayers--that is about a third of our  taxpayers, and that is families, so that is many people--will see an  average tax increase of $4,180; 2.2 million of those receiving a tax  increase will have incomes of less than $110,000.    So how can they say to the middle class, this is for you?    New taxes.   And we all want to encourage homeownership because it is putting down  roots. Building community is very important. But it is not just  California, it is across the country.   We are speaking from our experience. We are holding the California  Republicans accountable. But every one of the Members who votes here is  doing an injustice to the ability of States and local governments to do  their job. We are cutting taxes. Now you go raise them so you can get  the job done. So it makes matters even worse when you see what else is  there.   Some of the cruelties that are in the bill, I mean, macrowise we know  that this is a big transfer of wealth from middle class people to  corporate America and to the superrich. We know that it is unfair to  the middle class and will raise taxes on the middle class. It will  increase the deficit. It is a legacy assault on our children's future.  In addition, it deprives us opportunity cost to our budget in the near- term.   But there are some things in here that maybe are illustrative of the  fact that this is not a statement of anybody's values that you know.   Let's talk about education for a moment. First of all, with all due  respect, Mr. Speaker, one of the dumbest moves in this bill, with stiff  competition, but one of the dumbest moves in this bill is the cut to  education. Nothing brings more money to the Treasury than investing in  education: early childhood, K-12, higher education, postgrad, lifetime  learning. And in this bill, they, of course, make an assault on  education.   For example, if you have a student loan, right now you have a $2,500  deduction for your interest payment on the loan. Not in this bill. Make  that zero.   What? What did the middle class ever do to the Republicans that they  are going to take away a deduction for interest on student loans when  it is hard enough to save up and pay for college?   Next, now let's just go down to grade school. You are a teacher and  you bring to school supplies for the classroom because your district is  too poor to afford all of the things that the children would like to  have. Right now, you get a tax deduction for what you bring to the  classroom, but not in this bill. They have to take that away so they  can give a tax break to the superrich so that schoolteacher isn't even  compensated adequately, is sacrificing her personal funds, gets a tax  break, but they take it away because the top 2 percent are desperate  for their tax cut. But I don't think they are. I have more faith in the  people of our country to say: Let us pay our fair share and let's do  what is right.   But the list goes on on the things about lifetime learning and  employers being able to provide for the training of workers: bye-bye.   Let me just tell you this one, since we are talking about education  and children. In the bill, right now you get a tax credit to help you  with adopting a child.                                time  2030    Such a joy to a family. If you are adopting a child with special  needs, a tax credit. Not now. They have got to take that tax credit  away from you. You don't need it anymore because  [[Page H8594]]  they have got to give it to corporate America.   If your employer decides that their place of business wants to help  you with adoption, they get a deduction for helping you with your  adoption. Not under this bill. Say good-bye to that.   Tax credit to the family adopting, tax deduction to the employer all  gone so they can give the top 1 percent of our country 50 percent of  this benefit at the cost of America's working families.   If you have medical needs, since 1944, you could deduct medical  expenses for extraordinary medical needs. Very important to America's  families. Not anymore. Say good-bye to that because we have got to take  care of the superrich, so the pressure is on you.   The list goes on and on, but it gets personal. For families, it makes  a difference as to whether their children can go to college. It makes a  difference as to whether they can make ends meet with their medical  expenses. It makes a difference if they don't have their State and  local tax deduction. Again, this is across the country. We are speaking  from our California experience.   It would take all night to go through the sins in this tax bill. I  just wanted to give you a touch of some of those and how they directly  impact America's working families while they profess that they are  helping them. Not true.   Then they say: Oh, it is going to pay for itself.   Never has, never has. Don't take it from us. Bruce Bartlett, who is  part of this supply side economics leadership as well as the trickle- down economics, said: We never said it would pay for itself. Anybody  who says it does, it is not true. It is nonsense.   He even went on to say it was BS, as I am allowed to say on the floor  of the House in its initial form.   These other things they say that just aren't true--oh, they take the  name of Bill Bradley and Dick Gephardt in vain, and even President  Ronald Reagan: Oh, this is what they did.   No, this isn't what they did. They had over 400 people to testify, 30  hearings over a period of a couple of years, and worked in a bipartisan  way to iron out so that it would have sustainability. That is the only  way you get a good tax bill, is if it is bipartisan and sustainable.   So, in any event, this is a moment of truth for the American people,  and we want the truth to be known.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman for calling the  Special Order.    And just barely. Just barely.    And just barely. Just barely.    And just barely. Just barely.    All 14 California Republicans, like lemmings to the sea,  betraying the economic security of their constituents' families.    I do, too.    I do, too.    I do, too.    I do, too.    I do, too.    It was my pleasure.    It was my pleasure.    I thank you, because one thing that we must make sure  they know is that this is not tax reform. It is not a tax cut unless  you are in the top 2 percent or a corporation. But if you are a middle  class American or a working family in our country, you are susceptible  to an increase in what you pay in taxes. It is just not fair.   I thank Mr. Garamendi for his relentless leadership.
