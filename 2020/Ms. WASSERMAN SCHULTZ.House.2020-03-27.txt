 Mr. Speaker, as a proud Floridian, I rise to  protect our workers, health professionals, small businesses, and  veterans from this grave crisis we face.   Senate Republicans drafted a corporate-friendly bill that failed to  meaningfully support the millions who are losing their jobs. Instead,  Democrats secured a package that invests $2 trillion in families,  hospitals, and small businesses.   Workers will get massive investments in unemployment benefits and an  added 13 weeks of benefits, which Republicans fought to deny.   Working-class families will get as much as $3,400 for a family of  four.   Small businesses will get help to make payroll, rent, and utility  costs.   I am proud that the Appropriations Committee spearheaded nearly $20  billion to ensure veterans' health needs are met, whether at the VA or  local ERs and clinics.   Appropriators have also worked to ensure our VAs can assist our local  communities if they reach full capacity.   This package is not perfect, and more help will be needed. But our  families, small businesses, and hospitals need this help desperately.   I ask my colleagues to give them this lifeline against this invisible  enemy. We are all in this together.
