 Mr. President, I rise today, alongside my colleagues,  including Senator Coons and Senator Murray, to implore my colleagues to  hold firm in their support of Ukraine.   I have sat here for the last hour and listened to these speeches and  listened  [[Page S5493]]  to some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle--which, I  know, does not reflect all of them--and this is what I came away with:  the focus on ``Oh, you just want to go backward,'' the analogies to  talking about past decisions in Munich and Vietnam. We all are students  of history. I am focused on now. I am focused on what is happening now.   Like my colleagues here, I have strongly condemned the massacre, the  terrorist attack by Hamas--and the democracy of Israel. We stand with  Israel and the right to defend, but we also stand with the idea that we  should continue to provide humanitarian relief in Gaza and around the  world.   I think one of the ironies of the statement of our colleague from  Ohio--and some of our other colleagues--was that he failed to mention  that, actually, Israel has come out this week also supporting the  humanitarian aid. So that is one thing that I think needs to get  corrected.   The second, as we look at where we are now, he mentioned Vladimir  Putin, called him ``a bad guy.'' Those were his words, ``a bad guy.'' I  think it is a lot more than that. This is a tyrant. This is a ruler who  has committed war crimes, who has downed passenger planes, who has  invaded a democracy. Let's get the facts straight about Vladimir Putin.   The other thing is that, now, to not see this as connected is just  plain wrong. What kind of drones was Russia using? Iranian drones. Who  took the meeting with some of their senior officials from Russia? Who  went there? Hamas. Hamas went to Russia after this terrorist attack.   When we stand for democracies in one place, we stand for democracies  in other places.   Our colleague from Ohio referred to some of the President's requests  as a ``hodgepodge''--a ``hodgepodge.'' I was thinking of that word and  what is in this request and this budget: protection of a nuclear plant,  the largest nuclear plant not just in Ukraine but in Europe. When his  predecessor, Senator Portman, and I were in Ukraine, when we met with  President Zelenskyy--where we actually talked about the strong support  and the strong Ukrainian community in Ohio and in Minnesota--when we  met with him, a major focus of ours was the nuclear plant because we  didn't know how long the Ukrainians were able to hold the line to  protect that plant from not just contamination in Ukraine but  contamination all over Europe. That is what is in what our colleague  has called a ``hodgepodge'' of a budget.   What else? Supporting NATO. I was just with the leader of Estonia--a  small country, yes, but they have given over 1 percent of their  military budget--of the budget of their country--to Ukraine.   Are we just going to turn away on NATO because we think it is a  ``hodgepodge'' to support our allies in countries like Great Britain,  our allies in countries like France and Germany and Estonia and Latvia  and Lithuania and Georgia and, yes, Ukraine? We are just going to say  it is a ``hodgepodge''?   What else is in that ``hodgepodge''? Well, what else is in the  ``hodgepodge'' are things like air defense, things like munitions,  things like small arms. That is what we are talking about here when we  talk about the help that we give to Ukraine.   Then I looked at some of the percentages, as I sat here, of other  small nations that have given much more than the United States, where  it is something like 0.3 percent--right? These countries are at over 1  percent in the help that they have given Ukraine. They have taken in 4  million--count that, 4 million--refugees in Europe. So when we help  Ukraine, we are not doing it alone, colleagues. We are standing with  our allies. We are standing with our best trading partners. We are  standing with the world for democracy.    This is not in a vacuum. This is, as the President once said, a big  effing deal.   What about Vladimir Putin? Senator Bennet got at this. He is failing.  He tried to capture Kyiv, but he failed. He tried to wipe Ukraine off  the map, but he failed. He tried to break the Ukrainian spirit, but he  has made it stronger. He tried to break NATO, but NATO has grown.   Ukraine has persevered against all odds. To abandon our partners now  would be a dereliction of our duty to defend a democracy and an  embarrassment to this Nation, and, yes, it would create a much bigger  national security risk not just for our allies but for our country.   I have had the privilege of visiting Ukraine not just with Senator  Portman but on another visit, as well, with a number of our Republican  colleagues. Each time, I was struck by the strength of the people who  put their lives on the line: the ballerina who has to don camo and go  to the frontline, the cafe owner donating food to people in need, the  deejay at the national call center using her platform to find missing  loved ones.   We must not forget President Zelenskyy's words in September:         There is not a soul in Ukraine that does not feel gratitude       to you, America.    That is what we have to remember. They are watching in Ukraine. The  democracies are watching. And, as Leader McConnell has said, ``think of  it as an axis of evil: China, Russia, and Iran.''   This is not just a test for Ukraine. It is a test for the United  States and for the free world, and the path toward greater security for  all of us is simple: Help Ukraine win the war.   I yield the floor.   The Senator from Oregon is with us today to speak.
