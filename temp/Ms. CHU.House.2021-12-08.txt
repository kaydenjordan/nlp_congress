 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Dr.  Lorna Breen Act.   The past 2 years have stretched our Nation to the brink. No one has  shouldered this burden more than our healthcare workers. The doctors,  nurses, and all healthcare workers who have worked day in and day out  through surge after surge have put their lives on hold to care for us  and our loved ones as the pandemic spread around the country.   In many instances, they have done this while understaffed, without  sufficient PPE, and knowing that they are putting their own lives at  risk before a vaccine was available to them. This can have a profound  impact on a provider's mental health. Today, we are  [[Page H7525]]  taking an important step to ensure that they get the help they need.   The Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Protection Act establishes  grants for training healthcare workers and strategies to reduce and  prevent suicide burnout, mental health conditions, and substance use  disorders. It also establishes a national awareness campaign to  encourage healthcare professionals to seek support and treatment for  mental health issues.   As one of the two psychologists in Congress, I know how much mental  healthcare matters and how much stigma can prevent someone from getting  the help they need. By passing this bill today, we can say to  healthcare workers: You are not alone.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this critical  legislation.
