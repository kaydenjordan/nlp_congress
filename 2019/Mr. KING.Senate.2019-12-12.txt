 Mr. President, I rise for a few moments to compliment my  colleague, the chair of the Energy and Natural Resources committee,  along with her ranking member, Joe Manchin, who spoke a few minutes  ago, the Senator from West Virginia.   I have done a lot of thinking about leadership. One of the  observations I have made is that the character and personality and  thoughtfulness of the leader infect the entire organization. In this  case, the chair and the ranking member of our committee have produced  one of the most remarkable records of achievement in a committee that I  have seen since I have been here over the past year. It has been  because of their willingness to listen, their willingness to work with  all of the members of the committee--and it is quite a diverse  committee in terms of geography and in terms of ideology and in terms  of representation of various interests at the table of the important  questions of energy that face us.   This has been an amazingly productive year. I attribute that to the  skill and leadership and character of Senator Murkowski of Alaska and  of Senator Manchin of West Virginia.   It has been a wonderful experience for me to see what can be done in  this institution. The next step, of course, is to get to the floor of  the U.S. Senate and move these bills forward, as I think they can and  should, through the House of Representatives and to the President.   Again, I rise not only to congratulate but also to thank the  leadership of this committee for the great work they have done this  year. I look forward to even better and greater things in the years to  come.   I yield the floor.
