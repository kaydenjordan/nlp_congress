On this vote, the yeas are 88, the nays are  11.   The motion is agreed to.   The Senator from Virginia.    Mr. President, I thank my friend, the Senator from  Virginia, who is the vice chair of the Senate Select Committee on  Intelligence, for his remarks.   I, too, support the nomination of Dan Coats to serve as the next  Director of National Intelligence and succeed James Clapper, who has  been in the intelligence business for 50-plus years. He has big shoes  to fill, but I have every confidence Dan Coats can do that.   One of the things I hope he looks at is that post-9/11, when the  Office of the Director of National Intelligence was created, we  basically created another layer in the intelligence community. As the  Presiding Officer and other Members know, the DNI--the Office of the  Director of National Intelligence--has grown by leaps and bounds. I  just hope he takes a good, hard look at the layers we have created,  perhaps at the duplicative functions that do not necessarily make our  intelligence any better but that do create more problems in managing  what is a very important office to our national security and certainly  to the intelligence community.

I further ask that 1 hour of minority debate time be  reserved for Senator Wyden.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.
