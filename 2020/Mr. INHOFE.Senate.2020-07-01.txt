 Madam President, first of all, I would make a comment in  reaction to the comments of our good friend from Texas. What he says is  true, and the American people are not aware--and I don't say this  critically of the previous administration--but during the Obama  administration, his top priority was not really defense. He had his own  agenda, and, consequently, we suffered at that time.   In the last 5 years, which would have been from 2010 to 2015, he  reduced the  [[Page S4097]]  funding of our military by 25 percent. What people don't realize is,  during that same timeframe, Russia increased theirs by 34 percent, and  China increased the funding of their military by 83 percent. That put  us in a situation in which we have to do what we are doing, and that is  why this and the last bills have been very important.   We are still working on the National Defense Authorization Act. I  consider it to be the most important bill of the year. I know my  colleagues agree with me that this is very significant, and this is  something that we know is eventually going to pass. This will be the  60th consecutive year.   Our military is the best in the world. This week, with this bill, we  are going to make sure it stays that way. The goal of having a strong  military is deterrence--to make sure that we don't have to use it--and  to send a signal to our enemies that they can't win against us. This is  the message we need to send today, tomorrow, and forever. That is what  the national defense strategy tells us.   I don't have the national defense strategy book here, but we have  been adhering to it. It is a strategy that was put together a few years  ago by 12 Democrats, 12 Republicans, and all the experts in the field,  and we have been using it as our model ever since. So we want to make  sure that we have enough ships and planes and everything in place.   China and Russia have caught up in some areas, and I think it is  important, as the Senator from Texas said about the hypersonic weapons,  that we are talking about offensive and defensive weapons; we are  talking about something that is state of the art. They actually are  ahead of us right now, but with this bill we are going to get caught  up.   Our superiority rests on our staying ahead of our competition. We  ceded that advantage under the last administration, and we are going to  correct that. That is where we are right now.   I see the minority leader is here, and I would like to propose a  unanimous consent request.                Unanimous Consent Request--Amendments En Bloc    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that, at a time to be  determined by the majority leader in consultation with the Democratic  leader, the following amendments be made pending en bloc and the Senate  vote in relation to the amendments in the order listed without  intervening action or debate: Paul amendment No. 2011; Sanders  amendment No. 1790; third, Cornyn-Schumer-Cotton amendment No. 2244.   I further ask unanimous consent that the following amendments be  called up en bloc and the Senate vote on adoption of the amendments en  bloc with no intervening action or debate.   I hesitate to do this. It will take me a minute to actually name all  of the amendments because it is important for our Members who are  watching to be aware of where they stand in line.   I ask unanimous consent that the following amendments be called up en  bloc and the Senate vote on adoption of the amendments en bloc with no  intervening action or debate: Moran, No. 1694; Hyde-Smith, No. 1881;  Romney, No. 1883; Portman, No. 1891; Kennedy, No. 1987; Romney, No.  2018; Sullivan, No. 2391; Johnson, No. 2077; Wicker, No. 2178, Fischer,  No. 2231; Risch, No. 2238; Gardner, No. 2241; Portman, No. 2243;  Inhofe-Reed, No. 2248; Peters, No. 1753; Warner, No. 1803; Coons, No.  1808; Warner, No. 1907; Tester, No. 1968; Bennet, No. 1977; Smith, No.  2058; Cortez Masto, No. 2186; King, No. 2215; Merkley, No. 2251;  Cantwell, No. 2255; Cantwell, No. 2256; Hirono, No. 2269; Menendez, No.  2270, and Peters, No. 2275.    First of all, let me respond by saying that this has been  a long process, and it is one that has involved leadership on both  sides, and we are attempting to do that. I think that by looking at the  list I have read off, the Senator will see a lot of Democrats and a lot  of Republicans there. For that reason I think we have an adequate  number that several of us have agreed on, so I would object to  modification of my amendment.    I yield the floor.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object.    Mr. President, I object; although, I would like to have  the opportunity to look at all five of these amendments to see which  ones would not be consistent with the negotiation that is taking place  right now.   I would like to make sure that everyone understands that, at this  very moment, Democrats and Republicans are looking at a lot of  amendments, as we have done every year for 60 years, to make sure that  we are getting the right amendments in order to make the bill the best  we can.   Now, it will just take a few minutes for me to do this. Until then, I  reserve the right to object. If we have a timing problem on this, I  will object, but it might be that there is one I would like to consider  at this time.    Mr. President, I object.    Mr. President, I would like to be recognized in order to  make a comment.   First of all, I have great respect for the Senator. I have worked  with him many times, and we have really gotten quite a bit  accomplished. I know that my friend is sincere in the statements that  he makes, but I find myself in a different position.   I see what has happened in previous administrations, and, during the  last 5 years of the Obama administration, I saw when, in his budget,  the President reduced the military by 25 percent at the same time that  China was increasing its by 83 percent and Russia was increasing its by  34 percent. I am sensitive to this, and it is one of the considerations  we make.   I do object to this amendment, but I am going to work with the  Senator to see which of these might be appropriate and can be sellable  to a majority of the people in the Senate.    Mr. President, if the Senator would yield for one more  comment so I may address that, Senator Reed and I are both in  agreement. We have been wanting amendments. We have been asking on a  daily basis--now for about 2 months--for Members to bring their  amendments down so we can consider amendments. We are in the process  now of seeing which amendments we are able to bring up that we might  have reached an agreement on. We are doing that. It is not an easy  process, and it does take a little bit of time. Yet I am hopeful that  we will have amendments. I anticipate we will.    Mr. President, I would respond by saying that I don't  take issue with that, but I will say that we all remember what happened  a year ago when this bill was up. One of our Members objected to all  amendments coming up, and, as a result, no one got an amendment up.   That isn't happening this year because the individuals who were  opposed to amendments last year are no longer opposed to amendments. We  are just trying to--with the understanding and the realization that  things are done in the Senate with unanimous consent and that one  person has a lot of power to stop a lot of other people, we don't want  that to happen. We want to encourage amendments, and we are going to  try to consider as many as we can.    Thank you.    Mr. President, I have a motion to be made, but before  making it, I yield 3 minutes each to Senator Klobuchar from Minnesota  and Senator Schatz from Hawaii.    Mr. President, I call up the Paul amendment No. 2011 to  the text proposed to be stricken.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading  be dispensed with.    Mr. President, as I said earlier, I will move to table  the Paul amendment at 5:30 today, and Senators should expect a rollcall  vote at that time.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, there is another side to this story, and I  think, when you hear those promoting this particular amendment, it is  one we all agree--we want an end to the war. We want this to happen.  But there are some other reasons that this probably is not the best way  to do it.   First of all, the amendment directs a calendar-based withdrawal from  Afghanistan rather than a conditions-based. We have talked about this  quite often. It is something that you can't just say ``It is going to  happen by this date'' but, rather, under these certain circumstances.   It undermines peace negotiations and the Trump administration's  Afghan strategy. He has talked about that publicly. I think a lot of  people agree with that. I do.   It would also undermine the February 2020 U.S. agreement with the  Taliban that tries to map out a path to peace. According to the plan,  U.S. forces' reductions must be tied to Taliban counterterrorism  commitments. That is part of the plan.   Repealing it--the 2001 authorization for use of military force--would  undermine the authority of the President of the United States for  countering terrorists in Afghanistan but also would undermine the GITMO  detention and other global counterterrorist efforts.   The DOD and the White House would oppose this because it removes an  authority for using military force and would significantly undermine  counterterrorism authority.   So I move to table the Paul amendment No. 2011, and I ask for the  yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I want to thank all my colleagues and my  partners, my partner Senator Reed, for working so hard today to come to  an agreement. It has been a tough day. We think we have created a  package that is acceptable to everyone and we will be hotlining it  tonight.   The Senate will come back into session at 10 a.m. tomorrow morning,  and hopefully, we will be able to lock in our deal here.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate be  in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.
