 Madam President, as I was preparing to come to the floor,  I was going to say we are going to have a vote tonight to proceed to  fill a major gap in our national security, although it looks like  Mother Nature and the weather may prevent a vote tonight, and it may be  tomorrow. But, still, I expect in the next couple of days for us to  address a major gap in our national security.   More than a year and a half after the original CHIPS Act became law,  we are finally approaching the finish line in the race to fund it.   You may recall that it was June of 2020 that Senator Warner, the  senior Senator, a Democrat from Virginia, and I introduced the CHIPS  for America Act to address a frightening supply chain vulnerability  when it comes to the most advanced semiconductors in the world, 90  percent of which come from Asia, and 60 percent come from Taiwan.   Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin recently wrote a letter to  congressional leaders saying that ``funding the CHIPS Act is critical  to our national defense,'' and last week, former Secretary of State and  CIA Director Mike Pompeo also urged Congress to pass this funding,  saying:         The cost of compromise on this bill pales in comparison to       the costs we will suffer if we allow the Chinese Communist       Party to one day own and control access to our most critical       technologies.    I agree with both of these statements, one by a Democrat appointee,  another by a Republican appointee.   Chips underpin virtually all the technology that we use that keeps us  safe at home and protects our troops around the world. And for those  not conversant with the role semiconductors play, these microprocessors  underpin literally everything that has an off-and-on switch, and  obviously our dependency on that kind of technology will do nothing but  increase in the days and months and years ahead.   From our major military assets, like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter,  to everyday technologies that keep our troops safe, like advanced body  armor, semiconductors are key. Keeping a ready and dependable supply  chain of these defense assets requires a lot of semiconductors, and  right now, we are mainly looking to other countries to manufacture  them.   As a matter of fact, the United States of America makes zero percent  of the most advanced semiconductors in the world. We depend on  outsourcing virtually all of the manufacturing to other countries and  produce none of them here. Roughly 75 percent of the semiconductor  manufacturing globally is concentrated in China and East Asia, and 100  percent of the world's most advanced chipmaking capacity is located in  only two places--Taiwan and South Korea. As I said, Taiwan commands 92  percent of the world's advanced chipmaking, and the United States makes  zero.   You might wonder, How did we find ourselves in this situation? Well,  I think it was probably the supply chain vulnerabilities that we saw  from COVID-19 that called into question this assumption that just  because something could be made cheaper somewhere else in the world,  that that necessarily checked all the boxes. Well, it does if all you  are depending on is China to make toys for our children or other  nonessential items, but when you are talking about the very brains  behind the technology we need, ranging from our cell phone, as I said,  to our most sophisticated military weapons, it does not check all the  boxes to say we will just import those from abroad, where they can be  made cheaper, because that vulnerable supply chain, if disrupted, could  cause not only a severe economic depression in America but also  threaten our national security directly.   If access to those chips were cut off or restricted, we would be up a  creek without a paddle. We couldn't produce a stockpile of Javelin  missiles to supply Ukraine or produce the radios and  communications devices that keep our troops and our allies connected.  That is why shoring up this domestic supply, this manufacturing  capacity, is a key national security priority, and this is the best way  to protect one of our most critical supply chains and ensure our  military readiness will not be compromised by the People's Republic of  China or the Chinese Communist Party, which has threatened, by the way,  to invade Taiwan, where the vast majority of these advanced  semiconductors are made. But it wouldn't necessarily require a military  intervention. It could be another pandemic, it could be a natural  disaster--anything that might block our access to these advanced  semiconductors.    While closing that national security gap is the top priority here, we  can't ignore major economic consequences that this legislation will  deliver as well.   When I introduced this legislation with Senator Warner from Virginia,  who is chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, on which I also  serve, our focus was on national security. Obviously, many of our  States will be winners when it comes to the economic consequences of  this legislation as well. Texas has been, for example, a longstanding  leader in the semiconductor industry and is home to more than 200 chip  manufacturing facilities that employ 29,000 Texans. For years, our  State has reaped the benefits of semiconductor manufacturing. Most of  these are what are called legacy chips. They are the older chips where  you are not as concerned about miniaturization or compactness or  power--things that, for example, run our refrigerators or TV sets or  other consumer electronics or maybe even our cars.   We are already seeing the types of investments that this chips bill  will finally bring. Earlier this summer, Texas Instruments, in the  metroplex in Dallas-Fort Worth, broke ground on the first of four new  fabs in Sherman, TX, about an hour north of Dallas. This is part of a  $30 billion investment that is expected to create some 3,000 more jobs.  The mayor of Sherman, where this is located in Northeast Texas,  described it as ``a watershed day,'' noting that ``it's hard to have a  frame of reference for a $30 billion investment in a town of 50,000  people.''   Sherman isn't the only town in Texas preparing for a major chips  boom. Last fall, I joined leaders from Samsung--a South Korean company  with a large facility already in Austin, TX--when they announced a $17  billion additional investment in a new chip fab in Taylor, TX, just  outside of Austin. That facility is expected to directly create more  than 2,000 high-tech jobs, as well as thousands of other related jobs,  once it is operational because these fabs, or manufacturing facilities,  are not stand-alone; they are part of what ultimately will become an  ecosystem of suppliers and other affiliated industries that will be  built up around them, creating thousands more jobs.   But we also learned from Samsung that they are not likely to stop  there if we pass this CHIPS for America funding this week. Samsung is  currently considering whether to expand its investment to include 11  new chipmaking facilities in Central Texas.   If it moves forward with this plan, which, again, depends on our  passage of this legislation this week, it could lead to nearly $200  billion in additional investments and create 10,000 jobs.   I know that is tough to comprehend--the economic growth and sweeping  benefits that would come with a $200 billion investment and 10,000 new  jobs; but as exciting as these potential investments are, there is  something even better. This is just the beginning.   Companies around the world are eyeing Texas and the United States for  new investments in chipmaking. Applied Materials, NXP Semiconductors,  [[Page S3625]]  Infineon, GlobalWafers, GlobiTech, and a number of other companies are  looking at building or expanding their facilities in Texas or other  parts of the country.   GlobalFoundries, for example, is investing $1 billion to boost  production in New York. Intel plans to build a $20-billion facility of  two fabs in Ohio. And Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company--TSMC,  as it is called--is building a $12-billion plant in Arizona. They have  already broken ground on that plant, but they made it clear that their  willingness to make that investment and complete that fab will depend  on our passage of the CHIPS for America Act.   And once this legislation passes, I expect more good news to follow.  This is not just good news for our individual States, but also for our  national economy and our global competitiveness.   We are not used to providing these kinds of financial incentives to  businesses, but when it costs 30 percent less to build these  manufacturing facilities across the seas in Asia and our access to that  supply chain is potentially jeopardized by very real threats, it is a  necessary investment for us to make. And we are seeing other places  around the world providing similar incentives, for example, in the  European Union. But that doesn't necessarily solve our supply chain  problem. We need the jobs and that investment here in America for us to  be truly safe and secure and to reap the economic benefits of this  investment.   On the economic front, this funding has the support of many groups on  the outside, including the bipartisan support that I mentioned earlier;  in my State, the Texas Association of Business; the U.S. Chamber of  Commerce, for example; and we have heard from the National Governors  Association, which is a bipartisan organization of U.S. Governors; as  well as the U.S. Conference of Mayors, which represent State and local  leaders across the country.   My Governor, Governor Abbott, called this bill ``an opportunity to  lock even greater economic potential.''   So I am proud to support this legislation. After all this time, I  will be especially glad when the finish line is in sight and we cross  it successfully later this week.   I yield the floor.
