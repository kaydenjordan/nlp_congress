 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I hope that one day soon it will not be  necessary to come to the floor of this Senate and shine a spotlight on  how the Trump administration is making it harder and harder for women  in America to get the healthcare they need and deserve. It seems like  not a week goes by without the Trump administration full-on attacking  women's healthcare. It is the agenda of what I call healthcare  discrimination, and it is out in full force.   The latest news came out officially less than 24 hours ago. The Trump  administration has put itself right in the middle of women and their  doctors, denying access to critical information that millions of women  rely on from physicians and nurses--the very providers they trust and  depend on. What this means is that across this country you can say  good-bye to the guarantee that women are getting the whole story about  their health and the options they have for their care. For millions of  women, the healthcare they need is going to have to get a Trump stamp  of approval, and that Trump stamp of approval is going to be the  requirement to get the care they need.   I just want to say to my colleagues here in the Senate that I think  this alone makes a mockery of all the talk I remember hearing from  Republican colleagues in this body who said there is going to be  patient-centered care in  [[Page S2869]]  America. The developments in the last 24 hours basically say that with  respect to healthcare, it is not going to be patient-centered care, but  it is going to be politics-centered care.   Now, that patient-centered care concept was one of the most common  talking points I remember hearing again and again. We heard it in the  Finance Committee, where I have the honor to be the ranking Democrat.  We heard it again and again: We are going to have patient-centered  care. It was part of the crusade to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The  whole point of that patient-centered care slogan was to say that the  government shouldn't come between patients and their doctors and that  it wasn't going to be about politics; it was going to be about  patients--making sure that politics and the government didn't come  between patients and their doctors.    So here we are now, a few months later, and the Trump administration  has just decided point-blank that it will decide what is best for women  in Oregon and across the country. They basically said that they ought  to be able to gag doctors and deny women the right to hear about  healthcare options that, fortunately, are perfectly legal in America  today.   The fact is, this new decree--this dictate--from the Trump  administration comes with a battery of new restrictions on healthcare  clinics that millions of women depend on every single day. We all know  what it is about. It is an attack on Planned Parenthood. It is an  attack on vital sources of care for women.   As I have said on this floor--I have gone through it again and  again--the vast amount of work done by Planned Parenthood has nothing  to do with abortion. It is all about vital preventive services for  women, which, by the way, are especially important in rural areas.   I am sure we are going to be talking about women's healthcare  tomorrow in the Senate Finance Committee, where we will be having a  hearing specifically on rural healthcare. There is bipartisan interest  in that topic, but I want colleagues to know, it is pretty hard to  promote all of the opportunities for sound healthcare and  bipartisanship when you have a decision from the Trump administration  that has the potential to hit women's healthcare in rural communities  like a wrecking ball.   In States like Oregon, thousands of women live in communities where  there is not a clinic or a doctor's office every few miles. If the  Trump administration finds a backdoor way to shutter the few options  these women have today, they may not have anywhere else to turn to get  the essentials of healthcare. Women could lose the right to see the  doctor of their choosing.   I will just say it point-blank: If somebody wants to take away the  right of women in America to see the doctors and the providers of their  choice, they are going to have to run over me. I will tell you, I think  women are going to win that fight.   To have women lose access to lifesaving services like cancer  screenings, routine physicals, birth control, prenatal care, and so  much more--that ought to be off the table for politics. It shouldn't be  about Democrats and Republicans; it should be about commonsense  approaches to ensure that women have all of the options for the  healthcare they want and deserve.   Taking healthcare choices away from women is fundamentally wrong.  Depriving women of essential healthcare information that they have  every right to hear about is fundamentally wrong. The Trump  administration putting itself between women and their doctors is  fundamentally wrong.   The decision that came down last night, which we learned about last  night, is a reckless one. It is a harmful one. We ought to make no  mistake about it, it is going to make healthcare worse for women across  the country.   I have now had to say it too many times to count: It is long past  time for these attacks on women's healthcare to end. I hope it will not  be necessary to come to this floor again.   The Trump administration will see how flawed the decision--the  dictate--that came down last night is and will retract it. But until  they do, I will come to this floor and make the case for ensuring that  women are empowered in our country to be able to see the healthcare  providers of their choice, to have the opportunity to access the vast  array of services that are largely preventive from sea to shining sea.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, on May 10, I announced my intention to  object to a unanimous consent request for the Senate to take up the  nomination of Christopher C. Krebs who has been nominated by President  Trump to serve as Under secretary of the National Protection and  Programs Directorate at the Department of Homeland Security, DHS. I did  so because DHS had yet to clear for public release important  information about vulnerabilities in U.S. telephone networks that are  being exploited, potentially by foreign governments, to target  Americans.   Last week, I discussed with Mr. Krebs our shared interest in  protecting Americans from sophisticated cyber security threats,  particularly those that exploit flaws in U.S. communications networks.  I am pleased to say that DHS subsequently provided me with a letter  that included much of the information that I had previously requested.  I intend to make this letter public in the coming days and believe that  it will further much needed debate about the security of U.S. telephone  networks and the Federal Communications Commission's lax approach to  regulating the privacy and cyber security practices of wireless  carriers.   In light of this action, I will no longer object to any unanimous  consent request for the Senate to take up Mr. Kreb's nomination.                            ____________________     Mr. President, we in Congress are tasked in the  Constitution with promoting science and the useful arts through giving  authors and inventors the exclusive right to their writings and  discoveries for a limited time. The first copyright act provided that  the ``limited time'' would be a term of protection of 14 years,  renewable once. Since that time, the copyright term has exploded to 95,  or 120 years, or 70 years after the death of the artist, depending on  the circumstance. I have serious concerns that these lengthy terms tip  the balance toward limiting rather than promoting creativity and  innovation. Unfortunately, a bill--the CLASSICS Act--currently under  consideration in the Judiciary Committee blows past current U.S.  copyright term to provide a windfall to a select few.   The CLASSICS Act (Compensating Legacy Artists for their Songs,  Service, and Important Contributions to Society Act) would give up to  144 of exclusive copyright protection for digital transmissions of pre- 1972 sound recordings. Not only that, but it would create a hodge-podge  of State and Federal rights, basically cherry-picking the most valuable  right under the Federal regime and leaving the rest to be governed by  States. This means that if a library wants to make a copy of a  recording, and then digitally transmit that copy, it would have to  navigate two different regimes--creating more uncertainty, not less.   That is why, today, I am introducing the ACCESS to Recordings Act. It  would give artists the full suite of Federal rights, as well as the  uniformity and certainty that goes with the Federal copyright system.  Along with that comes the exceptions and limitations, including those  that enable archivists to preserve recordings, many of which are  starting to degrade in their original physical medium and urgently need  to be digitally preserved. In addition, it provides the same term  available to post-72 recordings--95 years from publication. Let's be  clear that is a significant term of protection. A song recorded in 1960  will enjoy protection until 2055--37 years from now.   I hope that someday, in the not too distant future, my colleagues and  I can sit down and talk about real copyright reform, but in the  meantime, we shouldn't be expanding term and making it more difficult  for users of the copyright system--including both artists and the  public--to navigate their rights and obligations. What I suggest  instead is a straight-forward application of the Federal rules that  apply to post-1972 recordings to those created before that time. We  must remember that copyright is for the public interest, not just for  the enrichment of large corporations. That is why I am introducing the  ACCESS to Recordings Act.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DAINES (for himself, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Thune, Mr. Rounds, and          Mr. Risch):   S. 2943.
