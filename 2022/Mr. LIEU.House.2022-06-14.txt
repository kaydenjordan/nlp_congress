Donald Trump lost the 2020  Presidential election.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 4160) to amend title 40, United States Code, to grant the  Supreme Court of the United States security-related authorities  equivalent to the legislative and executive branches.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 4160         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Supreme Court Police Parity       Act of 2022''.       SEC. 2. AUTHORITY TO PROTECT FAMILY MEMBERS.         Section 6121(a)(2) of title 40, United States Code, is       amended--        (1) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``and'' at the end;        (2) in subparagraph (B), by adding ``and'' after the       semicolon; and        (3) by adding at the end the following:        ``(C) any member of the immediate family of the Chief       Justice, any Associate Justice, or any officer of the Supreme       Court if the Marshal determines such protection is       necessary.''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on S. 4160.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 4160, the Supreme Court Police  Parity Act of 2022.   While the Supreme Court police force is currently authorized to  provide protection to the Justices of the Supreme Court, this bill  would unequivocally extend their authority to provide protection to  family members of Justices if there is reason to believe they are at  risk.   It is imperative that the Justices are free from fear of violence or  physical intimidation to make decisions based on the Constitution and  law as applied to the facts of the cases before them. This is essential  to the rule of law. Assailants like the man arrested recently for  allegedly plotting against the life of one of our Justices are a threat  to our democracy, but with the right security, they can also be stopped  before they inflict harm.   I thank Senators Coons and Cornyn for their work on this issue in the  Senate, and Representatives Stanton, Correa, and Issa for their work in  the House, likewise introducing bills that would extend protection to  the families of Justices. I also thank Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee  as well.   I further note that Mr. Stanton's bill would have also extended  protection to the families of Court employees. We understand that there  was Republican opposition to that aspect of the bill, and in the  interest of protecting the Justices' families, we could no longer delay  in passing the only version of the bill they would apparently agree to.  But I hope we will swiftly move another bill to extend protection to  families of employees as well.   I hope my colleagues will join me in passing this straightforward  measure to ensure that the families of Supreme Court Justices have the  necessary protection from any threats they may face.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, let me tell you why it took us a few weeks  rather than just 1 week to pass this legislation. It is because  Republicans refused to protect the families of Supreme Court employees  who are at risk. Shame on you for not doing that.    And, by the way, there are threats to Justices across the board. I  support this legislation. I just note that recently there was an  article on CNN titled ``Justice Sonia Sotomayor was targeted by gunman,  Federal judge tells `60 Minutes,' '' dated February 19, 2021.  Intimidation goes on both sides.   Madam Speaker, I support this legislation, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The Republicans are misleading you. Supreme Court Justices already  have protection. Let me say that again. Supreme Court Justices already  have protection.   This is about families of Supreme Court Justices, which I support  them having protection, and Democrats are fighting for families of law  clerks and employees of the Supreme Court. They should have protection,  too.   Let me tell you the threats to employees of the Supreme Court. Soon  after the draft decision leaked, a rightwing activist posted the  personal details of a law clerk who he baselessly claimed had leaked  Justice Alito's draft opinion overturning Roe v. Wade. This rightwing  activist even posted the clerk's wedding announcement and singled out  the clerk's spouse. Republicans don't want to protect that person or  their family.   After another Republican strategist claimed a different law clerk had  leaked the opinion, an extremist anti-abortion rights group issued a  press release targeting that clerk and the Justice the clerk worked  for. The author of the press release had served years in prison for  conspiring to blow up an abortion clinic. Referring to the people in  the Justice's office, the group's leader said that he could smell their  fear.   Republicans don't want to protect the families of Supreme Court  employees. Shame on them.   Recently, a news outlet obtained a DHS intelligence report  identifying threats to murder Justices and their clerks. Why don't  Republicans want to protect the families of Supreme Court employees?   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.     Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I am going to respond to that because what he just said is a lie. The  fact that he is saying Democrats think there is nothing wrong, there is  no danger to Supreme Court Justices, is a lie. Why? Because we are the  majority party, and we just put this bill up, and we are about to vote  on it. We clearly care about Supreme Court Justices.   But we also care about the families and employees of the Supreme  Court, and that is what we are talking about today. Again, I just want  to remind you, Republicans are misleading you. Supreme Court Justices  right now have law enforcement protection details. They are protected  by law enforcement. This bill has to do with the families of Supreme  Court Justices. I support protecting them. I also support protecting  the employees and their families of the Supreme Court.   That is the dispute. The Democrats want to also protect the employees  and families who are getting threats from rightwing activists,  intimidation from the far right.   Do you want to talk about intimidation? I will tell you what  intimidation is. It is Trump supporters assaulting the Capitol on  January 6, brutalizing 140 police officers. That is intimidation.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I condemn violence whether it is from rightwing groups or leftwing  groups or white supremacist groups or any other group. Democrats say  this all the time.   I will tell you why Republicans don't hear it. Because they are in  their bubble watching just Fox News, who won't even show the January 6  hearings. That is why they don't hear any of this stuff because it is  never played to them or their base. Democrats condemn violence all the  time.   By the way, last year--I am just going to tell you the headline of  this article again: ``Justice Sonia Sotomayor was targeted by gunmen .  . .'' Did Republicans jump up in outrage? No, no, they didn't.   So let's just be clear here what we are talking about today, once  again: Supreme Court Justices get law enforcement protection right now,  as we speak.   This is actually a dispute about employees. So I am going to ask  Republicans a question, and I bet you they will not answer it: Why do  they not want to protect the employees and their families of the  Supreme Court?   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Escobar).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Madam Speaker, S. 4160 is a straightforward bill that will  protect the families of the Justices. Democrats also fought to try to  protect the families of Supreme Court employees. Republicans objected  and won't do that, so this is the best we can get.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
