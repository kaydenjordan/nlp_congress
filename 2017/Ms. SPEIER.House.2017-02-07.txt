 Mr. Speaker, on Sunday, I and many Americans watched in  horror as our President continued to wax poetic on TV about the  bromance with President Vladimir Putin.   When the host noted ``But he's a killer,'' our President came back  with: ``There are a lot of killers. You think our country's so  innocent?''   While our country has made many mistakes, we have not yet seen an  authoritarian regime brazenly assassinate its political dissenters.   The same cannot be said for Putin and the growing list of murder  victims and dissenters in Russia, including liberal politician Boris  Nemtsov, former Press Minister Mikhail Lesin, former KGB agent  Alexander Litvinenko, and journalist Anna Politkovskaya, to just name a  few.   There is no moral equivalency between the United States and Russia.  We are not yet an autocracy. We are not like Russia, and the President  needs to stop relying on alternative facts.                            ____________________
