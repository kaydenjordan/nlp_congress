 Mr. Speaker, just weeks after President Trump released  his devastating budget which guts SNAP, our Nation's first line of  defense against hunger, House Republicans  [[Page H6220]]  have joined in that effort, proposing drastic cuts to our anti-hunger  safety net in the budget that they marked up last week.   In their budget, House Republicans have laid out their dangerous  agenda: dramatic increases in defense spending and tax cuts for  millionaires, billionaires, and corporations--all paid for by cuts to  programs that help working families and those struggling to make ends  meet.   Among the proposed cuts, House Republicans are seeking $160 billion  in cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as  SNAP, over 10 years. $150 billion of these cuts come from structural  changes to SNAP and harsher work requirements and time limits, and an  additional $10 billion would be fast-tracked through the reconciliation  process.   Mr. Speaker, SNAP is not an ATM. It is not money to be used for tax  breaks for the wealthy, additional weapons systems, or any corporate  handouts. It is intended to help our most vulnerable neighbors purchase  groceries and put food on the table when times are tough. Simply put,  SNAP helps people eat.   For a meager $1.40 per person, per meal, SNAP helps alleviate  poverty, reduce hunger, and improve nutrition. It is one of the most  efficient and effective Federal programs. But it is only $1.40 per  person, per meal. And my friends are proposing more cuts in this  program?   Mr. Speaker, I serve as the ranking member on the House Agriculture  Committee, Subcommittee on Nutrition. Since 2015, the committee has  held 23 hearings on SNAP. In our hearings, we have heard from over 80  witnesses--Republican and Democrat--about ways to make SNAP even  better. But none of these witnesses--not one--ever suggested changes  like the ones proposed by President Trump and House Republicans.   These Republican proposals are mean-spirited, and they are just as  heartless as they are reckless. They do not reflect the realities of  the program or seek to understand the challenges faced by those living  in poverty. They don't help struggling Americans find work, and they  certainly don't help address the ``benefit cliff,'' as some of my  Republican colleagues have proposed doing.   If Republicans were genuinely interested in helping struggling  families rise out of poverty, they would join Democrats in advocating  for higher wages, more jobs, and better work supports like childcare  and transportation. They would address affordable housing shortages and  help to improve access to healthcare. They would increase investments  in job training and career and technical education. They would finally  work with us to make college more affordable.   But instead of working on these priorities, House Republicans are  hell-bent on pursuing an agenda that belittles the struggles of the  working poor and tears apart our safety net. Their awful budget is no  exception.   Under the guise of ``State flexibility,'' their budget proposes a  block grant-like approach to administering SNAP.   Make no mistake, block-granting SNAP would make hunger worse in this  country, plain and simple. It would undermine the successful structure  of SNAP--its ability to expand as the economy struggles and contract in  times of economic prosperity. The proposed structural changes would  likely result in drastic funding cuts and reduced eligibility for the  program.   If State flexibility is the true goal, then my Republican friends are  in luck. SNAP already has a number of options that States can adopt.  What is ironic is some of these State exceptions are exactly the  provisions House Republicans are seeking to do away with.   The Republican budget also calls for additional work requirements of  SNAP, relying on dangerous rhetoric that suggests that hardworking  families who rely on modest food benefits don't want to work or are  somehow lazy. That couldn't be farther from the truth.   I would like to point out that the majority of people on SNAP who can  work, do work. Most people on SNAP are not expected to work or cannot  work--they are kids, senior citizens, and people who are disabled. But  that is exactly who Republicans will hurt if these dangerous proposals  advance.   If we are talking about how we can help transition people who can  work into the workforce, you don't do that by cutting the program by  billions of dollars or by cutting people off from food aid. That does  nothing to help people find jobs. It only makes people hungry.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my Republican colleagues to join me in rejecting  these damaging cuts, and to support investments in our anti-hunger  safety net that will help end hunger now.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3364--but with  reservations.   I strongly support the section of this bill that provides a role for  the Congress before any president may waive sanctions or provide relief  from sanctions against Russia. Russia sought to undermine America's  2016 election. It attempted to subvert our democracy. It did so  deliberately, methodically, and ruthlessly, spreading lies and  misinformation and exploiting weaknesses in computer systems and  records to steal private information and release it in sensationalistic  fashion.   These attacks against our democracy were and are totally unacceptable  and must be condemned. I remain bewildered that the current president  of the United States still fails to acknowledge that these actions  happened and that the Russian government, at the very highest level, is  responsible--even though there is a consensus among all U.S. domestic  and international intelligence and law enforcement agencies that this  is the case.   Sanctions imposed by the Obama Administration in response to this  multifaceted operation were lifted by President Trump. This legislation  rectifies that situation by re-imposing those sanctions and ensuring  that they cannot be removed without congressional consultation and  consent.   In addition, Russia continues to threaten its neighbors, especially  Ukraine, for which economic and military sanctions are now in place.   But I am somewhat reluctant in my support for this legislation  because of the provisions included on Iran. Like all my colleagues, I  am worried about Iran's continued testing and development of ballistic  missile technology. It is threatening and provocative to Iran's  neighbors and the region. I also oppose Iran's support for regional  militant and terrorist organizations, and for choosing to side with the  brutal regime of Bashir al-Assad in the Syrian conflict, as did Russia.   I do support, however, Iran's continuing compliance with the terms of  the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)--or the Iran nuclear  deal. I worry that the sanctions against Iran included in this bill  will be used and manipulated to undermine the JCPOA. I am worried that  we now have a president and an Administration actively seeking to  abrogate this international nuclear agreement. And I strongly oppose  any action that would violate, let alone abandon, the JCPOA.   The Trump Administration--and the White House in particular--seem  hell-bent on putting us on a path that leads to yet another costly war  in the Middle East and to a nuclear-armed Iran. This would be a  calamity of the greatest order, one that would place our friends and  allies in the region in even greater danger than what they now face. We  must not go there.   While I will vote in favor of H.R. 3364, I do so with grave  misgivings about how President Trump will seek to exploit the sanctions  against Iran provided in this bill to violate U.S. obligations under  the JCPOA, which will, in turn, give permission to Iran to develop a  nuclear weapon, and bring us all to the brink of war in the Middle  East.
