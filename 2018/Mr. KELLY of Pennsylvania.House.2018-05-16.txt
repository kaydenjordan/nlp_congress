 Mr. Speaker, this type of language is not  allowed in the people's House, directing it towards the Presidency.    Mr. Speaker, this morning, I would like to  recognize one of my constituents in Pennsylvania's Third Congressional  District, Mr. William ``Don'' Thomas, who will make history this  evening when he becomes the oldest student to ever graduate from Butler  County Community College, also known as BC3.   Mr. Thomas began taking classes at BC3 in the fall of 2010, and this  evening, at 80 years old, he will proudly receive an associate of arts  degree in history.   Furthermore, Mr. Thomas also represents the most senior graduate in  the class of 2018 among our State's four other western institutions  within the Pennsylvania Commission for Community Colleges.   Now, you have got to know something about Mr. Thomas. He is an Air  Force veteran who honorably served our country as an Airman Second  Class with the 17th Squadron.   I want you to think about something. This man, while serving in  France from 1956 to 1959, enrolled in classes provided by the  University of Maryland held outside the northeastern French town where  he was stationed, and while there, he earned 28 credits.    All these years later, following a successful life and career, Mr.  Thomas decided to enroll at BC3 in order to finish the degree he  started in 1956.   Mr. Thomas credits much of his academic success to BC3, which has  been rated the top community college in the Commonwealth of  Pennsylvania in back-to-back surveys.   BC3 president, Dr. Nick Neupauer, is beyond proud of Mr. Thomas and  believes his accomplishment is symbolic for the entire community  college.   Now, additionally, Don Thomas receives an abundance of love and  support and encouragement from his beloved wife, Nancy; their six  children; their eight grandchildren; and their four great  grandchildren.   Can you imagine tonight's graduation ceremony when he stands there  with all those people and receives his degree?   Now, Mr. Thomas was not a traditional college student. He inevitably  faced obstacles along the way, but regardless of the circumstances, he  never abandoned his goal of earning his degree.   Mr. Thomas reminds all of us that, with faith, hard work, and  determination, anything is possible. Mr. Thomas embodies the spirit of  a lifelong learner and is a living testament to the saying: ``If there  is a will, there is a way.''   His unwavering dedication, passion, and perseverance in pursuit of  his dream is not only inspiring and amazing, it is quintessentially  American. It is who we are as the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I am so blessed to be able to stand on the floor of the  people's House today and congratulate Mr. Thomas on a job well done and  count him as one of our district's finest constituents.   Mr. Speaker, I say to Mr. Thomas: Happy graduation day. Happy  graduation day.                            ____________________
