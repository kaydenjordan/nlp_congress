 Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of the  passing of a great American.   Allan Trimble was first and foremost a man of faith, whose mission  field for 35 years was 100 yards long and 53\1/2\  [[Page H10024]]  yards wide. Coach Trimble was the most successful high school coach in  Oklahoma history with 13 State championships, and in 2017, Jenks High  School affectionately renamed their stadium the ``Allan Trimble  Stadium'' in his honor.   He was inducted into the Oklahoma Sports Hall of Fame in 2018.  Trimble believed that when you make better people, you make better  players. For Coach Trimble, winning on the field was a by-product of  winning off the field, keeping your priorities of faith, family, and  football, in that order.   Coach Trimble was a master mentor who spent his entire adult life  pouring his wisdom into high school students and young adults.  Countless people were blessed by his mentorship.   Despite his battle with ALS, Coach Trimble continued to believe that  he was blessed and needed to bless others.   Coach Trimble spent his last year developing the Trimble Strong  Foundation, a continuation of his efforts to serve others and mentor  the next generation.   Last week, Coach Trimble left this earthly pain to join our Father in  Heaven.   He is remembered a hero by thousands of lives he touched both on and  off the football field. Oklahoma will never forget his legacy of  service and of selflessness, faith, and football.                                time  1045                   Congratulating State Football Champions     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of  three high school football teams in my district who won statewide  football State championships this weekend.   In 6A Division I, Owasso High School, coached by Bill Blankenship,  had an impeccable and undefeated season, earning their second State  championship in 3 years.   In 6A Division II, Bixby High School, coached by Loren Montgomery,  cruised to an undefeated season as well, winning State for the fifth  time in 6 years.   In 3A, Lincoln Christian School, coached by Jerry Ricke, also went  undefeated this year. They sailed through the playoffs to a victory in  the State finals on Saturday.   Congratulations to the Rams, the Spartans, and the Bulldogs. These  players and coaches worked hard all year to earn these championships.   In addition to these championship teams, Oklahoma's First District  had several teams make it to the finals. Jenks High School took runner- up in 6A Division I. Metro Christian School is playing in this  weekend's 2A championship game. And Regent Prep is playing for the  Class B championship.   With so many exceptional teams, Friday nights are never boring in  Tulsa.                            ____________________
