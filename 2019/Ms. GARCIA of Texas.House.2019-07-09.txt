 Mr. Speaker, the health and safety of millions  are at risk. Today, the Fifth Circuit heard oral arguments aimed at  repealing the Affordable Care Act.   Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton wants to end healthcare coverage  for people with preexisting conditions, young adults, and pregnant  women. Texas already has the highest number of uninsured people  anywhere in the United States, and that number would increase by 1.7  million if these protections ended, including many in my district.   We know that America suffers when people go uninsured. We can't  afford to let our families, our neighbors, our fellow Texans lose these  protections.   Premiums and out-of-pocket costs for doctors' appointments and  hospital visits will increase significantly.   House Democrats will continue to fight to expand access to  affordable, quality healthcare and to lower prescription drug prices.                            ____________________
