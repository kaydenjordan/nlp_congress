 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Clermont, Florida,  native Diane Travis, who exemplifies the type of citizen who puts  community above self.   Ms. Travis serves as a councilwoman, small business owner, and most  recently was named as a finalist for the Anne Viviani Women's Great  Grand Masters Duathlete of the Year. As a duathlete who runs, bikes,  and then runs again, she truly exhibits tremendous perseverance,  discipline, and strength of character.   Even more noteworthy is the fact that she dedicates each race to her  friend, Anne Viviani, whom this award is named after, and who sadly  lost her life in a car accident returning home from a competition.   Being recognized as a finalist for Duathlete of the Year reflects the  great success Ms. Travis has displayed in past competitions, including  being the 2019 champion in her age group at the Women's USA Nationals,  and then capturing the silver medal at the world competition.   Mr. Speaker, I wish Councilwoman Travis the best of luck moving  forward as a finalist and in all future competitions. I know she will  continue to make Clermont, the 15th Congressional District, and our  country proud.                            ____________________
