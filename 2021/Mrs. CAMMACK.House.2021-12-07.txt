 Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member of the Armed  Services Committee and all of my colleagues for bringing us to this  point here today.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022. I want to sincerely thank every  single member who worked in a productive, constructive, and helpful  manner to get us to this finish line.   Funding our military, taking care of our troops, and providing for  the common defense is, in fact, our duty. Promises made, promises kept.  We did what we said we were going to do. No dishonorable discharges for  servicemembers who refuse the vaccine, and it is retroactive. No  unconstitutional red flag laws. We killed and buried the dangerous  office of domestic extremism.   This bill counters China, gets them out of our supply chain, and  holds this administration accountable on Afghanistan. This bill is a  win for our military, our communities, our national guard, for our  country.   It is time to stop talking about getting Americans out of  Afghanistan. It is time to stop talking about securing the border. It  is time to stop talking about holding China accountable. It is time for  action. This bill does all that and more.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
