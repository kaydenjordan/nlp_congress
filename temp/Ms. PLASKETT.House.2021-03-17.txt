 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Nadler for his tireless  work and the work of so many women of this Caucus, including Speaker  Pelosi, to bring this bill to fruition and to bring this bill to the  floor.   We know, and we all believe, that violence against women and the  support necessary to impede that from happening is necessary and should  be reauthorized.   I rise today in strong support of the en bloc amendment. The Nadler  amendment en bloc is the culmination of a yearslong effort to authorize  explicit Federal legal action against the nonconsensual disclosure and  public transmission of intimate visual imagery, following the lead of  dozens of the States.   Nobody, under any circumstances, should have private intimate imagery  shared on the internet without their consent. The pain that is caused  by perpetrators who knowingly share sexually explicit or nude images of  someone without their consent has ruined lives and, in many instances,  the lives of their family as well. It is weaponized to humiliate,  harass, intimidate, and even exploit people who are primarily women.   I am proud to support this amendment that will give prosecutors and  victims important tools to bring perpetrators to justice and further  deter  [[Page H1472]]  offenders from committing such a terrible and egregious violation of  privacy. Please approve this amendment and let us pass this bill.
