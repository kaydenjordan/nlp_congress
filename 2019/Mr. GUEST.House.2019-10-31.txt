 Madam Speaker, on Veterans Day, we remember the devotion  of the brave men and women of the military who have honorably served  our Nation. Our veterans have fought to preserve this Nation, its  ideals, democracy, freedom, and prosperity.   American veterans not only have helped maintain the rights that were  established by our Founding Fathers, but they have also set an example  of enduring patriotism, returning home to become leaders in their  communities, States, and Nation. Back home, they have helped advance  our country by embodying the American spirit of hard work and  preservation.   Today, we acknowledge these men and women who have served our Nation  as members of our military. We thank them for their many contributions  to our country. We remember in prayer those men and women who never  returned home from foreign soil.                            ____________________
