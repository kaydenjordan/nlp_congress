 Madam Speaker, a point of clarification: Quid pro quo  exists on its face in what we reviewed just today. But, for the record,  criminal conduct does not have to be quid pro quo.   The President asked a foreign government to investigate his political  rival and interfere in our election.   The response by my friends across the aisle has also confirmed  something else I have had a suspicion about: They have an extraordinary  sense of humor. They imagine that this administration would have  released this whatever it is this morning relating to a transcript, the  complaint, and allowed the DNI to formally testify and the complaining  witness to testify just because the President thought we should know,  not because there was a complaining witness.   Without the complaining witness, no one knows about this--without  their courage. That emphasizes the point of how important complaining  witnesses are, because, without their courage, we don't know about  wrongdoing or there are further leaks, both of which put our country at  risk.
