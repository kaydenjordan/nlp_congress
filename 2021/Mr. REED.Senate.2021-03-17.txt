 Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Cybersecurity  Disclosure Act along with three members of the Select Committee on  Intelligence, Chairman Warner and Senators Collins and Wyden, in  addition to Senators Cortez Masto and Cramer, who serve with me on the  Senate Banking Committee. In response to serious data breaches of  various companies, our legislation asks each publicly traded company to  include--in Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) disclosures to  investors--information on whether any member of the Board of Directors  is a cybersecurity expert, and if not, why having this expertise on the  Board of Directors is not necessary because of other cybersecurity  steps taken by the publicly traded company. To be clear, the  legislation does not require companies to take any actions other than  to provide this disclosure to its investors.   As EY, also known as Ernst & Young, noted in an August 2020  publication, ``Public disclosures can help build trust by providing  transparency and assurance around how boards are fulfilling their  cybersecurity risk oversight responsibilities.'' Investors and  customers deserve a clear understanding of whether publicly traded  companies are prioritizing cybersecurity and have the capacity to  protect investors and customers from cyber related attacks. Our  legislation aims to provide a better understanding of these issues  through improved SEC disclosures.   While this legislation is a matter for consideration by the Banking  Committee, of which I am a member, this bill is also informed by my  service on the Armed Services Committee and the Select Committee on  Intelligence. Through this Banking-Armed Services-Intelligence  perspective, I see that our economic security is indeed a matter of our  national security, and this is particularly the case as the pandemic  has forced many of us to be ever more dependent on technology and the  Internet.   Indeed, General Darren W. McDew, the former Commander of U.S.  Transportation Command, which is charged with moving our military  assets to meet our national security objectives in partnership with the  private sector, offered several sobering assessments during an April  10, 2018 hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee. He stated  that ``cyber is the number one threat to U.S. Transportation Command,  but I believe it is the number one threat to the Nation . . . in our  headquarters, cyber is the commander's business, but not everywhere  across our Country is cyber a CEO's business . . . in our cyber  roundtables, which is one of the things we are doing to raise our level  of awareness, some of the CEO's chief security officers cannot even get  to see the board, they cannot even . . . see the CEO. So that is a  problem.''   With growing cyber threats that have resulted in serious breaches, we  all need to be more proactive in ensuring our Nation's cybersecurity.  This legislation seeks to take one step towards that goal by  encouraging publicly traded companies to be more transparent to their  investors and customers on whether and how their Boards of Directors  and senior management are prioritizing cybersecurity.   I thank the bill's supporters, including the North American  Securities Administrators Association, the Council of Institutional  Investors, the National Association of State Treasurers, the California  Public Employees' Retirement System, the Bipartisan Policy Center, MIT  Professor Simon Johnson, Columbia Law Professor Jack Coffee, the  Consumer Federation of America, and Rhode Island General Treasurer Seth  Magaziner, and I urge our colleagues to join in supporting this  legislation.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Cybersecurity  Disclosure Act along with three members of the Select Committee on  Intelligence, Chairman Warner and Senators Collins and Wyden, in  addition to Senators Cortez Masto and Cramer, who serve with me on the  Senate Banking Committee.
