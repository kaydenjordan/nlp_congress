 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an American and  Angeleno who is the definition of a public servant, Michael Owens.   I have had the honor to serve as an elected official for 27 years,  and I have learned that the backbone of every office is having a team  of dedicated people who work directly with our community members.   Just as it is in Congress, a Los Angeles city councilmember's  district team has the biggest impact on the constituents they serve,  and Michael made an impact on thousands of constituents.   Michael changed the lives of those with disabilities, LGBTQ+ youth,  and all the families of the San Fernando Valley.   Michael Owens served Councilmember Bob Blumenfield for 15 years,  first as his director of constituent affairs and later as district  director. In these roles, he oversaw more than 10 staffers and the  delivery of millions of dollars of city resources to their  constituents.   Before getting involved in politics, he was a paralegal and director  of legal affairs at the Motion Picture Association.   Michael lived in my district in the community of North Hills. He was  a leader in his homeowner association, bringing the knowledge he had  from the city to make his community a better place for all its  residents.   He was known by Councilmember Blumenfield as the ``constituent  whisperer'' for his ability to hear constituents' most difficult  problems and find solutions for them. No problem was too big or too  small for Michael.   As district director, he ensured the district office he served was a  space where students with disabilities could develop vital career  skills.   We lost Michael in April. He joins his parents and late husband,  Camron. My heart goes out to Michael's family, his sister Susan, Uncle  Bob, and cousin Sara, and to Bob Blumenfield and his entire staff  during this difficult time.   Michael represents the Angeleno and American spirit of going above  and beyond to serve the community that gave him so much.                          Honoring Irma Cantu Acosta     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Irma Cantu Acosta, a  beloved leader, wife, mother, grandmother, and friend.   As a former small business owner and realtor, I saw firsthand the  efforts of Irma to help families and young real estate agents attain  the American Dream.   Irma was born in a small rural town in southwest Texas, and in the  fifties, her family moved to Boyle Heights, Los Angeles.   Irma began her career in real estate, a field where she helped  thousands of families navigate the real estate market. Her passion was  helping working families find a house they could call home.   In 2000, she led the creation of the National Association of Hispanic  Real Estate Professionals, the largest voice and champion for Latino  homeownership and empowerment, which is now tens of thousands of  members strong. From the local to the national level, she mentored  thousands of clients and colleagues with her warm, reassuring smile and  valuable insight.   Irma is survived by her high school sweetheart and husband, Ernie,  and her three children, four grandchildren, and one great- granddaughter.   Today, I stand to celebrate and honor the incredible life of my  friend, Irma Cantu Acosta, someone who believed that we can all aspire  for our own piece of the American Dream.                            ____________________
