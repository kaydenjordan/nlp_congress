 Mr. Speaker, it is a great honor  tonight to be here with Congressman Clyburn on a very extraordinary  evening. To me, it is a dream come true.   Eleven days ago, I had the opportunity--my wife, Roxanne, and I--to  campaign across the Fifth Congressional District by bus. As we traveled  the district with Ralph and Elaine Norman, I found out that his  business background gives him the basis to understand how to create  jobs. I saw his affection for our veterans and his understanding of the  importance of a strong national defense. In particular, with Shaw Air  Force Base in the district, he understands a strong national defense.   It was so inspiring, also, to be with their four grown children who  are each successful. And he has a real interest to be successful  because he has 15 grandchildren. What an achievement. Members  understand this is really important.   For the past 7 years, I am really grateful that he has been a floor  leader for Governor Nikki Haley, now our Ambassador to the United  Nations, where he has been a floor leader for limited government and  expanded freedom.   It is with great honor I introduce to you Congressman Ralph Norman.
