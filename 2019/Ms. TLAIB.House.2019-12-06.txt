 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a proud granddaughter of a  strong, loving Palestinian woman, my sity. For me to stand up for her  human dignity, I must oppose H. Res. 326.   This resolution not only endorses an unrealistic, unattainable  solution, one that Israel has made impossible, but also one that  legitimizes inequality, ethnic discrimination and inhuman conditions.   Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Likud party have actively fought  against a two-state solution and took steps to ensure its demise. They  increased their illegal taking of Palestinian homes, imprisoned more  Palestinian children than ever before, and are building walls right now  to annex the West Bank and other Palestinian villages.   Moreover, Israel's nation-state law, which states that only Jews have  the right to self-determination, has eliminated the political rights of  the Palestinian people and effectively made them second-class citizens.   Separate but equal didn't work in our country, and I can't see that  it is possible in other countries. Given our Nation's history of  segregation, we should recognize when such injustices are occurring. We  cannot be honest brokers for peace if we refuse to use the words:  illegal occupation by Israel.   Our country and the United States Congress must condemn these  undemocratic actions. We must take bolder actions to ensure that human  rights are upheld in Israel and that Palestinians and Black Israelis  are treated with equality every human being deserves.   To honor my Sity Mufteih who lives in the occupied West Bank,  Palestine, I am unable to support this resolution today. She deserves  better.                                time  1015
