 Madam Chair, as the designee of  Ranking Member Lowey, I move to strike the last word.    Madam Chair, I rise today in  support of amendment 155, the assisted outpatient treatment, $5 million  increase; $20 million total.   As the original cosponsor of H.R. 2646, the Helping Families in  Mental Health Crisis Act of 2016, I recognize the importance of funding  for outpatient treatment.   As a former chief psychiatric nurse at the VA hospital in Dallas,  Texas, I have witnessed the unintended consequences of the  deinstitutionalization process. Many of my own patients, diagnosed with  severe mental illnesses, were discharged with 30 days of prescription  medicines and did not have stable housing.   Once they ran out of their prescriptions, their condition worsened,  they suffered psychotic breaks, and they became homeless or  incarcerated. Individuals with untreated psychiatric illness now make  up one-third of the Nation's estimated homeless population. That totals  600,000.   In Texas, there are 35,000 incarcerated individuals with a severe  mental illness, but only 4,500 psychiatric beds are available in all of  the Texas hospitals combined.   This amendment increases court-ordered assisted outpatient treatment  by  [[Page H7290]]  $5 million to meet the fully authorized amount of $20 million in  support of the severely mentally ill, thereby allowing them to get  treatment in the community without incarceration or hospitalization.   This outpatient treatment reduces incarceration, homelessness, and  emergency room visits by upwards of 70 percent.   I urge support of this amendment. This country has neglected the  mentally ill, and this country is suffering because of it. We have got  to recognize the need, and I urge everyone to support this amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
