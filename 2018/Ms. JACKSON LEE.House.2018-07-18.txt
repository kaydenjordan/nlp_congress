 Mr. Speaker, viewing Monday's display in Helsinki as  a devastating manner is not exaggeration. It is not hyperbole. It is  not exaggerating.   Frankly, I think it is important for the Congress to adhere to its  responsibilities in Article I, which indicates that all legislative  powers herein are vested in this Congress.   We must do our job on behalf of the American people.   So let me read: ``President Trump, you first. Just now, President  Putin denied having anything to do with the election interference in  2016. Every U.S. intelligence agency has concluded that Russia did. My  first question for you, sir, is: Who do you believe?''   This is a reporter from the AP.   ``My second question is: Would you now, with the whole world  watching, tell President Putin--would you denounce what happened in  2016, and would you warn him to never do it again?''   The answer of the President of the United States: ``So let me just  say that we have two thoughts. You have groups that are wondering why  the FBI never took the server. Why haven't they taken the server? Why  was the FBI told to leave the office of the Democratic National  Committee? I've been wondering that. I've been asking that for months  and months, and I've been tweeting it out and calling it out on social  media. Where is the server? I want to know, where is the server, and  what is the server saying? With that being said, all I can do is ask  the question.   ``My people came to me. Dan Coats came to me, and some others, and  they said they think it's Russia. I have President Putin; he just said  it's not Russia. I will say this: I don't see any reason why it would  be.   ``But I really do want to see the server. But I have confidence in  both parties. I really believe that this will probably go on for a  while, but I don't think it can go on without finding out what happened  to the server.''                                time  1030    He goes on to say:         So I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I       will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and       powerful in his denial today.        And what he did is an incredible offer.        He offered to have his people working with our people.       Thank you.    In response, Senator John McCain, a POW, said these words: ``Today's  press conferences in Helsinki was one of the most disgraceful  performances by an American President in memory. The damage inflicted  by President Trump's naivete, egotism, false equivalence, and sympathy  for autocrats is difficult to calculate. But it is clear that the  summit in Helsinki was a tragic mistake.''   ``President Trump proved not only unable, but unwilling to stand up  to Putin. He and Putin seem to be speaking from the same script, as the  President made a conscious choice to defend a tyrant against the fair  questions of a free press and to grant Putin an uncontested platform to  spew propaganda and lies to the world.''   Let me remind you that the question of the reporter was: My first  question to you, sir, is, who do you believe, Mr. President? My second  question is: Would you now, with the world watching, tell President  Putin would you denounce what happened in 2016?   It is clear that the Russians invaded and altered the election of  2016. It has been stated by our intelligence community, Director Coats,  that at least they invaded and impacted and that they are doing it now.   It is time for the Congress to ask or subpoena the translator's  notes. It is time for us to have a detailed relaying to the Congress,  in a classified manner, what were the contents, what were the  discussions, what were the agenda items, what was said in the meeting  singularly by our President and President Putin. Then we must pass  legislation for extreme sanctions on anyone  [[Page H6471]]  that even thinks of interfering with the elections of 2018 and those  who interfered with 2016.   Finally, I believe it is important for a full-throated apology of the  White House to the intelligence community and the American people. I  remind you that I do not stand here singularly by myself. I stand here  standing on a constitutional democracy which is the United States of  America.   Article I powers of this Congress is that we must act. We cannot  correct it with a typographical correction--wouldn't over would. The  reporter directly asked: Who do you believe? It was never answered that  it was the American people in the intelligence community, Mr. Speaker.  It was indicated that Mr. Putin gave a strong response of denial, and  it was implied in that, that I believe Mr. Putin, and I am not going to  answer the question to say that I believe my intelligence community.  Therefore, I would indicate it is time for the Congress to act.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment is prohibiting the use of  appropriated funds to eliminate the Urban Wildlife Refuge Partnership,  or  [[Page H6524]]  programs, that are for the reforestation of urban areas. In fact, I  celebrate and support the increase in funding. This amendment is  particularly helpful, I hope, to create the legislative history of the  importance of the urban reforestation program.   Mr. Chair, I thank the ranking member as well as the chairman of this  committee for recognizing the importance of urban reforestation.   This amendment emphasizes the importance of the Urban Wildlife Refuge  Partnership in urban forests and preserves our ability to return urban  areas to healthy and safe living environments for our children. I have  offered similar amendments because I want an ongoing creation of  legislative history to ensure that this program is kept.   In the past 30 years alone, we have lost 30 percent of all of our  urban trees, a loss of over 600 million trees. Eighty percent of the  American population lives in dense quarters of the city. Reforestation  programs return a tool of nature to concrete areas that can help remove  air pollution, filter out chemicals and agricultural waste in water,  and save communities millions of dollars in stormwater management  costs.   I have certainly seen the devastation of droughts right in large  cities. In particular, Houston, a couple years ago, lost many, many  trees in a severe drought that we experienced over the summer. It took  many community investors--when I say that, nonprofits--and Federal  dollars to restore green life to Houston.   We know that asthma is on the rise. In people below the Federal  poverty threshold, we see asthma increasing. Asthma comes when children  have to be subjected to polluted air.   Some of the reasons individuals at lower income may have increased  risk of asthma are increased exposure to indoor and outdoor pollutants,  cigarette smoking, secondhand smoke exposure, and nearby industrial  pollutants and highway traffic.   The good news is that trees provide the source of oxygen that is so  necessary, and it comes about through a scientific process that I will  discuss a little bit later.   We have a headline here from Science Daily that says: ``Cities and  Communities in the U.S. Losing 36 Million Trees a Year.''   And then another headline: ``Researchers Suggest Reforestation Around  Urban Areas to Reduce Ozone Levels,'' which enhances, creates, makes  worse the asthma that many of our children suffer from.   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to support my amendment.   Thank you for this opportunity to speak in support of my amendment to  Division A of H.R. 6147, the Interior and Environment Appropriations  Act for Fiscal Year 2019 and to commend Chairman Calvert and Ranking  Member McCollum for their leadership in shepherding this bill through  the legislative process.   Among other agencies, this legislation funds the U.S. Forest Service,  the National Park System, and the Smithsonian Institution, which  operates our national museums including the National Zoo.   Mr. Chair, my amendment is simple but it sends a very important  message from the Congress of the United States.   The Jackson Lee Amendment emphasizes the importance of Urban Wildlife  Refuge Partnerships and urban forests, and preserves our ability to  return urban areas to healthy and safe living environments for our  children.   Similar amendments were offered and accepted in the Interior and  Environment Appropriations Acts for Fiscal Year 2018 (H.R. 3354),  Fiscal Year 2017 (H.R. 5538), Fiscal Year 2016 (H.R. 2822), Fiscal Year  2008 (H.R. 2643), and Fiscal Year 2007 (H.R. 5386), and were adopted by  voice vote.   Mr. Chair, surveys indicate that some urban forests are in serious  danger.   In the past 30 years alone, we have lost 30 percent of all our urban  trees--a loss of over 600 million trees.   Eighty percent of the American population lives in the dense quarters  of a city.   Reforestation programs return a tool of nature to a concrete area  that can help to remove air pollution, filter out chemicals and  agricultural waste in water, and save communities millions of dollars  in storm water management costs.   I have certainly seen neighborhoods in Houston benefit from urban  reforestation.   In addition, havens of green in the middle of a city can have  beneficial effects on a community's health, both physical and  psychological, as well as increase property value of surrounding real  estate.   Reforestation of cities is an innovative way of combating urban  sprawl and deterioration.   Mr. Chair, a real commitment to enhancing our environment involves  both the protection of existing natural resources and active support  for restoration and improvement projects.   Several years ago, American Forests, a leading conservation group,  estimated that the tree cover lost in the greater Washington  metropolitan area from 1973 to 1997 resulted in an additional 540  million cubic feet of storm water runoff annually, which would have  taken more than $1 billion in storm water control facilities to manage.   Trees breathe in carbon dioxide, and produce oxygen.   People breathe in oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide.   A typical person consumes about 38 pounds of oxygen per year.   A healthy tree, say a 32 ft tall ash tree, can produce about 260 lb  of oxygen annually--two trees supply the oxygen needs of a person for a  year.   Trees help reduce pollution by capturing particulates like dust and  pollen with their leaves.   A mature tree absorbs from 120 to 240 pounds of the small particles  and gases of air pollution.   Trees help combat the effects of ``greenhouse'' gases, the increased  carbon dioxide produced from burning fossil fuels that is causing our  atmosphere to ``heat up.''   Trees help cool down the overall city environment by shading asphalt,  concrete and metal surfaces.   Buildings and paving in city centers create a heat-island effect.   A mature tree canopy reduces air temperatures by about 5-10 degrees  Fahrenheit.   A 25 foot tree reduces annual heating and cooling costs of a typical  residence by 8 to 12 percent, producing an average annual savings of  $120 per American household.   Proper tree plantings around buildings can slow winter winds, and  reduce annual energy use for home heating by 4-22 percent.   Mr. Chair, trees play a vital role in making our cities more  sustainable and more livable.   The Jackson Lee Amendment simply provides for continued support to  programs like Urban Wildlife Refuge Partnerships that reforest our  urban areas.   For all these reasons, Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of the Jackson  Lee Amendment and thank Chairman Calvert and Ranking Member McCollum  for their courtesies, consideration, and very fine work in putting  together this legislation.                    [From Science Daily, Apr. 18, 2018]      Cities and Communities in the US Losing 36 Million Trees a Year           Source: USDA Forest Service--Northern Research Station         Summary: Nationally, urban/community tree cover declined       from 42.9 percent to 42.2 percent between 2009-2014. This       translates to losing an estimated 36 million trees or       approximately 175,000 acres of tree cover annually.        Scientists with the USDA Forest Service estimate that       between 2009 and 2014, tree cover in the Nation's urban/      community areas declined by 0.7 percent, which translates to       losing an estimated 36 million trees or approximately 175,000       acres of tree cover annually. Pavement and other impervious       cover increased at a rate of about 167,000 acres a year       during the same period, according to research by USDA Forest       Service scientists.        Nationally, urban/community tree cover declined from 42.9       percent to 42.2 percent. Twenty-three states had a       statistically significant decrease in tree cover, with a       total of 45 states showing a net decline. Trees improve air       and water quality, reduce summer energy costs by cooling       homes, reduce noise, mitigate runoff and flooding, and       enhance human health and well-being, making them important to       human health and urban and community infrastructure. The       annual benefits derived from U.S. urban forests due to air       pollution removal, carbon sequestration, and lowered building       energy use and consequent altered power plant emissions are       estimated at $18 billion.        The study by Dave Nowak and Eric Greenfield of the USDA       Forest Service's Northern Research Station, ``Declining urban       and community tree cover in the United States,'' was       published in the journal Urban Forestry and Urban Greening.        A table showing tree cover and impervious cover change by       state is available at: https://www.nrs.fsis.fed.us/news/ release/resources/cities-communities-losing-tree-cover/  ``Urban forests are a vital part of the nation's       landscape,'' said Tony Ferguson, Director of the Forest       Service's Northern Research Station and the Forest Products       Laboratory. ``Forest Service research puts knowledge and       tools into the hands of urban forest managers that supports       stewardship and the wise allocation of resources.''        States or districts with the greatest annual net percent       loss in urban/community tree cover were Rhode Island and the       District of Columbia (minus 0.44 percent), Georgia (minus       0.40 percent), and Alabama and Nebraska (minus 0.32 percent       each). States with the greatest annual net loss in tree cover       were Georgia (minus 18,830 acre/year), Florida (minus 18,060       acre/year) and Alabama (minus 12,890 acre/year).  [[Page H6525]]         Three states--Mississippi, Montana and New Mexico--had       slight, nonsignificant increases in urban/community tree       cover. Nationally, Maine has the highest percent tree cover       in urban/community areas with 68 percent tree cover. At 10       percent tree cover, North Dakota ranked as having the lowest       percent urban/community tree cover.        ``Urban forests are an important resource,'' said Nowak.       ``Urban foresters, planners and decision-makers need to       understand trends in urban forests so they can develop and       maintain sufficient levels of tree cover--and the       accompanying forest benefits--for current and future       generations of citizens.''        As of 2010, urban land occupied 3 percent, or 68 million       acres, of the United States, while urban/community land       occupied just over 6 percent of the United States, or 141       million acres.        Overall, urban/community impervious cover had a       statistically significant increase from 14.5 percent to 15.1       percent (an increase of o.6 percent), States with the       greatest annual net percent increase in impervious cover were       Delaware (0.28 percent), Iowa (0.26 percent), and Colorado,       Kansas and Ohio (0.24 percent each). States with the greatest       annual net increase in impervious cover were Texas (17,590       acre/year), Florida (13,900 acre/year) and Ohio (8,670 acre/      year).                                   ____                        [From Phys.org, Sept. 9, 2014]   Researchers Suggest Reforestation Around Urban Areas to Reduce Ozone                                   Levels                               (By Bob Yirka)         A team of research conservationists with members from       several universities in the U.S. is suggesting in a paper       they've had published in Proceedings of the National Academy       of Sciences, that urban areas could benefit by investing in       cost effective reforestation efforts around urban areas that       currently suffer from high ozone levels. Planting trees, they       suggest could help cities bring those levels down.        The researchers note that despite aggressive efforts by       many metropolitan areas to lower ozone levels in ground level       air, levels remain high, causing the populations that live in       them to live with an increased risk of health problems--prior       research has indicated that as many as 152,000 premature       deaths each year can be attributed to the damage ozone       inflicts on lungs. Current efforts to combat ozone levels are       aimed at the source, factory emissions, etc. Laws limiting       emissions have not kept up with growth however, leading to       increases in ozone levels.        The researchers suggest a different approach--remove the       ozone by planting trees. They suggest that land be purchased       on the outskirts of cities with high ozone levels to be       converted to forest--trees they note, remove both ozone, and       one of its precursors.        To bolster their point, the researchers looked at the       Houston metro area in Texas, a part of the country with       consistently high ozone levels. Land that is currently used       for agriculture on the outskirts, they claim, could be       purchased and replanted with trees, creating a 1.5-square-      mile forest. They estimate that over a 30 year period, the       reforested area could reduce ozone and precursors in ground-      level air by 310 tons. They also note that if fast growing       trees were planted, timber harvests could help make up       initial outlays and loss of local revenue from agricultural       products.        The researchers also plotted potential targets on a map of       the U.S., highlighting areas where reforestation would likely       do the most good--along the 1-95 corridor in the northeast,       for example, and around Chicago, Detroit and many parts of       California. The team concludes by noting that if something       isn't done, the problem of ozone pollution is only likely to       get worse in the face of both continued growth and as global       warming exacerbates the problem.     Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from California.   As I indicated, I think that creating the additional legislative  history of the importance of this particular program is what I hope  will strengthen it.   May I ask, Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have?    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), the ranking member, to discuss the urban  reforestation program, and I thank her for her leadership.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, let me conclude my remarks by saying I have certainly seen  neighborhoods in Houston benefit from urban reforestation. In addition,  havens of green in the middle of a city can have beneficial effects on  a community's health, both physical and psychological, as well as  increased property values of surrounding real estate. But when you have  had a drought, you know how important this program is. Reforestation of  cities is an innovative way of combating urban sprawl and  deterioration.   Finally, let me say, photosynthesis, how many of us remember that in  our classrooms? I love that process. That happens in plants, generally  involves the green pigment chlorophyll, and generates oxygen as a  byproduct, cleaning the air. That is what these programs do in urban  America.   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member and the  chairman of this committee for considering my amendment.   My amendment is prohibiting the use of appropriated funds to limit  museum outreach programs administered by the Smithsonian Institution.  Again, for programs like this, this is to advocate and create the  legislative history of the importance of these programs, and I am glad  to have this amendment presented to the Congress at this time.   Mr. Chair, in order to fulfill the Smithsonian's mission--the  increase and diffusion of knowledge--the Smithsonian seeks to serve an  even greater audience, and this has come about over the years by  bringing the Smithsonian to enclaves of communities who otherwise would  be deprived of the vast amount of cultural history offered by the  Smithsonian.   The Smithsonian's outreach program serves millions of Americans,  thousands of communities, and hundreds of institutions in all 50 States  through loans of objects, traveling exhibitions,  [[Page H6526]]  and sharing of educational resources via publications, lectures,  presentations, training programs, and websites.   Let me say from personal experience, one of my predecessors, the  Honorable Mickey Leland, that many people know died in an airplane  going into an Ethiopian mountain trying to bring food to starving  people in Eritrea and Ethiopia, had introduced the first bill for a  museum dealing with slave history. He did not live to see that  legislation go forward, but later,  John Lewis introduced the  legislation to create the Smithsonian Museum of African American  History and Culture.   We have it today, and it is a museum that has seen more people attend  it, and the outreach is crucial: the board members, who are so proud to  be a part of it, and the Congressional Black Caucus, that was the  anchor of passing this legislation. Now we have an outstanding exhibit  on Oprah Winfrey, and all are there to see this historic figure and  many others.   It is important that the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum and many  others have the opportunity to reach out to Americans and let them know  of these very special resources, these assets that are here.   So this is a very important emphasis to have, and I would like to  make sure that we continue to do it robustly so that more Americans can  know their history.   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to support this amendment.   Thank you for this opportunity to speak in support of my amendment to  Division A of H.R. 6147, the ``Interior and Environment Appropriations  Act for Fiscal Year 2019.''   Let me also thank Chairman Calvert and Ranking Member McCollum for  their leadership in shepherding this bill to the floor.   Among other agencies, this legislation funds the Smithsonian  Institution, which operates our national museums, including the Air and  Space Museum; the Museum of African Art; the Museum of the American  Indian; and the National Portrait Gallery.   The Smithsonian also operates another national treasure: the National  Zoo.   Mr. Chair, my amendment is simple but it sends a very important  message from the Congress of the United States.   The Jackson Lee amendment simply provides that:         Sec. __.  None of the funds made available in this Act may       be used to limit outreach programs administered by the       Smithsonian Institution.    This amendment is identical to amendments I offered to the Interior  and Environment Appropriations Acts for FY2017 (H.R. 3354) and FY2016  (H.R. 2822) that were approved by voice vote.   Mr. Chair, the Smithsonian's outreach programs bring Smithsonian  scholars in art, history and science out of ``the nation's attic'' and  into their own backyard.   Each year, millions of Americans visit the Smithsonian in Washington,  D.C.   But in order to fulfill the Smithsonian's mission, ``the increase and  diffusion of knowledge,'' the Smithsonian seeks to serve an even  greater audience by bringing the Smithsonian to enclaves of communities  who otherwise would be deprived of the vast amount of cultural history  offered by the Smithsonian.   The Smithsonian's outreach programs serve millions of Americans,  thousands of communities, and hundreds of institutions in all 50  states, through loans of objects, traveling exhibitions, and sharing of  educational resources via publications, lectures and presentations,  training programs, and websites.   Smithsonian outreach programs work in close cooperation with  Smithsonian museums and research centers, as well as with 144 affiliate  institutions and others across the nation.   The Smithsonian's outreach activities support community-based  cultural and educational organizations around the country.   They ensure a vital, recurring, and high-impact Smithsonian presence  in all 50 states through the provision of traveling exhibitions and a  network of affiliations.   Smithsonian outreach programs increase connections between the  Institution and targeted audiences (African American, Asian American,  Latino, Native American, and new American) and provide kindergarten  through college-age museum education and outreach opportunities.   These outreach programs enhance K-12 science education programs,  facilitate the Smithsonian's scholarly interactions with students and  scholars at universities, museums, and other research institutions; and  disseminate results related to the research and collections strengths  of the Institution.   The programs that provide the critical mass of Smithsonian outreach  activity are:   1. the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (SITES);   2. the Smithsonian Affiliations, the Smithsonian Center for Education  and Museum Studies (SCEMS);   3. National Science Resources Center (NSRC);   4. the Smithsonian Institution Press (SIP);   5. the Office of Fellowships (OF); and   6. the Smithsonian Associates (TSA), which receives no federal  funding.   To achieve the goal of increasing public engagement, SITES directs  some of its federal resources to develop Smithsonian Across America: A  Celebration of National Pride.   This ``mobile museum,'' which will feature Smithsonian artifacts from  the most iconic (presidential portraits, historic American flags, Civil  War records, astronaut uniforms, etc.) to the simplest items of  everyday life (family quilts, prairie schoolhouse furnishings, historic  lunch boxes, multilingual store front and street signs, etc.), has been  a long-standing organizational priority of the Smithsonian.    SITES ``mobile museum'' is the only traveling exhibit format able to  guarantee audience growth and expanded geographic distribution during  sustained periods of economic retrenchment, but also because it is  imperative for the many exhibitors nationwide who are struggling  financially yet eager to participate in Smithsonian outreach.   For communities still struggling to fully recover from the economic  downturn, the ability of museums to present temporary exhibitions, the  ``mobile museum'' promises to answer an ever-growing demand for  Smithsonian shows in the field.   A single, conventional SITES exhibit can reach a maximum of 12  locations over a two- to three-year period.   In contrast, a ``mobile museum'' exhibit can visit up to three venues  per week in the course of only one year, at no cost to the host  institution or community.   The net result is an increase by 150 in the number of outreach  locations to which SITES shows can travel annually.   And in addition to its flexibility in making short-term stops in  cities and towns from coast-to-coast, a ``mobile museum'' has the  advantage of being able to frequent the very locations where people  live, work, and take part in leisure time activities.   By establishing an exhibit presence in settings like these, SITES  will not only increase its annual visitor participation by 1 million,  but also advance a key Smithsonian performance objective: to develop  exhibit approaches that address diverse audiences, including population  groups not always affiliated with mainstream cultural institutions.   SITES also will be the public exhibitions' face of the Smithsonian's  National Museum of African American History and Culture, as that new  Museum comes online.   Providing national access to projects that will introduce the  American public to the Museum's mission, SITES in FY 2008 will tour  such stirring exhibitions as NASA ART: 50 Years of Exploration; 381  Days: The Montgomery Bus Boycott Story; Beyond: Visions of Planetary  Landscapes; The Way We Worked: Photographs from the National Archives;  and More Than Words: Illustrated Letters from the Smithsonian's  Archives of American Art.   To meet the growing demand among smaller community and ethnic museums  for an exhibition celebrating the Latino experience, SITES provided a  scaled-down version of the National Museum of American History's 4,000- square-foot exhibition about legendary entertainer Celia Cruz.   Two 1,500-square-foot exhibitions, one about Crow Indian history and  the other on basket traditions, will give Smithsonian visitors beyond  Washington a taste of the Institution's critically acclaimed National  Museum of the American Indian.   Two more exhibits, ``In Plane View'' and ``Earth from Space,''  provided visitors an opportunity to experience the Smithsonian's  recently opened, expansive National Air and Space Museum Udvar-Hazy  Center.   For almost 30 years, The Smithsonian Associates--the highly regarded  educational arm of the Smithsonian Institution--has arranged Scholars  in the Schools programs.   Through this tremendously successful and well-received educational  outreach program, the Smithsonian shares its staff--hundreds of experts  in art, history and science--with the national community at a local  level.   The mission of Smithsonian Affiliations is to build a strong national  network of museums and educational organizations in order to establish  active and engaging relationships with communities throughout the  country.   There are currently 138 affiliates located in the United States,  Puerto Rico, and Panama.   By working with museums of diverse subject areas and scholarly  disciplines, both emerging and well-established, Smithsonian  Affiliations is building partnerships through which audiences and  visitors everywhere will be able to share in the great wealth of the  Smithsonian while building capacity and expertise in local communities.  [[Page H6527]]    The National Science Resources Center (NSRC) strives to increase the  number of ethnically diverse students participating in effective  science programs based on NSRC products and services.   The Center develops and implements a national outreach strategy that  will increase the number of school districts (currently more than 800)  that are implementing NSRC K-8 programs.   The NSRC is striving to further enhance its program activity with a  newly developed scientific outreach program introducing communities and  school districts to science through literacy initiatives.   In addition, through the building of the multicultural Alliance  Initiative, the Smithsonian's outreach programs seek to develop new  approaches to enable the public to gain access to Smithsonian  collections, research, education, and public programs that reflect the  diversity of the American people, including underserved audiences of  ethnic populations and persons with disabilities.   For all these reasons, Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of the Jackson Lee  Amendment and thank Chairman Calvert and Ranking Member McCollum for  their courtesies, consideration, and very fine work in putting together  this excellent legislation.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1930     Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), the ranking member, and thank her again for  her leadership.    Mr. Chair, let me thank the gentlewoman for really  letting us know what a joy the Smithsonian is, even in front of the  Appropriations Committee.   Mr. Chair, I want to emphasize that the Smithsonian outreach programs  increase connections between the Institution and targeted audiences:  African Americans, Asian Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, and new  Americans, and provide kindergarten through college age music education  and outreach opportunities.   Mr. Chairman, I failed to say that when we were putting this  together, once the African American museum was established, the museum  personnel leadership, Dr. Lonnie Bunch, went on the road across America  collecting artifacts from African Americans and historic families to  put in this museum, real items of slave history and the history from  through the years, through the centuries, and it made the museum a  living example of the history of our time here in the United States.   That has been done by the Smithsonian in many different groups. And  so I would offer this article that says: ``New National Data Reveals  the Economic Impact of Museums Is More Than Double Previous  Estimates.''         The American Alliance of Museums released two       groundbreaking reports revealing indisputable evidence that       museums contribute more to the United States economy than       previously thought and have widespread support.    Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to support this amendment.   I would like to include in the Record this American Alliance of  Museums report dated February 13, 2018.           [From the American Alliance of Museums, Feb. 13, 2018]   New National Data Reveals the Economic Impact of Museums Is More Than                         Double Previous Estimates                              (By Laura Lott)         Arlington, VA.--The American Alliance of Museums (AAM), the       only organization representing the entire scope of the museum       community, today released two groundbreaking reports       revealing indisputable evidence that museums contribute more       to the United States economy than previously thought and have       widespread public support that transcends political       affiliations and geographic locations.        Armed with the two new reports and a wealth of data, on       February 27 hundreds of museum professionals will visit with       members of Congress and their staff to ask them to support       funding for vital federal agencies and tax incentives for       charitable donations. The Fiscal Year 2019 budget proposal       announced by President Trump yesterday calls for the       elimination of multiple agencies that support the arts and       humanities.        ``Never before in the 112-year history of the Alliance have       we possessed such comprehensive and statistically robust       studies to support what we've always known,'' said Alliance       President and CEO Laura Lott. ``Our legislators,       policymakers, funders, and trustees can be confident in the       fact that museums are important economic engines that support       jobs and bring revenue to their local communities. In       addition, our studies show that the American public is       overwhelmingly supportive of museums in general, and       specifically supports maintaining or increasing their federal       funding.''                  Two Reports Reinforce the Value of Museums         The first study, Museums as Economic Engines, reveals that       museums support 726,000 jobs in the United States, and       directly employ 372,100 people, more than double that of the       professional sports industry, according to the Bureau of       Labor Statistics. The study, conducted by Oxford Economics       with the support of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, shows       that for every $100 of economic activity created by museums,       an additional $220 is created in other sectors of the US       economy as a result of supply chain and employee expenditure       impacts. These impacts mean that museums contribute       approximately $50 billion to the US economy each year, a       number that's more than twice previous estimates.        The report is also the first to show that US museums       generate more than $12 billion per year in tax revenue to       federal, state, and local governments. The museum field's       largest economic impact is on the leisure and hospitality       industry (approximately $17 billion), but it also generates       approximately $12 billion in the financial activities sector       and approximately $3 billion each in the education/health       services and manufacturing sectors.        Museums provide important economic impacts to every part of       the nation. The top 10 states driving this impact are       geographically diverse and account for 57 percent of the       gross value added to the national economy. States with the       highest economic impact from the museum sector included       California ($6.6 billion), New York ($5.4 billion), and Texas       ($3.9 billion). However, those that rely most heavily on       museums due to their relatively higher concentration include       the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Wyoming, and Alaska.        The second report, Museums & Public Opinion, examines the       opinions of Americans concerning museums, their educational       and economic value, as well as their thoughts about federal       funding and support for museums in their community. Conducted       jointly by AAM and Wilkening Consulting, the study was       fielded by the market research experts at Ipsos and polled       more than 2,000 Americans. The survey results overwhelmingly       demonstrate the high degree to which Americans believe in and       support their museums, regardless of political affiliation,       geographic location, and whether they visit museums or not:        97 percent believe that museums provide valuable       educational experiences to their communities        89 percent recognize the important economic contributions       and jobs that museums bring        96 percent would approve of elected officials who act to       support museums including acting to maintain or increase       federal funding.        ``The data speaks clearly: whether urban or rural,       conservative or liberal, or a museum-goer or not, Americans       treasure the museums in their communities and want elected       officials to support them,'' Lott said.  [[Page H6528]]         Findings from the two reports will be discussed by leaders       from the Alliance and its research partners February 26 at       Museums Advocacy Day in Washington, DC and May 7 at the       Alliance's Annual Meeting & Museum Expo in Phoenix.                            Congressional Honorees         During Museums Advocacy Day, the Alliance will present       awards to legislators who have demonstrated exemplary support       for the nation's museums:        Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) used her position on the       Senate Appropriations Committee to advocate for funding for       key federal agencies. She is also an original cosponsor of       legislation that would reauthorize the Institute of Museum       and Library Services.        Representative Suzanne Bonamici (D-OR) is a co-founder of       the Congressional STEAM Caucus, and a leader in seeking       funding that will help school districts provide a well-      rounded education.     Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to support the  Jackson Lee amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman very much and I  am glad that she emphasized the work that the Environmental Justice  grants have done in Puerto Rico, and the fact that they are citizens of  the United States.   But I have seen what the Environmental Justice grants have done  because they are small. As Mr. Calvert indicated, the administration  recommended $2 million. These grants are small, and they help  communities clean up. They help communities deal with violators of  environmental rules, both in the State and Federal, mostly State, and  gives them the ability to clean and deal with neighborhood issues. That  is how small these grants are.   It also has provided assistance to Environmental Justice clinics that  can work with community organizations on how to petition for something  that is both an eyesore and environmental damage, to rid it of it, or  to get the entity, the corporation, the small business, whatever it is,  to clean it up. It makes it better for all concerned.   Mr. Chair, I would just ask and recognize that this is part of civic  participation, and these grants should be allowed.    Mr. Speaker, last school year was a deadly year for  so many of our children going to school in America. School shootings  shocked the very core of Americans and communities across the country.   As we approach the beginning of school, this Congress has passed no  gun safety legislation, no universal background check, no banning of  assault weapons, no holding parents responsible for children getting  guns.   Although I understand that there are many discussions about school  security, the proliferation of guns is one of the issues that  contributes to the dangers that our children face.   We know that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to bear arms,  but there is nothing in the Second Amendment that does not allow us to  have sensible gun safety legislation.   It is time for us to recognize that a Nation that has more guns than  citizens can stand down in order to provide a safe educational climate  for our children.   Are they not our most precious resource? It is time to act now.                            ____________________
