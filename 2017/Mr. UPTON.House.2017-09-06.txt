 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, H.R. 3388,  the SELF DRIVE Act. This legislation and technology is, indeed, going  to play a very important role in improving motor vehicle safety and  addressing the rising number of traffic-related fatalities.   As the birthplace of the automobile industry, my home State of  Michigan is a well-known home to innovative suppliers and manufacturers  that make our cars and trucks safer, more efficient, and, yes, more  affordable. It is also a nexus of engineering and research talent,  which makes it perfect for the development of the next phase of  vehicular mobility: autonomous vehicles. It is here.   In 2015, more than 35,000 folks lost their lives on U.S. highways.  Early estimates indicate that number may have increased to more than  40,000 last year. In Michigan, there were 1,064 traffic facilities, a 7  percent increase over the previous year. NHTSA has found that 94  percent of these fatalities are related to human error.   This legislation on autonomous vehicles, which includes the PAVE Act,  authored by myself and my good friend from Michigan, Debbie Dingell,  will go a long way to taking human error out of driving and making  roads safer for every American.   Forget about ``The Jetsons.'' It is over. The future of the  automobile is here, and this bill will give the automotive industry the  tools it needs to completely revolutionize how we are going to get  around for generations to come.
