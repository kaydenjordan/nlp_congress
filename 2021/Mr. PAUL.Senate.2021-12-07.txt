 Mr. President, I move to discharge S.J. Res. 31 from the  Foreign Relations Committee.    Mr. President, the most common cause of famine and  starvation is war. Saudi Arabia's air and naval blockade of Yemen has  led to thousands and thousands of deaths in Yemen from lack of food and  medicine. The United States should end all arms sales to the Saudis  until they end their blockade of Yemen.   President Biden said he would change the Trump policy of supporting  Saudi's war in Yemen, but it is not all that apparent that policy has  changed.   Today, we challenge the Biden administration's sale of $650 million  worth of arms, including air-to-air missiles in Yemen.   Just 2 months ago, the Biden administration approved $500 million  worth of arms, including maintenance for attack helicopters that are  used in Yemen.   Some want to differentiate offensive weapons from defensive weapons,  but, really, even defensive weapons can be used to allow a country to  absorb attacks in order to continue their offensive operations.   The real question is not an artificial designation of weapons as  offensive or defensive but whether Congress is serious about using the  leverage of arms sales or withholding arms sales to end the blockade in  Yemen.   That the Biden administration continues to reward Saudi Arabia with  weapons seems to indicate that President Biden is not really serious  about withholding arms sale to end the war in Yemen.   Indeed, if this administration were serious about ending the Saudi  blockade, they could do one thing, and this thing would end the war  tomorrow, would end the blockade tomorrow. The Saudis, I think, would  immediately stop the blockade if this administration would stop sending  spare parts and stop fixing the planes.   Bruce Reidel of Brookings writes that ``the Saudi air force would be  grounded in short order'' if we quit sending them spare parts, quit  repairing their aircraft. We could stop this war if we really had the  will to do it.   All America should be appalled at the humanitarian disaster caused by  the Saudi blockade of Yemen. For years now, ships that would otherwise  carry food, fuel, and medicine are turned away by the Saudi-led  coalition, depriving the Yemeni people of the necessities to sustain  civilization.   Yemen is one of the poorest countries on the planet. They have to  import their food. The blockade is killing their children.   Saudi Arabia's intervention in the Yemeni civil war is a chilling  example of the cruelty of warfare by starvation. According to the  United Nations, in Yemen 5 million people are one step away from  succumbing to famine and disease, and 10 million more are right behind  them.   We can start the process of ending this crisis by enacting this  resolution of disapproval.   The children of Yemen who survive Saudi's barbaric blockade will  inevitably tell their sons and daughters of the horrors of their youth,  and those sons and daughters will tell their sons and daughters.  Through oral tradition, a thousand generation of Yemenis will know of  the Crown Prince's ruthlessness, and they will also know that it was  the Americans who sold the weapons to wage this murderous campaign.   The reports from Yemen are literally a nightmare. The Washington Post  reported recently of a 3-year-old boy who cannot walk or speak, who  weighs 10 pounds--a 3-year-old boy who weighs 10 pounds. The images are  grotesque. His face is ``skeletal.'' His arms and legs are as ``thin as  twigs.'' He weighs 10 pounds. His father says that he sometimes goes  days without any food.   And we are complicit. We are arming the Saudis and allowing this to  happen. Offensive, defensive--they shouldn't get any of our weapons. We  should stop selling them any weapons until they stop starving the  country of Yemen.   The New York Times tells the story of a mother who, after 3 days of  failing to get a ride, carried her 8-month-old while walking 2 hours to  reach medics to treat her child's acute malnutrition. But even after a  week of treatment with enriched formula, the boy still lay motionless  on his hospital bed.   Tens of thousands of children have already died from disease and  malnutrition from this war, and we should not be complicit. We should  not be aiding the Saudis.  [[Page S8953]]    International aid agencies, which also have to fight the Saudi  blockade to provide assistance, put it this way:         The people of Yemen are not starving. They are being       starved.    The Saudi's siege of Yemen is made possible because of American  weaponry. The arsenal provided by the United States includes billions  of dollars' worth of military aircraft and thousands of air-to-ground  munitions.   Only weeks ago, the Biden administration approved a new $650 million  sale of 280 advanced medium air-to-air missiles and 596 missile  launchers. As painful as it is to admit, the United States is an  accessory to this Saudi savagery.   President Biden says the latest sale is merely to help defend Saudi  territorial integrity, but the Commander in Chief's words do not match  Saudi actions. According to William Hartung, the director of the Arms  and Security Program for the Center for International Policy, ``the air  blockade is enforced by a threat to shoot down any aircraft, military  or civilian, that enters Yemeni air space. . . . The provision of air- to-air missiles gives further credibility to this threat, dissuading  any government or aid group from bringing in crucial medicines or  flying patients in and out of Yemen.   These weapons are not purely defensive. They are used as a threat to  any aircraft that brings aid into Yemen, and they are part of the  blockade. They are part of the problem, and it is our leverage.   These weapons belong to the American people. They may be made by  private companies, but they are owned by the American people because we  commission these weapons, and we should not give them to countries that  are starving children and committing, essentially, genocide in Yemen.   In other words, no weapon is exclusively defensive, and continuing  arms sales means continued death and destruction in Yemen.   We must end America's complicity in Saudi Arabia's war on the Yemeni  people. If you believe in humanitarianism, if you believe America is a  force for good that serves as a model for other nations to emulate, if  you believe that the crushing of the Yemeni people must be stopped,  then you must vote for this resolution of disapproval.   We have a chance to tell the Crown Prince that American arms sales  will end until he gives up his starvation campaign. We can end the  Saudi blockade and bring relief to the long-suffering people of Yemen.   Should we fail to seize this opportunity, history will not let us  forget that America, the last best hope for humanity, failed to protect  defenseless civilians from the cruelty of a criminal regime.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Anthony  Charletta, an intern in my office, be granted floor privileges until  December 17, 2021.
