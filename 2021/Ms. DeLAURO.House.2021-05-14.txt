 Madam Speaker, this week was designated as the Child Tax  Credit Week of Action. The outpouring of stories and news articles  coming from across the country describing just how transformational  this assistance will be for families is heartwarming.   I am so proud that in the American Rescue Plan we fought for and won  the expansion and improvement of the child tax credit. Its inclusion  was historic but just a first step. We must make this expansion  permanent.   The child tax credit is a lifeline to the middle class, cuts child  poverty by 55 percent this year, and provides children and their  families with additional payments throughout the year that help them  with the costs of food, childcare, diapers, healthcare, clothing, and  taxes. Poor, working, and middle-class families--90 percent of our  children--will receive the same monthly benefits.   We must spread the word about the benefits of the child tax credit,  how families can start to receive that monthly check starting in July.  If people have filed a tax return, they are all set. If they have not  filed their tax return, and their family is eligible for the tax  credit, they must file by May 17. Even if they typically do not file,  this ensures that they will receive a monthly benefit.   Let's get the word out. Let's get people signed up.                            ____________________
