 Madam President, over a week ago, I traveled to the  Texas-Mexico border with the Vice President, as well as the Presiding  Officer and other Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee. We  visited McAllen, which is located in the heart of the Rio Grande  Valley, which is a beautiful region with a thriving economy, but folks  in the region continue to struggle to manage the growing humanitarian  crisis caused by the massive influx of migrants arriving at our  southern border.   The Rio Grande Valley has been disproportionally impacted by this  migrant crisis, with 46 percent of all apprehensions last month  occurring in that sector. It has taken a toll, as you might expect, on  the Border Patrol, the Department of Health and Human Services, local  communities, and the nongovernmental organizations working to provide  care for these migrants.   Our trip provided the opportunity for the Vice President and members  of the Judiciary Committee to meet with the men and women who are on  the frontlines of this crisis and hear about the challenges they face  every day. We also discussed what Congress needs to do to help them  address this crisis.   Chairman Lindsey Graham invited all the members of the Judiciary  Committee, both Republicans and Democrats, to go on the trip, but  unfortunately none of our Democratic colleagues accepted that  invitation. Instead of going on a bipartisan basis, Senate Democrats  chose to wait a week and go on what was clearly a partisan messaging  mission.   The minority leader said the purpose of the trip was to  ``investigate, inspect and evaluate conditions for migrants at  facilities on the border.'' They traveled to McAllen--exactly where we  were 1 week before--and they had a very similar itinerary, but they had  a very different mission. Our mission was to find out what Congress  needed to do to help fix the problem; theirs was to shine a light in a  partisan fashion on conditions of migrants, which are largely of  Congress's own making as a result of congressional inaction on dealing  with the underlying causes.   We both met with Chief Patrol Agent Rudy Karisch, toured the Donna  holding facility, heard from Border Patrol agents, and had the chance  to speak to the migrants themselves, but our takeaways from these  nearly identical trips were quite different. This was like ships  passing in the night.   I left that trip feeling immense gratitude for our professional  Border Patrol agents, whom we met, working tirelessly to fulfill their  duties with the utmost professionalism and compassion. As this crisis  has grown, they have been asked to do more and more with less and less.  They go to work each morning not knowing exactly what the day will  bring. Will they encounter a group of hundreds of migrants? Will they  find abandoned children left for dead by smugglers? Will they rescue a  drowning family from the Rio Grande or, worse, find the remains of  those who have succumbed due to the dangerous journey in very hot  weather?   This growing crisis is not the fault of our professional law  enforcement officials working along the border, and despite what our  colleagues across the aisle claim, it is not a side effect of the 2016  Presidential election either. This migrant crisis has been bubbling up  for years. We got a glimpse of how bad it could be in 2014 when then- President Obama announced there was a ``humanitarian and security  crisis''--his words--on the southern border. In May of 2014--the height  of apprehensions that year--nearly 69,000 people were detained at the  southern border. In May of this year, that number more than doubled to  144,000 in 1 month alone. So President Obama called it a ``humanitarian  and security crisis'' in 2014, and the problem has roughly doubled  since that time.   If there is one thing I hope our colleagues found on their trip, as  the minority leader said, to investigate, inspect, and evaluate, I hope  it is this: I hope their investigation confirmed what they have  reflexively denied for months on end--that there is, in fact, a crisis  at the border. I hope their inspection revealed that the problem isn't  with the administration's policies or with the actions of our Border  Patrol; it is our broken immigration system. And I hope they evaluated  that without some type of action--real action--by Congress, the  situation along the border will only continue to get worse.   As this senseless partisanship over border security carries on,  people living and working along the border are also hurting. When we  were in McAllen a week and a half ago, we heard from one Border Patrol  agent, Oscar Escamilla, who talked about the role Border Patrol plays  at the centralized processing centers. He said:         We wear different hats. Sometimes we're fathers, sometimes       we're mothers, brothers, sisters, play pals, and even       counselors. We do this because we care. We do this because       there is a real need.    There is certainly a need.   Last month, we passed bipartisan legislation to send much needed  humanitarian relief, which will provide some temporary help. That bill  also included funding for the departments and agencies that have  depleted their resources trying to manage this crisis the best they  can, and it made $30 million available for impacted communities to  apply for reimbursement from the Federal Government. In other words,  they have had to pay out of their own pockets for something that is the  Federal Government's responsibility, and I am glad that at least we  provided $30 million for reimbursement.   This was a long-overdue and important step to support those who have  been working day in and day out, hour  [[Page S4959]]  by hour, minute by minute, to manage this crisis, but, as the folks we  talked about in McAllen reiterated, the underlying problem still  exists. In other words, you can treat the symptoms, or you can treat  the cause. But we shouldn't be confused. We have been maybe addressing  some of the symptoms; we have done nothing to address the underlying  cause.    These officers and agents work incredibly hard to enforce our laws  and provide compassionate care for those in their custody, but without  meaningful action from Congress, we are sending them into a losing  battle. Without fixing the loopholes and repairing the broken system  that facilitated this humanitarian crisis in the first place, we will  find ourselves experiencing deja vu every few months. If you think $4.5  billion was needed for this emergency just a couple of weeks ago, wait  for 6 more months, when there will be another $4.5 billion required and  thereafter and thereafter and thereafter.   Well, what is the answer to the underlying root cause? What does  Congress need to do in order to fix it and to staunch this flow of  humanity across our border?   Well, there is only one bill out there with bipartisan support--with  support both in the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate--that  would provide relief along the border, and that is the HUMANE Act. It  is an honest, nonpartisan attempt to fix the problem--no poison pills,  no radical proposals, just reasonable policy designed to solve the  problem.   This bill would close what has become known as the Flores loophole,  which is often exploited by human smugglers as a way to gain entry into  the United States. This is an effective way to stem the flow of those  trying to game--to game--our immigration system without inhibiting  legitimate trade or travel.   In addition, the HUMANE Act would improve the way we process  individuals entering into our country. We got the recommendation for  the legislation from the bipartisan Homeland Security Advisory  Committee. It would, for example, establish regional processing  centers, which would have personnel on hand from across the government  to assist, including medical personnel and asylum officers right there  at the border in regional processing centers.   Finally, it would improve standards of care for individuals in our  custody--something we all want to see happen. It would require the  Department of Homeland Security to keep families together during court  proceedings and ensure that migrants have timely access to medical  assistance, as well as recreational activities, educational services,  and even legal counsel.   The HUMANE Act also requires additional training for Customs and  Border Protection and ICE officers, otherwise known as Immigration and  Customs Enforcement--in other words, everyone who deals with children.   The HUMANE Act is the only bipartisan bill currently proposed, and I  would urge all of our colleagues to give it serious consideration.   I can only hope that this trip our Democratic colleagues took  convinced them that it is time to quit playing games and get serious  about finding a solution to the humanitarian crisis on our southern  border.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
