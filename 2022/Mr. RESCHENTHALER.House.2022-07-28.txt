 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.    Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from New York (Mr.  Morelle), my good friend, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and  I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, the rule before us today provides for consideration of  the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022. After conference negotiations failed  on a package to counter the malign actions of China, the Senate drafted  this legislation to send billions of taxpayer dollars in the form of  subsidies and tax credits to a single industry.   Democrats' reckless spending policies led to this record-high  inflation that is crushing American families and small business. The  government should not be spending hundreds of billions of dollars to  provide subsidies benefiting one industry.   This legislation comes to the House just 1 day after Senate Democrats  announced a deal to tax American manufacturers and energy producers,  which will increase the cost to American families and worsen our supply  chain crisis.   They also want to hire 87,000 new IRS agents, and let's be honest  about this. Those agents will do nothing more than target American  families and small businesses.   They also want to spend $369 billion on their radical, far-left,  Green New Deal agenda. There can be no doubt that this latest iteration  of Biden's build back broke agenda will cause inflation to skyrocket  even further.   The Biden administration is deflecting on our Nation's recession.  They are classifying Biden's economic crisis as a ``transition'' to  slower growth. While they are doubling down on their disastrous  policies, they are devastating everyday Americans.   It is time my colleagues across the aisle abandon their socialist  pipe dream and actually work with Republicans to get our economy back  on track.   Madam Speaker, I, therefore, urge my colleagues to oppose this rule,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I don't disagree that these chips are important to the  U.S. economy and many manufacturers. What I take issue with is the fact  that we are putting even more money, billions of dollars, into an  economy that is already suffering from record-high inflation.   It is unsettled whether this will even make a difference. It can be  argued that chips were already going to come back anyhow, and it is not  just me saying it. I have an article right here from  [[Page H7267]]  The Economist, not exactly a rightwing publication. It was published on  10 July of this year. ``When the chips are way down: After a  turbocharged boom, are chipmakers in for a supersize bust?'' That is  the headline.   It goes on, saying: ``Surging supply and softening demand are  bringing the pandemic's superstar industry back to Earth.''   My question is: If this industry is already coming back, if it is  already as important as we think it is, why do we need to inject  billions of dollars into the economy that is just going to further the  economic crisis we are already in?   I know my colleague from North Carolina was talking about how to spur  research and development. I can tell you how to do it: You cut taxes.  You cut regulations.   If you look at the TCJA, this was a huge win for U.S. research and  investment: 25 percent higher than in the years prior, reaching an all- time high in 2019 of $584 billion and 3 percent of GDP.   If you want to stimulate the economy, you can do it by reducing taxes  and reducing regulation, not by picking winners and losers.   To talk more about this point, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from the great State of Texas (Mr. Burgess), my good friend and fellow  Rules Committee member.                                time  1115     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, just a point of clarification. This is just an  authorization. We will still wait a year anyhow to appropriate these  funds, so trying to act like we have a gun to our head right now and  this is a do-or-die moment is completely illusory. Again, this is just  an authorization.   Additionally, I agree with my friend from New York on two points.  Number one, we have got to be competitive with China.   Number two, the semiconductor chips are important for the economy.   But the way to compete with China is not to emulate the policies of a  Communist police state. The way to compete with China is to unleash the  American economy, to get back to our Western roots of free-market  capitalism. If we want to bring more businesses onshore, if we want to  fix our supply chain crisis, we can start by reducing the burdensome  regulations that are crippling American businesses. We can reduce our  income tax and our corporate income tax to make us more competitive  globally, and we can do something to make sure we have cheap, reliable,  abundant energy resources, such as exploiting our natural gas reserves  and perhaps investing in nuclear power.   But to sit here and say that we are going to compete with China by  doing what the Chinese do and having some bureaucratic monster in D.C.  pick winners and losers for a particular industry is not a winning  proposition.   What will beat China and keep us competitive with China is getting  back to what made this country great in the first place, and again that  is free-market capitalism.   Let's talk about inflation because, again, this is going to put  billions of dollars into the economy, which will make this situation  worse. Americans are facing the highest inflation in over 40 years.  This is literally the worst inflation in my lifetime. This morning we  learned that GDP has decreased for a second quarter in a row.   Yet, the Treasury Secretary wants to downplay Biden's economic crisis  by redefining recession, which for decades recession has been defined  as two quarters of negative economic growth. Instead, Secretary Yellen  and the leftists across the aisle want to play Orwellian and change the  definition to ``a period of transition.'' Even the extreme liberal  think tank, The Brookings Institution, acknowledged we are in a  recession, but it seems, again, my colleagues across the aisle have  forgotten basic economics.   House Republicans want to set the record straight. That is why if we  defeat the previous question, I will personally offer an amendment to  the rule to immediately consider House Resolution 1290, a resolution  affirming the longstanding definition of a recession.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment into the Record along with any extraneous materials  immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman  from Arizona (Mr. Schweikert), my good friend and the sponsor of this  resolution, to explain the amendment.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Just to clarify, this is not an either/or choice here. If we defeat  the previous question, we can consider the resolution of my good friend  from Arizona to actually define recession, and then we can take up the  underlying bill. Again, this is a false choice saying it is one or the  other. We can do both.   People may ask, Why is it necessary to define recession? It is  necessary because the party across the aisle are trying to redefine  recession. But I shouldn't be surprised. Because remember, this is the  same party that tried to tell us that women are now known as birthing  people. It is the party that all during the summer of 2020 told us that  violent rioting and looting was mostly peaceful protesting. Now they  are trying to tell us that a recession, which has been defined  for decades as two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, that  that is now called a transitionary period.    So it is an absolute necessity that we define recession so that we  have clarity in language.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Rodney Davis), my good friend and the ranking member on the Committee  on House Administration.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to  the gentleman from Illinois.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis) for the purpose of a rebuttal.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield  myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, my good friend from New York was talking about jobs  and the promise of more jobs with this act. We have heard this before.  The American Rescue Plan. We sat here and debated that, and we were  told by the  [[Page H7271]]  leftists across the aisle that this was going to create 4 million new  jobs. You know what didn't happen? We didn't create 4 million new jobs.  And that is not me saying that. That is a study from the American  Enterprise Institute, which found that the American Rescue Plan failed  to create any of the 4 million new jobs that Big Government Democrats  had promised.   While we are talking about stats and figures, let's put a real cost  to the inflation and the pain that is being inflicted on the American  people by injecting billions of dollars into the economy. So let's put  real numbers on it. Inflation will cost the average American household  more than $6,000 a year. That is so high that if you have had a  constant salary for the last year, you have essentially worked for more  than a month without pay.   So, let me ask this: If you are sitting here watching at home, could  you take one paycheck from this year, one paycheck, and just throw it  out the window? Probably not.   Now, if you are part of the coastal elite and the woke, yuppie, Zoom  class that is the base of the Democratic Party, you might be able to  afford that. You might just go to two Pilates classes a week instead of  four. You may not take that second trip to Europe. You may scale back  at Whole Foods. You have that luxury if you are part of the woke  Democratic base. But if you are somebody in Pittsburgh who is a retired  steel worker that is on a fixed income, this hurts you. You don't have  that disposable income. If you are a natural gas driller in Oklahoma  that has to drive to a drill site every day to actually produce  something, you have to fill your tank with gas. You don't have the  option to sit at home and pretend you are working on Zoom. If you are a  woman that has to drive, for example, to a diner to work a shift, you  don't have the luxury of not doing that. You have to bear the burden of  the inflation; again, the inflation that is being caused by the radical  left policies of the Democratic Party.   Yet, despite this real economic pain, Democrats continue to want to  put billions of dollars in the economy, billions in corporate handouts.  They want to undo Republican tax cuts and policies that actually led to  the lowest unemployment rates we have had in 50 years.   So, rather than forcing Americans to pay for their radical socialist  agenda, my colleagues across the aisle should use the time to work with  Republicans on policies that American families will benefit from and  allow American companies to actually compete in a global economy. And  we can do that all simply by reducing regulation and reducing taxation.  And how about we unleash our domestic energy supply?    So I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question and  ``no'' on the rule.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   This will be a 5-minute vote.
