 Mr. President, today I wish to honor Kimberly ``Kim''  Bierly, who will retire this month after 13 years of service to the  U.S. Senate. For as long as I have been in the Senate, Kim has served  as my regional manager for the North Central Region of Pennsylvania.   Born and raised in Lock Haven, Kim gained a wealth of professional  experience prior to her Senate service. A student of journalism, Kim  graduated from Rider College before becoming a reporter for the Lock  Haven Express. She later served as the national marketing director for  Penn State University and worked in private sector marketing, before  lending her time and talents to my 2006 Senate campaign. Following our  victory that year, Kim began her Senate service when I asked her to  join my State staff in 2007.   Over the course of these many years, Kim has tirelessly championed  the concerns of rural constituents and worked to ensure that their  needs were always addressed in my work. She answered thousands of phone  calls, attended hundreds of constituent meeting and traveled far and  wide across many, many miles to meet people in their own towns. She  worked hard to present the views of our State's farming community and  conducted me around all my engagements and events throughout the  region. It is often said that Kim ``knows everyone in Central  Pennsylvania,'' and I can testify that that is true.   Kim has a heart of gold, and she has always watched over all of her  colleagues as a kind of ``Mother Hen,'' sending along a kind word of  encouragement, placing a personal call, and helping everyone who is in  need. As a proud cancer survivor, she proudly ministers to other  patients and believes in giving back in return for the many kindnesses  bestowed on her during her illness.   For all of her professional accomplishments, Kim has many hobbies and  personal pursuits. She is an accomplished knitter--socks are her  favorite--who owned her own small business in Centre County for several  years called ``Main Street Yarn.'' She is also an animal lover who  spent 10 years leading a volunteer golden retriever rescue organization  in her free time that saved over 800 dogs. While she misses her goldens  ``Timber'' and ``Teddy'' every day, she loves to show off pictures of  her dog, ``Charlie,'' and her cat, ``Caddy.'' They are her family.   My most enduring memories of Kim are our annual attempts to procure  donuts and milkshakes at the Pennsylvania Farm Show and snacking on the  wonderful chocolate chip cookies she would bake for the whole team  during our staff retreats. Her departure leaves big shoes to fill, but  I wish her well as she and her husband, Keith, move on to this next  adventure in their lives.   Congratulations, Kim, for a job well done. I am grateful for your  service to the country and the Commonwealth, and I wish you the best of  luck in your retirement. We will miss you.                            ____________________
