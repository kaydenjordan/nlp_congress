 Madam Speaker, and still I rise because I love my  country.   And I rise tonight also because we had a hearing today in the  Committee on Financial Services. We had the hearing today because of  words that Dr. King called to our attention. He reminded us that, in a  real sense, all of life is related. He said that life is an inescapable  network of mutuality tied to a single garment of destiny. What impacts  one directly impacts all indirectly.   He went on to say that I can never be all that I ought to be until  you are all that you ought to be, and you can never be all that you  ought to be until I am all that I ought to be.   This hearing was held because we wanted to highlight and recognize  the fact that invidious discrimination exists for persons who are  members of the LGBTQ community. Tonight, I want to talk about this  invidious discrimination not only as it relates to the LGBTQ community,  but also as it relates to other communities within our country. In  fact, all of these communities are a part of humanity.   With reference to the LGBTQ community, we had empirical evidence that  proved beyond reasonable doubt that members of this community are being  discriminated against when they apply for loans. They are being charged  higher interest rates and a greater percentage than persons who are not  members of the LGBTQ-plus community. They are being discriminated  against on their jobs. They are being discriminated against when they  apply for jobs if it is known or suspected that they are members of the  LGBTQ-plus community, discriminated against in being promoted, in pay  raises.   The LGBTQ-plus community is being discriminated against, and it does  not make good sense to do this. It is irrational. But it also does not  make good dollars and cents to do this because we are talking about  millions of people. The estimates are as high as 16 million. Some say  more, some say less. We are talking about a $1 trillion economy within  the community.   It just makes good sense for us not to discriminate against people  who want to put their money into the economy, who want to put their  work product into the economy, who want to help America succeed. It  does not make good sense for this level of discrimination to exist, but  it does.   One of the salient messages that we wanted to impart at this hearing  today was the message that you are not alone. There are persons who are  allies of the LGBTQ community who are going to stand with you, who are  going to stand for you, and who are going to stand against the  invidious discrimination being perpetrated upon you.   Life is an inescapable network of mutuality tied to a single garment  of destiny.   The Muslim community is being, has been, and most likely will  continue to be discriminated against until there is some change in this  country. We have had from the highest office in the land an indication  that Muslims should be banned from the country. An attempt was made to  perfect such a ban of Muslim persons from the country.   Life is an inescapable network of mutuality. If you can ban one  religion, you can ban another. Muslims today--only fate knows which it  will be tomorrow. We must protect every religion if we want our  religion to be protected.   This is the way life works, the mutuality. What impacts one directly  impacts all indirectly.                                time  1815    People of color are being discriminated against in an invidious way.  In the Latinx community, the family separation that took place at the  border was unconscionable.   It is hard to believe that this country that holds out the welcome  torch, the Statue of Liberty, this country that has brought in  immigrants from across the globe would turn away children who are  fleeing harm's way in the way that we did it; this country that has a  history rooted in immigration would do such a thing, babies crying for  their mothers as they are being torn out of their arms.   It is a sad thing when you contemplate it. It is a very sad thing  when you see it perfected.   We cannot allow this to happen to children who are coming here trying  to flee harm's way, because the truth be known, but for the grace of  God, there go I and possibly you. We all can have dates with destiny  that we cannot contemplate in the present.   So we ought to protect the rights of people who are fleeing harm's  way, who are only asking for what the law provides in this country. And  the law in this country does provide for people who are fleeing harm's  way to come and say, ``I am here. I am here because  [[Page H8589]]  I need help. Will you help me? Will you give me the opportunity to  demonstrate that I qualify for the opportunity to become a part of this  country?'' rather than summarily turn people away or send out a clarion  message, ``We have no more room. Don't come. Go back.''   This is not the country that does this.   To borrow a phrase from a great and noble American who has made his  transition, the Honorable Elijah Cummings: We are better than this.  This country understands that we must continue to be the light for the  world when it comes to righteousness.   When it comes to African Americans, we have a history, a long history  of invidious discrimination, a very long history. A Civil War was  fought because of the invidious discrimination being perpetrated, the  hate, if you will, that was being perpetrated upon African Americans.   And today, within the last several months, perhaps a year or so, we  have had the Chief Executive Officer proclaim that we have some s-hole  countries, countries that are predominated by persons from Africa,  where Africans are the indigenous population.   But persons in this country, persons of color, of African ancestry,  are being discriminated against as I speak, as is the case with the  others that I have mentioned earlier, I might add, also being  discriminated against.   And there are people who say, when we talk to people about the issues  that are of concern to them, we ought to talk about kitchen table  issues. Well, I can tell you without question, reservation, hesitation,  or equivocation, when African Americans talk about kitchen table  issues, they talk about invidious discrimination. They may not use this  terminology, but the import of what they say is the same.   They say: I am being discriminated against on the job.   They say: I have suffered discrimination when I have tried to apply  for a loan.   They say: I have suffered discrimination when I have sought to get a  promotion.   They talk about discrimination. It is a kitchen table issue. But  there are those who don't see it as such, or if they do, they don't  talk about it as such. It is a kitchen table issue: invidious  discrimination in the African American community.   There is invidious discrimination in the Asian community. We have  been working to try as best as we can to deal with the question of  linguistics.   We have seen this happen in the Latinx community, the Latino  community, as well. People will advertise in one language, and when you  come into the place of business, they will conduct business in another  language.   So you are induced to come in and transact business, let's just use  this as an example, in Spanish, induced to come in and transact  business in Spanish, but once you arrive, the contract is in English.   There are many who would say, well, what is wrong with that?   Well, here is what is wrong with that. If you know that you are going  to communicate in English when you bind the person with the contract,  why would you entice the person to come in in Spanish? If you know that  you have no intentions of conducting your business in Spanish, why  would you entice the person to come in with Spanish?   This is a form of perfidy. It is ill will. It is not the way people  of good will treat other members of society. We respect people to the  extent that we want them to understand what they are doing.   In the area of housing, we have tried, on a contract, to have  language that simply says: What language would you prefer to do  business in? We indicate that you do not have to complete this portion  of this document if you choose not to--this is a person who is  applying--and we also indicate that this is not going to be binding  upon the person who has presented the contract. We are trying to get  some sense of the linguistic needs that are prevalent in our society,  just trying to get some sense.   However, that language that we had worked and toiled to put in place  has been rejected. It has been rejected, and we are trying to protect  it.   I have traveled to many places in my lifetime. I have had the good  fortune to travel to many other continents and many countries, and in  so doing, I have always appreciated the fact that people would try to  communicate with me in English. In each and every country, there were  people who would assist me in English. There may have been some  exceptions, but generally speaking, English.   People moving through airports in distant places can have the  announcements made in English.   I have gone to hotels where the persons who were working in the  hotels in foreign countries could speak multiple languages. One of them  would be English.    People have catered to us across the globe. We have had the welcome  mat extended to us because we are Americans and we speak English and  they want to do business with us. They want to roll out the welcome  mat. Unfortunately, we have not shown a similar characteristic.   It is my belief that we ought to show a level of respect to other  people who come to this country. Many of them are here to do business.  Many of them are here as immigrants. Many of them are here for lawful  purposes, yet we do not concern ourselves with the linguistics.   We have had difficulty putting up street signs in communities that  are in multiple languages. There are many people who oppose this.   When I have traveled through airports and through other countries, I  have seen the signs in multiple languages, including English.   Life is an inescapable network of mutuality tied to a single garment  of destiny; what impacts one directly impacts all indirectly.   This discrimination must end because it not only impacts the persons  who are being discriminated against--the LGBTQ, the Muslims, the people  of color, the African Americans, the Latinx, the Asians--it not only  impacts these people directly, it impacts all of us indirectly, because  Dr. King was right then and his words of profundity still ring with  truth today:         I can never be all that I ought to be until you are all       that you ought to be, and you can never be all that you ought       to be until I am all that I ought to be.    All of this has been called to the attention of Members of this House  because I believe that there is still work to do with reference to the  question of impeachment.   I have said on this floor before when I spoke here last, and I say  again, we cannot allow invidious discrimination to be weaponized so  that people suffer to the extent that the weaponization is creating the  suffering.   And it starts at the top. And because it starts at the top, this  House has a duty to start at the top. And if we do our duty and start  at the top, we will understand that just as we can impeach a President  for issues related to national security, we can impeach a President for  issues related to invidious discrimination.   The Republicans did it in 1868--Republicans. Some things bear  repeating: Republicans impeached a President in 1868 based upon issues  rooted in invidious discrimination.   We had just fought a Civil War, and those who were called freedmen-- freed persons, if you will--were working with a Freedmen's Bureau to  try to acquire the same rights as others. But there was a President,  Andrew Johnson, who was of the opinion that they did not merit the same  rights, and he fought against the Freedmen's Bureau. He fought to  maintain white supremacy.   But radical Republicans, radical Republicans, radical Republicans,  radical Republicans stood up to him. They impeached him, and President  Johnson changed his tune, to borrow a phrase. Oh, he was still the  bigoted racist of his time, but he did tone down. And he did not get  reelected, by the way.   He was a successor to Abraham Lincoln, but he did not get elected--I  should not say, ``reelected.'' He was Vice President, and he did not  get elected President.   The point is this: Radical Republicans cared enough for newly freed  people--radical Republicans. They cared about invidious discrimination.  We had just fought a war. They stood up.   By the way, I have an opinion that I will share with you.   I believe that the Republicans in this House right now would do a  similar thing if a Democrat happened to occupy the White House and  behaved the  [[Page H8590]]  way the current occupant behaves. I believe that Republicans of this  time would respond the same way the Republicans of that time, in 1868,  responded.   I believe that if any person in the White House who was there with  the title of Democrat behaved the way the current occupant behaves,  that person would be impeached, and Republicans would lead the charge.                                time  1830    Life is an inescapable network of mutuality tied to a single garment  of destiny; what impacts one directly impacts all indirectly.   The inaction that we take today will produce an action in our future.  Our failure to act today is going to say to the next occupant: You  cannot conclude that this is the last person who will disregard all the  protocols and rules. You cannot assume this. You can only assume that  we have this one, and you can hope that there will not be another, but  there can be.   If we show that there are no guardrails, if we demonstrate that we  don't have the courage to do what Article II, Section 4, of the  Constitution mandates, in my opinion, our inaction today will result in  future actions that would be harmful to this Nation.   This is our calling. Only we can bring justice to all of these that I  have called to your attention tonight who are being discriminated  against. We can't bring the kind of justice that is needed by ignoring  the harmful discrimination that is taking place.   More than 50 percent of Americans, according to a Quinnipiac poll of  just a couple of months ago, I believe, maybe 3 or 4, indicated that  more than 50 percent of the people in this country believe that the  President is a racist. We ignore it because it is uncomfortable. It is  easier for us to take on the challenge of national security.   Well, invidious discrimination that causes white supremacists to  march up and down the street screaming ``blood and soil,'' invidious  discrimination that allows persons to traverse the country so that they  can murder people of a certain hue from a certain place, that is  harmful to this country.   This level of invidious discrimination should not be tolerated by  this Nation. We have a responsibility to stand up for those who are not  in this Chamber to stand up for themselves. This is our calling. I am  here tonight on behalf of all of these who I have called to your  attention. I stand for them.   I may stand alone, but it is better to stand alone than not stand at  all. I stand for them because I know the harm that they can and have  suffered. And I believe that we ought to have at least one Article of  Impeachment that deals with invidious discrimination. I believe it; I  encourage it; and I support it.   I understand that we want to get back to bigotry as usual. I  understand that, to a limited extent, I stand in the way of getting  back to bigotry as usual, back to bigotry as usual when it is a talking  point, not an action item, when you don't have to vote on Articles of  Impeachment that deal with bigotry. That is too hard.   I understand that we want to get back to bigotry as usual, when we  can say that we are for principles above politics, when we can proclaim  that we do not put party above country. I understand. I want to get  back to bigotry as usual. I am sorry that I am one of the impediments.  But I assure you, my dear friends, I can't let it go. I can't. I know  what the suffering is like.   I suppose it is my destiny to be here to call these things to our  attention. We can ignore them. We can tolerate this bigotry. But  remember this: Those who tolerate bigotry perpetuate it.   There are people and organizations that have built their reputations  fighting bigotry. Yet, when there was an opportunity to vote to deal  with bigotry at the highest office in the land, well, the argument was  the Senate won't convict so why would we do it.   Well, it is the same argument for discrimination as it relates to  national security, as it relates to abuse of power. The same argument,  but we now put principle above politics--the same argument.   There are those who said that: Well, you know what will happen if you  remove the current occupant.   Well, the same argument could be made now. But it is because we have  a different issue, it is not invidious discrimination.   We now can put principle above politics. We now are not concerned  with who the next occupant might be. We now say that the Senate has to  just do its job and that we are going to do our job.   Things have changed, and thank God they have. I am appreciative that  they have changed. I really am. This is why I am calling to our  attention the necessity to have an Article of Impeachment related to  invidious discrimination.   There are those who believe that, in this country, invidious  discrimination has become a tool, a tool to be used by political  parties, a tool to be used to rally the vote, to get out the vote, to  create a constituency to vote, just a tool to be used. And that tool is  being managed so that the political parties can continue to play their  games--a tool.   I don't want to manage; I want to end. I do not want to see us manage  invidious discrimination. I want to see us end it.   That is why I stand here tonight. Life is an inescapable network of  mutuality tied to a single garment of destiny. What impacts one  directly impacts all indirectly.   Dr. King's probably most famous words were: ``Injustice anywhere is a  threat to justice everywhere.'' Injustice in any community in this  country is a threat to justice in every community in this country.   I love my country; I didn't come to Congress to make this speech. I  love my country; I didn't come to Congress to impeach a President. But  because I love my country, I am making this speech. And because I love  my country, I have brought Articles of Impeachment.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
