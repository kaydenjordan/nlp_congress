 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Midshipman  Chandler Washburn and the entire United States Naval Academy mixed crew  team for their victory at the historic, now historic, King's Cup this  past July.   The King's Cup is a prestigious race between eight allied military  forces, and has only been held twice, once in 1919, and this year on  the 100th anniversary. The U.S. Naval Academy defeated countries like  Canada, France, and Germany on their way to winning the cup.   The Northeast Florida community is incredibly proud of Chandler and  his fellow midshipmen on this extraordinary accomplishment.   Chandler graduated from the Episcopal School in Jacksonville and is  now a sophomore at the Naval Academy. Like all those representing us at  service academies across the country, his commitment to both academics  and military service inspire us all.   On behalf of the Fourth District of Florida, congratulations to  Chandler and the Naval Academy mixed crew team for a victory they will  remember for the rest of their lives.                            ____________________
