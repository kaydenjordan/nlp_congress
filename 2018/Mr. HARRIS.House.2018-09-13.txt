 Mr. Speaker, today the House will pass H.R. 4913,  renaming the Salisbury, Maryland Post Office, the ``Sgt. Maj. Wardell  B. Turner Post Office Building'' In honor of Sgt. Maj. Wardell Turner  who was killed in action in Afghanistan.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation honors the memory of a fellow  serviceman, devoted husband, loving father and valorous soldier. It is  my sincere hope that the designation of this post office in Sergeant  Turner's name will help our community on the Eastern Shore, and our  country, celebrate and remember the legacy of service and sacrifice  left behind by this true American hero.   Sergeant Turner was a local legend on Maryland's Eastern Shore. He  graduated from Bennett High School in Salisbury, Maryland in 1984 where  he was a standout fullback and middle linebacker. He helped lead the  Bennett High School Clippers to back-to-back undefeated seasons and  state titles in 1982 and 1983. His leadership and ability earned him an  athletic scholarship from Towson University. He was a four-year letter  winner and in 1989, graduated with a bachelor's degree in management.  Years later, in 2011, he would earn his master's degree in criminal  justice from Central Missouri State University. In 1991 he married his  wife, Katherine, whom he met at a New Year's Eve dance on the Eastern  Shore of Maryland. In 1993, looking for an opportunity to serve, he  enlisted in the Army. According to those closest to him, the Army was  more than just a career, it was a calling.  [[Page H8247]]    His military career took him across the United States and to bases in  Germany and South Korea. While in Germany, Wardell Turner was  recognized for saving a young woman's life as she attempted to jump off  a bridge. He was later deployed to Bosnia in the 1990's and then to  Iraq in 2003. He served in military police units beginning in 1993,  most recently with the 720th Police Battalion based at Fort Hood,  Texas. Earning the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, and other Meritorious  Service Medals along the way, he steadily climbed the enlisted ranks  and was promoted to Sgt. Maj. in 2013.   Sgt. Maj. Turner was assigned to the headquarters of the U.S. Army  Garrison at Fort Drum in New York when he was sent to Afghanistan in  July of 2014 during Operation Enduring Freedom. There he served as the  senior enlisted advisor for the Combined Security Transition Command- Afghanistan in Kabul whose primary mission was the training of Afghan  security forces. Sgt. Maj. Turner had planned for this to be his last  deployment, hoping to retire in a year or so and spend more time with  his family. Those that knew him described him as highly organized and a  devoted family man.   Prior to his death, just before Thanksgiving, he had found time to  gather and ship Christmas gifts to his family back home. According to  his wife, Katherine, despite his being unable to be home for the  holidays, these gifts, and the effort he made to make sure they arrived  on time, highlighted just how much his family meant to him, and him to  them.   Sergeant Turner was killed on November, 24, 2014, when his convoy was  hit by an IED while on patrol in Eastern Kabul.   Sergeant Turner's son, Devin Turner, who was also enlisted in the  Army and was deployed to Afghanistan at the time, planned to share  Thanksgiving with his father. Tragically, he was informed a few days  before the holiday that his father had been killed. Specialist Turner  escorted his father's casket home. After his father's funeral,  Specialist Turner, despite his loss, returned to Afghanistan to finish  his tour. According to Devin, his father would have supported his  decision to return to duty and didn't believe in leaving your business  unfinished.   Sgt. Maj. Turner was laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery in  January of 2015. Members of his family say that they found peace in his  sacrifice knowing he died doing what he loved . . . serving his  country.   Sgt. Maj. Wardell Turner has left a lasting legacy in our community.  In 2016 Towson University created the ``Wardell Turner Scholarship'' to  be awarded annually to a defensive back on the football team that is in  good academic standing and demonstrates the qualities and attributes  exemplified by Mr. Turner. Those enumerated qualities include  leadership, selfless service, and commitment.   Last year, friends, family and high school teammates gathered at the  Wicomico Presbyterian Church to retire his Bennett High School jersey  and to celebrate his life and his military service. During the  ceremony, Mayor Jake Day of Salisbury, Maryland proclaimed October 28,  2017, as ``Sgt. Maj, Wardell Turner Day''.   His legacy survives and continues with his five children, Shayla,  Quinton, Devin, Wardell II, Xavier, several grandchildren, and his  devoted wife, Katherine.   Mr. Speaker, Sgt. Maj. Wardell Turner is a true American hero. His  life of courage and service provides an example for us all. It is my  pleasure to offer this bill to rename the Salisbury post office the  Sgt. Maj. Wardell B. Turner Post Office building. I urge my colleagues  to support this legislation that honors one of the Eastern Shore's  favorite sons.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, was read  the third time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the  table.                            ____________________
