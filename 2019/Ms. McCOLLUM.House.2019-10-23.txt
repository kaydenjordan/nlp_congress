 Mr. Speaker, the National Football League is  celebrating its 100th anniversary, and its popularity and economic  success is indisputable. Millions of fans watched the NFL last year,  and the league's 32 teams split more than $16 billion in revenue.   One team, the Washington franchise, exploits a racist slur and a  racist mascot that insults and demeans Native Americans to help  generate profits for the NFL owners.   In the 21st century, we should rightly condemn the use of racial  slurs that disparage African Americans, Latinos, Asians, or anyone. And  there is no doubt about it. The term ``redskin,'' in fact, was used in  conjunction with scalp hunting in the 19th century.   In 1863, in Winona, Minnesota, my home State, a newspaper, the Winona  Daily Republican, printed an announcement: ``The State reward for dead  Indians has been increased to $200 for every redskin sent to purgatory.  This sum is more than the dead bodies of all the Indians east of the  Red River are worth.''   A news story published in the Atchison Daily Champion in Atchison,  Kansas, on October 9, 1985, told the stories of settlers' ``hunt for  redskins, with a view of obtaining their scalps.''   No doubt about it, this is a negative word. This is a slur. So it is  remarkable that the NFL commissioners and owners continue to sanction  the racist and shameful use of the term ``redskin'' to describe Native  Americans and then profit from it.   There are millions of Native Americans in this country whose  ancestors endured forced removal from their lands, suppression of their  culture, and state-sponsored campaigns of ethnic cleansing.   The NFL racist mascot mocks this painful history.   Tomorrow night, the Washington team and its racist mascot will be in  Minnesota, the home of 11 proud sovereign Tribal nations. I will be  joining Tribal leaders, elected officials, and other Minnesotans  gathering outside the stadium. We will be speaking out against racism  and exploitation. We will stand proudly with our Native American  brothers and sisters. With one voice, we will be calling on the NFL to  end its racist exploitation of Native Americans and to do one thing:  Change the mascot.                            ____________________
