 Mr. President, today I am once again introducing  legislation to allow the District of Columbia to receive funding and  other benefits under the Coastal Zone Management Act. I am pleased to  offer this companion legislation to a bill, H.R. 2185, introduced by  the Congresswoman from the District of Columbia, Eleanor Holmes Norton.   Few of us realize that 70 percent of the District is located within  the coastal plain. Similar to my State of Delaware, sea level rise,  upstream sources of water, degraded infrastructure, and coastal  subsidence mean that the District could experience serious future  cleanup and repair costs due to flooding--including damage to federal  property, which makes up almost 30 percent of the District. The  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reports that  since 1950, nuisance flooding has increased by more than 300% in the  District. And, since 2006, DC has experienced two 100-year flooding  events, and District officials estimate that a future 100-year flood  event could cause over $1.2 billion in damages. Needless to say, these  events will become more and more common due to climate change-- including rising sea levels--and coastal subsidence.   The District of Columbia would use funding from the Coastal Zone  Management Program for flood risk planning and environmental  restoration to prevent and mitigate future flood damage. At the same  time, this work would help to restore and conserve the District's  coastal resources such as habitat, fisheries, and endangered species.   If included in the Coastal Zone Management Program, the District of  Columbia would be eligible for $1 million or more of federal funding  annually to assist in coastal flood-control projects, to combat non- point source water pollution, and to develop special area management  plans in areas experiencing environmental justice and/or flooding  issues.   The National Coastal Zone Management Program, housed in NOAA, was  established through the passage of the Federal Coastal Zone Management  Act of 1972. At the time, Congress recognized the need to manage the  effects of increased growth in the nation's coastal zone, which  includes jurisdictions bordering the oceans and the Great Lakes.   There are currently 34 jurisdictional coastal zone management  programs, including both States and territories. In order for the  District of Columbia to participate in the program, Congress must pass  this amendment to the Coastal Zone Management Act that would include  the District under the definition of a ``coastal state.''    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1734         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Flood Prevention Act of       2019''.       SEC. 2. ELIGIBILITY OF DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA FOR FEDERAL                     FUNDING UNDER THE COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT ACT                     OF 1972.         Section 304(4) of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972       (16 U.S.C. 1453(4)) is amended by inserting ``the District of       Columbia,'' after ``the term also includes''.                                  ______                                         By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Reed, and Mr.          Coons):   S. 1741. A bill to direct the Secretary of Energy to establish a  program to advance energy storage deployment by reducing the cost of  energy storage through research, development, and demonstration, and  for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.
