 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this bill.   Mr. Speaker, every one of us in this body was elected to serve and  represent the people of our districts. Doing our jobs means fairly and  fully considering the legislation that comes before us. If we pass this  measure, we will have failed to meet that incredible responsibility.   Our democracy depends, in part, on civilian control of the military.  If we are going to appoint a recently retired general as the new  Secretary of Defense, that decision calls for careful deliberation and  informed debate.   Mr. Speaker, I hear nothing but good things about General Mattis, but  the good people of the Fourth Congressional District of Virginia didn't  hire me to take someone else's word for it. If we are going to waive  this law that has been on the books for oh so many years, Members of  this body deserve the opportunity to ask General Mattis questions, to  hear his answers, and to weigh his views.   Unlike our colleagues in the Senate, Members of this body did not  have the opportunity to have a full committee hearing with General  Mattis. For that reason, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.
