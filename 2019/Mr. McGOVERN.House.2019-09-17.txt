 Mr. Speaker, President Trump said that the U.S. is  ``locked and loaded'' and ready to launch an attack against Iran in  retaliation for attacks on Saudi oil facilities that Houthi rebels in  Yemen have claimed responsibility for.   Let's be clear, Mr. Speaker, this Congress has not--and let me  emphasize, has not--authorized any kind of military operation against  Iran. Nevertheless, the President is beating the drums of war to  distract Americans from the truth.   What happened in Saudi Arabia is a logical outcome of failing to  negotiate an end to Yemen's civil war. It is a logical outcome of the  President's blind support for Saudi Arabia against the will of  Congress.   It is time for cooler heads to prevail. It is time to end U.S.  support for Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen. It is time to end the failed  maximum pressure campaign against Iran. It is time to remind this  President that the Constitution gives Congress the right to declare  war, not him.                            ____________________
