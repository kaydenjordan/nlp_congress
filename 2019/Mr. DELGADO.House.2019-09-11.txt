 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of nearly 3,000  Americans who were killed in the September 11 terrorist attacks on our  homeland.   Eighteen years ago today, vile acts of terror were committed in New  York, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. In the moments following these  tragedies, as thousands of people streamed out of the towers for  safety, thousands of first responders ran into harm's way to save  lives. These first responders came from all across the State of New  York, including my district, the 19th Congressional District.   Today is a solemn day of quiet remembrance. We bow our heads as a  nation in a moment of silence, as we cannot carry the weight of these  memories of loved ones alone. The pain is too hard for one family to  bear, for one city to bear alone, for one State to bear alone.                                time  1815    Today I join my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and from every  corner of the country to never forget--to never forget the lives we  lost, to never forget the sacrifices made of our men and women in  uniform, and know that we will stand with you and your families in the  years ahead.   May we also never forget the national unity we all felt in the days,  weeks, and months following 9/11 where all that mattered was putting  country first. God bless America.
