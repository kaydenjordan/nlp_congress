 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the hard  work, resilience, and achievements of Nebraska distance running  standout, Madison Seiler.   As a high school freshman running for my alma mater, Gering High  School, Maddie was a top-four finisher in class B at the Nebraska State  cross country meet and a member of the State class B girls State  championship team. The following year, she won her first individual  State championship as a sophomore.   Prior to her junior season, Maddie suffered a serious ankle injury  which required surgery. Despite missing the entire summer training  period and all but one competition leading up to the district and State  championship races, she began running just 45 days after surgery and  overcame improbable odds to repeat as individual State champion in  2021. It was an extraordinary achievement.   This October, Maddie's determination and discipline once again led to  another individual State championship, and in doing so, she became just  the 13th runner in Nebraska high school cross country history to be a  three-time State champion. Maddie is an honor roll student, and her  family and community are incredibly proud of her. Go Bulldogs.                            ____________________
