The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill shall be debatable for 1 hour  equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member  of the Committee on Financial Services.   The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling) and the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Maxine Waters) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria: the images of the human misery and  the economic devastation are still clearly imprinted on our minds.   Unfortunately, we know that part of this is a result of a failed  National Flood Insurance Program, which, Mr. Speaker, faced three  important challenges.   First, it is a bankrupt program. It is unsustainable. Taxpayers are  on the hook for $1.2 trillion, running an annual actuarial deficit of  $1.5 billion. It has already received two different bailouts, for a  combined total of about $25 billion.   Also, it incents and subsidizes people to actually live in harm's  way.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, it is a government monopoly that,  notwithstanding subsidized rates, still, unfortunately, has  unaffordable premiums for many.   Today is a good day, Mr. Speaker, because today the House gets to  vote on the 21st Century Flood Reform Act.   I thank the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer) for his  leadership on the mapping reforms and reinsurance. I want to thank the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Ross) for his reforms on opening up the  market. I certainly want to thank the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Duffy) for his tireless effort and leadership in bringing this bill to  the floor.   There are a lot of good reforms in this bill, Mr. Speaker, for both  taxpayers and ratepayers. Let me just briefly touch upon two.   It is an absolutely revolutionary reform, Mr. Speaker, that we can  break open the government monopoly and bring in market competition,  innovation competition, and more affordable rates for so many.   Milliman, one of the actuarial experts within the marketplace,  released a study a couple of months ago talking about the market  competition, saying: ``Based on our estimates, this would hold for 77  percent of all single families in Florida, 69 percent in Louisiana, and  92 percent in Texas,'' who all would see cheaper premiums.   We know that is not theory. It is actually happening in the market  today. In the nascent part of the market that is open, people are  getting hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars of savings.   One of the great tragedies that I saw in my native State of Texas, in  Houston, was how few people actually took up flood insurance. Think,  Mr. Speaker, if we had competition, if we had advertising, if people  could roll that into their homeowner rates, how many more people would  have been protected by the ravages of these hurricanes.   One more reform, briefly. We have these repetitive loss properties  where people live in areas that flood over and over and over. I met a  couple of families in Houston. They had three floods in 8 years. We  have got to help them.   This bill provides more money for relocation, for flood-proofing, and  for mitigation, than any other flood reform bill, all by 25 percent. We  would prioritize these areas.   We also have to realize that if we are going to make this program  sustainable, we cannot have 1 percent of the properties causing 25  percent of the losses.                                time  1515    Ultimately, if all we do is rebuild the same properties in the same  fashion in the same location, that is neither wise nor compassionate.  We have an opportunity to enact historic reforms. We should do it  today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 2874, legislation  that will make flood insurance more expensive, less available, and less  fair for consumers.   At the outset, let me just say that I appreciate the time and effort  that Chairman Hensarling and Mr. Duffy spent in responding to my calls  for bipartisanship. We sat down multiple times to discuss areas where  we could find compromise and a path forward.   Although our discussions were ultimately not successful and I  strongly oppose this bill, I continue to believe that flood insurance  really can be a bipartisan issue. In fact, I have a long history of  working across the aisle on the National Flood Insurance Program.   In 2012, I coauthored the Biggert-Waters Act with former  Representative Judy Biggert, and in 2014, when FEMA's botched  implementation of the premium increases called for in that law led to  unintended consequences, lawmakers from across the aisle joined me once  again to pass the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act.   Unfortunately, despite the best efforts of Members from both sides of  the aisle, I cannot support H.R. 2874 because it contains many  provisions that will harm American families and businesses.   First and most importantly, the bill makes flood insurance more  expensive. This bill will punish low and middle class Americans with  increased premiums, surcharges, and reserve fund assessments. In the  wake of a historic hurricane season that devastated so many  communities, it is unconscionable that we are considering a bill that  would make flood insurance less affordable. We should be focussing on  providing additional disaster relief and recovery after these  devastating storms, not punishing these communities with higher  premiums and surcharges.   It is clear that there are those who choose to live near the coast as  a luxury, but there are also those who live in floodplains who are low-  and middle-income families with modest homes, including some  neighborhoods that are predominantly minority. This is because of the  sad history of government-endorsed racism in access to credit and in  neighborhood planning that pushed minorities into the bad parts of  town, which, in some cases, were bad because they were prone to  flooding.   These communities also often lack the resources to make upgrades to  their homes and infrastructure to guard against future flood risk and  are the least able to recover after a flood. The Lower Ninth Ward in  New Orleans is a prime example.   Another example is Greenspoint, a business district in Houston that  was one of the hardest hit by Harvey. One in three residents in  Greenspoint lives below the poverty line. Families in Greenspoint were  still living in water-damaged and moldy units from flooding last year  when they were hit again by Harvey.  [[Page H9227]]    There is no simple answer to our Nation's flooding problems, but I do  know that raising the premiums and racking these up on policyholders  will only hurt families as well as our economy.   Second, the bill makes flood insurance less available by allowing  businesses to opt out of the requirement to purchase flood insurance,  even if they are a high-risk property in a flood zone.   What is more, the bill kicks out certain low-value homes from the  NFIP by prohibiting coverage for any home with claims that, over the  entire history of the property, following enactment, even if it changes  hands, exceed three times the replacement value of the structure.   This provision is so ill-conceived that the American Bankers  Association wrote: ``Cutting off such properties from NFIP coverage  will likely lead to significant hardship for homeowners, lenders, and  communities. As borrowers lose NFIP coverage, and especially if  alternative private coverage is not available or affordable, these  properties will lose value, and the risk of abandonment and/or  foreclosure increases dramatically. In some flood-prone communities,  this could lead to a local or regional foreclosure crisis.''   Third, the bill makes flood insurance less fair for policyholders. In  the wake of this historic hurricane season, it is astounding to me that  the bill does nothing to fund flood maps so that we can better protect  families. Oftentimes, communities are unaware of their true flood risk;  and by not providing any funding for flood maps, building in areas with  no information about flood risk will only continue.   Climate change will only make these storms more frequent, stronger,  and more devastating than ever before, and we must make sure that the  NFIP remains available and affordable to all Americans, not make it  worse.   For all of these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 2874,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Royce), the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee  and respected member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer), chairman of the Financial Institutions  and Consumer Credit Subcommittee and one of the coauthors of H.R. 2874.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Ross), the vice chairman of the Housing and Insurance  Subcommittee and the author of the pro-consumer competition title of  the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), the vice chairman of our Financial  Institutions and Consumer Credit Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), the vice chairman of our Financial  Institutions and Consumer Credit Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Arkansas (Mr. Hill), a member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Minnesota (Mr. Emmer), a hardworking member of the Financial  Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Zeldin), a member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), the majority whip, who has a slightly  different message.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk), another respected member of our  committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk), another respected member of our  committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. MacArthur), a very hardworking member of the  Financial Services Committee.   Mr. MacARTHUR. Mr. Speaker, I also am from the Northeast, from New  Jersey, and I rise in support of this bill today.   Five years ago, Superstorm Sandy devastated my district. Ocean  County, my home, was the epicenter of that storm. You might remember  the photographs of the iconic Jet Star roller coaster sitting in the  ocean. That was my district.   Even today, I have thousands of constituents who are still out of  their homes. Now, thousands more are experiencing the same thing  because of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.   140 million Americans live in coastal counties, and the NFIP has done  a lot to help with zoning standards, building standards, flood plain  management standards. It hasn't been run perfectly, but this program is  desperately needed by people in areas like mine.   The NFIP has fiscal issues, and this bill seeks to address them. It  is the only Federal disaster program that actually collects money in  advance of a disaster.   When I got on this committee a year ago, I set out on this issue to  do four things: a long-term reauthorization, improve affordability,  increase accountability, and enhance mitigation efforts.   This is a 5-year reauthorization. It reduces the mandatory annual cap  on premium increases; it brings more accountability, including my  language to forbid NFIP from hiring disbarred lawyers; and it doubles  the mitigation coverage from $30,000 to $60,000.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to  the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Capuano), a senior member of the  Committee on Financial Services and a strong progressive leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer), a senior Democrat and leader on environmental  issues in the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy), the chairman of the Housing and Insurance  Subcommittee, and the sponsor of the legislation, the 21st Century  Flood Reform Act.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, there are a lot of horrific images from Hurricane  Harvey. We should never forget them. We should look at this image and  say: Never again.   Yet I hear from my colleagues: Let's preserve the status quo. Let's  again subsidize people to live i harm's way.    I say no, Mr. Speaker. It is time to get these people out of these  neighborhoods. Let's help them. That is why  [[Page H9236]]  this bill has more money for mitigation and relocation than has ever  been in any flood insurance reform bill.   I hear my ranking member say that she cares about affordability. Then  let's give people options.   I hear from people who say: NFIP would have cost me $2,700 a year,  but I was able to find private coverage for $718.   Here is another one: I have benefited from switching to private  market flood insurance from FEMA. I save about $1,000 a year.   Let's save money. Let's save premiums. Let's save lives. Let's vote  ``aye'' on the 21st Century Flood Reform Act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Yoder). All time for debate has expired.   Pursuant to House Resolution 616, the previous question is ordered on  the bill, as amended.   The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was  read the third time.                              Motion to Recommit     Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Speaker, first, I have some good news for my  friend on the other side of the aisle. I would have him pay very  careful attention to title VI of the 21st Century Flood Reform Act. It  has everything to do with the whole Sandy appeals process. We have 25  pages of reforms dealing with what the gentleman was describing,  including Section 601, Penalties for Fraud and False Statements in the  National Flood Insurance Program.   And, indeed, after Sandy, many of the policyholders were wronged and  there was much that we learned from that experience, and we tried to  listen very carefully to a number of our colleagues from New Jersey and  New York and, indeed, took many of the provisions which they have  suggested.                                time  1630    The gentleman from New Jersey, indeed, has some very legitimate  issues and concerns. Many of them, I hope and trust, have been  addressed in this  [[Page H9237]]  bill. It is not too late. I would urge the gentleman to look at that  title IV of the bill and perhaps he would be encouraged to support it.   Otherwise, Mr. Speaker, I must urge rejection of the motion to  recommit because, as you heard from the gentleman from New Jersey, he  says it is all about delay. We can't delay getting people out of harm's  way. We can't delay getting people out of neighborhoods that have  flooded four, five, six, seven times in the last 8 years.   For those who can't afford flood insurance, we can't delay getting  them market alternatives, where, in the 2 percent of the market that  exists today, particularly in Pennsylvania, there are people that are  not just saving hundreds of dollars, Mr. Speaker, but even thousands of  dollars. We can't delay.   We know that this is a program that is unsustainable. It is a  bankrupt program that is being funded, regrettably, by a bankrupt  nation. Taxpayers are on the hook for $1.2 trillion and an annual  deficit of $1.5 billion of actuarial deficit a year.   This thing isn't just broke, Mr. Speaker, it is bailout broke. We  can't delay. We can't delay trying to put this back on a path of  sustainability so the next time we have a serious storm or superstorm,  we want there to be funds available to actually pay claims.   So, no, Mr. Speaker, we cannot delay. We cannot delay, and we cannot  continue to do what we have done in the past in these repetitive loss  areas and have our hands unclean by putting people back in the exact  same neighborhoods that haven't just caused the loss of their property,  but one day may very well cost the loss of their lives. We cannot  delay.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a rejection of the motion to recommit, and I  yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is  ordered on the motion to recommit.   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.
