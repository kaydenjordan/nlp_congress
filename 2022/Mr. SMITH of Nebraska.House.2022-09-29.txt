 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Bulk Infant Formula to  Retail Shelves Act. I appreciate my colleague, Suzan DelBene, for  working together to help lead this bipartisan effort to further address  our Nation's ongoing infant formula shortage.   It is very disappointing that the administration knew of this looming  shortage for months, actually, before they developed a strategy. So  here we are, 9 months into the crisis, and as yet, as of August, 30  percent of our Nation's baby formula was out of stock nationally for 6  weeks in a row. This is simply unacceptable.   I am glad that we can work together to correct this. We must use  every tool available to increase domestic manufacturing, including  responsibly importing FDA-approved base powder used to manufacture  formula when needed.   The Bulk Infant Formula to Retail Shelves Act builds on the  bipartisan work done in the Formula Act and supports domestic  manufacturing by allowing formula base powder to be imported duty-free  through the end of the year.  [[Page H8266]]    I will continue to work with my colleagues on the Ways and Means  Committee to use trade tools to strengthen critical supply chains like  infant formula.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate this opportunity  that we can work together to remove barriers to getting nutrition to  especially young children. As a father of pretty young kids, I can  appreciate the fact that it is pretty scary for families not being able  to find formula when they previously could.   I think that when we talk about supply chains, as was discussed as  well, we have got a lot of work to do ahead of us, and that we can  hopefully bring about more affordable results for the American people.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
