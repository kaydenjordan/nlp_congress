 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the hardworking  Utahns in the uranium industry in San Juan County, and especially those  who have recently lost their jobs at the White Mesa uranium mill and  the La Sal uranium mine complex.   Unfortunately, foreign subsidization of uranium production has had a  devastating impact on North American production and has affected the  mill's operation; and, as a result, roughly 30 percent of the employees  had to be let go at our Nation's last operating uranium mill.   In addition to producing critical minerals, this mill has provided  families with good incomes and generated tax dollars to help the local  infrastructure. In fact, this facility is the largest private employer  in San Juan County.   Since my election to Congress, I have had the privilege to spend  significant time in the rural parts of Utah, including San Juan County.  I appreciate rural Utah's sense of community and desire to help their  neighbors during a time of need.   Unlike the more urban parts of Utah with a business hiring on every  corner, rural areas often have fewer economic opportunities. However,  the hardworking and entrepreneurial spirit among the residents of San  Juan County make me confident they will be successful in their fight  through this difficult time and, ultimately, come out stronger for it.   Additionally, I am committed to creating new economic opportunities  in rural areas. Rural Utahns deserve the same quality of life that  their urban friends have, including access to broadband, quality  medical care, and good-paying jobs. I will continue to work in Congress  to bring these vital services to rural Utah.   While it has been a difficult week for many in San Juan County, I  know the community will be resilient and persevere.                            ____________________
