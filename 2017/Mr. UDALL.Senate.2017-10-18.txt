 Thank you, Madam President, for the recognition.   Madam President, today I wish to talk a little bit about something  very obscure that is buried in this budget bill, but it is something  that is very, very important to me. First, before I talk about the  specific policy issues, I just want to talk about a personal  exploration I had. This is with regard to  [[Page S6510]]  the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and this special area up here  called the 1002 area.   I had the opportunity in the 1980s to take a raft trip down across  this Arctic Coastal Plain and down to the sea, and part of the reason  was that many of the Alaska Senators at the time used to say: If you  are going to make policy in Alaska, you ought to see that part of  Alaska. So I took the opportunity to see it. I took a raft trip down a  river called the Hula Hula River, which flows out of the Brooks Range,  a large mountain range, into the Beaufort Sea.   I can say that from my personal experience, this is one of the  wildest, most magnificent places on the Earth.   I would like to talk a little bit about the creatures and critters we  saw there. We saw the beginning of the caribou migration, which occurs  over in Canada to this area in Alaska, where they calf on the 1002  area. It is one of the biggest migrations in the world of a mammal  species. We saw grizzly bears. One grizzly bear actually came into our  camp, and we had to retreat and watch whatever it was going to do until  it moved along. We saw musk oxen. We saw polar bears. We saw what a  marvelous and incredible area this was and what a rich, rich ecosystem  it was.   I was reminded of my Uncle Mo, Congressman Morris Udall, who was the  author in 1980 of legislative protections for this area. He required  congressional action to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge  and this 1002 area. He did that because he realized how significant and  how magnificent it was.   One of the things we have to realize is what we are protecting here.  People travel all over the world to go to the Serengeti and see the  migration of the animals on the Serengeti plains. This same caribou  migration is very much like the Serengeti. In fact, it is our  Serengeti, when you have animals migrate from Canada all the way into  Alaska and back. This is our Serengeti. It is a special place. It is a  real treasure, and I don't have any doubt in my mind that we should  save it.   The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge represents one of the world's  wildest and more biodiverse places. Its Coastal Plain or the 1002 area  is the biological heart of the refuge. There is no other place like it  on the planet. Congress showed remarkable restraint and forethought  when it put the Refuge under Federal protection, and I am proud my  Uncle Mo Udall was instrumental in passing legislation that doubled the  size of the Refuge. Under that law, only Congress can open up the 1002  area for drilling.    Today I rise in strong opposition to the Republican proposal to drill  for oil in this remarkable place. I will fight their plan tooth and  nail. The only reason they are doing this is to pay for tax cuts for  big corporations and tax cuts for the richest Americans.   The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge's coastal plain is an  environmental time machine. It is a rare place on this Earth, where  almost everything has been preserved as it was over 10,000 years ago.  Oil and gas development would change its delicate ecosystem forever. We  could never get it back.   This Refuge is the largest Arctic conservation area on the globe. It  is part of our national heritage. It is part of the world's heritage.  That is why I compare it to the Serengeti, where people travel from all  over the world to see that migration. The same thing is true here. It  would be wrong to plunder this magnificent area for short-term gain,  especially when that gain is speculative.   The 1002 area is home to 37 species of land mammals, 8 species of  marine mammals, 42 fish species, and over 200 species of birds.  Migratory birds fly in and out of this area from every State and every  continent. The coastal plain in the Refuge is only 20 to 30 miles wide.  No other equivalent slice of Alaska's North Slope is as biologically  diverse.   Let me share a few examples of the wildlife that depend on this area.  Here is a photograph of a caribou and its young during the spring  calving time. The 1002 area hosts the largest and most concentrated  herd of Porcupine caribou in the world: 197,000 caribou make the  longest land migration of any animal--2,700 miles--to give birth there  on the coastal plain in the 1002 area. Their numbers are strong now,  but even a small change in reproductive rates could threaten the herd's  existence.   Here is a picture of a polar bear. Nine hundred Beaufort Sea polar  bears den on- and offshore in this area. The magnificent polar bear is  threatened under the Endangered Species Act, and with climate change  causing sea ice to melt rapidly, more bears are expected to den on  shore.   Here is a photo of the musk oxen. About 250 musk oxen live there  year-round. This impressive mammal survived the last ice age, but  forcing them from their habitat now could threaten their survival.   People also depend on the Refuge. The Gwich'in have lived there for  thousands of years. They call themselves people of the caribou because  their culture and way of life are intertwined with the Porcupine  caribou herd. Caribou represents about 80 percent of the Gwich'in  people's diet. They use caribou skins for clothing, bedding, and  shelter. They make fish hooks, skin scrapers, and other tools from  Caribou bones.   Gwich'in are spiritually tied to the caribou as well. They have a  saying: ``Every caribou has a bit of the human heart in them; and every  human has a bit of caribou heart.'' The Gwich'in people depend on the  caribou for their material and spiritual survival. Oil development in  caribou calving grounds would threaten their very future.   The Republicans' budget resolution instructs the Senate Energy  Committee to identify at least $1 billion in deficit savings over the  next 10 years. The Republicans have their sights on the 1002 area to  produce that $10 billion. As I said, this estimate is highly  speculative, but, for the sake of argument, let's assume the number of  $1 billion is correct. It still doesn't even scratch the surface of the  $1.5 trillion deficit the Republicans recklessly propose. It is not  even one one-thousandth of the money the Republicans need to raise to  pay for the megadeficit they will rack up to pay for a tax break for  the superwealthy.   Opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is not necessary for U.S.  energy independence. We are now an oil exporter, and oil prices are  low. Low prices are forcing companies to stop drilling in areas that  are much more accessible and less sensitive to development. Opening the  Refuge now makes even less sense as more and more people are demanding  fuel-efficient and electric cars.   The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is one of the last truly wild  places in America. The decision to protect the Refuge from drilling was  done carefully and thoughtfully. The decision to undo that protection  should be given the same care and thought.   We haven't held hearings. We haven't even been able to hear from and  question experts. Directing the Energy and Natural Resources Committee  to draft legislation to raise funds without a public process is  premature. The American people will have to live with our decision.  This rushed proposal shortchanges them and it shortchanges future  generations.   There are few places left in the world where the Arctic coastal  plains, foothills and mountains and the wildlife they support are wild  and free. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is one of those places.  This unique, grand, and biologically rich place deserves full  protection in perpetuity.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Melanie  Thornton, a congressional fellow in my office, be granted floor  privileges for the remainder of the 115th Congress.
