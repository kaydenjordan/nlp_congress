 Madam President, a year ago this afternoon, I was sitting  in my office in the Russell Office Building when a news report began to  flash about a shooting at a high school in South Florida. I was the  father at the time--in the case of one of my two older children--of a  child who was still a high school student in South Florida. You would  normally be interested, just in being a Senator from the State, but you  would be most particularly interested as a parent. As it turns out, the  incident and the shooting took place at a school that was about 50  miles--about 50 minutes--from my home, and we all know of the story and  of the lives that were lost in this terrible tragedy.   On a personal level, it is clearly an issue that has affected me,  first, because I am one of two Senators who represent the State. Every  person who was impacted--every victim, everyone who was wounded--is a  constituent of ours. Yet, as I have also pointed out, my two oldest  children are the same ages as the victims. When you see the pictures  and you hear the stories, you can't help but recognize the stories and  the pictures, maybe just not individually. I didn't know any of the  victims personally, but the stories are familiar. They are the stories  of my children and their friends, who are of the same age and are at  the same times in their lives.   It is impossible to fully comprehend unless you have gone through the  loss of a child--by the grace of God, I have not--particularly under  such tragic and traumatic circumstances. Throughout the last 12 months,  as we have reached different milestones in my two daughters' lives,  whether it was their proms or graduation days, or whether it was  dropping off my oldest at college or attending a class ring ceremony  for a junior, we have been almost reminded, for just a moment, of the  parents who had expected to have been doing the same during this time  of the year but have been unable.   I have learned a lot from those parents, many of whom I have gotten  to know personally and have worked alongside, in the last year, on a  number of issues. In the year that has passed, they have, as have the  students, turned their grief into effective activism. The parents, in  particular, are the ones with whom I have interacted the most here in  Washington on a regular basis, and it is why I thought it appropriate  to come to the floor today. I think they would say that the best way to  honor the memories of the children they lost is to take actions that  will work to make sure that no other parent will ever have to face this  again.   Several of the parents have publicly described what happened a year  ago today as the most avoidable mass murder in American history, but  what was it that enabled this to happen? Why was it avoidable? What  could have been done to address it?   In the brief moments that we have here--my colleague from Florida  will have additional statements as well--I want to point to some of the  things we now know that we didn't know a year ago today or in the days  that followed.   From it, not only should that spark outrage, but it should also spark  ideas about how to fix those things so never again will any parent have  to face what they did and none of my colleagues will have to stand here  and give a speech like the ones my colleague from Florida and I have to  give today.   At the outset, let me say that the credit for much of what I am about  to speak about belongs to the extraordinary journalists at the South  Florida Sun Sentinel, who have done a remarkable job over the last 10  months of revealing to the public many facts that would have been  unknown otherwise.   At a time when there is so much debate about journalism and its role  in our society and in public service and in politics, they deserve  tremendous credit for bringing this to light, and I think it is an  example of why journalism remains an important institution in our  country.   A lot of the attention in this debate has been paid to the issues  that we are familiar with and have been debating long before this  tragedy: a ban on certain weapons, universal background checks, taking  on what is described as the gun lobby. These issues dominated the  national media coverage, and support for these positions is not new.  They predate this tragedy.   In our Republic, people most certainly have the right to advocate for  this or against it. They have the right to lobby for it. They have the  right to vote for candidates who support these positions and to vote  against those who do not. They are valid issues to debate on public  policy, but at the end of the day, neither go directly to the heart of  this particular case and to the facts that led up to it.   At the heart of this is that the killer, the perpetrator of this  terrible tragedy, was known to be dangerous for a long time by many  people in positions of power and authority at the school district, the  sheriff's office, and at the FBI, and no one did anything about it.  This is now a documented fact.   Early in the days after this, we saw images of the sheriff and the  superintendent lecturing people and talking about what a great job they  had done, but the facts will show that it was their incompetence that  allowed this to happen, and, then, even worse, they tried to cover it  up.   There is an article entitled ``Schools culture of tolerance lets  students like [the killer] slide,'' by Megan O'Matz and Scott Travis,  reporters at the South Florida Sun Sentinel. I am going to read from  it, and then I am going to introduce it into the Record. I am not going  to read the whole article.   Here is how it opens:         Broward schools have grown so tolerant of misbehavior that       students like [the killer] are able to slide by for years       without strict punishment for conduct that could be criminal.        The culture of leniency allows children to engage in an       endless loop of violations and second chances, creating a       system where kids who commit the same offense for the 10th       time may be treated like it's the first. . . .        [The killer] was suspended at least 67 days over less than       a year and a half at Westglades Middle School, and his       problems continued at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. .       . .    The South Florida Sun Sentinel obtained the killer's discipline  records, they reviewed discipline policies, and here is what they  found:         Students can be considered first-time offenders even if       they commit the same offense year after year.        The district's claim of reforming bad behavior is       exaggerated.        Lenient discipline has an added PR benefit for the       district: lower suspensions, expulsions and arrests along       with rising graduation rates.    It goes on to say:         Many teachers and parents say Broward has created a culture       in which teachers are expressly told or subtly pressured not       to send students to the administration for punishment so a       school's image is not tarnished.    One teacher who taught for 37 years in the district before retiring  said she  [[Page S1339]]  retired early due to her concerns about student discipline.   Here is a quote:         It was so many things. I had three students bring knives to       my classroom. One was out of the classroom for one day.       Another had so many things on his record, he was gone for       five days. None were expelled.    Part of this leniency is a program called the Promise program, which  the superintendent of the district claims has a 90-percent success rate  by keeping students from reoffending. That is a misleading statistic  because, ``A student can commit a subsequent infraction without being  considered a repeat offender as long as it's not the exact same  violation, in the exact same year.   Each year they start with a clean slate.   In the interest of time, I ask unanimous consent that the rest of  this article be entered into the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                   [From the Sun Sentinel, May 12, 2018]    Schools' Culture of Tolerance Lets Students Like Nikolas Cruz Slide                     (By Megan O'Matz and Scott Travis)         Broward Schools have grown so tolerant of misbehavior that       students like Nikolas Cruz are able to slide by for years       without strict punishment for conduct that could be criminal.        The culture of leniency allows children to engage in an       endless loop of violations and second chances, creating a       system where kids who commit the same offense for the 10th       time may be treated like it's the first, according to records       and interviews with people familiar with the process.        Cruz was suspended at least 67 days over less than a year       and a half at Westglades Middle School, and his problems       continued at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, until he       finally was forced to leave.        The South Florida Sun Sentinel obtained Cruz's discipline       records, reviewed discipline policies and found:        Students can be considered first-time offenders even if       they commit the same offenses year after year.        The district's claim of reforming bad behavior is       exaggerated.        Lenient discipline has an added PR benefit for the       district: lower suspensions, expulsions and arrests along       with rising graduation rates.    School district shuts down information after Stoneman Douglas shooting         The forgiving attitude goes beyond the schools'       controversial Promise program, the target of considerable       public scrutiny for enabling students to avoid criminal       charges for misdemeanor offenses.        The program, the pride of Superintendent Robert Runcie, was       designed to use counseling and mentoring to help students       avoid the school-to-prison pipeline. Under former zero-      tolerance policies, black students ended up suspended,       expelled and arrested at rates that were widely       disproportionate to their peers.        Desmond Blackburn, then Broward's chief school performance       and accountability officer, specifically instructed teachers       and staff in a video years ago to challenge and nurture       students, while using suspensions, expulsions and arrests as       ``absolute last resorts.''        Now, many teachers and parents say Broward has created a       culture in which teachers are expressly told or subtly       pressured not to send students to the administration for       punishment so a school's image is not tarnished.        Mary Fitzgerald taught for 37 years in the district before       retiring from Sunrise Middle in Fort Lauderdale in 2016. She       said she retired a year early due to her concerns about       student discipline.        ``It was so many things. I had three students bring knives       to my classroom. One was out of the classroom for one day.       Another had so many things on his record, he was gone for       five days. None were expelled.''    No one heeded warning signs about Nikolas Cruz before school shooting         Safety concerns at Sunrise were brought up at faculty       meetings. ``The message out there is that the students are       untouchable. Habitual negative behavior means nothing       anymore,'' state the minutes of a Faculty Council meeting on       Feb. 2, 2015.        ``My principal basically would tell me it was his job to       market the school. He was adamant about not looking bad,''       Fitzgerald said.        Runcie, in an interview with the Sun Sentinel, acknowledged       there are complaints that discipline isn't consistently       enforced.        In a memo to principals Wednesday, Runcie said he       reinforced that ``we have to be vigilant in reporting every       incident so that we can ensure our students who are victims,       as well as offenders, get the appropriate intervention and       support.        ``We're going to try to make sure, from the top, we're       sending the right message related to discipline and holding       our schools accountable,'' he said.        The superintendent said in the memo that he will propose       the School Board create a Climate and Discipline Department       to ``better monitor and support school teams as they address       students with major challenges and concerns.''                             The Promise program         The Pine Ridge Education Center, just outside Fort       Lauderdale, houses the Promise program, as well as secure       classrooms for other children who have been expelled from       their regular school but need supervision and guidance.        The principal describes it as a ``school of promise and       encouragement, not a school of punishment.'' Students call it       the ``Zap School,'' as in you've been ``zapped'' and sent       there as punishment.        Runcie claims the Promise program has a 90 percent success       rate at keeping children from re-offending, but that       statistic can be deceiving.        A student can commit a subsequent infraction without being       considered a repeat offender, as long as it's not the exact       same violation, in the exact same year.        The following year, they start with a clean slate.        ``It's extremely problematic,'' said Tim Sternberg, a       former assistant principal at Pine Ridge Educational Center       who administered the Promise program. ``You can develop a       psyche that it is OK to commit crime because you can refresh       the clock every year.''        Sternberg says he doesn't have confidence in the district's       data. ``They aren't tracking kids over time.''        Asked about kids starting each year anew, without marks       against them from prior semesters, Runcie told the Sun       Sentinel he will review it.        ``We'll make whatever adjustments we need to. We review the       discipline policy every year and have made some adjustments       and continue to take feedback.''                              Inside the Matrix         The district's Student Code of Conduct, first created in       2004-05, includes a complicated discipline ``matrix'' that       lists the prescribed punishment for a litany of offenses:       skipping school, violating rules, being disruptive, having       drugs, fighting, destroying property, committing a crime.        It was designed to help staff make fairer and more       equitable decisions in handing out penalties. But potential       punishments have become more lenient over the years.        More than five years ago, a high school student who used       profanity toward a staff member would receive a three- to 10-      day suspension. That was reduced to one to two days after the       discipline chart was revised.        The first violation for disruptive classroom behavior       called for an in-school suspension of one to five days.       Later, it was reduced to a suspension of under one day.        Since the 2012-13 school year, suspensions have declined 27       percent, according to the Florida Department of Education.       Incidents reported to law enforcement have fallen 8 percent.       The number of arrests per 1,000 students: down 64 percent.        The district's menu of choices for dealing with rule-      breaking students include detention, internal suspension,       out-of-school suspension and expulsion, where children can be       sent to an alternative education center.        Or another option: the Promise program.                                 Under attack         Runcie is proud and protective of the program, which was       launched under his leadership in November 2013 when the       Broward Sheriff's Office, the Public Defender's Office, the       NAACP, the state Department of Juvenile Justice and the State       Attorney signed an agreement to reduce school-based arrests.        But the program is under attack because of widespread       allegations that Cruz, the Marjory Stoneman Douglas school       shooter, benefited from it.        Runcie had insisted that Cruz was not in the Promise       program, but he did an abrupt shift this week and said Cruz       had been referred to it in 2013 for vandalizing a bathroom.       Cruz did not complete the three-day stint, the district said,       but administrators haven't said why.     Broward schools backtrack on gunman Nikolas Cruz's Promise program                                 connection         A couple of months later, he was sent to a special school       for children with severe emotional and behavioral disorders.       As a tot, he was found to be developmentally delayed and had       been considered a special needs child in school, entitled to       certain services and protections under law.        Some parents and community leaders have criticized the       superintendent for misleading the public about Cruz, and the       school district appears not to be able to make sense of all       of the records it has on him.        ``To me, it's an indication that the various discipline       programs in place at the district are confusing, poorly       implemented and executed, and clearly if we take the district       at its statement, they've been difficult to track,'' said       Ryan Petty, whose daughter Alaina was one of 17 people shot       to death in Cruz's Valentine's Day massacre. ``If the records       are this difficult to find, clearly it would be difficult to       know whether this is helping students or not.''        Despite Cruz's history of discipline problems, neither the       schools nor police ever steered him to the justice system.     The second article--I will be brief on this--is from the  Sun Sentinel, by Scott Travis: ``Broward schools fought against 2013  plan for more security money.''   They turned down a proposal to levy $55 million in tax dollars for  school safety, and one of the quotes is this:   [[Page S1340]]              One of the school board members slammed the proposal. They       said they'd rather ask voters for money to improve technology       and renovate old schools, which they did in November of 2014.    In hindsight, that was a terrible mistake.   There is another article from the Sun Sentinel: ``What's being done  to stop another school shooting.'' Again, it is a very long article. I  will just say this:         Once he decided to shoot up a school, there wasn't much to       stop [the killer].        His threats were ignored, the campus was wide open, the       school doors were unlocked and students had nowhere to hide.    What has changed after 10 months since the shooting? This was back on  December 29, 2018.         At least a quarter of campuses do not have single-entry       points to control intruders. Safe spaces to protect children       in classrooms haven't been identified.    The killer wasn't welcome at that high school, by the way.         He was known by former classmates and even administrators       as a potential school shooter. And still he walked right onto       campus.    It goes on to say:         [The killer] didn't keep his homicidal urges quiet. But the       schools incompetently handled the threat he represented to       his fellow classmates and teachers.        [The killer's] lust for violence had been documented       officially 69 times in his life. At least 30 people knew of       his troubling behavior before the shooting.    In fact, I have here with me the record of those 69 discipline  points. It is extensive, and I ask unanimous consent that that record  be entered into the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         The table below shows the history of incidents involving       Nikolas Cruz as reported by school officials during his time       at Westglades Middle School and Marjory Stoneman Douglas       High. In between those schools, Cruz attended Cross Creek, a       public school in Pompano Beach for students with emotional       and behavioral disorders.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                  Date                             School                          Type of incident ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 5/15/12...............................

It  talks about efforts that were made by the school district to keep from  the public the sorts of things that we are now finding out.   Finally, ``Here's what the [school district] knew about the Parkland  shooter'' is another article that talks about, time and again, how this  killer told people he was going to do this--not just one person, but  multiple people--and nothing was in place to do anything about it.   I wrap up with a couple of points. The first is that the Marjory  Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission empaneled by the  State looked at these shootings and from it, I think, are pretty  instructive of some of the things I hope we can work on together. It  looked at a 20-year period and found that 48 individuals committed 46  of these attacks, and 35 were students, and 10 were former students. So  45 of the 48 were either students or former students.   It found that the most typical weapon used was a semiautomatic  pistol. It found that 50 percent of these attacks were done with  weapons that were taken from the home--not even purchased, but taken  from the home. It found that in four of five incidents, at least one  person had some knowledge that they were going to do this, and in more  than half of the cases, at least two people knew they were going to do  this.   It is on the basis of these discoveries, working with many of the  parents whose children lost their lives a year  [[Page S1341]]  ago today, that last year we pursued on a bipartisan basis and passed  the STOP School Violence Act, which provides, over a 10-year period,  $100 million a year for strengthening school security, providing school  training to identify threats before they take action, and creating  school threat assessments and crisis intervention. That has passed.   It is why this year I have reintroduced the Extreme Risk Protection  Order and Violence Protection Act, which will dedicate the Department  of Justice funds to incentivize States to give law enforcement the  authority to prevent individuals that pose a threat to themselves or  others the ability to purchase or possess firearms, so that if  information like what was available to authorities in Parkland is  available to people now, they can actually go to court--to prove their  case with due process, and take the guns away from this person before  they go out and commit this crime. More importantly, they can alert  their parents to secure the guns at home so they don't use that gun to  commit the crime.   I have also introduced a bipartisan bill, the Threat Assessment  Prevention and Safety Act. It creates a task force of experts to  provide recommendations for a national strategy to keep our communities  safe from targeted violence through threat assessment and management,  which experts say is the best way to identify potential killers before  they act.   If something like this had been in place, it is highly likely that  authorities, putting all this together--what we know today--would have  said this individual is a serious threat and we need to do something  about it before they take action.   And, finally, yesterday, Senator Grassley and I reintroduced the  EAGLES Act, which would reauthorize and expand the U.S. Secret Service  National Threat Assessment Center to help communities proactively  mitigate threats of violence in schools.   It is my hope that this terrible tragedy and what we have learned  about it will guide us and will provide us a road map of concrete steps  that we can take to empower communities, schools, and police  departments and parents and families with the tools they need, not just  to identify people who are potentially violent but to prevent it from  happening and to get out ahead of it--maybe it is a risk assessment or  maybe it is institutionalized mental health or wraparound services, but  anything that can be done.   I raise all of this today because if you were to speak to the  families, as I know my colleague from Florida and I often do, they will  tell you that the most important thing we can do to honor the memory of  their children whom they lost in this terrible tragedy is to make sure  it doesn't happen to anybody else.   Now, there is one more thing we would like to do to honor the victims  of this tragedy. My colleague Senator Scott and I have put forth a  resolution that commemorates this day. It honors the survivors. It  pledges continued support for their recovery. It recognizes the  strength and resiliency of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and the  community that surrounds it. It expresses gratitude to the emergency  medical and healthcare professionals of the community for their efforts  in responding and caring for the victims and survivors. Most of all, it  commemorates the victims who were killed in the attack, and it offers  the Senate's heartfelt condolences and deepest sympathies to the  families, loved ones, and friends of the victims.   Madam President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous  consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 71,  submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to,  the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    I yield the floor.    Madam President, today I recognize Jennie Cyran,  the Polk County Teacher of the Year from Horizons Elementary School in  Davenport, FL.   In receiving this award, Jennie credited her colleagues and students  for her success, believing she would not be in this position if it were  not for them. She considers successful teachers to be those that devote  their time to building trust and relationships with their students and  their families.   Jennie considers the classroom to be a student's second home, free  from judgement and a place where they can embrace their mistakes as  learning opportunities. She tutors her students on weekends at school  or at their homes and offers parents the resources to help their  children succeed in school and later in life.   Jennie has been a teacher for 13 years and enjoys working with new  teachers so that they are not overwhelmed with their new jobs. She also  mentors female students through the Girls of Integrity program and  volunteers as a Special Olympics coach and unified partner for several  sports.   I would like to thank Jennie for all her hard work to provide  students with a successful learning environment. I extend my best  wishes to her and look forward to hearing of her continued success in  the coming years.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I honor Holly Mickler, the  Pasco County Teacher of the Year from Pasco Middle School in Dade City,  FL.   Holly is an Advancement Via Individual Determination teacher. She  focuses on preparing her students for college level writing, reading,  and critical thinking skills. She also teaches them the non-academic  skills, such as perseverance, time management, curiosity, manners, and  character building, that are so important for students success in the  classroom and in life.   While she develops a general lesson plan for her students, she also  individualizes these plans and shifts her end goals based on their  needs. Holly believes having an intentionally flexible lesson plan is  what turns good teachers into great teachers because it allows them to  adapt their student's needs.   Holly has taught at Pasco Middle School for 14 years. She earned her  bachelor's degree in special education from Appalachian State  University. Outside of the classroom, she works with her husband in  their prison ministry, Hostage of Hope Ministries. They provide inmates  with personal items and transcribe sermons from the Tampa Bay  Presbyterian Church.   I extend my sincere thanks and gratitude to Holly for her dedication  to her students and look forward to hearing of her continued success in  the years to come.                            ____________________
