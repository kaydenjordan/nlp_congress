 Let me thank the gentleman for his very astute  argument and his leadership on the committee.   I am going to narrow my argument to, I think, very realistic  questions about whether or not we are procedurally in the context of  overruling the OSHA decision out of the Federal courts or whether or  not this is really a question of do we want to protect the rights of  American workers and protect them from the years of injuries that  preceded the establishment of OSHA. I want to fall on the side of the  American worker.   Let me be very clear what we are talking about today. The ruling that  we are speaking about went against 40 years of precedence in reporting  workplace safety violations. Since 1972, every administration has  maintained that the 5-year retention period for recording work-related  injuries, illnesses, or death is standard practice. This DOL rule was  simply put in place to codify and create some consistency that will  benefit both employers and employees.   Thank you, President Obama, who recognized that it is not the Member  of Congress who may slip on a rug in their privileged manner of coming  to this august body and voting, but it is, in fact, the workers who  come every day and pick up your garbage, the sanitation workers, the  same workers that Dr. King went to Memphis to stand up for and the  individuals who, because of their work, are susceptible to injuries  more often than not.   Individuals who work in construction, who help build our houses and  hospitals and tall skyscrapers, what excuse can we give for not  maintaining the standards of keeping and reporting those injuries for a  period of 5 years and the retention of such? Or those who work, for  example, in the area of railroads, railroad beds and railroad sites-- hard labor. Or those who work at our ports--hard labor.   So I rise to oppose disapproving the rule submitted by the Department  of Labor regarding OSHA, and I do so for the men and women who do the  heavy lifting.   I include in the Record a letter from AFSCME, which represents  municipal and county workers across America, establishing why we should  vote ``no'' on this.           American Federation of State, County and Municipal             Employees, AFL-CIO,                                 Washington, DC, February 28, 2017.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.6 million members       of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal       Employees (AFSCME), I'm writing to urge you to oppose H.J.       Res. 83, which would abolish an Occupational Safety and       Health Administration (OSHA) rule that clarifies an       employer's responsibility to maintain accurate records of       serious work-related injuries and illnesses.        The new OSHA rule creates NO new compliance or reporting       obligations and imposes no new costs on employers.        The 1970 law creating OSHA explicitly directed the agency       to ``prescribe regulations requiring employers to maintain       accurate records of and to make periodic reports on, work-      related deaths, injuries and illnesses other than minor       injuries . . . .'' Since the first recordkeeping regulations       issued in 1972, OSHA has required employers to record       workplace injuries on an ``OSHA log'' within seven days of       the injury and to maintain the records of the log and annual       summary of the log for five years. Every Republican and       Democratic administration since 1972 has interpreted this       employer obligation to make and maintain accurate records to       be ongoing from the date of the injury or illness until the       five-year retention period expires. OSHA issued this       clarifying regulation in December 2016 in response to a court       decision that dramatically limited OSHA's enforcement of       injury recordkeeping regulation to a six-month period. OSHA's       clarifying rule simply restores the standard to one employers       have known and complied with for 45 years.        H.J. Res. 83 would strip OSHA of its enforcement authority       and harm workplace safety.        Passage of this Congressional Review Act Resolution of       Disapproval would enable employers who deliberately and       recklessly break the law to avoid any penalties for       systemically failing to report or underreporting  [[Page H1424]]       injuries over many years. They would be able to cover up or       mask longstanding workplace hazards that need correcting.       OSHA has limited resources and, on average, can inspect a       workplace once every 140 years. OSHA relies upon reliable       injury and illness data to prioritize its resources to those       workplaces that present the greatest hazards to workers. H.J.       Res. 83 would remove OSHA's enforcement ability to protect       workers from the most dangerous and significant hazards.        Workplace injuries are real. Last year, a GAO report found       workplace violence is a serious concern for the approximately       15 million health care workers in the United States, but the       full extent of injuries that are the result of workplace       violence is unknown because of underreporting. Accurate       reporting would help OSHA, employers, workers and their       representatives respond more effectively to this prevalent       workplace hazard. H.J. Res. 83 would jeopardize the progress       that could be made on workplace violence and other workplace       injuries by blocking this basic reporting and recordkeeping       rule or a similar rule in the future.        We oppose H.R. Res. 83 and urge you to stand with workers       by rejecting this resolution.            Sincerely,                                                        Scott Frey,                            Director of Federal Government Affairs.     H.J. Res. 83 is wrong. It is wrong because it goes  against the hardworking people.   I also include in the Record, Mr. Speaker, a letter from the  International Brotherhood of Teamsters disapproving of H.J. Res. 83.                                           International Brotherhood                                                    of Teamsters,                                  Washington, DC, February 27, 2017.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.4 million members       of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, I urge you to       oppose H.J. Res. 83, disapproving the rule submitted by the       Department of Labor relating to ``Clarification of Employer's       Continuing Obligation to Make and Maintain an Accurate Record       of Each Recordable Injury and Illness.'' Disapproving this       rule would undermine safety in some of the nation's most       dangerous industries, many of which employ Teamsters.        The rule does not impose new costs on employers and simply       reaffirms OSHA's ability to enforce injury and illness       recordkeeping. This rule became necessary when a 2012 court       decision overturned policy that had been in place for 40       years by limiting enforcement of OSHA's injury recordkeeping       regulations to a six month period. OSHA publishes the data       that it collects from employers on worksite injury and       illness which is then utilized by employers, unions, and       workers to identify and fix workplace hazards. With limited       resources, OSHA also utilizes the data to target its       enforcement and compliance activities to the most dangerous       workplaces thus making it essential that OSHA have accurate       information. With under-reporting of injury and illness data       already a major issue, it makes no sense to effectively strip       OSHA of its ability to enforce reporting requirements as this       ultimately impacts workplace safety. Congress should be       working to improve work place safety not undermine it, and       voting for H.J. Res 83 will ultimately harm working men and       women.        I urge you to oppose H.J. Res. 83 to protect OSHA's ability       to enforce accurate injury and illness reporting and to       ensure workers have a safe and healthy workplace.            Sincerely,                                                    James P. Hoffa,                                                 General President.     Mr. Speaker, I stand with the workers.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.J. Res. 83, a  resolution ``Disapproving Department of Labor Rule Relating to  Clarification of Employer's Continuing Obligation to Make And Maintain  an Accurate Record of Each Recordable Injury And Illness.''   I oppose this bill because it will harm workers who depend on the  Occupation Health and Safety Administration to ensure that their  workplaces are safe. H.J. Res. 83 will undermine workplace health and  safety and make it impossible for OSHA to ensure that injury and  illness records are complete and accurate.   Accurate records are needed to ensure OSHA focuses its limited  resources on the nation's most dangerous workplaces, instead of wasting  time in workplaces with low risk.   The Department of Labor rule at issue here does not create any new  obligations.   OSHA has enforced injury recordkeeping requirements by reviewing the  last five years of an employer's records throughout its entire history,  under every administration.   In 2012, a court decision limited enforcement of OSHA's injury  recordkeeping regulations to a six month period--a dramatic departure  from the last OSHA's 40 year policy and practice.   The 2016 rule simply allows OSHA to continue this practice.   Mr. Speaker, complete and accurate information on work-related  injuries and illnesses is important.   The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 directs the Secretary  of Labor to ``prescribe regulations requiring employers to maintain  accurate records of, and make periodic reports on, work-related deaths,  injuries and illnesses other than minor injuries.''   Since the early 1970's, OSHA has required construction employers to  keep these records.   The records are used by employers, workers, and unions at the  workplace to identify hazardous conditions, and take corrective action  to prevent future injuries and exposures.   Both positive and negative injury trends are tracked on a national  scale, allowing limited prevention resources to be targeted  effectively.   Most importantly, OSHA relies on the records to target its  enforcement and compliance assistance activities to dangerous  workplaces.   No employer, union, or individual could possibly want OSHA inspecting  safe workplaces rather than hazardous ones, but without accurate  information, this will happen.   Disapproval of the new rule puts construction workers lives in  danger.   Without the new rule, it will be impossible for OSHA to effectively  enforce recordkeeping requirements and assure that injury and illness  records are complete and accurate.   Underreporting of injuries and illnesses is already a huge problem,  and without enforcement, this will get much worse.   It will undermine safety and health and put workers in danger.   I strongly oppose H.J. Res. 83 and urge all Members to vote against  this ill-conceived and unwise legislation.
