 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Florida. I want to  commend her for her passion and her commitment to helping the people of  Venezuela. I thank her for making me part of this Special Order.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the ongoing crisis in Venezuela.  With every week that passes, we see the situation in Venezuela becoming  more critical.                                time  1930    A country with the world's largest known oil reserves is spiraling  into a collapsed state where people are struggling just to survive.  Journalists and citizens risk their lives every day to report what is  happening inside Caracas and around the country. We see that tensions  are growing, and government security forces shoot first and don't even  bother to ask questions later.   Maduro continues to keep political prisoners like Leopoldo Lopez  under lock and key to send a strong message to those trying to question  his actions. Just yesterday, we saw reports that government buildings  in western Venezuela are being set ablaze. Make no mistake: It is the  failed Chavismo policies and the authoritarian actions of Nicolas  Maduro that have brought all of this pain and suffering upon the  Venezuelan people.   Press reports show that of 800,000 businesses that opened during the  Chavez regime, nearly 600,000 have shut down. Both the Obama and Trump  administrations have sanctioned senior officials in the Venezuelan  Government for their associations with narcotrafficking, money  laundering, and other illicit activities.   Just today, Reuters released an exclusive report that the Venezuelan  Government is in possession of 5,000 shoulder-launched surface-to-air  missiles that are typically used to shoot down low-flying planes and  helicopters.   Last week, Spanish authorities interdicted a shipment of 6 tons of  cocaine from Venezuela en route to their shores. With the recent  sanctions of Vice President Tareck El Aissami, under the Kingpin Act,  it has become clear that Venezuela's Government is  [[Page H4499]]  acting as a narco-state and facilitating the shipment of narcotics  throughout the region. These sanctions are not against the Venezuelan  people but are carefully crafted and targeted towards the individuals  who are committed to destroying the lives of millions of innocent  civilians in exchange for money and power.   Last week, the U.S. Department of the Treasury sanctioned members of  Venezuela's Supreme Court for their rulings that stripped power away  from the National Assembly, further consolidating Maduro's  authoritarian regime. Maduro and his cronies continue to get rich as  they traffic money and drugs while doing nothing to help the millions  of suffering people in Venezuela. They continue to loot the country as  reports regarding the worsening situation continue to make front-page  news throughout the region. Maduro's tactics are making it impossible  to survive.   Multiple news reports confirm a growing health crisis as people lack  access to basic medicines, and infant mortality rates and preventable  diseases such as diptheria, malaria, and the Zika virus are all on the  rise. In addition, nearly every day we hear of young children whose  lives are cut short, whether it is from a bullet from Maduro's thugs or  the lack of access to food, water, and basic services.   That is why I am grateful for the efforts of my colleagues here  tonight who have supported several initiatives in Congress that work to  hold these thugs accountable. My colleagues and I have held hearings,  sent letters, and met with our allies in the region to work together to  try to bring sound relief to the Venezuelan people.   Meanwhile, instead of focusing on the economy, Maduro is staging mock  military exercises and stoking fears by spreading propaganda of U.S.- led invasion.   The truth about Maduro is clear, and the international community is  starting to unify against him. The OAS Secretary General Luis Almagro  has wisely called for Venezuela's suspension from the OAS unless it  frees its political prisoners, accepts humanitarian aid, and holds  elections without delay.   I believe we need to work together with our allies around the world  and continue to insist Maduro abide by international norms and give the  Venezuelan people the freedom they deserve.   I thank my dear friend from Florida, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and the  other Members here tonight for their relentless commitment to these  important issues.    Mr. Speaker, I want to take this moment to thank my  colleague and my chairman of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee for  always being present on all the important issues, human rights issues  in the Western Hemisphere.   And of course, I want to thank my colleague from Florida, Ileana Ros- Lehtinen, for her passion and determination to bring democracy to  Venezuela.   Before I recognize my good friend from Florida, Mario Diaz-Balart, I  would just like to say that Venezuela basically has taken a page out of  the Castro brothers. This is how the process in Cuba started. Fifty- five years later, there is nothing but oppression, no freedom of  expression, no election, and, quite frankly, there are approximately  about 30,000 Cubans in Venezuela running the security apparatus.   But I want the Venezuelan people to know that we are fighting along  with them, that we are talking to all the Presidents, all the leaders  in the Western Hemisphere, to put pressure on Venezuela to develop the  democracy and stop the abuse of human rights in Venezuela.   At this time, I yield to my good friend from Florida (Mr. Diaz- Balart), who is also a fighter for human rights and who has been always  in the forefront of human rights in the Western Hemisphere.    Thank you, Congressman. Thank you for all your passion and  all your effort on behalf of those people who need it the most, the  people in Venezuela.   Mr. Speaker, I would just like to end by saying, you know, I remember  years ago when Spain went through 39 years of dictatorships in the  Franco era. And one of the things that happened that was able to  develop democracy in Spain was the fact that all the European countries  got together and helped and assisted in developing a democracy in  Spain. I think the same thing needs to happen in this region.                                time  2000    The countries of our Venezuela have to demand that Venezuela release  its political prisoners, that it has free elections, and stop the human  rights abuses. After all, it is in their best interest that a stable  Venezuela is good for a stable region.   Mr. Speaker, I thank very much my colleague, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen,  always for her passion on this issue. She is the little giant of human  rights in this Congress. I thank her and my colleague, Mario Diaz- Balart.
