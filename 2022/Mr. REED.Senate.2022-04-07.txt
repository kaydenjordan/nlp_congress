 Mr. President, today I am introducing the Ship Agent  Licensure Act along with my colleague Senator Whitehouse. This  legislation seeks to improve supply chain efficiencies and port safety  and security by creating a Federal standard and licensure for  independent ship agent companies, just as we already do for  transportation intermediaries like Freight Forwarders and Non-Vessel  Operating Common Carriers, NVOCCs.   Ship agents are one of the most important yet least understood  stakeholders in the international marine trade supply chain, but in the  United States, there is no Federal licensing for these essential  players.   A ship agent can best be understood as the general contractor of the  port call, tasked by ship owners and charterers with managing thousands  of vendors to ensure a safe, secure, and cost efficient port call. This  includes coordinating critical Federal Government clearances and  inspections for Agencies that include the Coast Guard, Customs and  Border Protection, the EPA, USDA, and others. Government officials rely  on ship agents to fulfill their critical role of facilitating commerce,  and protecting life, property, and the environment. More than any other  stakeholder, the ship agent facilitates efficiencies at the Nation's  ports of entry, the frontline of the supply chain.   While the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development has  established minimum international standards for ship agent competency,  quality, and fiduciary responsibility, there is no requirement for  independent ship agent companies to abide by these, or any set of  standards in the United States. Many domestic independent ship agent  companies voluntarily certify through third-party accreditation  associations in accordance with these international standards, but not  all do. When ship agents are not properly trained and do not carry the  appropriate bond and insurance, it creates delays and inefficiencies  during vessel calls, jeopardizes port entry and clearance, and  increases risk for Federal Agencies.   That is why it is critical to require Federal licensing for  independent ship agent companies. Indeed, such a licensing requirement  represents a unique opportunity for the United States to adopt its own  uniform nationwide standards, consistent with the existing  international standards, to ensure that ship agents have the knowledge,  experience, and skills needed to manage these high stakes vessel calls  and help our government agencies fulfill their responsibilities.   I urge our colleagues to join us in supporting this commonsense  legislation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. REED (for himself, Ms. Collins, and Mr. Merkley):   S. 4041. A bill to promote environmental literacy; to the Committee  on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.    Mr. President, today, I am introducing bipartisan,  bicameral legislation with Senator Collins and Senator Merkley and  Congressman Sarbanes that targets the fundamental goal of public  education, which is to equip the next generation with the knowledge,  skills, and experiences to understand the world around them and their  ability to shape it. In the face of a global climate crisis, it is  essential that all students graduate with environmental literacy skills  to secure and sustain their future. The No Child Left Inside Act will  ensure that our students will have the opportunity to develop  environmental literacy.  [[Page S2096]]    Environmental education provides broad benefits. It has been shown to  enhance student achievement in science and other core subjects and to  increase student engagement and critical thinking skills. Moreover, it  promotes healthy lifestyles by encouraging kids to get outside.   The COVID-19 pandemic has shown us just how vital understanding the  environment is to our own health, well-being, and ability to carry out  our daily activities. As the pandemic took hold, Rhode Island's  environmental educators sprung into action, creating outdoor learning  support opportunities and virtual programs for students as they did  school from home. We need this to work on a national level for all  students.   The No Child Left Inside Act authorizes $150 million annually to  supports States in the development and implementation of environmental  literacy plans to integrate environmental education and field  experiences into the core academic program in public schools, with an  emphasis on professional development in environmental education for  teachers. With this funding, States will provide grants for  partnerships between school districts and parks, natural resource  management agencies, educator preparation programs, museums or other  organizations with expertise in engaging young people with real world  examples of environmental and scientific concepts. The legislation also  establishes a pilot program for outdoor school education programs that  offer intensive, hands-on learning experiences, such as residential  programs and summer camps.   The No Child Left Inside Act will also help coordinate the Federal  efforts on environmental education. It requires the Secretary of  Education to establish environmental literacy advisory panel to  coordinate and report on environmental literacy activities across  Federal Agencies. It also will prove easy access to environmental  education resources through the Department of Education's website.   The No Child Left Inside Act has the support of nearly 100  organizations, representing educators, parks, museums, environmental  organizations, and community-based organizations at the national,  State, and local levels. They stand ready and willing to partner with  schools across the Nation. The Federal Government should be a partner  too. That is why I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring the No  Child Left Inside Act.                                  ______                                         By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Whitehouse, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr.          Merkley):   S. 4060. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide  for inflation rebates, and for other purposes; to the Committee on  Finance.    Mr. President, today I am introducing the Food and Fuel  Family Savings Act, FFFSA, along with Senator Whitehouse, Senator  Feinstein, and Senator Merkley. Price increases, particularly for basic  necessities like food and gas, are weakening household buying power and  cutting family budgets across the country. Americans are struggling,  and it is critically important that we both address the long-term  factors driving inflation and support the millions of families facing  higher prices right now. That is why we are introducing this  legislation, which would provide eligible individuals and families with  debit cards to cover higher food and fuel prices in the short term and  help tame inflation in the medium and long term.   A number of factors are driving our current bout of inflation.  Pandemic-driven supply chain snarls, a surge and shift in demand  towards goods, and corporate consolidation have created an imbalance  between supply and demand. Energy prices have risen particularly  quickly, as OPEC limits output and oil companies refuse to invest in  domestic production to meet growing demand. Russia's invasion of  Ukraine has also decreased global oil, fertilizer, and wheat supplies,  moving prices higher for food and energy. These wide-ranging pressures  pushed the Consumer Price Index up 7.9 percent in February--its fastest  increase in 40 years.   Hard-working Americans are not at fault for these global price  pressures. Yet, these households, which often put a large share of  their income towards basic necessities, are being forced to bear the  burden of higher costs. Indeed, U.S. grocery prices rose 8.6 percent in  February, the largest annual increase in over 40 years, and U.S. gas  prices were up a whopping 38 percent. While the wealthiest Americans  can afford more expensive everyday goods, higher prices erode working  families' buying power and can force them to delay or reduce critically  needed purchases. We need to help them.   Our bill would take the burden off the shoulders of working Americans  by providing targeted relief to low- and moderate-income individuals  and families. It would provide eligible households with debit cards  loaded with $600 per family member that work exclusively at grocery  stores and gas pumps. The average American household would receive  $1,500. Using estimates from Bloomberg economists, this payment should  cover the additional $183 the average family will spend each month on  food and fuel for the rest of 2022. In other words, our legislation  would ensure households can put food on the table and gas in the car  this year.   Importantly, this fiscally responsible legislation is fully paid for.  In fact, offsets would pay for the cost of the debit cards and slash  the deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars. More than that, it  would tamp down inflation in the medium and long term. Indeed, this  bill would help families weather today's inflation while cooling price  increases in the years ahead.   Congress must continue working on other measures to foster a  stronger, more resilient postpandemic economy. Our legislation would  aid these long-term efforts while providing Americans the financial  help they need right now.   I urge our colleagues to join us in supporting this important  legislation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. PADILLA (for himself, Mr. Menendez, Ms. Cortez Masto, Mr.          Heinrich, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Murphy, and Ms.          Rosen):   S. 4068. A bill to promote and support collaboration between  Hispanic-serving institutions and local educational agencies with high  enrollments of Hispanic or Latino students, and for other purposes; to  the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.
