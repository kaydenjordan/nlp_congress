 Madam President, no one wants to live on a dirty planet.  Before we created the Environmental Protection Agency, the EPA, nearly  50 years ago, rivers actually caught fire from pollution, smog covered  our cities, and powerplants spewed arsenic  [[Page S1378]]  and mercury into the sky with impunity.   In the years since, the EPA has been at the vanguard of the effort to  protect the air we breathe and the water we drink.   This work is not easy, and the person who leads the EPA has a tough  job. It requires toughness and fortitude to fight back against  polluters and special interests.   In all the years the EPA has been around, we would be hard-pressed to  find someone more hostile to the Agency's fundamental mission or as  less suited to leading it than Scott Pruitt is.   As Oklahoma's attorney general, Mr. Pruitt organized, led, or  participated in virtually every challenge to the EPA's work during his  time in office. His lawsuits have, among other things, sought to  prevent the EPA from enforcing rules that keep our water safe, protect  our air from harmful pollutants, like mercury and arsenic, and limit  the carbon pollution that causes climate change.   These lawsuits beg the question: Does Scott Pruitt believe the EPA  should even exist? In the weeks and months since he was nominated, Mr.  Pruitt has gone out of his way to try and smooth over his record and  say what he thinks we want to hear, but we can't fall for it.   Instead of listening to what he is saying now, let's examine more  closely what he has done as Oklahoma's attorney general.   His record is troubling. Throughout his term of office, Mr. Pruitt  has been very cozy with fossil fuel companies and affiliated interest  groups.   A 2014 investigation by the New York Times revealed that energy  lobbyists drafted letters for Mr. Pruitt to send on State stationary to  the EPA against the Obama administration's environmental regulations.   The CEO of Continental Energy--an oil and gas company based in  Oklahoma--served as the campaign chairman for his reelection bid. We  just got word yesterday that a State district judge in Oklahoma ordered  the attorney general's office to turn over as many as 3,000 documents  related to Mr. Pruitt's communications with oil, gas, and coal groups  during his time in office. Unfortunately, we will not get a chance to  see what these documents reveal before voting on his confirmation.   Based on his record and associations, however, I think we can make an  educated guess that these documents will reveal the extent of Mr.  Pruitt's ties to fossil fuel interests, and we have no reason to  believe he will renounce these connections if confirmed to serve as EPA  Administrator.   He also fought relentlessly against the EPA's efforts to establish  basic limits on smog, arsenic, mercury, and other dangerous air  pollutants.   Mr. Pruitt, for example, sued the EPA not once but twice to overturn  the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards. These standards would prevent  40,000 pounds of mercury emissions every year and would help keep our  food supply safe from contamination.   Mr. Pruitt has also repeatedly questioned whether climate change is  real.   In an op-ed in the Washington Times, Mr. Pruitt refused to accept  settled science that humans contribute to climate change. He said there  are ``a wide range of viewpoints regarding the extent to which man  contributes to climate change.''   In the National Review, Mr. Pruitt said ``scientists continue to  disagree about the degree and extent of global warming.''   The fact is, 97 percent of scientists agree that climate change is  real and that human beings contribute to it. I hardly think 97 percent  of scientists agreeing constitutes a wide range of viewpoints on  climate change and the extent to which man contributes to it.   From his perch as Oklahoma's attorney general, Mr. Pruitt sued to  prevent President Obama's Clean Power Plan to cut carbon emissions from  taking effect. He argued that the Federal Government doesn't have the  authority to regulate carbon emissions. This is wrong.   The Supreme Court ruled twice--first in Massachusetts v. EPA in 2007  and again in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA in 2014--that the EPA  has the authority to regulate carbon emissions as pollution under the  Clean Air Act.   If confirmed, Mr. Pruitt has promised to kill the Clean Power Plan  and undo much of the positive work that President Obama did to address  climate change.   Mr. Pruitt also has a track record of undermining enforcement of  environmental laws and regulations. Shortly after becoming Oklahoma's  attorney general in 2010, Mr. Pruitt gave us a taste of what is to come  at the EPA when he eliminated the Environmental Protection Unit within  the Oklahoma attorney general's office.   For years, this unit investigated water contamination from  refineries, lead paint waste, and illegal dumping. In its place, he  created the innocuous sounding Federalism Unit. Unlike the unit he  eliminated, whose mission was to protect the health and safety of  Oklahomans, the Federalism Unit's job is to handle all of Mr. Pruitt's  legal challenges against the EPA. Over the past 3 years, Mr. Pruitt has  increased the budget of the Federalism Unit by over 700 percent, and  the taxpayers of Oklahoma get to foot that bill.   Mr. Pruitt's record paints a clear picture: His priorities directly  conflict with the EPA's mission to protect public health and the  environment. He is much more concerned about protecting corporate  interests than keeping our communities healthy and safe from pollution.   Over the past few months, I have heard from thousands of my  constituents who have urged me to oppose Mr. Pruitt's nomination. I  would like to read two of the letters I have received. Georgia is a  Ph.D. student at the University of Hawaii. She wrote:         I strongly oppose Scott Pruitt's confirmation as EPA       Administrator. Mr. Pruitt is a climate change denier who has       actively worked against the mission of the agency.    As a Ph.D. student in science, I know we need an EPA administrator  that respects science and supports clean air, clean water, and a  healthy environment. Pruitt is the wrong choice for our nation and must  be rejected.   Keiko from Kaneohe also wrote to explain what this fight means to  her.         This is not a bipartisan issue, but it is as much an       American issue as it is a Hawaiian issue, a human issue, and       an issue of all inhabitants of Papa, mother earth. I ask that       you continue to be vigilant and `onipa'a in the face of       climate change deniers . . . Mahalo for looking out for       everyone living today and going to be born tomorrow.    We have come too far over the past 8 years to let someone like Scott  Pruitt destroy the progress we have made. I urge my colleagues to  oppose this nomination.   I yield the floor.
