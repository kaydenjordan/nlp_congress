 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H.R. 4.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, in calling up H.R. 4, the FAA Reauthorization Act of  2018, this bipartisan legislation is cosponsored by every chair and  ranking member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.   This bill is critical to our economy, to millions of Americans who  work in aviation, and to hundreds of millions of Americans who use the  system every year. H.R. 4 authorizes FAA programs through FY 2023.   This is a long-term bill, something that is overdue. Too often, our  aviation programs face short-term extensions, CRs, and threats of  government shutdowns. We are now operating on the fifth extension from  the last long-term FAA law, which was signed on February 14, 2012.   Before the bill was signed into law, Congress passed 23 short-term  extensions. This is an incredible amount of uncertainty for programs  that rely on long-term stability. That uncertainty was one of the  reasons I initially pushed for air traffic control reform, to separate  the modernization of our system from the unreliable Federal budget  process.  [[Page H3591]]    In that regard, this bill only maintains the status quo. I still  strongly believe Congress must soon pass real air traffic control  reform for the U.S. to finally develop the most modern, advanced  aviation system in the world, and right now, we cannot claim that. The  more we delay, the more we risk losing our position in the world as a  leader in aviation.   So, while H.R. 4 does not contain all the reforms our system needs,  it does contain other important reforms that must be implemented. For  example, this bill cuts red tape in the certification process so our  manufacturers can get products to market on time, stay competitive, and  continue providing millions of American jobs.   It streamlines the regulatory process to encourage innovation and new  technologies, like unmanned aircraft systems.   It provides critical funding for the AIP program and airport  infrastructure across America.   It strengthens protections for passengers, and it addresses safety  issues that have arisen in recent years.   The bill contains many good provisions, and I plan to offer a  manager's amendment that provides additional improvements. That  includes an additional safety provision in light of the April 17  Southwest flight 1380 engine failure.   I want to commend pilot Tammie Jo Shults for her absolute heroic  performance after a catastrophic engine failure at over 30,000 feet.  This was a prolonged emergency--not over in just a minute or two. For  the next 15 to 20 minutes, with a hole in the cabin and believing that  a passenger may have been completely sucked out, she calmly and  expertly guided the plane to an emergency landing.   Tragically, one person died in the incident, but 148 people are alive  today because of Captain Shults and her crew. She prevented what could  have been a large tragedy. In my opinion, this is one of the most  heroic performances by a pilot and crew in recent memory.   Strengthening our aviation system is only one of the reasons we need  to pass today's legislation. H.R. 4 also includes the Disaster Recovery  Reform Act, a measure that passed the House in December with  overwhelming support, but it was not taken up in the Senate.   These provisions strengthen FAA's focus on predisaster mitigation,  preparing our communities to better withstand the next hurricane,  wildfire, flood, or other disasters. Building better and building  smarter will save lives and lower the growing cost of disaster  recovery. Investing more in mitigating disasters before they strike  makes common sense.   This bill is a result of the hard work of the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee, the bill sponsors, and many others. I want to  thank Ranking Member DeFazio, Chairman LoBiondo, Ranking Member Larsen,  Chairman Barletta, Ranking Member Titus, and the many other Members who  worked on this legislation. I look forward to a good debate today and  to moving this bill to the Senate.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.           Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,                                        House of Representatives,                                     Washington, DC, April 17, 2018.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: On April 13, 2018, the Committee on       Transportation and Infrastructure introduced H.R. 4, the FAA       Reauthorization Act of 2018. The bill was referred primarily       to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, with       an additional referral to the Committee on Ways and Means.        I ask that you allow the Committee on Ways and Means to be       discharged from further consideration of the bill so that it       may be scheduled by the Majority Leader. This discharge in no       way affects your jurisdiction over the subject matter of the       bill, and it will not serve as precedent for future       referrals. In addition, should a conference on the bill be       necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee       on Ways and Means represented on the conference committee.       Finally, I would be pleased to include this letter and any       response in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration, to memorialize our understanding.        Thank you for your consideration of my request.            Sincerely,                                                      Bill Shuster,      Chairman.                                   ____                                        Committee on Ways and Means,                                        House of Representatives,                                                     April 17, 2018.      Hon. Bill Shuster,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Shuster: I am writing with respect to H.R. 4,       the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018, on which the Committee       on Ways and Means was granted a referral.        As a result of your having consulted with us on provisions       in H.R. 4 that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the       Committee on Ways and Means, I agree to waive formal       consideration of this bill so that it may move expeditiously       to the floor. The Committee on Ways and Means takes this       action with the mutual understanding that we do not waive any       jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or       similar legislation, and the Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation       moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues       that fall within our jurisdiction. The Committee also       reserves the right to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees to any House-Senate conference involving       this or similar legislation, and requests your support for       such request.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding, and would ask that a copy of       our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R. 4.            Sincerely,                                                       Kevin Brady,      Chairman.                                   ____           Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of             Representatives,                                    Washington, DC, April 23, 2018.

I appreciate your support for       Committee on Financial Services representation on a related       conference committee, should one be necessary.        Thank you in advance for a response to this letter       confirming this understanding with respect to H.R. 4. I also       appreciate your willingness to insert a copy of our exchange       of letters on this matter in the Congressional Record during       floor consideration.            Sincerely,                                                    Jeb Hensarling,      Chairman.                                   ____           Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of             Representatives,                                    Washington, DC, April 17, 2018.

Hon. Bud Shuster,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I have received your letter regarding       H.R. 4, the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018, which was       additionally referred to the Committee on Natural Resources.        In the interest of permitting you to proceed expeditiously       to floor consideration of this very important bill, I will       agree to discharge the Natural Resources Committee from       further consideration of the bill. I do so with the       understanding that the Natural Resources Committee does not       waive any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matter       contained in the bill that fall within its Rule X       jurisdiction. I also appreciate your support to name members       of the Natural Resources Committee to any conference       committee to consider such provisions and for inserting our       exchange of letters on H.R. 4 into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor.        Thank you once again for the very cooperative spirit in       which you and your staff have worked regarding this matter       and many others between our respective committees.            Sincerely,                                                        Rob Bishop,      Chairman.                                   ____           Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of             Representatives,                                    Washington, DC, April 19, 2018.

Hon. Bill Shuster,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing concerning H.R. 4, the       ``FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018.''        H.R. 4 contains provisions within the Committee on Science,       Space, and Technology's Rule X jurisdiction. As a result of       your having consulted with the Committee and in order to       expedite this bill for floor consideration, the Committee on       Science, Space, and Technology will forego action on the       bill. This is being done on the basis of our mutual       understanding that doing so will in no way diminish or alter       the jurisdiction of the Committee on Science, Space, and       Technology with respect to the appointment of conferees, or       to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters       contained in the bill or similar legislation.        I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming       this understanding, and request that you include a copy of       this letter and your response in the Congressional Record       during floor consideration of this bill. Thank you in advance       for your cooperation.            Sincerely,                                                       Lamar Smith,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Chairman, it is my great privilege to yield 3  minutes to the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young), the former chair of  the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.   (Mr. YOUNG of Alaska asked and was given permission to revise and  extend his remarks.)    Mr. Chairman, it is my great pleasure and honor to yield  5 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LoBiondo), my friend  and the chairman of the Subcommittee on Aviation of the Committee on  Transportation and Infrastructure, who has been a tireless advocate for  aviation safety efficiency, but who has also been a great partner on  the committee to me and to the other members of the committee.    Also, I want to mention that--and I think this is accurate--he is the  only Member of Congress who has a CDL, commercial driver's license, so  he is in a very unique position to not only know and advocate for  aviation, but also, on the ground, he knows how commerce moves.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta), the chairman of the Subcommittee on  Economic Development, Public Buildings and Emergency Management.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time each  side has remaining?    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Smith), the chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Graves), chairman of the Highways and Transit  Subcommittee of the full Committee of Transportation and  Infrastructure, and the bleating voice on general aviation in Congress.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Knight).    I yield the gentleman from California an additional 15  seconds.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Gibbs).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Denham), the chairman of the Railroads, Pipelines,  and Hazardous Materials Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I just have one more speaker, and then I  am ready to close.   I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Posey).    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chairman, this is an issue that I know the gentleman  from Florida cares deeply about and has been a champion for his  constituents in the commercial space industry. I do commit to the  gentleman to work with him as we move to advance this bill forward.   Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to close if the gentleman from Oregon is.  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I encourage all Members to support this  positive reauthorization of the FAA. I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the manager's  amendment. A vote for this amendment is a vote for positive change. A  vote against it would be a real missed opportunity to make the bill  better.   This amendment enhances the training of flight attendants so they are  better equipped to deal with sexual misconduct. It also establishes  working groups to develop best practices on how to address sexual  misconduct on flights and improve airline employee training.   The amendment addresses an issue which is important to the traveling  public and our constituents, and to each of us, in a thoughtful and  respectful way.   The amendment adds to the provisions included in H.R. 4 to improve  the air travel experience of disabled Americans. It establishes an  Airline Passengers with Disabilities Bill of Rights to clarify the  rights of passengers with disabilities and the responsibilities of  airlines and airports.   The amendment also strengthens the civil penalties for violations  that involve injury to a passenger with a disability or damage to a  passenger's wheelchair or other mobility aid.   Finally, the amendment will make it better for both passengers and  service animals by harmonizing standards. This will provide much-needed  clarity in an area where there is real confusion.   We worked closely with organizations representing persons with  disabilities, as well as with the airline industry, and I want to thank  all those who were willing to come to the table to make those  improvements.   Last week, we witnessed a tragedy when an engine exploded in midair,  killing a passenger. A far bigger tragedy was averted thanks again to  the professionalism of the flight crew and to the pilot, which I talked  about earlier.   The same airline experienced a similar incident 2 years ago, and  while the FAA and industry have begun inspections, we must ensure that  the airline engine safety is thoroughly assessed, and this amendment  mandates a call to action to bring relevant people together to examine  and address any risk associated with airline engines.   The amendment also requires a deep-dive study of general aviation.  This sector of aviation has the highest number of accidents, injuries,  and fatalities.   While general aviation safety has improved in recent years, in fiscal  year 2016, there were still 213 fatal accidents and 379 fatalities.   We must improve the safety of the general aviation community. They  share the skies with other airspace users and operate above our  neighborhoods. We can and must do better.   Again, the amendment also provides for the direction on how the FAA  should spend the additional general fund, operations, airport  infrastructure, and F&E money in 2019 and thereafter.   It also revises the FAA authorization levels to reflect the updated  CBO baselines for fiscal year 2018.   In response to the drone sightings around airports, the amendment  makes counter-drone systems AIP eligible.   It makes improvement to the Airport Investment Partnership Program so  that we can leverage private sector money for our airport  infrastructure needs.   There are some good government reforms in here. The amendment repeals  a costly mandate for aircraft avionics that have not yet proven to be  beneficial. This will relieve a future burden on aircraft operators.   The amendment would bring certain FAA processes into the digital age  and review agency practices.   Some other important changes are:   The amendment authorizes expenditures for commercial space  transportation activities of the FAA;   It also requires better intra-FAA coordination on commercial space  transportation's use of the national airspace and addresses the  industry's support aircraft;   Commercial space transportation operators, like other users of the  airspace, must coordinate and follow instructions of air traffic  controllers;   Air traffic controllers keep us moving safely across this country,  but they  [[Page H3643]]  also work in far-off places, including Guam. This amendment requires  the FAA workers to work with the Department of Defense so that these  folks and their families can get good medical care on the island of  Guam;   Finally, the amendment establishes the Youth in Aviation Task Force  to attract young people to aviation jobs. This is critical to ensure  that our aviation system prospers in the years ahead.   Mr. Chairman, this amendment is a good amendment, it has bipartisan  support and will improve the underlying bill. I urge all Members to  support the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Graves), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Highways and  Transit, our general aviation pilot.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, pursuant to House Resolution 839, I offer  amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No.  25 be modified by the form I have placed at the desk.  [[Page H3648]]     Mr. Chairman, I support considering these amendments en  bloc, all of which have been approved by both the majority and the  minority.   These Members put forth thoughtful amendments, and I am pleased to be  able to support moving them en bloc.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis), a valued member of the  committee.    Mr. Chair, we will be committed to working with the  gentleman as we move forward.   Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.  Lewis), a member of our committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Kansas (Mr. Estes).    I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Kansas.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I encourage all of my colleagues to  support the en bloc package, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, pursuant to House Resolution 839, I offer  amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chairman, I support considering these amendments en  bloc, all of which have been approved by both the majority and the  minority. These Members put forward thoughtful amendments, and I am  pleased to be able to support moving them en bloc.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  North Dakota (Mr. Cramer).                                time  1415     Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Sanford).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Indiana (Mr. Banks).    Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to close, so I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Biggs).    Mr. Chairman, I encourage my colleagues to support the  en bloc package, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Higgins for yielding.   I believe this amendment that initiates a pilot program allows small  numbers of these aircraft to land in the United States for maintenance  services. I understand what the gentleman is trying to do, and I want  to stress the next point, that no community would have these older  aircraft land at their airports unless they certify annually that they  are willing to accept them.   I think the gentleman is trying to create jobs in a district, in a  rural area, that the noise will not affect and that will put  hardworking Louisianans to work fixing these planes that still operate  around the Caribbean.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment. The amendment  would repeal existing law that has been in place since 2012. The law  generally prevents DOT from adopting lithium battery regulations that  are not harmonized with international standards.   Existing law represents a balanced approach that allows DOT to issue  regulations that exceed international requirements if the Secretary has  credible evidence that lithium batteries would substantially contribute  to onboard fires.   Billions of lithium batteries and lithium-battery containing products  are shipped safely by air every year. Shipments by air into the U.S. in  2017 were valued at approximately $120 billion, which also means there  are thousands of jobs attached to these.   Aviation is a global industry, and it is very important there not be  a patchwork of regulations. The international body studying the global  standards for lithium battery transport requirements has been very  active on the issue, and the United States has been centrally involved.  In reality, the international effort on lithium batteries has been  ahead of the DOT in terms of implementing requirements.   Additionally, H.R. 4 continues to focus on safely transporting the  products that almost all Americans rely on. It assures expert  participation in all panels and working groups of international test or  standard-setting organizations in which the United States participates.  It avoids creating a burdensome patchwork of regulations, provides the  Secretary of Transportation with the authority to deal with this, and  creates a Lithium Battery Air Safety Advisory Committee to ensure that  the best and safest policy positions are developed and synchronized in  the U.S.   This amendment also would put exclusive powers to represent the  United States internationally on transport issues in the hands of the  FAA, despite hazardous materials transportation affecting all modes of  transportation.    Currently, the Secretary of Transportation is statutorily directed to  represent the United States in international forums for transporting  hazardous materials in international commerce. It is the Secretary's  discretion to delegate this authority to her or his choice of agencies.  Discretion appropriately rests with the Secretary.   Experts agree that uniform international transportation regulation is  a key to safety, so I would urge all Members to oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate my colleague's passion on  this issue.   I would, again, say, having a system that is harmonized throughout  the world is critical. ICAO has already said in their standard that  they recommend that we don't carry them on passenger aircraft, so our  industry in America has done that.   Further, the companies that ship cargo--UPS, FedEx--are working, and  I have seen what they have done to make sure that the crews of cargo  planes are protected. Again, the private industry understands this, and  they are moving forward to develop these systems that contain it or  suppression systems.   So, again, I believe that the best way forward is to, again,  harmonize with the rest of the world and continue to ship billions of  dollars of these batteries safely every year. Again, I urge my  colleagues to not support this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for offering this  amendment.   This amendment would streamline the process for airlines to obtain  information from the National Driver Registry for airline pilots  seeking employment.   I thank the gentleman for offering this amendment, and I urge all of  my colleagues to support this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, even though I do not oppose the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for offering his  amendment.   This amendment implements critical recommendations from the FAA's  Rotorcraft Occupant Protection Working Group. Specifically the  amendment will require newly manufactured helicopters meet specific  safety standards to prevent post-crash fires from occurring.   In many cases, fatal helicopter accidents are due to post-crash fires  rather than the impact itself. Equipping these new helicopters with  crash resistant fuel systems is absolutely critical in preventing  thermal injuries and fatalities.   I thank the gentleman for his continued leadership and persistence.  When I say persistence, the gentleman has been working on this issue  for a number of years, so, again, I congratulate him for that effort.   Mr. Chairman, I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, pursuant to House Resolution 839, I offer  amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chairman, I support considering these amendments en  bloc, all of which have been approved by both the majority and  minority. These Members put forward thoughtful amendments, and I am  pleased to be able to support moving them en bloc.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Fleischmann).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Lance).    Mr. Chairman, I urge all my colleagues to support the  amendments en bloc, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition.   This amendment would interfere with national security, homeland  security, and law enforcement operations.   As home to the Nation's Capital, the area serves a critical role for  the country as home to the Federal Government. Each day, military  pilots and other agencies use helicopters to conduct vital missions as  part of our national defense and the operations of government. These  agencies include the DOD, the Coast Guard, Park Police, Capitol Police,  and other agencies. The missions they fly cannot be accomplished by any  other means and are essential to our Nation's protection.   This amendment would add complexity to the airspace and could affect  the safety of our servicemembers and law enforcement and affect the  efficiency of the airspace.   Mr. Chairman, I understand the gentleman's concerns, and I hope we  can find some way to address them, but I urge my colleagues to oppose  this amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for offering this  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I agree with the ranking member, Mr. Larsen. This  amendment requesting the GAO study makes a lot of sense to me. The  outlook of the future supply of individuals in the workforce, we know  there are some shortages out there. This report will inform us about  the current aviation workforce and needed actions to ensure we do have  an adequate supply of workers in the future.   Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his leadership and thank him  for offering this amendment, and I urge all Members to support it.    Mr. Chair, I thank Mr. Lewis and I thank the gentleman  for offering this amendment. The Metropolitan Planning Organizations  were created to ensure that local officials drive the decisions about  how Federal and highway transit funds are spent. Unfortunately, for the  gentleman's district, a loophole in the law undermines elected  officials.   This amendment ensures the structure of MPOs can consist of locally  elected officials. This is a fair and commonsense amendment, so I urge  all Members to support this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, the amendment is a re-regulation of the  airlines that was soundly defeated in the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee. It would force airlines to interline, which  refers to agreements among airlines to carry each other's passengers.  Most airlines already have interline agreements with other airlines,  and the freedom to do so is important to preserve.   Forcing all airlines unwilling into such deals will have unintended  consequences. Customers will be punished and forced to bear the burden  of the service fares of other airlines. The problems caused by this  amendment would be most acute in smaller communities that have few  flights per day.   H.R. 4 includes provisions requiring air carriers to prominently  disclose to passengers what services will be offered in the event of  widespread disruption. The underlying bill contains a number of other  consumer protections that are widely supported by stakeholders and  Members alike.   Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for his leadership on this issue,  but I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Washington (Mr. Larsen).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my  request for a recorded vote on amendment No. 67 to the end that the  Chair put the question de novo.    Mr. Chairman, I reluctantly rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend and, actually, my  classmate, Mr. Lynch. You, myself, and Joe Wilson are the last of the  special election eight that came in 2001, so with me leaving, it will  just be up to you and Joe Wilson. But I appreciate working with you.   I appreciate the intent of your amendment. Again, I reluctantly  oppose it because of my high regard for you and the work you have done  here. I might add too that what you are talking about, the  registration--your amendment, I am familiar with it; I think it might  have had some unintended consequences. But I also believe that what  they do in Oklahoma City at the registry would put some language in  this bill to change that process out there. I intend to go out and see  it firsthand, because there are problems out there with the way they  operate out there in Oklahoma City. Again, I understand what you are  talking about.   But I do rise, reluctantly, to oppose the amendment. The amendment  would require the FAA to undertake a very unclear task, I believe,  facilitating opportunities for air carriers to install noise reduction  devices. If you come onto the House floor with an FAA bill, the number  one amendment that we have--many, many amendments that we have deal  with noise. So it is a problem out there. But the air carriers do have  an incentive to, again, operate and reduce the noise of their aircraft,  and each new generation of aircraft continues to reduce the noise.   I know that in Connecticut, I believe, Briggs & Stratton has a  facility up there, United Technologies, and they were talking about a  jet engine that will reduce noise by as much as 70 percent. Again,  technology. A lot of smart people are out there trying to figure out  innovative ways to reduce noise on these aircraft. Having the FAA  involved in these air carrier business decisions, I believe, would  stifle the innovation and would set back that development.   But again, I thank the gentleman for his leadership. I am well aware  of the issue. I at this point would urge my colleagues to oppose the  amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for offering this  amendment, but I do oppose it.   This amendment would require the FAA to develop a global-scale  guidance system related to convection activity. The FAA already has  extensive resources for obtaining necessary weather information for  safe flight operations, including thunderstorm information, lightning,  and so on. Additionally, the FAA is currently engaged in such weather- modeling development and is actively working towards deploying such  capability in the future.   However, this amendment will likely require significant budgetary  resources  [[Page H3682]]  from both the FAA and NOAA, and, unfortunately, the brevity of this  amendment and the lack of details results in a vague mandate that may  distract the FAA and NOAA from their ongoing efforts. If the intent is  to improve forecasting efforts, then let's not distract them from those  efforts they are currently involved in.   For these reasons, I urge all my colleagues to oppose the amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding and  rise in support of his amendment.   Again, this amendment does address the concerns of the people on Long  Island. As the gentleman pointed out, this was put in place without  public comment, without talking to the folks that live and have to live  under these  [[Page H3683]]  overflights, so I applaud him for his efforts and commitment to his  constituents on this issue. Again, he has worked tirelessly for the  last two Congresses on this issue and been a tremendously effective  advocate.    I thank the gentleman for his continued leadership, and I thank him  for his amendment and encourage Members to support Mr. Zeldin's  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I  do not oppose the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for offering this  amendment. It is a good amendment. The cybersecurity workforce will  play a greater role in the aviation industry in the years ahead.   Mr. Chairman, I encourage all of my colleagues to support Mrs.  Lawrence's amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Smucker) having assumed the chair, Mr. Collins of Georgia, Acting Chair  of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported  that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 4)  to reauthorize programs of the Federal Aviation Administration, and for  other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
