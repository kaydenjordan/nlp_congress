 Mr. President, I thank my colleague Senator Lee for an  impassioned and effective argument.   I rise here today in support of my colleague Senator Hyde-Smith's  SAVE Moms and Babies Act, of which I am a proud cosponsor. I am  disappointed that my colleagues would object to this bill to help  safeguard and help expectant mothers.   The SAVE Moms and Babies Act would improve women's health by  protecting important safety mechanisms put into place by the FDA. The  Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy is an essential mechanism which  ensures that drugs with serious safety concerns are used and prescribed  correctly.   My Democratic colleagues and the abortion lobby may expect Americans  to believe chemical abortion pills are safe to use and should be  available online without an in-person physician consultation, but here  are the facts: Between 3.4 and 5.9 percent of women taking chemical  abortion drugs require surgical intervention to complete the abortion.  This meant 10,000 women in 2017 alone needed surgery after taking an  abortion drug. Chemical abortion has four times the complications as  surgical abortion during the first trimester. The risk of complications  are particularly worsened in the case of an ectopic pregnancy. Women  with ectopic pregnancies have suffered serious injury and even death  from taking chemical abortion drugs.   I am disappointed this Chamber could not come together today to  support Senator Hyde-Smith's timely, needed, and important bill to  protect women's health.   I yield the floor.
