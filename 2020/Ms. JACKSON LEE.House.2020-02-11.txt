 Mr. Speaker, first, I would like to honor and  express my deepest sympathy, as a fellow Texan, to the family of  Sergeant 1st Class Javier Gutierrez, who lost his life in battle in  Afghanistan. I also want to acknowledge Sergeant 1st Class Antonio  Rodriguez of New Mexico, as he lost his life in battle as well.   It is a war that is endless. Nonetheless, the service of our giants,  our young men and women in uniform, is to be constantly honored.   Sergeant Gutierrez, a family man, a husband, a father, engaged in the  service of his Nation, enthusiastically joining. He came from a long  legacy of service to the Nation: his grandfather, another hero in our  Nation, and his father, another hero in our Nation.   I pray for this family, who has now given the ultimate sacrifice and  never refused to put on the uniform to fight in battle for this  Nation's freedom, its justice, and its equality.   May God bless his family, and may he rest in peace.                   Defeat President Trump's Proposed Budget     As I move to another topic, I would like to say that  this is a message to my constituents and the American people.   As you have heard in the news, and were probably frightened by the  excerpts, I hold in my hand a budget for America's future. This was  offered by the President of the United States. It is frightening in its  attack on the basic security, domestic security, of the American  people.   I would venture to say that even our young soldiers have found the  need for their families to sometimes have assistance with the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, food stamps. Tragically,  this budget digs deep to hatchet away the basic safety net that we have  come to understand is not a handout for working families who may be  impoverished but a hand-up.   I am startled by the cuts, draconian cuts, in this document. I am  startled by $1.6 trillion in cuts for Medicare and Medicaid.   I am startled by, in the midst of the coronavirus, a more than $4  billion cut in funding for the NIH and the Centers for Disease Control,  the very entities that provide lifesaving research and possible cures  for the American people and people around the world.    The World Health Organization is begging to go into China at this  time, and they are looking to have American researchers who are ready  and able to go, to determine how to stop, how to determine the origins,  and how to thwart what might be a horrific pandemic around the world.  How can you cut $4 billion?   Then, the precious children in my congressional district, I have the  privilege of representing a number of school districts, not just one,  but a good number of school districts. Every day, the administrators,  teachers, and parents, dropping their beautiful children off, are  looking for an opportunity so that they, too, might serve and  contribute to this great Nation. Yet, a number that is so startling it  takes your breath away: $6.2 billion in cuts for education.   After Hurricane Harvey, with 51 trillion gallons of floodwater,  people are still suffering from the losses of their homes, still trying  to fix flooding areas and mitigate the damage through infrastructure  work. Yet, $1.7 billion has been cut from those needs of people who  have experienced heinous and horrific natural disasters and still need  the repairs that are necessary.   Of course, every child knows that climate change is real. So in this  Nation--the innovative, important leader of the world--we are slashing  the dollars for climate research.   We are not aware as well, I guess, in this administration, that  terrorism is on the rise, domestic terrorism in particular. But we must  also be vigilant for the terrorism that brought down the Twin Towers on  9/11. Yet, those dollars are being cut from FEMA, $746.9 million.   Then, let me say, as I close, that we are also saying to those who  are unhoused, the homeless, those who seek better housing, that they,  too, can't get housing. Affordable housing for the homeless and others  is now waning.   Mr. Speaker, I ask to defeat this budget, as we will.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, there are always special moments in  this House, particularly when something draws the support of Members  from both sides of the aisle. I have been supporting this legislation  for a long time, and that is H.R. 1980, the Smithsonian Women's History  Museum Act carried by my colleague Representative Carolyn Maloney and  so many cosponsors who evidenced the importance of the history of women  in this Nation.   This is the 100th year of women's right to vote, and I am reminded of  the suffragettes who decided to take a chance and be courageous and to  fight against the denial of women's right to vote.   Early in the 1800s, we know that women of color stood up, like  Sojourner Truth, and said, ``Ain't I a woman?'' to demand the right to  vote; she was a suffragette and an abolitionist fighting for freedom  and justice.   Now, this particular museum will open our eyes to the extensive  history of women, starting from the Revolutionary War that fought for  this country, stood for this country, and helped build this country.   I am excited about being part of the support and history of the  Smithsonian Women's History Museum Act. I look forward to its doors  opening for women to be acknowledged and recognized in the greatness of  this country.                            ____________________
