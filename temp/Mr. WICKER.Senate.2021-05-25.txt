 Madam President, I would like to be recognized for a  moment before we proceed.   This is an important step in the consideration of the Endless  Frontier Act. We have just locked in six votes for this afternoon--two  important side by sides, Wyden and Crapo on Finance Committee matters;  a Paul amendment on the National Institutes of Health funds being used  in China; an Ernst amendment on the Wuhan lab; a Daines amendment on  intellectual property in China; and the Lee amendment on stem cell  research.   This is a great step forward; that the Senate is proceeding this  afternoon to regular order, and regular order allowing Senators to come  forward and offer amendments that might improve the bill is helpful. It  is hoped that we can do that again tomorrow and Thursday and move  toward an opportunity to pass this bill.   I would point out to my colleagues--and I know the distinguished  chair of the Finance Committee will agree with this. We have locked in  six 15-minute votes. In fairness, really, the five subsequent votes  should be 10-minute votes. We can fool around and wander in here for  hours and be here until 8 or we can begin at 4:45 and resume the  practice that we had for years before we quit doing regular order in  this body.   If Members will hold each other accountable and if the Chair is  willing to say after a certain amount of time, if a straggler is  missing, that that Senator simply has missed votes, then we can do this  in an orderly fashion. I have an appointment at 5:30 that I have had to  cancel. Perhaps others will have to do that too.   But we are making progress on a very substantive bill about the  future of this country and moving toward competing in a better way with  China. And I would suggest that maybe appointments in the early  afternoon might be canceled, and we can get back to quick votes and be  considerate of others, realizing that some of us may miss votes if we  are late. I make that suggestion, and I thank my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle for the hard work in locking in these six votes.   I yield back.                            ____________________     I ask for the yeas and nays.
