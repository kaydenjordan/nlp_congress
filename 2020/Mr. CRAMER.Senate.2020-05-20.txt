 Mr. President, I want to honor the half century of  distinguished Federal service of a remarkable North Dakota man who is  retiring at the end of May.   Myron Lepp has been the administrative program director for the North  Dakota office of USDA Rural Development for the past 13 years. He took  this position after 37 years in the military, retiring as a full  colonel. In these 50 years of service, Myron has brought knowledge,  intelligence and dedication to everything he has undertaken.   He began his military service in 1971 and became a commissioned  officer in 1976. Myron served in the North Dakota National Guard as  director of information management for 12 years and later held other  positions such as chief of staff for the adjutant general, State  director of maintenance, and joint forces logistics director. In his  final 2 years in the military, he was the national command logistics  inspector for the National Guard Readiness Center in Washington, DC,  traveling every other week to conduct combat readiness inspections at  all State Army National Guard units   Myron brought this invaluable background to the USDA Rural  Development office, giving exemplary guidance to the crucial work this  agency does to support our rural communities in North Dakota. His  lifelong background in farming and ranching enhanced this work. Myron  has raised crops such as wheat, oats, and corn, and he has a cow/calf  operation near his hometown of Lehr.   I came to appreciate Myron's dedication and professional expertise  when we worked together on North Dakota's Roughrider Honor Flight  program. As president of this program, Myron oversaw the work of many  dedicated  [[Page S2548]]  volunteers who organized five flights for 500 veterans to visit the  National World War II Memorial in Washington, DC.   The profound impact Myron Lepp has made over these 50 years to  enhance the military and agricultural strength of North Dakota will  never be adequately measured. We can only thank him for this service,  which I want to do here on behalf of all North Dakotans. I congratulate  him on his well-earned retirement and wish him many years of health and  happiness in the future.                            ____________________
