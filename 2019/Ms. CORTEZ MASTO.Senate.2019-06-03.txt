 Mr. President, today I rise to recognize a  true Nevada public servant, State Senator Joyce Woodhouse. For over 50  years, Senator Woodhouse has been an education champion who has  dedicated her life to ensuring that every child in Nevada has an  opportunity to succeed. Senator Woodhouse will complete her final  session of the Nevada Legislature on June 3, 2019, and her last term as  senator at the end of next year.   Senator Joyce Woodhouse came to Las Vegas in 1966 for her first  teaching position after graduating from Carroll College in her home  State of Montana. She has dedicated her life and career to serving the  children of Nevada since then. She was an elementary school teacher and  principal at JM Ullom Elementary School before joining and eventually  leading the Clark County School District's School Community Partnership  Program. During her tenure, she sought to bring local businesses  together in strategic partnerships to support Nevada's schools.   Senator Woodhouse was first elected to the Nevada Legislature in  2006. She has served the State in that capacity for nearly 12 years.  She has led critical deliberations regarding the funding needs of the  State as past chair of the Senate Education Committee and as current  chair of the Senate Finance Committee. Her experience as a teacher and  school administrator has given her a deep understanding of the needs of  students, teachers, and parents, and that connection has inspired her  throughout her career in public service.   Senator Woodhouse has been a fierce advocate for hard-working  Nevadans in the State Senate. She helped broker compromises to secure  as many resources as possible on behalf of students. She has fought for  the health and well-being of our senior citizens, as well as the  dignity and respect of our working families. Most recently, she was the  lead advocate for ensuring all Nevadans have access to paid leave.   In addition to her commitment to our students, our schools, and all  Nevadans as State senator, Senator Woodhouse has been a dedicated  volunteer in our community. Before serving as a public servant, she was  a vocal advocate for educators and the children  [[Page S3159]]  they teach as president of the Nevada State Education Association. She  continued to lend her voice in many roles throughout the years,  including treasurer and board member for Kids Voting Southern Nevada,  and cochair of the Southern Nevada Science Education Consortium. While  Senator Woodhouse closes this chapter of her career in public service,  I have no doubt that she will continue to serve the people of Nevada  for years to come.   I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing and thanking Senator  Woodhouse's lifelong commitment to public education.   Thank you, Senator Woodhouse, for all that you have done for our  children, our schools, and the future of the great State of  Nevada.                            ____________________
