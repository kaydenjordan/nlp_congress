 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for her excellent  leadership. I thank Mr. Roy for his great bipartisan work and my dear  friend, colleague, and fellow problem solver, Dean Phillips, for his  remarkable leadership on this important piece of legislation. He did it  the way he believes we all should govern, and that is working across  the aisle. I am grateful for what he did on the Paycheck Protection  Flexibility Act, which was supported by the Problem Solvers Caucus, 50  strong--25 Democrats and 25 Republicans.  [[Page H2337]]    Mr. Speaker, I have heard over and over again from businesses in my  community in northern New Jersey that they are so grateful for the PPP  Loan Forgiveness Program and all of the jobs and businesses it helps  protect. But they need more flexibility with the formula and timeframe.  They need more time with the loan and more flexibility on how to spend  it, from salaries to rent.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud that this bipartisan legislation does exactly  that: helps the 131,000 small businesses in New Jersey that have been  helped by the PPP Loan Forgiveness Program.   And I am equally grateful for the bipartisan TRUTH Act, which demands  more transparency and accountability for every single dollar that is  loaned out from the Small Business Administration to our businesses. I  am glad that that legislation will pass here later today and that we  will know where all the loans have gone.   Mr. Speaker, New Jersey's economy, including all of our small  businesses, want to make sure their businesses can stay open at the end  of this pandemic. They want to keep their workers. They want to keep  giving back to our communities. They want to grow their businesses and  give back to our great State. But they need our help. This bill does  that, and I am hoping the Senate acts quickly to take it up.
