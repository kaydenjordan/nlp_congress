 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address America's immigration  crisis.   For 29 months, encounters with illegal immigrants have been higher  than the highest month in the Trump years.   While Washington Democrats continue to ignore the crisis, House  Republicans continue to do everything we can in our power to enforce  them.   Earlier this year, we passed H.R. 2, also known as the Secure the  Border  [[Page H4419]]  Act. This bill helps finish the border wall, stops the Biden  administration's open-border policies, and increases Border Patrol  staffing.   This legislation awaits consideration in a Democratic-controlled  Senate. It cannot wait any longer.   It is time for the Senate to take action. We cannot allow the Biden  administration to dismantle the border wall. We cannot allow Secretary  Mayorkas to circumvent or dismantle the successful remain in Mexico  policy. We cannot continue to allow illegal immigrants to stream across  our border illegally without regard for our national security.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to come together and  support a commonsense plan like H.R. 2 to stem the humanitarian crisis  on our southern border.                            ____________________
