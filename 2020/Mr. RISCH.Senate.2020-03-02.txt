 Mr. President, as a member and former chairman of  the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each month  I recognize and celebrate the American entrepreneurial spirit by  highlighting the success of a small business in my home State of Idaho.  Today I am pleased to honor The Gathering Place located in Bonners  Ferry as the Idaho Small Business of the Month for March 2020.   In 2006, Norv and Sharon Skrivseth founded Sharon's Country Store as  a side business in the basement of their home. The store was an  immediate success, and it soon burgeoned into a thriving storefront  providing local jobs and opportunities to the Bonners Ferry community.  Eventually, Sharon's Country Store expanded to include the Bread Basket  Bakery in 2014 and the 3-Mile Produce Stand in 2016. As the business  grew, friends and customers started referring to the stores as ``The  Gathering Place,'' and the Skrivseths happily embraced the new title.   Today, The Gathering Place continues to be run Norv, Sharon, and  their six children. With the motto ``Come, Sit, and Stay Awhile,'' the  businesses continues to attract locals and travelers alike with its  wide array of homemade products, fresh food, and produce. The  Skrivseths' warm hospitality and a commitment to service translates not  only into a superior experience for their customers, but also into  strong community engagement. Norv and Sharon are considered pillars in  the Bonners Ferry community, often donating to various charitable  causes and school events throughout the area. Success stories like that  of The Gathering Place demonstrate why Idaho is consistently ranked one  of the best places in the country to do business.   Congratulations to Norv, Sharon, and all of the employees of The  Gathering Place on being selected as the Idaho Small Business of the  Month for March 2020. You make our great State proud, and I look  forward to your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
