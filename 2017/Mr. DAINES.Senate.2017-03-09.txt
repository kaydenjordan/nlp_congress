 Mr. President, this week, I have the distinct  honor of recognizing Lyle Burgess of Ryegate. Lyle has been a  dependable leader for the people of Golden Valley County for over a  generation. He has contributed to the community in the fields of  education and emergency services. Golden Valley County is located in  the middle of Montana, and Lyle has been in the middle of events in the  county for many years.   After graduating from Eastern Montana College, now known as Montana  State University-Billings, Lyle began a 30-year career as a school  teacher at Ryegate High School. A few years after he started teaching,  Lyle began serving as a first responder with the Golden Valley County  Emergency Medical Services. Although he is now retired from teaching,  Lyle continues to serve his community: he went on to become the  director of EMS. Today he still serves in that role. As director, Lyle  is responsible for training new first responders and getting them ready  to be Emergency Medical Technicians. The familiar saying ``once a  teacher, always a teacher'' rings true for Mr. Burgess. Golden Valley  County Sheriff Robert Pallas referred to Lyle and his colleague at EMS,  Mary Ann Schladweiler, as the ``staples'' of the program.   Golden Valley County is home to just about 800 residents. The rural  setting magnifies the necessity of having great folks like Lyle and  Mary Ann offer their time and talent in the service of others. Montana  is a State blessed with many treasures, and the greatest treasure of  all is the people. Thank you, Lyle, for going above and beyond in the  community and teaching others by your example.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the Litigation Relief for Forest Management Projects Act be printed in  the Record.
