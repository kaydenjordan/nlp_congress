 Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 178 and ask  unanimous consent that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, I come to the floor to ask that my  colleagues support this very important amendment with Senator Sanders.  I will match his passion with numbers.   The price of insulin, as our colleagues know, has tripled in the last  decade. The antibiotic doxycycline went from $20 a bottle to nearly  $2,000 a bottle in 6 months. Naloxone, the drug used to help with  overdose, went from $690 to $4,500 to date. We cannot sit here and do  nothing. We have an opportunity, for those who believe in the free  market, to allow in competition--competition from the safe country of  Canada, our neighbors to the north. In Minnesota, we can see Canada  from our porch, and we want to see that competition come in and save  our constituents' lives.    Madam Clerk, how am I recorded?    Because there is no plan in the alternative, I vote  no.
