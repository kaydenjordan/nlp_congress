 Mr. Speaker, I proudly rise today to recognize and honor  firefighters from my district in Davie County, North Carolina, who  battled an early morning fire caused by a lightning strike earlier this  week. Thanks to their efforts and heroism, Mr. Speaker, a church  building was spared.   Around 3:30 a.m. this Tuesday, Davie County firefighters responded to  a fire at Smith Grove United Methodist Church along U.S. Highway 158 in  Mocksville. When the firefighters arrived on the scene, flames were  bursting out of the roof and immediate action was needed to stop the  flames, according to Smith Grove Fire Chief Don Howard.   Even though the lightning strike caused the steeple to fall off the  roof of the church, the firefighters pressed on to fight the flames and  save the majority of the building.   I am grateful for the service of these men and women, many of whom  are volunteers, who every day put themselves in danger to keep our  families and our communities safe.   Mr. Speaker, I would also like to recognize the departments that  responded, which included Smith Grove, Farmington, Cornatzer-Dulin,  Mocksville, the Cooleemee Fire Departments; Davie EMS; Davie County  Fire Marshal's Office; and the Davie County Sheriff's Office.   I thank these heroes and others like them in our country.                            ____________________
