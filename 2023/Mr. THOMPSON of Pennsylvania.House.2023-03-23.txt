 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate  National Agriculture Week, which kicked off March 21, also known as  National Ag Day.   For 50 years, this week has marked a time to honor American farm  families and the essential and often unsung role that agriculture plays  in all our lives.   The safe and abundant food and fiber supply that Americans rely on on  a daily basis comes from hardworking farming communities across this  country.   With rising input costs, market uncertainty, increasing regulations,  and global supply chain disruptions, producers are facing increased  hardship.   Only 2 percent of Americans are employed in the agriculture sector,  yet they successfully feed our entire Nation and the world, despite the  odds being stacked against them.   During this week of education and appreciation, I want to emphasize  rural America, or what I like to call essential America, as the  backbone of our Nation.   Mr. Speaker, this year, we are reauthorizing the farm bill.   This farm bill will put producers first and aims to revitalize rural  America by restoring the farm safety net, expanding market access, and  much more.   National Agriculture Week is the perfect opportunity to highlight the  hardworking Americans who have dedicated their lives to providing a  safe and abundant food supply.   I honor their contributions to society and commend farmers and  ranchers who add so much to our national culture.   Mr. Speaker, this is a week where I call on everyone to celebrate  National Agriculture Week.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong  support of the Parents Bill of Rights Act. This legislation is just one  of many promises we intend to keep in our ``Commitment to America.''   As a recovering school board member, I know firsthand the importance  of hearing from parents and encouraging them to be engaged in their  child's education.   The Parents Bill of Rights Act provides parents an expanded  opportunity to engage with their children and the teachers who educate  them. This bill implements clear, commonsense protections allowing  parents to easily review curriculum information, academic standards,  and see how schools are spending our tax dollars.   Parents deserve the right to be heard and should be able to raise  concerns and address their school board without fear of harassment or  retribution.   This bill includes simple protections to keep our children safe, from  protecting their privacy to requiring parents to be notified of violent  activity in the school.   As a graduate of the public school system and having raised three  sons in the very same school district, I know parental involvement is  critical to fostering a successful educational environment.   Mr. Chair, quite simply, this bill is common sense. I urge my  colleagues to support this legislation that ensures parents are at the  center of their child's educational experience.
