 Madam Speaker, no amount of warnings from the Biden  administration and our intelligence could have prepared us for the  sheer brutality and devastation we have seen from Mr. Putin, who  expected a quick toppling of Ukraine's young democracy. He was wrong.   We have watched in awe the resilience and heroism of the Ukrainians  led by President Zelensky. But their bravery alone is not enough. We  must meet their bravery with global support.   This is a war and a humanitarian crisis--families, children, forced  to leave their homes in the carnage of war. The number of refugees  fleeing Ukraine has already exceeded 1 million, and it is estimated  that it will go as high as 5 million. But death, destruction, and  displacement must not be forever.   Madam Speaker, I thank President Biden and his administration for  their steadfast leadership in the West's support of Ukraine. Alongside  the President, this Congress must continue to provide necessary  weapons, medicines, food, fuel, and refuge.   Ukrainians worldwide, please know: We are here for you. You are  welcome here.   God bless America. God bless Ukraine.                            ____________________
