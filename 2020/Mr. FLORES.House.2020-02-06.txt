 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 175th  anniversary of Baylor University.   Baylor University, a private Christian university, was chartered by  the Republic of Texas on February 1, 1845.   The charter, signed by Republic of Texas President, Anson Jones, was  supported by the efforts of Baptist pioneers who sought to establish a  Christian university ``fully susceptible of enlargement and development  to meet the needs of all ages to come.''   Originally located in Independence, Texas, Baylor is the oldest,  continually operating university in Texas, and was actually formed  before Texas became a State.   In 1886, Baylor moved its main campus to Waco, Texas, where it  remains today, and combined with Waco University. The new flagship  campus of over 1,000 acres along the banks of the Brazos River enabled  the university to flourish in its new central Texas home.   Today, Baylor continues to uphold their mission to educate men and  women for worldwide leadership and service by integrating academic  excellence and Christian commitment within a caring community.   Baylor's diverse student body is comprised of over 18,000 students  from all 50 States and from over 90 countries. Both undergraduate and  graduate students are propelled toward success by passionate and  committed faculty and staff who recognize a calling to address  society's greatest challenges.   A nationally ranked and distinctly Christian research university,  Baylor is on an ambitious path to become the ninth Research 1, or R1,  university in Texas, and the world's preeminent Christian research  university.   As Baylor strives to attain the coveted R1 status, it is continually  engaging in research at the highest levels as students work to fight  disease, investigate environmental challenges, pioneer new  technologies, and advance human flourishing.   This university-wide commitment to excellence is evident through  classroom teaching and a communal drive toward success. Faculty provide  impactful services to Baylor students and support them academically,  spiritually, personally, and in their future careers.                                time  2145    Baylor strives to enable each student to achieve at the highest  levels of human performance in academics, arts, and athletics,  preparing them for worldwide leadership and service.   Mr. Speaker, in recognition of the recent 175th anniversary of Baylor  University in Waco, Texas, I applaud the university's ongoing  commitment to Christian values and academic excellence.   I have requested that a United States flag be flown over our Nation's  Capitol to honor the 175 years of legacy and impact of Baylor  University.   As I close today, I urge all Americans to continue praying for our  country, for our military men and women who protect us, and for our  first responders who keep us safe at home.                            Recognizing Ben Downs     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ben Downs of  Bryan, Texas, as a 2019 inductee into the Texas Radio Hall of Fame.   Ben's radio career began as a childhood fascination. Growing up in  Hope, Arkansas, Ben dreamed of hearing his own voice over the radio. As  a child, he recalls sitting up in the Hope Field House, pretending to  give play-by-plays into an empty soda can.   His dream came true on November 4, 1968, when, at the age of 14, Ben  went on the air for the first time. Looking back, Ben says he  ``wouldn't let a 14-year-old run my station, but fortunately for me,  the manager at that radio station did.''   By the time he went away to college at Texas A&M University in  College Station, Texas, Ben was a seasoned pro. After 4 years at the  station in  [[Page H932]]  Hope, Ben decided to focus on his studies and enjoy the radio solely as  a listener. This didn't last long, as he quickly found himself  accepting a job offer from the local station in Bryan-College Station.  That was in 1972, and he has been broadcasting ever since.   It was at Texas A&M University that Ben and I first met during the  fall of 1972 as students in our management 105 class. We are both proud  members of the centennial class of 1976, and he and I remain close  friends today.   Since 1989, Ben has led Bryan Broadcasting. Under his leadership, the  group has expanded significantly into a variety of genres and formats.  He has worked hard to ensure that Bryan Broadcasting is always at the  forefront of technology and constantly offering its listeners new and  exciting content.   The rise of the internet and streaming service has provided WTAW and  Bryan Broadcasting with a platform for a wide array of programs and on- demand podcasts while still promoting the traditional radio broadcast  medium.   Ben remains involved in the broadcasting community through the Texas  Association of Broadcasters and the National Association of  Broadcasters. He also consults regularly with Members of Congress and  the Federal Communications Commission to address important issues to  the broadcasting community. One issue that he is particularly  passionate about is revitalization of AM radio.   Outside of his work in the broadcasting industry, Ben has lived a  life committed to service. During his time at Texas A&M University, Ben  acquired a reputation for community service, which continues today. He  has said that he is proud to be a part of a community that takes giving  to heart. In 2018, Ben was named Citizen of the Year by the Bryan- College Station Chamber of Commerce.   It was Ben's philanthropic spirit which led him to meet his wife,  Lillian, 44 years ago as he was working on a tennis tournament to  benefit the local Boys and Girls Club. Today, Ben and Lillie have two  adult children and three beautiful grandchildren.   Mr. Speaker, I am humbled to honor the many accomplishments of my  friend, Ben Downs, for his induction to the Texas Radio Hall of Fame,  as well as his nomination for the Marconi Radio Award and the legendary  Manager of the Year Award, both from the National Association of  Broadcasters.   For decades, Ben's career has been dedicated to the passion he found  as a child, broadcasting, while continuing to push the industry to take  advantage of ever-advancing technology. His accomplishments and his  service-centric spirit are more than deserving of this amazing honor.  He is a faithful community leader, selfless servant, husband, father,  grandfather, and friend.   I have requested that a United States flag be flown over our Nation's  Capitol to honor Ben's meaningful accomplishments and contributions to  the broadcasting industry and to our Brazos Valley community.   As I close, I ask all our viewers to continue praying for our  country, for our military men and women who protect us, and for our  first responders who keep us safe at home.                     Honoring the Life of George Aguilar     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of George  Aguilar of Bryan, Texas, who passed away on January 13, 2020, after a  battle with cancer.   George was born on January 12, 1958, in San Antonio to Policarpio and  Delores Aguilar.   Growing up in a military family, George traveled a great deal across  the United States and Germany. He graduated from Killeen High School in  Killeen, Texas, and went on to attend Central Texas College, where he  studied criminal justice.   From a young age, George lived a life of service and was dedicated to  giving back to his community. Following graduation, he served as a  jailer in Killeen and then as a corrections officer in Huntsville,  which led him to find his dream job as a police officer. In 1980,  George joined the Bryan Police Department as a patrol officer.   Over the next three decades, George served in many roles within the  department. As part of his commitment to the Bryan community, he served  on patrol, as a detective, as a school resource officer, and as a  canine handler. He was instrumental in starting important programs,  such as Camp PAL, which operated from 1994 to 2005. He was awarded six  commendations throughout his career and eventually earned a master  peace officer's license.    After 34\1/2\ years on the force, George retired from the Bryan  Police Department in 2015. However, his dedication to a life of service  did not end there. Following his retirement, George went on to work as  a bailiff for the Brazos County Associate Courts.   George is remembered for his great sense of humor, his love of dance,  and his bright, smiling face that brought joy to all of those around  him.   As a lifelong Dallas Cowboys fan, he attended as many games as he  could, always cherishing the Cowboys v. Packers games he would attend  with his son.   Mr. Speaker, George's life was defined by his service to his  community. He will forever be remembered as a father, a brother, a  fiance, and a selfless servant.   My wife, Gina, and I offer our heartfelt condolence to the Aguilar  family. We also lift up the family and friends of George Aguilar in our  prayers.   As I close today, I urge all Americans to continue praying for our  country, for our first responders who protect us at home, and for our  uniformed military service personnel who protect us around the world.                       Honoring Dr. Stephen A. Holditch     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Stephen A.  Holditch of College Station, Texas, who passed away unexpectedly on  August 9, 2019.   Before I continue our discussion about Steve, I want to give some  context about the importance of his professional career. Let me state  first that Steve considered his roles as a husband, father, and  grandfather to be his most important. Because of the exceptional way he  lived those roles, his legacy is readily apparent in the lives of those  he left behind--his wife, Ann; his daughters, Katie and Abbie, and  their five grandchildren.   The discussion of his professional accomplishments starts with a  description of current energy metrics. Today, the United States of  America is blessed to be the number one producer of oil and natural gas  in the world, and as of this year, we are a net exporter of oil and  gas. Reserves of American oil and gas rank us among the top 10  countries in the world. We also lead the industrialized world in the  reduction of carbon dioxide emissions over the past few decades. Ten  years ago, no one would have ever predicted we would be where we are  today.   This new world of American energy dominance is having dramatic  implications, both domestically and internationally. We have secure,  stable, environmentally responsible, and attractively priced energy  resources for American families and businesses. We have become a  reliable source of energy for our allies, giving them the flexibility  to move away from unstable Russian and Middle Eastern suppliers. The  oil and gas sector of our economy has created millions of good jobs and  great paychecks for hardworking Americans. Our balance of trade  payments has improved, and our geopolitical position has strengthened.   This dramatic energy renaissance didn't happen by accident or by  government. It is the result of American ingenuity, research, and bold  leadership. While no one person is solely responsible for the seismic  shift in American energy, there are a number of bold leaders who took  challenges that looked impossible to solve and solved them,  particularly in the area of stimulation of low permeability, or tight,  reservoirs. Their developments, studies, research, and field  experiments using horizontal drilling and very large hydraulic  fracturing treatments revolutionized American oil and natural gas and  transformed our economy and our security.   One of those bold leaders was the late George P. Mitchell, Texas A&M  class of 1940. Another is the person we are honoring today, Dr. Stephen  A. Holditch, Texas A&M class of 1969.   Stephen Holditch was born on October 20, 1946, in Corsicana, Texas,  to Damon and Margie Holditch. Growing up, Steve and his family moved  often while his father pursued a career in the oil and gas industry. He  spent most of his childhood in San Antonio before moving to Richardson,  Texas, for his final year of high school, where he graduated in 1965.  [[Page H933]]    Following graduation, Steve attended Texas A&M University, where he  joined the Corps of Cadets and began his journey as a Fightin' Texas  Aggie. Steve quickly excelled both in academics and the corps. While at  A&M, he was a member of Company F-1, a member of the prestigious Ross  Volunteers Honor Guard, and a member of the Ross Volunteers Firing  Squad. During his senior year, he served as second battalion commander.  In 1969, Steve graduated from Texas A&M University with a bachelor of  science degree in petroleum engineering. He continued at A&M to earn a  master's degree in the same discipline.   Steve began his career with Shell Oil Company in Houston, Texas. Much  of his work over his 5 years with Shell focused on designing and  pumping large hydraulic fracture treatments to stimulate production  from the deep, low permeability geopressured gas reservoirs in south  Texas. It was his work with hydraulic fracturing that inspired him to  return to Texas A&M and set him apart from his peers as a true legend  of the oil and gas industry for the advancement of this critically  important technology.   One day in 1970, Steve was riding the elevator at work and met Ann  Friddle, who was also working at Shell. Steve and Ann were married 6  months later on January 9, 1971, and they had been married over 48  years when Steve passed away.   He and Ann returned to College Station, and he pursued a Ph.D. in  petroleum engineering, which he completed in 1975. In 1976, Steve  joined the Texas A&M petroleum engineering faculty, and as if he didn't  have enough to do as a young father and new professor, he started his  own consulting company, S.A. Holditch & Associates.   S.A. Holditch & Associates quickly became a worldwide powerhouse in  the petroleum engineering space. Over the years, Steve earned a  reputation for being able to solve the most difficult petroleum  engineering problems, especially those dealing with low permeability  reservoirs needing stimulation, typically through hydraulic fracturing.  He was distinctly proud of the work that Holditch & Associates did  alongside the Gas Research Institute to advance understanding of low  permeability sandstones, shales, and coalbed methane.    After over 20 years of success, Steve chose to sell Holditch &  Associates to Schlumberger, where he stayed on as a fellow, the highest  technical designation in that organization. As a Schlumberger Fellow  for 5 years, Steve traveled extensively to help solve some of the  world's most difficult petroleum engineering problems.   In 1995, at the age of 49, Steve was elected to the National Academy  of Engineering, the highest honor that can be given to an engineer.  After many years of service to the Society of Petroleum Engineers, or  SPE, Steve was elected to the board of directors, then vice president  of finance, and finally president of this global organization with over  70,000 members.   He was awarded almost every recognition that SPE has to give,  including three of the society's top technical awards. He was elected  an SPE honorary member in 2006, the highest award that SPE can bestow  upon an individual, and was officially named a Legend of Hydraulic  Fracturing by SPE in 2014.   While Steven enjoyed many professional successes in the commercial  regime, many of his accomplishments were at Texas A&M University, where  he served on the faculty for 37 years. During his tenure, he taught 97  classes and served on over 150 graduate committees. From 2004 to 2012,  Steve worked as head of the Harold Vance Department of Petroleum  Engineering.   During this time, he revitalized the Crisman Institute of Petroleum  Research and saw the number of students in the petroleum engineering  department more than double. Under his leadership, the department  quickly earned a reputation as the number one ranked university  petroleum engineering department in the world.   It was during his time at A&M that he created this second legacy for  America's hydrocarbon industry, the thousands of Aggie petroleum  engineers who work around the world every day utilizing Steve's  teaching and mentoring to solve the world's greatest energy challenges.  Collectively, these pacesetters--George P. Mitchell, Michel T.  Halbouty, and Dr. Stephen A. Holditch, and ones they taught and  guided--have contributed significantly to America's energy dominance  that is changing the world today.   In 2013, Steve retired from the faculty after many years of dedicated  service to the Texas A&M community. Throughout his life, Steve often  credited Texas A&M University as the foundation from which his success  grew. He praised the values instilled in all Aggies, and in 2014, he  was named a Texas A&M Distinguished Alumnus, an honor he richly  deserved for a life of service and devotion to his beloved university.  In thanking the Aggie community, Steve said: ``You will look back at  your years at Texas A&M as one of the best periods of your life. Always  remember the Aggie Code of Honor.''   In 2016, Steve was inducted in the Corps of Cadets Hall of Honor, an  award which made him prouder and happier than perhaps any other award  he had ever received.   Following retirement, Steve enjoyed spending time in Bryan/College  Station, with his wife Ann, their two daughters, and their five  grandchildren. As a season ticket holder to a variety of Texas A&M  sports, Steve continued to support the Aggies, but Fightin' Texas Aggie  Football remained closest to his heart. Steve contributed a great deal  to the Texas A&M community and can be described as a model Texas Aggie,  who was true to its core values of Excellence, Integrity, Leadership,  Loyalty, Respect, and Selfless Service. One of my favorite phrases that  Steve often used was ``I reserve the right to get smarter.'' That is  what he did best, always pushing to find solutions to the world's  toughest oil and gas challenges.   Mr. Speaker, Steve's life was defined by his dedication to his family  and friends, his world-changing accomplishments in energy, and his true  love of Texas A&M University. He will be forever remembered as a true  pioneer in his field, a devoted husband, father, grandfather, teacher,  mentor and friend. My father has a saying--``go make a hand.'' Mr.  Speaker, Steve Holditch truly ``made a hand'' for his family, his  university, his community, our country, and the world.   My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to  the Holditch family. We also lift his family and friends in our  prayers.   I have requested that a United States flag be flown over our Nation's  Capitol to honor the life and legacy of Dr. Stephen A. Holditch.   As I close today, I urge all Americans to continue praying for our  country, for our veterans, for our military men and women who protect  us, and for our first responders who keep us safe at home.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 10 o'clock and 1 minute  p.m.), the House adjourned until tomorrow, Friday, February 7, 2020, at  9 a.m.                            ____________________
