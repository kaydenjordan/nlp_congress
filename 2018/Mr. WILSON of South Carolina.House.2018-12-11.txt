 Mr. Speaker, an extraordinary tribute  for President George H.W. Bush was published by Krishnadev Calamur in  The Atlantic: ``Had George Herbert Walker Bush never become the 41st  President of the United States, he would still be remembered as one of  the great Americans of the 20th century. . . .   ``But it was his one-term presidency, from 1989 to 1993, that had a  monumental impact on the world. Ronald Reagan, his predecessor, uttered  the famous words: `Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall,' yet it was Bush  who presided over its orderly dismantling.   ``Bush oversaw the collapse of the Soviet Union, the end of the Cold  War, the birth of the post-Soviet republics, and the West's outreach to  former members of the Warsaw Pact.''   In my service in Congress, I have seen firsthand the expansion of  freedom and democracy. Today the largest number of nations in world  history are free and democratic, from Bulgaria to Lithuania, inspired  by President George H.W. Bush.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
