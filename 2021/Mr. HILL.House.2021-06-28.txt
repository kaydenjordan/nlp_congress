 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from west Texas for  this important bill.   Mr. Speaker, recently, I created the Congressional Task Force on  American Hostages and Americans Wrongfully Detained Abroad with my  colleague, our good friend, Ted Deutch from Florida. I thank  Representative Pfluger for being one of the first Members to join that  task force.   Mr. Speaker, that is why I come and rise in support of my friend,  Representative Pfluger's resolution. This resolution calls for the  release of Trevor Reed of Texas; and expresses support for Paul Whelan  of Michigan, another American unjustly imprisoned in Russia.    From this debate, we have heard and learned some of the details of  Trevor's arrest, sham trial, and absurd sentencing for his alleged  crimes. All channels of the United States Government must engage with  friends and enemies alike to ensure that Americans in situations like  Trevor and Paul are brought home expeditiously.   This is especially the case for Members of Congress who represent the  concerned families of those held hostage or wrongfully detained. Here  in Congress, we must continue to collaborate with the administration in  situations like these to disincentivize wrongful detention and taking  hostage of Americans in the future.   Let this be a message to Trevor and Paul and their families: We are  committed to bringing you back to the United States safely.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the full committee for his  support of this effort and work. I also thank my friend from west  Texas. I urge all my colleagues to support this resolution.
