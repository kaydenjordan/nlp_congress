 Madam Speaker, after advocating for USMCA this past  year, I am excited to vote for it today.   Not only will this deal expand trade with Mexico and Canada, but it  is going to help us build momentum for deals with other nations, like  China, Vietnam, and so forth. It is going to be great for our country.   One quick example of how this helps the American people, particularly  farm families: Over the summer, Farmers for Free Trade rallied in our  southern Minnesota district for USMCA. We were at the Hoffman Dairy  Farm, about 15 miles south of New Ulm. The Hoffmans are sixth- generation dairy farms. They said that it has been 5 or 6 years of  tough commodity prices--low prices, high input cost. They needed a win.   Our market for dairy has been shut out of Canada, virtually, with 300  percent tariffs. USMCA is going to knock down those tariffs, allow more  exports, create more demand, help families like the Hoffmans, and help  our country. I urge everyone to vote for the agreement.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        December 19, 2019, on page H12263, ``*ERR08*'' inadvertently  appeared at one place.

The USMCA is a long overdue, much needed and well-deserved bipartisan  win for the American people. The agreement is a win for our workers,  businesses, farmers and families in Minnesota's First District and  throughout the nation.   It will open new markets, expand economic opportunity and create new  high-wage jobs,  [[Page H12264]]  build momentum for trade deals with China and other nations, and help  protect and promote our rural way of life in southern Minnesota.   We are already seeing evidence of this momentum with the United  States and China announcing a ``Phase One'' trade agreement just days  after the bipartisan agreement on USMCA was reached.   I am personally hearing from the farmers back home that they are  relieved to finally have some market certainty after six years of low  commodity prices. Especially our dairy farmers, who for the first time  will have access to the Canadian market.   USMCA is also a boon to manufacturers who will continue to have duty- free access to Canada and Mexico, the industry's largest export  markets--creating tens of thousands of new jobs and adding nearly $70  billion to the U.S. economy as a whole.   I will vote ``yes'' on this agreement, I urge my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to do the same, and I hope the Senate will move  quickly to ratify the deal and send it to President Trump's desk so  that the agreement can be implemented as quickly as possible for the  American people.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        December 19, 2019, on page H12264, ``*ERR08*'' inadvertently  appeared at one place.
