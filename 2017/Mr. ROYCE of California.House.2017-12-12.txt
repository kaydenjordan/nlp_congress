 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  agree to the resolution (H. Res. 407) condemning the persecution of  Christians around the world, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 407         Whereas the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22       U.S.C. 6401 et seq.) found that religious persecution is not       confined to a particular region or regime and reaffirmed the       commitment of the United States that religious freedom, which       is the freedom of thought and conscience and the right to       practice theistic and non-theistic beliefs, is the right of       every individual and should never be arbitrarily abridged by       any government;        Whereas the persecution of Christians is a global problem,       occurring in countries across Asia, Africa, the Middle East,       and the Americas;        Whereas Christians face persecution not only from Islamic       extremist groups, like the Islamic State and Boko Haram, but       also from other religious extremist groups and from officials       at all levels of government;        Whereas the Middle East has been a home to Christians since       the first century A.D., but the Christian population in the       Middle East has significantly decreased over the past few       decades as a result of persecution, displacement, and       genocide;        Whereas such persecution ranges from social harassment and       discrimination to physical violence, imprisonment, torture,       enslavement, rape, and death;        Whereas Christians in Syria and Iraq have faced assault,       torture, imprisonment, enslavement, and execution in a       genocidal campaign by the Islamic State;        Whereas according to 2017 reports from international non-      governmental organizations, the Christian population in Iraq       decreased from 1,400,000 people in 2003 to just 275,000       people in 2016, as a result of displacement and genocide       caused by religious extremism;        Whereas Christian holy sites in Syria have been destroyed       by the Islamic State;        Whereas in 2016, approximately 200 Christians in Iran were       arrested, while others have been beaten, tortured, subjected       to feigned public executions, and even sentenced to death for       their faith, and at least 90 remain in illegal detention;        Whereas in Saudi Arabia, Christians as well as other       religious minorities face imprisonment, torture, and       deportation and must practice their faith in secrecy because       their houses of worship are not allowed;        Whereas on April 9, 2017, Palm Sunday, 44 people were       killed in bomb attacks by the Islamic State on Coptic       churches in Egypt;        Whereas the Islamic State has also claimed responsibility       for the attack on a bus on May 26, 2017, in which 29 Coptic       Christians were killed while traveling to a monastery in       Minya, Egypt;        Whereas since the fall of the Gaddafi regime, Libya has       served as a haven for militant Islamist extremist groups,       like the Islamic State, which has resulted in more violent       forms of Christian persecution;        Whereas the Islamic State claimed responsibility for the       killing of 51 Coptic Christians in Libya in February and       March of 2015;        Whereas Christian migrants from northern Africa traveling       through Libya on their way to Europe have been abducted,       trafficked, and forced to convert to Islam at the hands of       the Islamic State;        Whereas in Afghanistan there are reports that converts to       Christianity have been murdered or sent to mental hospitals;        Whereas Christians in Pakistan face accusations of       blasphemy, punishable by death, and convictions and sentences       for blasphemy are given despite little or no evidence;        Whereas according to Open Doors USA, approximately 600       Christian churches were attacked in Pakistan in 2016;        Whereas both Christians and Muslims in Nigeria have been       massacred by Islamic extremist groups like Boko Haram;        Whereas Christian converts in Somalia often face public       execution;        Whereas in 2017, a mob of 100 men attacked a Christian       church in Uganda, beating and raping members of the       congregation;        Whereas in May 2017, a Christian governor in Indonesia was       found guilty of blasphemy and sentenced to two years in       prison, in what was widely seen as a challenge to religious       pluralism in Indonesia;        Whereas communist regimes have a strong history of       oppressing and persecuting Christians as well as other       religious minorities;        Whereas since 2013, in the Zhejiang Province of China,       crosses have been removed from over 1,500 churches as part of       that province's anti-cross campaign;        Whereas in China, members of Christian churches, as well as       other religious minorities, that are not registered with the       government face increased persecution from the Chinese state,       including the risk of imprisonment and torture;        Whereas in North Korea, the practice of Christianity is       prohibited and if caught, Christians are sent to forced labor       camps;        Whereas in November 2016, Vietnam adopted a new ``Law on       Belief and Religion'' that falls dramatically short of       internationally accepted standards for human rights and       curtails the right to religious freedom for over 8,000,000       Christians in that country;        Whereas in Mexico and Colombia, Christian church leaders       have been assaulted, threatened, and in some cases killed by       transnational criminal organizations and paramilitary armed       groups attempting to intimidate and silence them;        Whereas religious discrimination, including the persecution       of Christians, is a global human rights problem; and        Whereas the right to religious freedom is a universal right       recognized by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: Now,       therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) condemns all violations of religious freedom and       affirms that religious freedom is a fundamental right of       every individual that should never be arbitrarily abridged by       any government;        (2) condemns the persecution of Christians around the       world;        (3) calls on discriminatory countries to cease their       persecution of Christians and religious minorities and combat       religious persecution carried out by extremist non-state       actors; and        (4) urges the President and the heads of the governments of       all countries around the world to uphold the right to       religious freedom and condemn the global persecution of       Christians and other religious minorities.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  [[Page H9822]]  California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each  will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material in the Record on this  measure.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material in the Record on this  measure.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me begin here by thanking the gentleman from  Wisconsin, Representative Glenn Grothman, for his work on this  resolution.   As many in our country are preparing to celebrate this season of  peace and joy, thousands of Christian believers around the world are  marking the holiday in a much more somber way. They are marking this  holiday under a threat of persecution and under a threat of violence.   Pope Francis has said: ``When we read the history of the first  centuries, we read of so much cruelty toward Christians. I tell you:  There is the same cruelty today, and to a greater extent.''   Those were his words.   According to research, Christians today are more targeted for attack  than any other body of believers.   While about 30 percent of the world's population identifies as  Christian, 80 percent of all reported acts of religious persecution  right now are directed at Christians. Open Doors charity reports that,  each month, around the world, 300 Christians are murdered--this would  be for their faith--and more than 200 churches and properties are  destroyed. This is each month.   Over 770 acts of violence are committed against Christians, including  beatings, abductions, rapes, arrests, and forced marriages.   For example, across the Middle East there are historic Christian  communities that are only one or two generations away from extinction.  These were the indigenous people to this region. In Iraq, there are now  fewer than 250,000 Christians remaining of a community that once had  more than 1.4 million believers.   Last Congress, the House took the lead in declaring the violence  against Christians committed by ISIS in Iraq and Syria as genocide.  Since then, Congress has pushed hard to make sure that these vulnerable  communities are protected and receive the assistance that they need.   I have visited these communities up in northern Iraq, and I can  attest to the amount of persecution that they have been through.   Of course, our brave men and women in uniform deserve our praise for  leading the fight to destroy ISIS, the so-called caliphate, allowing  for the safe return of Christians and other religious minorities in the  region.   We are blessed to live in this country free to enjoy our religious  festivals in peace and security. We must not turn a blind eye to the  atrocities happening elsewhere in the world.   With passage of this measure, we acknowledge the disturbing rise in  persecution of Christians around this globe and recommit our Nation to  support the religious freedom of all people.   We also call on other world leaders to end persecution of Christians  and other religious minorities that are also persecuted at the  national, local government, and community level. This includes  persecution, of course, by violent non-state actors like terrorist  groups Boko Haram and ISIS.   With this call to action, we work to advance our Nation's historic  goal to promote ``peace on Earth and goodwill toward men.''   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman), the author of this resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman), the author of this resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank Mr. Engel for his leadership in  bringing these issues to the floor and, certainly, our colleague, the  cosponsor of this resolution, Carolyn Maloney. I thank, again,  Congressman Glenn Grothman for authoring this important resolution  here.   Christians around the world are being assaulted, raped, tortured, and  murdered. Believers in North Korea, for example, have ``disappeared''  by the hundreds. They are hidden away in labor camps for decades. Many  of them are worked to death, as you know by the conditions in those  camps. The reason they are there is they attempted to practice their  faith: Christianity.   We know that, at the hands of ISIS, brutal atrocities have risen to  the level of genocide. Wherever ISIS goes, you see the consequence in  the terror that is visited upon Christians, Yazidis, Jews, and other  races.   In terms of the positioning that ISIS had in the Middle East, they  had ready access to the Christian communities. Having visited those  Christian communities in the aftermath of those attacks as they escaped  into the Kurdish regions, it was absolutely heart-wrenching to hear the  accounts of the survivors about what had happened among the Christians  and Yazidis.   These are just a few of the examples of the persecution against  Christians that is happening around the world.   I urge my colleagues to join me in this call to world leaders to work  to stop the global persecution of Christians.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House  Resolution 407 condemning the persecution of Christians around the  world, as amended.   I am proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with all those who have been  persecuted for their religious views and remain committed to fighting  with you as we embark on the journey of promoting freedom of  conscience, speech, association, religion, and all other freedoms that  are inalienable to all humankind.   As a Member of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, I continue to  work with my colleagues in a bipartisan manner in order to amplify the  important work of upholding religious freedom, facilitating human  dignity, and protecting human rights.   As a Member of Congress, one of our charges is to understand how to  improve religious freedom and diplomacy across the globe and here at  home.   A good measure for this congressional call of fostering religious  freedom and diplomacy is H. Res. 407 that calls on:   (1) discriminatory regimes to cease their persecution of not only  Christians but all religious minorities, and   (2) the President and heads of the governments of all democratic  countries to uphold the right to religious freedom and condemn the  persecution of Christians and minorities.   This resolution highlights the United States foreign policy  commitment to the protection and promotion of religious freedom across  the globe from Indonesia, to Pakistan to Nigeria to China to name a  few.   The persecution of religious minorities is a global problem,  occurring in countries across the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and the  Americas.   Christians, for example, face persecution not only from Islamic  extremist groups, like the Islamic State and Boko Haram, but also from  other religious extremist groups and from officials at all levels of  certain foreign government.   Such persecution of religious minorities ranges from social  harassment and discrimination to physical violence, imprisonment,  torture, enslavement, rape, and death.   Over 200 million Christians experience persecution across the globe,  the majority of those are found in the Middle East. But it is important  to note that Christianity is not a Western imposition on historically  Islamic countries in the Middle East.   The Middle East has been a home to Christians since the first century  A.D., but unfortunately the Christian population in the Middle East has  significantly decreased over the past few decades as a result of  persecution, displacement, and genocide.  [[Page H9824]]    Not only Christian lives, but also Christian holy sites have been  destroyed by the Islamic State.   And not only Christians, but anyone who opposed their ruthless war on  peace.   In many places, Christians must practice their faith in secrecy  because churches are not allowed, and makeshift churches in homes are  raided.   A loud example of this persecution is aimed at the Coptic Christians  in Egypt that have faced persecution for over 50 years, and on April 9,  2017, Palm Sunday, 44 people were killed in bomb attacks by the Islamic  State on Coptic churches.   The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack on a bus  on May 26, 2017, in which 29 Coptic Christians were killed while  traveling to a monastery in Minya, Egypt;   This important resolution describes numerous instances where  Christians have been attacked by terrorist groups, groups that hide  behind religion as a pretext to destroy minority groups and to  recklessly and harmfully seek power.   Religious minority persecution has been on the rise in Asia,  primarily due to religious nationalism.   Recently, in Bangladesh, hundreds of Christians are being forced off  their property, and legal action rarely results in the favor of a  Christian party.   In Burma/Myanmar, since late August 2017, more than 645 thousand  ethnic Rohingya have fled a campaign of ethnic cleansing by Burma's  security forces and sought asylum in Bangladesh.   The Rohingya massacre is another example of religious minority  persecution, overlooked and disregarded by a government that, as some  may surmise, values power over people.   Not surprisingly, Christians and other dissidents of the government  in North Korea are forced into harsh labor camps, where approximately  70,000 Christians are imprisoned in 2017.   All that is to say that religious discrimination is a global human  rights problem and the right to religious freedom is a universal right  recognized by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.   In the 114th Congress, I introduced and continue to support  legislation by my colleagues that seek to protect religious freedom and  democracy which are the very bedrock of the United States Constitution.   Fighting for human rights across the globe is one of my passions and  I have sought to promote and protect religious freedom such as H. Res.  290, a resolution I introduced in the last Congress condemning  blasphemy laws that serve as a pretext to persecute religious  minorities; that resolution was co-sponsored by our former colleague,  Joseph Pitts of Pennsylvania.   Within the context of H. Res. 407 and other legislation addressing  human rights, some of the issues we continue to grapple with include:   Expanding the Country of Particular Concern (CPC) list to include  more countries who have not improved in their treatment of religious  minorities or upholding religious freedoms;   The need for an Annual Countries of Particular Concerns Designations;   Double hatting of sanctions and indefinite waivers;   The need to designate non-state actors as violators of religious  freedom;   Prosecuting Islamic state militants; and   The need to have a high functioning Department of State with  appropriate leadership for both senior and junior staff, and sufficient  funding.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules  and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 407, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the resolution, as amended, was agreed to.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  agree to the resolution (H. Res. 336) reaffirming a strong commitment  to the United States-Mexico partnership.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 336         Whereas shared cultural ties, values, and beliefs connect       the citizens of the United States and Mexico and have long       been the foundation from which the friendly, bilateral       relationship has flourished;        Whereas the United States and Mexico have benefited from a       bilateral, mutually beneficial partnership focused on       advancing the economic and security interests of both       countries;        Whereas it is in the national interests of the United       States and Mexico to continue deepening economic cooperation       and security cooperation;        Whereas consecutive United States and Mexican       administrations have increased bilateral defense and law       enforcement cooperation on counterterrorism and       counternarcotics issues, including the illicit trafficking of       weapons, money, people, and drugs across the United States       southern border;        Whereas cooperation with Mexico during the administration       of President Pena Nieto has led to the extradition of more       than 270 individuals facing criminal charges in the United       States;        Whereas, the January 19, 2017, extradition of drug kingpin       Joaquin ``El Chapo'' Guzman to New York was a major victory       for both countries that would not have been possible without       a robust United States-Mexico security partnership;        Whereas the Merida Initiative was established in 2007 and       enabled a new level of security cooperation between the       United States and Mexico on a range of issues including       efforts to combat transnational organized crime and promote       justice reform;        Whereas the United States and Mexico have begun cooperation       to address the trafficking and production of heroin and       fentanyl threatening the lives of citizens in both countries;        Whereas the United States has provided almost $2.8 billion       in security assistance to Mexico through the Merida       Initiative between fiscal year 2008 and fiscal year 2017;        Whereas the United States and Mexico enjoy close diplomatic       cooperation and Mexico has consistently voted with the United       States at the United Nations on challenges related to Syria,       North Korea, and Ukraine;        Whereas the United States and Mexico have closely       collaborated at the Organization of American States (OAS) on       issues related to Venezuela, where Mexico has played a       leading role;        Whereas Mexico is an important security and defense partner       to the United States, and regularly participates in training       activities in coordination with United States Northern       Command (NORTHCOM) and the North American Aerospace Defense       Command (NORAD); and        Whereas the United States and Mexico launched the High       Level Economic Dialogue on September 20, 2013, to help       advance United States-Mexico economic and commercial       priorities to promote mutual economic growth, job creation,       educational exchanges and innovation, and global       competitiveness: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) reaffirms its strong commitment to a United States-      Mexico partnership based on mutual respect and the promotion       of shared democratic values and principles;        (2) supports continued bilateral cooperation through the       High Level Economic Dialogue on issues related to the       economic well-being and security of both countries;        (3) encourages continued security cooperation between the       United States and Mexican law enforcement agencies and       militaries, including on violence reduction in Mexico,       counterterrorism and the increased trafficking of heroin and       fentanyl;        (4) supports continued engagement with Mexico to tackle       regional issues and work together in international fora,       including the United Nations and the Organization of American       States; and        (5) supports efforts by the Government of Mexico to       strengthen the rule of law, reduce corruption, and advance       civil and human rights.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each  will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material in the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material in the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs  Committee, Mr. Engel. This is his bill. Let me also say that the  chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, Mike McCaul, who was his  primary cosponsor for this, has worked hard on this resolution. It  represents a broad, bipartisan acknowledgment of the importance of the  relationship between the United States of America and the country of  Mexico.   The United States and Mexico share strong ties. Passage of this  resolution will signal this body's commitment to strengthening our  bilateral relationship with Mexico, a relationship that impacts  Americans on a daily basis.  [[Page H9825]]    Today, the United States is grappling with challenges, just as Mexico  is grappling with some challenges. We have a deadly drug crisis where  more than 1,000 people a week die from opioid-related overdoses. This  is a crisis that started with overprescribed pain medication here in  the United States but is now fueled by heroin and fentanyl supplied by  drug cartels.   We have got to strengthen our partnership with Mexico and continue  working with Mexican security forces to stem the tide of these illegal  drugs entering into our communities and to harden our shared border  against terrorism and criminality.   This resolution also affirms the strong commercial relationship  between our two countries. Mexico was the second largest export market  for U.S. goods last year. It affirms our long history of cooperation on  environmental and natural resource issues.   For example, this past September, our two countries signed an  agreement to improve reservoir levels in Lake Mead and in the Colorado  River Basin that will help prevent water shortages currently affecting  Americans in the Southwest United States.                                time  1545    There are, of course, areas that I think we can improve the U.S.- Mexico relationship. Mexico needs to do more to combat the corruption  that has taken its toll on its citizens' trust.   But this resolution comes at an important time in the U.S. with our  relationship with Mexico and should signal to the people of Mexico that  the people of the United States want to continue to work with Mexico on  matters of mutual concern, from security to combating the illegal drug  trade, to strengthening our respective economies.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this resolution,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, again, I thank the author, the  ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Engel, and I thank  Congresswoman Norma Torres, as well, and the chairman of the Homeland  Security Committee, Mike McCaul, for their work on this important  resolution recognizing the U.S.-Mexico partnership and recognizing our  important economic relationship. As our countries continue to work  together, this resolution signals our commitment to strengthen our ties  with our Mexican neighbors.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules  and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 336.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the resolution was agreed to.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  agree to the resolution (H.

General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and include any extraneous material in the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and include any extraneous material in the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to recognize the leadership of Mr. Duncan,  who, until recently, served as the chairman of the Western Hemisphere  Subcommittee, and Mr. Gregory Meeks, the ranking member, in bringing  this important resolution forward.   I also want to recognize Mr. Huizenga, chairman of the Capital  Markets, Securities, and Investments Subcommittee of the Financial  Services Committee, who led the delegation this past fall with the  Canada-United States Inter-Parliamentary Group in Windsor, Canada.   This resolution affirms the already strong partnership we enjoy with  our neighbors to the north, while recognizing that this bilateral  relationship has advanced U.S. national interests.   Canada and the U.S. share the longest international border of any  countries in the world. Canada is one of the largest trading partners  with the U.S., and our largest agricultural export market. U.S. exports  of goods and services to Canada supported 1.6 million jobs in the  United States last year.   In addition, the U.S. and Canada enjoy a very close and vital  security  [[Page H9827]]  relationship, which is seen most acutely in our close border security  collaboration, as well as in defense arrangements such as NORAD and our  shared NATO mutual security commitments.   Our two countries have an exceptionally close energy relationship.  Canada is our largest supplier of oil, natural gas, electricity, and  uranium. Our two countries collaborate on environmental concerns,  particularly with our shared responsibility for the Great Lakes, which  are the world's largest freshwater ecosystem and contain 20 percent of  the Earth's surface freshwater.   This relationship gives Congress the opportunity to reaffirm, through  this resolution, our important and close bilateral ties with Canada and  to renew our commitment to growing and improving that relationship to  the benefit of both countries.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this  measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                   Washington, DC, December 8, 2017.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Brady: Thank you for consulting with the       Foreign Affairs Committee and agreeing to forgo a sequential       referral request on House Resolution 357, Reaffirming the       strategic partnership between the United States and Canada,       so that the resolution may proceed expeditiously to the House       floor.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this resolution or similar legislation in the future.        I will seek to place our letters on H. Res. 357 into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration. I appreciate       your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward       to continuing to work together as this measure moves through       the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                   Edward R. Royce,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Ways and Means,                                  Washington, DC, December 11, 2017.      Hon. Edward R. Royce,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Royce:, I am writing with respect to H. Res.       357, reaffirming the strategic partnership between the United       States and Canada, on which the Committee on Ways and Means       was granted an additional referral.        As a result of your having consulted with us on H. Res 357,       I agree to waive formal consideration of this resolution so       that it may move expeditiously to the floor. The Committee on       Ways and Means takes this action with the mutual       understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction over the       subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and       the Committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as       the resolution or similar legislation moves forward so that       we may address any remaining issues that fall within our       jurisdiction.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding, and would ask that a copy of       our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of H. Res       357.            Sincerely,                                                       Kevin Brady,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Duncan). He is the author of this  resolution.   Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and  the Foreign Affairs Committee for helping move this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, being the former chairman of the Western Hemisphere  Subcommittee on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I rise to  encourage the passage of H. Res. 357 to reaffirm the strategic  partnership between the United States and Canada.   As my good friend and former United States Ambassador to Canada,  David Wilkins taught me that Canada is one of our strongest allies and  one of our largest and best trading partners, and we are dependent on  cooperation between the nations to promote trade, security, and energy  issues.   It is imperative that we protect the close partnership with Canada  and the interdependent North American energy market. Enforcing the  strength of our relationship with Canada would expand the size of our  energy market, create more jobs, reduce energy cost for consumers, and  enhance North American energy security and interdependence. I remind  the administration that energy issues should be a top priority in any  NAFTA negotiation, as Canada is the largest supplier of energy to the  United States. Now, this includes oil, uranium, natural gas, and  electricity.   We share the longest undefended border, the largest bilateral trading  relationship, and one of the deepest security and energy partnerships  in the world. Today, 32 States consider Canada their primary trading  partner. The comprehensive trade and investment relationship, which the  United States has with Canada, supports millions of jobs in goods and  services on both sides of the border. The importance of this bilateral  relationship is critical for both countries.   Let me conclude by saying it is vital that we continue to look for  ways to strengthen our relationship with Canada, and I hope that my  colleagues will support this resolution to reaffirm the importance of  U.S.-Canada relations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to once again thank Representative Duncan and Mr.  Meeks and Mr. Huizenga and Mr. Engel for their commitment to the U.S.- Canada relationship and for bringing this important resolution forward.   This resolution affirms the already strong partnership that we enjoy  with our neighbors to the North while recognizing that this bilateral  relationship has advanced our national interests.   In addition to working together on trade, on border security, on  energy, Canada is also a valuable partner in security. As my colleagues  know, Canada is a founding member of NATO and leads a NATO battalion in  Latvia--I happen to have seen that battalion recently in Latvia--while  maintaining 200 Canadian military trainers in Ukraine.   Our shared values and proximity have rendered Canada one of our most  important allies, and this resolution allows this body to stand  together in affirming that relationship. I urge my colleagues to  support this important resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Poe of Texas). The question is on the  motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the  House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 357, as  amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the resolution, as amended, was agreed to.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
