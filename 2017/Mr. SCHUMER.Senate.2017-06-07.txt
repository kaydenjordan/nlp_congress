 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so  ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, first on Iran and Russia: This week we  will be considering bipartisan legislation to impose sanctions on Iran  for its ballistic missile testing, for its human rights abuses, and for  its overt support of terrorism. I support this and look forward to a  vote on the measure. It is important we do it.   I also understand that the majority leader will consent to an  amendment vote alongside that bill on bipartisan Russia sanctions  legislation. There is a broad bipartisan consensus for moving forward  on tough sanctions against Russia. Russia defied the sovereignty of the  Ukraine with the annexation of Crimea. It has been accused of human  rights abuses including propping up the brutal Assad regime in Syria,  and of course the intelligence community has confirmed that Russia  interfered with our democracy.   I appreciate that the majority leader has committed to having a vote  on Russia sanctions, and I thank so many of my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle for pushing this issue. It is the right thing to do,  and I appreciate them doing it.   I strongly believe that Russia's sanctions legislation needs to do  three important things. First, we must codify existing sanctions on  Russia; second, we need to give Congress a chance to review any  decision by this administration before sanctions are lifted; and,  third, we need to impose tough, new sanctions on Russia for its attack  on our democracy.   Two pieces of legislation, one posted by the two lead sponsors,  Senators McCain and Cardin, the other by Senators Graham and Cardin-- both bipartisan and both, I believe, with at least 10 cosponsors from  each side of the aisle--do these things. What we have suggested to the  leader is that we put those two bills together and combine them, tweak  them a little bit, and move forward. We await the answer from the  majority leader on our proposal.   It is certainly our responsibility and the responsibility of this  Congress to vote on the tough Russia sanctions bill as a response to  Russia's persistent violations of international norms and agreements.   If we do nothing on Russia or if we have a weak bill, we will not  accomplish that goal, and Mr. Putin will continue to do everything he  is doing. We know sanctions have bite with Russia. If the Russians see  that this Congress, in a bipartisan way, is resolute and strong, it  will make a difference, and I hope we move forward.                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, there are many subjects in this very  quickly changing world in which we live. The next subject is  infrastructure.   Today, President Trump will continue his infrastructure week in  talking about inland waterways. I would like to repeat that Democrats  welcome a discussion about these issues. Democrats have argued in favor  of a large infrastructure package to address our crumbling roads and  bridges, our levees, our dams, our ports, and our locks for a long  time. While we disagreed with President Trump on a great many things  during the campaign, I think many of my colleagues thought that when  Mr. Trump was elected, we could find some common ground on the topic of  infrastructure.   Needless to say, so far, the President's actions on infrastructure  have been a disappointment. In 6 months, the President has not given  any real details about his infrastructure plan. The most he has done is  endorse an off-the-shelf plan to privatize air traffic control. In  fact, he actually cut infrastructure spending in his budget by over  $200 billion. Now, during what they have termed ``infrastructure  week,'' the White House has only proposed to privatize much of our  infrastructure.   Today, I expect more of the same--bold promises, few details. What  details we do hear will likely be about how large financiers should  decide where and how to build American infrastructure. That has never  happened before. The approach will not address the very broad  infrastructure needs we have. Financiers will not pay to finance  infrastructure projects from which they cannot make a buck. It is their  right to seek a profit--that is what businesses do and are supposed to  do--but there is no such thing as a free lunch. They are going to need  to get recompense when they lay out money. That kind of approach will  not fix our water sewer systems. It will not expand rural broadband. It  will not fix our energy grid. It will do one thing--lead to Trump tolls  from one end of America to the other.   After the election, we stood ready to work with the President on a  real bill, provided it would not be just tax breaks for private  financiers or roll back labor and environmental protections. We even  wrote a detailed blueprint on how to spend $1 trillion. That was the  President's number. It would create 13 to 15 million jobs. It would  rebuild our infrastructure--large parts of it--from one end of America  to the other. It would not leave out rural areas that will never  benefit from any kind of private financing, as Senators Barrasso and  Moran have made clear.   We sent it to the White House and never heard a peep. I have talked  to the President several times on the phone and said that I want to  work with him on infrastructure--no response. Now we have their plan  without any consultation from Democrats. Even with talk that they  should do this on reconciliation, there has been no Democratic support  or votes or input. Just as their doing things by reconciliation is  tying the Republican Party in knots on healthcare, it does not bode too  well for them on tax reform. It will mess up infrastructure as well.   So I hope the President drops his go-at-it-alone infrastructure push  and instead decides to sit down and talk to Democrats about the issue.  We agree wholeheartedly on the problem and its magnitude. Let's sit  down and start talking about what solutions actually make sense. Let's  not have a few financiers who whisper into the President's ear  determine our infrastructure policy--because it will be a flop.                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, on another matter: healthcare.   Yesterday, the insurer Anthem pulled out of exchanges in Ohio, citing  the administration's decision to hold cost-sharing reduction payments  hostage as the reason for its exit. Anthem joins a growing list of  health insurers that have chosen to leave the 2018 marketplace or  considered raising their rates as a result of the uncertainty the  President and Republicans are causing--deliberately, in my judgment--in  our healthcare system.   The President and Republicans blame ObamaCare for insurers leaving  the marketplace. It is simply not true. The nonpartisan Congressional  Budget Office said it is the ``substantial uncertainty about  enforcement of the individual mandate and about future payments of the  cost-sharing subsidies'' that have led insurers to withdraw from the  current marketplace. AHIP, which is hardly a Democratic group--it is  the largest trade group of insurers and is completely nonpartisan--said  the uncertainty about cost-sharing payments was ``the single most  destabilizing factor in the individual market.''   The Affordable Care Act is not falling under its own weight. It is  being sabotaged deliberately by President Trump and Republicans who  have been whipping up all of this uncertainty to gain political  advantage, to say: ``I told you so.'' They are hurting millions of  people. That is really wrong.   After downplaying weeks of expectations in moving forward, yesterday  our  [[Page S3303]]  Republican colleagues said they expect to have a repeal bill passed by  June 30. That is 23 days from today. From all reports, the efforts by  Republican Senators to craft a different TrumpCare will be based on  many of the provisions in the House bill--a bill that would remove the  guarantee of coverage for preexisting conditions, raise rates on some  older Americans by as much as 800 percent, and decimate Medicaid, which  so helps rural folks, folks with a family member in a nursing home, and  those suffering from opioid abuse. It would also leave 23 million more  Americans without health insurance.   I remind all of my colleagues on the other side that drafting a  Senate Republican healthcare bill that is based on a House bill is  putting lipstick on a pig. TrumpCare is fundamentally flawed, has been  rejected overwhelmingly by the American people of all political  stripes, and will devastate our healthcare system in order to finance  massive tax breaks for the wealthiest of Americans. There is no amount  of window dressing that can fix up a flawed concept.   I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that even if  the proposal is 10 or 20 percent better than the House bill, it ain't  close to being good enough for the American people. Republicans ought  to drop the repeal. Choose to work with Democrats to actually improve  our healthcare system, not to sabotage it.                            ____________________     Finally, Mr. President, a word on the President's latest  idea for a border wall with Mexico. After the idea of a border wall was  roundly rejected in the last omnibus by Members of both parties and  after no Republican from a border State area would support the border  wall, the President just cannot seem to let it go. Yesterday, it was  reported that he actually pitched the idea of a 40- or 50-foot-tall  border wall with solar panels. Never mind that he still has not come up  with a plan on how to build the wall, where to build it--on our side or  the Rio Grande side--or how to get the land on the border from the  private citizens who own it. Never mind that a border wall would be  incredibly expensive and ineffective in actually preventing illegal  border crossings. Never mind that Mexico still wouldn't be paying for  the border wall or its solar panels.   The President is still pushing this medieval proposal--now with an  absurd twist. Just like painting stripes on a pony doesn't make a  zebra, solar panels on a wall no one wants doesn't make it any more  attractive. If the President thinks his new idea will catch on in  Congress, well, I have a 50-foot-tall wall made of solar panels I will  sell to you.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.

Mr. President, I ask permission to speak under  leadership time for a brief moment.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Thank you, Mr. President.   With respect to the pending vote on the Iran sanctions bill, I want  to be very clear. Democrats will vote to advance this bill to the floor  because most of us support the bill but also because we expect an  amendment process that will follow for a vote on a strong package of  Russia sanctions. I have talked to the Republican leader about this. He  is amenable to that.   Our Republican colleagues should realize it will be very difficult to  gather Democratic support for final passage of this bill until we deal  with Russia sanctions. We feel strongly that we need a tough, effective  package of Russia sanctions to move alongside the Iran sanctions. We  are currently negotiating to that end. I have faith that the majority  leader and I, along with Chairman Corker, Chairman Crapo, Ranking  Member Cardin, and Ranking Member Brown, will be able to agree on a way  forward that allows for a final vote on Iran sanctions alongside a  strong and effective package of Russia sanctions.   With that, I yield the floor.                                Cloture Motion    The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before  the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.   The legislative clerk read as follows:                               Cloture Motion         We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the       provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate,       do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to       proceed to Calendar No. 110, S. 722, a bill to impose       sanctions with respect to Iran in relation to Iran's       ballistic missile program, support for acts of international       terrorism, and violations of human rights, and for other       purposes.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum  call has been waived.   The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the  motion to proceed to S. 722, a bill to impose sanctions with respect to  Iran in relation to Iran's ballistic missile program, support for acts  of international terrorism, and violations of human rights, and for  other purposes, shall be brought to a close?   The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.   The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk called the roll.
