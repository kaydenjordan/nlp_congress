 Mr. Speaker, I want to read a letter from a Syrian refugee  to the interfaith coalition sponsoring his family, which settled in  Bloomfield, New Jersey, last month.   Muhammad is a father of four. His family was one of the last to  arrive prior to the signing of President Trump's ban.   Muhammad wrote:         I feel ashamed when I repeat the words: Thank you.        I feel it's very few and very weak in front of your       interest and your generosity.        The first thing I want to learn in the English language is       how I can thank you more and more.        America is beautiful because you live in it.    These are the kind of families the Trump administration wants to turn  away. They are the oppressed and the persecuted, the kind of people  this country was founded for.   I understand the need to vet people coming to our country, and the  importance of protecting our Nation's security. No one questions that  at all.   But we cannot close our country to refugees like Muhammad and his  family. We cannot sacrifice what it means to be American.   Muhammad is right, America is beautiful, and we can keep it that way  by remaining a beacon of freedom and hope.                            ____________________
