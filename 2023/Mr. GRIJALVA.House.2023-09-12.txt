 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 1567 introduced by my colleague from  Wisconsin, Representative Tiffany.   The United States Forest Service manages millions of acres of  forestland, including vital watersheds, critical wildlife habitat, and  countless outdoor recreational areas.   The Forest Service's 10-year Wildfire Crisis Strategy Implementation  Plan stresses the importance of fire-adapted landscapes and hazardous  fuel treatments to build resilient forests.   Wildfire risk reduction projects are complex multistep processes  requiring significant planning and investments often carried out over  several years.   Therefore, it is important that we receive accurate, transparent, and  accessible data on how forest management projects are being planned and  implemented.   This legislation would require the agency to include a report in the  President's annual budget on hazardous fuel activities carried out in a  given fiscal year to account for each treated acre.   This ongoing reporting requirement will enhance transparency and  accountability, providing critical information that can help guide  investments in management of our national forests--including how we  deploy our historic investments in wildfire risk reduction efforts that  were included in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and in the  Inflation Reduction Act.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   H.R. 1450 is the Treating Tribes and Counties as Good Neighbors Act  introduced by my colleague from Idaho, Representative Fulcher.   This bill updates the Good Neighbor Authority program to update the  incentives for Tribes and counties to partner with the Forest Service  and the Bureau of Land Management on restoration projects designed to  enhance resilience and promote healthy landscapes.   As climate change intensifies, it is crucial that land managers  utilize collaborative, consensus-driven tools such as Good Neighbor  Authority to facilitate conservation, restoration, and resiliency of  Federal lands and neighboring lands.   However, under current law, only States are authorized to retain  revenues from timber sales and contracts executed through this program.   This legislation provides parity for Tribes and counties to increase  community participation in the restoration of our public lands.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. Perez), the sponsor of the legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation. It creates parity and access for two significant  constituencies, counties and Tribes, and creates parity for them. I  think at the end of the day, it creates a collaborative effort that is  more comprehensive and more extensive.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3389, the Emergency Wildfire Fighting Technology  Act, was introduced by my colleague, Representative Valadao of  California.   The bill requires the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the  Department of the Interior, in coordination with the National  Interagency Aviation Committee and Interagency Airtanker Board, to  complete an evaluation of the container aerial fighting system to  support wildland fire mitigation and suppression.   In 2011, the Forest Service conducted a study and determined that  this particular delivery system did not meet existing standards and  posed safety risks to our communities and forests.   However, there have been technological advancements in the decades  since the initial report, and this bill aims to kick-start research  that could promote the use of under-utilized technology.                                time  1715    The climate crisis is clearly increasing the severity and the  duration of the wildfire season, so it is imperative that we  continuously research and re-evaluate any emerging technology.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the majority for their willingness to work with  us on amending the bill at markup. The updated text that we are  considering today ensures that the Forest Service retains the  decisionmaking authority with respect to the use of this particular  tool.   This is an important safeguard for the safety of wildland  firefighters and the communities impacted by the wildfire crisis.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3324, introduced by my friend from California,  Representative Huffman, would extend the Forest Service's existing  authority to collect and retain marina fees in the Shasta-Trinity  National Forest.   The chairman has outlined the content of the legislation, and I won't  repeat that again. It is a good bill and it is essential to the  operation and the management of the recreation area. It is a critical  tool that needs to be extended.   The continuation of this authority has been an ongoing priority for  the Forest Service and the surrounding communities. I thank and  congratulate Mr. Huffman for his leadership on the issue.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Huffman).    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
