 Mr. President, I am glad to see a Member of the majority  saying that Mitch McConnell ought to have us around here doing some  work. I appreciate the Senator from Tennessee saying that.   Senator McConnell said there was no urgency to help unemployed  workers. Six hundred thousand unemployed workers in my State in August  lost their $600 a week. What are they to do?   Foreclosures are up. There are no dollars for public education so  schools can open safely.   I appreciate the Senator from Tennessee. Maybe she will talk to  Senator McConnell and ask him to do his job so we can do our job.                                 H.J. Res. 90    Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of H.J. Res. 90, the joint  resolution of disapproval of the Office of the Comptroller of the  Currency's Community Reinvestment Act rule.   We know who gets hit the hardest by this pandemic and economic  crisis. It is not Wall Street. It is not CEOs. It is not U.S. Senators.  It is low-income workers. It is essential workers. It is workers who go  to work every day and get exposed to this virus and then come home,  anxious about potentially infecting their family. It is the middle  class. It is communities of color. Those are the people getting hit the  hardest. It is the same story we see over and over and over. Corporate  lobbyists and their allies in Washington do whatever it takes--whatever  it takes to make sure that Wall Street recovers, and then they say: Oh,  no, we can't afford to--we can't--the budget, the deficit. We can give  a tax cut to rich people, explode the deficit, but we can't do anything  for regular people, for middle-class people, and for low-income people.  We just can't afford to help anyone else.   The stock market is back up, so Leader McConnell and President Trump  seem to think that everything is just fine, thank you, in our country.  Meanwhile, families don't know how to feed their children and how to  make rent. They don't know about family businesses closing their doors  and schools can't open for in-person learning. But, oh, yeah, the stock  market is up, so Leader McConnell and President Trump seem to think  everything is fine.   Black-owned businesses have closed down at twice the rate--including  in the State of Arkansas--closed at twice the rate of White-owned  businesses during this pandemic. Black and Latino renters are more  likely to be behind on their rent or mortgage. But the stock market is  up, so Leader McConnell and President Trump seem to think that  everything is just fine.   Low-wage workers are more likely to remain out of work. There are  600,000 people in my State who can't find jobs. They have lost their  unemployment insurance. But the stock market is up, so Leader McConnell  and President Trump seem to think that everything is fine.   Low-wage workers are more likely to remain out of work and more  likely to be struggling to pay for food. We  [[Page S6054]]  should--we should--but we are not because Leader McConnell is taking  care of his contributors, he is taking care of the big-money people,  and he is taking care of Wall Street. The stock market is up--I know I  have said that a few times--but that is what matters to far too many  people around here, and to the President of the United States, that is  what matters. We should be rolling up our sleeves to invest in  neighborhoods and the small businesses that sustain them. Instead, we  have had another Trump appointee working to actually make it harder to  invest in these communities at a time when they need support the most.   For decades, redlining and government bank sanctions--you know how  they started. It was the Black codes after reconstruction; then it was  Jim Crow; then it was redlining; and now it is locking in  discrimination by Trump nominees who have had another Trump appointee  working to make it harder to invest.   For decades, redlining and government- and bank-sanctioned  discrimination left parts of this country--often Black and Brown  communities, often rural areas in Southeast Ohio and Arkansas--with  virtually no investment from banks. All kinds of people had dreams to  start businesses, to build houses, to grow and support their  communities, but they couldn't get the loans to do it. Even after  Congress outlawed housing and lending discrimination based on race,  whole communities struggled to get the loans they needed. Banks were  happy to take Black and Brown and low-income people's deposits, and  then they would lend their money to wealthy investors and companies  outside of the community. Long after redlining and long after legal  segregation officially ended, people living in largely Black and Brown  neighborhoods weren't able to get mortgages to buy a home because the  bank just wasn't making loans in those parts of town.   Small farms and small businesses couldn't get the loans they needed  to grow. That is why we passed the Community Reinvestment Act, the CRA,  to make it clear that banks have a responsibility to serve all of the  places where they do business, including low- and moderate-income  areas. As I said, they would take the deposits and then take the money  and lend it out to wealthy investors.   The CRA is one of the foundational civil rights laws passed to  address decades of explicit disinvestment and begin to undo the legacy  of redlining. For 40 years, our government and banks alike have  recognized in theory--in theory--that banking shouldn't just be about  serving the people with six-figure salaries and big mortgages. It is  about helping a family farm take out a loan. It is about helping a  busdriver buy their first home or a brother and sister open a corner  store in a neighborhood where there is nowhere to buy fresh groceries.  It is about listening to what the communities need and making it  happen, like helping to finance a new affordable housing development or  offering small loans so that people don't have to turn to payday  lenders. It is about investing in neighborhoods and borrowers who are  locked out of the financial system based on who they were and where  they were born.   The three entities that oversee our banking system--the Comptroller  of the Currency, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC--acted together over  those 40 years so that there was one CRA for all banks to follow and  one set of expectations about serving customers in communities.   But, in May, the Trump OCC threw out 40 years of progress--just threw  it out the window. But, you know, the stock market is up, so Leader  McConnell and President Trump seem to think everything is just fine. In  the middle of a pandemic disproportionately--we have established, and  even Senator McConnell understands, this pandemic disproportionately  harms Black and Brown communities in Kentucky, Arkansas, New Jersey,  Delaware, Ohio, and all over this country, but Trump's OCC unilaterally  rewrote the CRA--unilaterally. The other Trump nominees didn't even go  that far.   Just 6 weeks before the rule was finalized, civil rights leaders,  community development organizations, State and local officials, Senator  Menendez on the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Budget Committee,  and I and others submitted over 7,500 comments on the OCC's and FDIC's  proposed rewrite of the CRA. The vast majority of commenters opposed  the agency's proposal. A coalition of civil rights leaders, the NAACP,  the National Fair Housing Alliance, and UnidosUS said the proposed rule  invited--their words--``a return to discrimination against communities  of color and low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.''   Remember how this worked. It was the Black codes; then it was Jim  Crow; then it was redlining. Now it is locking in these discriminatory  rules, and we said no to that. But, unfortunately, the Trump  administration says yes to that. But 22 State attorneys general wrote  that the proposal was ``contrary to the [Community Reinvestment Act's]  purpose and text, will harm communities in the States, and should be  withdrawn.''   Across my home State of Ohio, cities such as Akron, Toledo, Dayton,  Cincinnati, Mansfield, Lima, and many others wrote and passed  resolutions opposing this plan. Some in government--those not directly  connected to the Trump administration--listened to the people we serve.  The FDIC heard the feedback. FDIC saw the financial pain of the  pandemic, and they declined to move forward. The Federal Reserve also  said no, but the OCC plowed ahead. It ignored the thousands of civil  rights groups and local nonprofits and banks, all of whom told them  their plan just wouldn't work for low- and moderate-income communities.  Instead, the agency said: We know best   They think these Trump appointees in Washington know better than  mayors and city council members and local advocates and small  businesses in Ohio and around the country.   The day after they announced they were ignoring the rest of the  country and plowing ahead, Comptroller of the Currency Otting announced  he would resign. Imagine that. First he inflicts this on us, and then  he walks away, probably for a better paying job down the road.   Since the rule was finalized, the Federal Reserve has set out on a  path for all three regulators to work together to create a CRA rule  that will increase the focus on lending and investments and services in  low- and moderate-income communities and to small businesses and farms.  That is what CRA is there for. That used to be bipartisan. That used to  be the consensus around here. We should be investing in these  communities that have been systematically excluded from sharing in our  country's prosperity. That means strengthening the CRA. It means  listening to communities when they tell us what they need. But the  OCC's rule does the opposite. They even acknowledge there was  widespread opposition to this rule, particularly from the communities  the CRA was meant to serve.   It should be easy for my Republican colleagues to join us in voting  to revoke the OCC's rule and to stand up for the underserved in low-  and moderate-income communities, rural communities, and communities of  color whom CRA was meant to serve.   I would just ask our Republican colleagues to join with what the FDIC  wants to do--the Trump appointees there. Join with the Federal  Reserve--Jay Powell, Chair of the Federal Reserve, Trump appointee. It  is what the Senate should be doing--working to get our country through  the worst crisis we have seen in our lifetime and investing in the  communities getting hit the hardest.   Instead, Leader McConnell is using the final days before an election  to jam through another special interest judge who will carry out the  corporate agenda that the voters keep rejecting. The Senate needs to  get back to focusing on the people we are here to serve and to repeal  the OCC's misguided rule to gut the Community Reinvestment Act.   I urge my colleagues to support the resolution so that we can get  back to the task of strengthening the CRA. The stock market being up-- as important as that is to Leader McConnell and President Trump in  their belief that everything is fine because the stock market is up,  there is way more to measure our economy than that. Support our  resolution; strengthen the CRA; and help our communities across the  country.  [[Page S6055]]    Before yielding the floor, I ask unanimous consent that the letters  from the National Urban League, the Center for Responsible Lending, and  45 civil rights organizations, consumer advocates, and unions in  support of H.J. Res. 90 and opposing OCC's CRA rule be printed in the  Record. Along with these letters that I have requested to be printed, I  would also like to refer to a coalition letter supporting the  resolution which can be found at: https://ncrc.org/wp-content/uploads/ dlm_uploads/2020/10/FINAL-H.J.-Res-90-SignOn-Letter.pdf   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                          National Urban League,                                                   October 19, 2020.      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senators: On behalf of the National Urban League and       our 90 affiliates across 36 states and the District of       Columbia, I write to express strong support for H.J.       Resolution 90 (H.J. Res. 90), a Congressional Review Act       resolution intended to reverse the Office of the Comptroller       of the Currency's (OCC) harmful and woefully misguided       changes to the implementation of the Community Reinvestment       Act of 1977 (CRA).        The framework represented by OCC's final CRA rule       represents a serious shift from the CRA's original intent of       addressing the history of redlining, disinvestment, and the       market failures that continue to leave communities of color       in America underserved. Notably, it is illustrative that two       of the three federal agencies charged with enforcing the       CRA--the Federal Reserve (the Fed) and the Federal Deposit       Insurance Corporation (FDIC)--did not join the OCC in       finalizing this controversial rule. Moreover, under the       leadership of Chair Jerome Powell and Governor Lael Brainard,       the Fed has now proposed a different approach to modernizing       the CRA that better aligns with the original intent of this       crucial civil rights law.        If fully enacted, the OCC's final rule would effectively       give banks under the agency's jurisdiction more credit for       performing less CRA activity, resulting in significantly       fewer lending opportunities and bank services for the many       low- and middle-income (LMI) families nationwide who most       need the vital access to the sustainable lending and       homeownership opportunities made possible by the CRA.       Additionally, the OCC's final rule favors investments that       are already well-served by current market trends and for       which the CRA was never intended.        The CRA was designed to combat generations of       discrimination and redlining by requiring banks to better       meet the lending needs of the surrounding communities in       which they are chartered to serve, including underserved       areas. This important law was enacted in large part because       communities of color continued to face barriers accessing       credit despite the passage of federal fair lending laws,       including the Fair Housing Act, the Equal Opportunity Act,       and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act.        In light of the very serious concerns about the OCC's       finalized changes to the implementation of the CRA, the       National Urban League urges Senators to vote in favor of H.J.       Res. 90 when it comes to the Senate floor for consideration.       Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact       Julius Niyonsaba at the National Urban League.            Sincerely,                                                    Marc H. Morial,      President & CEO, National Urban League.                                   ____                                    Center for Responsible Lending                                                   October 19, 2020.      U.S. Senate,      U.S. Capitol, Washington, DC.        Dear Senator: The Center for Responsible Lending writes to       express our strong support for H.J. Res. 90, a Congressional       Review Act resolution of disapproval that will invalidate the       Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) final rule on       the Community Reinvestment Act.        The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (CRA) was one in a       series of landmark civil rights legislation and is a critical       tool to help our nation work toward overcoming the legacy of       redlining. Today's racial wealth gap and lending disparities       are in large part the result of decades of government       policies and practices that enabled the redlining of       communities of color for most of the 20th century. In the       post-Depression era, federal policies that created housing       opportunities for returning veterans and their families       explicitly excluded people of color from the benefits of       government-supported housing programs. Among these programs       were public housing, the Home Owners' Loan Corporation       (HOLC), and mortgage insurance through the Federal Housing       Administration (FHA). Not only did this redlining segregate       residential neighborhoods across the United States, but it       granted whites the ability to build wealth through       homeownership while denying equal opportunities for families       of color to build similar home equity over the same period.       The inequities that result from these discriminatory programs       are part of the injustices that today's people led protests       are demanding to be addressed.        The CRA imposes continuing and affirmative obligations on       banks to help meet the credit needs of the local communities       in which they are chartered and continues to be an important       tool for fostering access to credit for these communities       today. The law has urged banks to more actively lend in LMI       areas; it has also played a key role in ensuring bank       participation in community revitalization efforts across the       country.        Despite the importance of CRA and the community investment       it has spurred, CRA rules must be strengthened. The CRA as       applied has not done nearly enough to revitalize previously       redlined areas and has not made a substantial dent in the       lagging homeownership rate for people of color. The white       homeownership rate is 73% while the rate is 44% and 48% for       Black and Latino borrowers respectively. Additionally, bank       lending in LMI communities and communities of color has       declined dramatically since the Great Recession. And existing       disparities will be further perpetuated in the face of the       COVID-19 global public health and economic crisis.        Unfortunately, the OCC decided to act unilaterally--without       the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance       Corporation--to issue a structurally flawed final rule that       weakens the CRA and will harm low- and moderate-communities       and communities of color. Rather than postpone rulemaking to       focus on the devastating economic crisis caused by the COVID-      19 health pandemic, the OCC issued the rule a mere six weeks       after the closing of the comment period on its proposed rule       despite broad requests for delay from community groups, civil       rights and consumer organizations, and industry. The OCC       acknowledged in the preamble to the final rule that most of       the comments disagreed with the proposal's approach. Yet, the       OCC decided to side with the minority of comments in support       of the proposed rule. The OCC's rule will harm the       communities most adversely affected by the current crisis,       including many families that were hardest hit by the Great       Recession and have yet to recover.        The final rule imposes an overly simplistic evaluation       measure that fails to ensure that local banking needs are       met, and sanctions bank redlining. The rule overvalues the       dollar amount of CRA activities in comparison to the quality       of such activities and allows banks to earn more credit for       easier and larger investments in communities from which they       can get the highest return. Indeed, the rule permits banks to       ignore 20% of their assessment areas and still pass,       resulting in unchecked neighborhood disinvestment and       redlining. The rule also disincentives investment in LMI       neighborhoods and communities of color. It incentivizes       activities and investments that do not ``primarily'' benefit       LMI communities, such as large-scale infrastructure projects.       Estimating such projects' impact on LMI neighborhoods is       difficult and thus will likely divest funds away from smaller       scale, yet impactful community development activities.       Furthermore, the rule reduces the importance of retail       lending and retail services, resulting in less lending and       investments in communities that are already credit starved.       The rule is opposite to the CRA's statutory mission and will       cause deep harm to communities.        We urge support for H.J. Res. 90 to reverse the OCC's       regulatory attack on the Community Reinvestment Act. Thank       you for your consideration.            Sincerely,      Center for Responsible Lending.                                   ____                                                  National Community                                          Reinvestment Coalition,                                                   October 19, 2020.        Dear Senator: We, the undersigned organizations, write to       express our strong support for H.J. Res. 90, a Congressional       Review Act resolution of disapproval that will nullify a       rulemaking by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency       (OCC) that, if allowed to stand, would drastically undermine       one of our nation's most important civil rights laws, the       Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the CRA).        Enacted in 1977, the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) has       been vital in fighting redlining, a practice that       systematically--and for decades, as a matter of federal       policy--shut neighborhoods of color and lower-income       communities out from home loans and other essential financial       services. The CRA requires banks to undertake reasonable       efforts to lend to and invest in all of the neighborhoods in       areas where they do business. The law has helped to spur       increased investments in formerly-redlined communities. It       did not, however, prevent non-bank lenders (who are not       subject to the CRA) from flooding communities of color with       toxic subprime mortgages in the years before the 2008 crisis;       and research shows that racial disparities in lending--which       cannot be explained away by differences in credit scores--      persist to this day.        It is clear that the CRA needs to be modernized and       strengthened in order to fulfill its original purpose. But in       January, the OCC and the Federal Deposit Insurance       Corporation (FDIC) published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking       (NPRM) that would instead significantly weaken the CRA. The       agencies proposed new overly simplistic metrics system that       would make it far easier for banks to pass their CRA exams by       making large investments in communities where they can reap       the largest rewards, rather than carefully-targeted, smaller       investments in underserved consumers and neighborhoods.        Even before the NPRM was published, a wide range of       stakeholders weighed in with  [[Page S6056]]       both the OCC and FDIC to raise concerns and to ask for more       data justifying the changes. Those concerns were not       addressed, and the data was never released. By the time the       NPRM was published, the United States and the world were just       beginning to learn about the growing threat posed by a       dangerous new respiratory virus. In the coming weeks, it       became clear that the virus had not been contained, and it       spread rapidly to multiple countries including the United       States. As stakeholders and the public began devoting more       and more resources and attention to the health, social, and       economic fallout of the growing pandemic, and many urged the       OCC and FDIC to temporarily suspend rulemaking not related to       COVID-19, the agencies continued plowing ahead, only agreeing       to a one-month extension for comments.        In the days before the deadline for comments on the rule,       it had become clear that COVID-19 was proving fatal to       communities of color--the very communities the CRA was       intended to help--at a rate several times higher than the       population at large; the U.S. Surgeon General warned the       public to prepare for ``our 9/11 moment,'' and models       predicted 100,000 or more deaths in the United States alone.       Only 41 days after the comment period ended, and even though       only a minority of commenters voiced support for the new       framework, the OCC rushed through a final rule that left it       largely intact. The FDIC, to its credit, declined to finalize       its version of the rule at this time.        In the months since the OCC finalized its rule, our nation       has been facing a long-overdue reckoning with our troubled       legacy of racial and ethnic discrimination. While much of the       conversation has rightly been focused on police brutality and       the impact of over-policing in communities of color, this       conversation is inexorably tied to the lasting economic,       social, and legal legacy of redlining and other forms of       racial discrimination.        We will not succeed in addressing issues surrounding law       enforcement in communities of color without also addressing       decades of underinvestment in housing, employment, education,       health care, transportation, and other factors that, to this       day, have contributed to the longstanding disparities that       are once again coming to light. Now is certainly not the time       to weaken the most important civil rights laws we have at our       disposal to correct those disparities.        As such, we urge Congress to support H.J. Res. 90, to       overturn the OCC's regulatory attack on the Community       Reinvestment Act. Thank you for your consideration.
