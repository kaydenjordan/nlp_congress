 Madam President, today we vote to begin the  consideration of S. 2657, which will serve as the vehicle for the  American Energy Innovation Act. This is truly bipartisan energy policy.  This innovative package will be the first comprehensive policy update  in 13 years. It brings together the strong bipartisan work of the  Energy Committee over the last year.   I would like to thank my friend and chairman of the committee, Lisa  Murkowski, Republican from Alaska, for her leadership and partnership  with me over the last 14 months to process these bills and form the  basis of the energy package we will be turning to today.   Thanks to the members of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee  for their contributions to the development of this legislation.   The American Energy Innovation Act draws from 53 bills from Members  from both sides of the aisle, and 39 of those were truly a bipartisan  effort. And 63 Members of the Senate have either sponsored or  cosponsored a piece of this package.   It truly is a bipartisan product and one that I believe will benefit  this country greatly. So far, we have had over 150 amendments filed,  several of which are bipartisan, and there is no controversial issue  that I know of. I am hoping that we can work together to incorporate  some of those amendments from both sides of the aisle.   As it stands, the American Energy Innovation Act will advance the  abilities of Department of Energy and the National Laboratories to  deliver the much needed technology that American workers can then  produce and export across the global marketplace. Not only will it  further our ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from energy,  transportation, industry, and buildings, but it will also enhance our  cyber and grid security and maintain our competitive edge and role as a  global leader.   We talk a lot--all of us do--about global climate, and when you think  about global climate, then you think about our responsibility and what  we emit into the air. For some reason, most people have been led to  believe that power generation--whether it be coal-fired powerplants,  natural gas-fired powerplants, or anything that has to do with fossil-- is contributing all of the greenhouse gas emissions in the United  States. That is just not true.   Let me give you the breakdown. Power generation contributes 27.5  percent of the greenhouse gas emissions.  [[Page S1451]]  Power generation is how you get your electricity--if it comes from a  coal-fired powerplant, gas, or any other type of fossil.   Transportation is how we come and go back and forth to work and how  we receive our goods. Whether it is going to be by car, by train, by  plane, or by trucks, 29 percent of the responsibility for greenhouse  gases goes to transportation.   The industry is where people work, where they make their living,  provide for their family, whether it be in a small factory, a large  factory, a small business, or a high-tech business. Industry  contributes 22 percent of greenhouse gas emissions.   Commercial and residential, which is the building we are in today,  which is the beautiful Capitol, and where we live--just the commercial  and residential--are 11.5 percent responsible for greenhouse gases.   So you have to have an ``all in'' policy. One thing doesn't fit, and  we don't have a silver bullet to fix everything. What we have done is  this. You take all of those--power generation, transportation,  industry, commercial and residential--and that represents 90 percent of  all the greenhouse gas emissions. We are approaching--and, basically,  this piece of legislation approaches--every one of those to reduce the  greenhouse gas emissions.   If we all work together and pass this truly bipartisan, far-reaching,  all-inclusive bill, it will make a world of difference in how we lead  the rest of the world in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. That is  what we are trying to do.   We do it through innovation. We don't do it through elimination.  Elimination is not practical, responsible, or reasonable. The rest of  the world will not follow, and, basically, we have to have baseload  fuel. It has to be dependable, reliable, and affordable, but it has to  be the cleanest in the world. That is what this bill does.   There is the other 9 percent. You say: Well, that is 90 percent;  where is the other 10 percent? That is in agriculture. That is not in  our jurisdiction, but they are working very hard in the Agriculture  Committee to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and their footprint.  Everybody is doing their job.   I believe this package is well balanced, and many of my colleagues'  priorities on both sides of the aisle have been met. This bill  represents a critical step in the right direction. I encourage--I  truly, sincerely encourage--all of my fellow Members, Democrats and  Republicans, to vote yes today on the motion to proceed. Your children  will thank us, and your grandchildren and generations after them will  definitely thank all of us for doing our job today.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I rise today to honor a proud West  Virginian, a dedicated public servant, a beloved husband, father,  grandfather, and a dear friend to all who had the pleasure of knowing  him. It is a privilege to recognize the life and legacy of Mayor Harold  Howard ``Sonny'' Howell II for his many years of dedicated service to  the city of Madison, Boone County, and to our entire home State.   Gayle and I are heartbroken to learn of the passing of our dear  friend Sonny. My uncle, the late A. James Manchin, and Sonny were the  closest of friends. I first met Sonny in the 1970s and he remained an  absolute unconditional, lifelong friend. I have met many unique people  throughout the years, but nobody compared to Sonny. He was a true  example of what it means to be a public servant, having served in the  U.S. Army, as justice of the peace, Boone County Circuit clerk, and for  many years as mayor of Madison.   Born and raised in Madison, Sonny was a member of the Madison United  Methodist Church for more than 80 years. He was a 1956 graduate of  Scott High School, and he attended West Virginia Wesleyan College,  Morris Harvey College, and West Virginia State College. He was a member  of the Masonic O'Dell Lodge, Beni Kedem Shrine, Royal Order of the  Jesters, Madison Rotary Club, Paul Harris Fellow for Rotary  International, Member of the Municipal League, and a recipient of the  35th Star from my uncle A. James Manchin. He and his wife Onia have  been the owners of Howell Rental, a family business started by Sonny's  father in 1940.   There is a lot to be said of someone who bravely serves our Nation,  then returns home to continue giving back to the community that made  them who they are. When visitors come to West Virginia, I jump at the  chance to tell them we have fought in more wars, shed more blood, and  lost more lives for the cause of freedom than most any State. We have  always done the heavy lifting and never complained. We have mined the  coal and forged the steel that built the guns, ships, and factories  that have protected and continue to protect our country to this day. I  am so deeply proud of what West Virginians have accomplished and what  they will continue to accomplish to protect the freedoms we hold dear.  That is Sonny's legacy, and his courage, loyalty, and humility will  never be forgotten.   Put simply, Sonny represented the very best of West Virginia, which  is saying quite a lot. In the Mountain State, if you are hungry, you  will be fed. If you are lost, someone will not only give you directions  but will offer to drive you to your destination. That is just who we  are, and that is who Sonny was. We have lost a shining star in Boone  County, but his impact, vision, and his passion for this special  community will last forever. It was an honor to have known him and to  call him my friend. He never met a stranger and always had time to  share a story.   What is most important is that Sonny lived a full life, surrounded by  dear friends and family. It is my hope that his loved ones are able to  find peace, strength, and support in one another. I extend my  condolences to his wife of 59 years, Onia, his son Kip, his daughter- in-law Deanna, his grandchildren Harry and Meredith, sister-in-law  Marilyn, brother-in-law Mike, and a host of nieces and nephews, who  lovingly referred to him as Uncle Son. Again, I extend to you my most  sincere condolences for our loss of this wonderful person. The  unwavering love Sonny had for his family, friends, community, and our  home State will live on forever in the hearts of all who knew  him.                            ____________________
