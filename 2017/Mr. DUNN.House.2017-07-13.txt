 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge a tragic incident  that occurred today in the Second District.   Early this morning, a man drove his truck into the side of the Bay  County Government Center and caused a fire that resulted in his death.  My district office has an office in that building. Thankfully, no  workers or visitors were injured in the incident, and all of the  district staff are safe.   It is a sad day to witness someone so troubled take such an action  and, ultimately, their own life. While there is still much to learn  about this person's motivations and the reasons behind this attack on a  public building, we should all remember that, no matter how inflamed  our passions, violence is never the answer.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in thanking the first responders and the  law enforcement officers who are addressing this incident, and please  join me in a prayer for the Bay County community as they come together  to respond to this tragedy.                            ____________________
