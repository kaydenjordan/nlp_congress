 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the House Republican  Conference, I offer a privileged resolution and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 897         Resolved, That the following named Members be, and are       hereby, elected to the following standing committees of the       House of Representatives:        Committee on Appropriations: Mr. Rutherford.

Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 891 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 891         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 5698) to       amend title 18, United States Code, to punish criminal       offenses targeting law enforcement officers, and for other       purposes. All points of order against consideration of the       bill are waived. The bill shall be considered as read. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       bill and on any amendment thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary; (2) the further       amendment printed in part A of the report of the Committee on       Rules accompanying this resolution, if offered by the Member       designated in the report, which shall be in order without       intervention of any point of order, shall be considered as       read, shall be separately debatable for the time specified in       the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent       and an opponent, and shall not be subject to a demand for       division of the question; and (3) one motion to recommit with       or without instructions.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the bill (S. 2372) to amend       title 38, United States Code, to provide outer burial       receptacles for remains buried in National Parks, and for       other purposes. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. An amendment in the nature of a       substitute consisting of the text of H.R. 5674 as reported by       the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, as modified by the       amendment printed in part B of the report of the Committee on       Rules accompanying this resolution, shall be considered as       adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read.       All points of order against provisions in the bill, as       amended, are waived.

No further consideration of the bill shall be in       order except pursuant to a subsequent order of the House.                                time  1230                                Point of Order     Mr. Speaker, I claim time in opposition to the point of  order and in favor of consideration of the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I don't claim to know as much about the farm bill as my  friend from Massachusetts does. He has the privilege of representing  his constituents both on the Rules Committee and on the Ag Committee.   I represent my constituents on the Rules Committee and on the Budget  Committee. I work with CBO day in and day out, as my colleague knows.   CBO is absolutely charged with being the nonpartisan scorekeeper in  all of these budgetary matters. But as the gentleman recalls, having  worked for a former member of the Rules Committee himself, when  Republicans passed and President Clinton signed the unfunded mandates  point of order, it was designed with one goal and one goal only in  mind, and that was to make sure that when Congress acts, it considers  the impacts of folks back home. It considers whether or not it is  shirking a responsibility in Washington and shifting that  responsibility to State and local governments back home.   I will tell you with certainty, Mr. Speaker, that not a single Member  on this side of the aisle has wavered in that commitment from when this  bill passed in 1995 until today.   What my friend from Massachusetts references are programs that are  implemented by the States in order to receive a Federal benefit. We see  this happen all the time, day in and day out. You get all the  transportation money that you want, but you need to alter your speed  limit if you want to receive that transportation money. You can get all  the transportation money you want, but you need to deal with your  drinking age if you want to get that money.   What we are talking about today at its core, Mr. Speaker, is whether  or not, at a time when we have the lowest unemployment rate in my  lifetime, at a time when we have more jobs available to be filled in  America than ever before in American history, whether it is a burden to  say if you want to receive a Federal benefit, that being food stamps,  that you should try to find a job first. If you can't find that job, we  should get you enrolled in a job training program so that you can find  the job.   At the end of the day, the farm bill aims to do two things with the  SNAP program: number one, is continue to provide a safety net for  families in need. But number two, to make sure it remains that net and  tries to lift folks  [[Page H3993]]  out of poverty instead of trap them in poverty for generations to come.   Mr. Speaker, this unfunded mandates point of order, I was in Congress  at the time that it passed, has been a speed bump, a needed speed bump  in the consideration of legislation time and time again.   Now, sadly, more often than not, we see it as a dilatory tactic on  the House floor. We see it raised as something just to try to slow down  the process and gum up the works.   That is not what is happening here today. I want to stipulate that  that is true.   My friend from Massachusetts raises a legitimate concern, but what I  would say to my colleagues is this is a task, an obligation that has  been placed on the States in consideration of receiving a Federal  benefit. Folks are not mandated to do anything at all, but if we are to  participate in the program, if folks are to continue to work through  the program, if we are to get people back to work, if we are to provide  this safety net, if we are to succeed on behalf of our constituents, as  we all want to do, then we are going to have a partnership between the  Federal Government and the State governments to make that happen.                                time  1245    Again, I respect my friend from Massachusetts, Mr. Speaker. He is an  authority on the farm bill and an authority on the SNAP program. But as  far as the unfunded mandates point of order goes, I would encourage my  colleagues to reject that request today and to vote in favor of  proceeding with consideration of the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, again, I recognize my friend's passion. I tell you, this  is not going to be the end of my friend's passion. We are going to be  here for another hour, together, talking about the farm bill, and I  suspect we will see even a new degree of passion because my friend from  Massachusetts is incredibly committed to his point of view on the SNAP  program.   What I would tell you, Mr. Speaker--and I will speak on behalf of my  Governor from the great State of Georgia; I will speak on behalf of my  legislators and my administrators in the great State of Georgia--folks  want to be a part of lifting people out of poverty. Nobody wants to be  a part of trapping people in a cycle of poverty, and there is  absolutely, Mr. Speaker, a degree of complicity that this Chamber has  often been involved in by saying: This is the best we can do. We can't  do any better, and we are just going to resign ourselves to the fact  that generational poverty will continue. I say nonsense, and this bill  is a step in the right direction.   I share my friend's frustration that what should have been a  bipartisan farm bill, what traditionally is a bipartisan farm bill,  went off the rails somewhere in the process and folks walked away from  the table. We can assign blame however we choose to do it; but in this  case, Mr. Speaker, we are talking about a bill that is going to take a  major step forward in lifting folks out of poverty, a major step  forward in putting people back to work, a major step forward in making  sure that folks who receive Federal benefits are those who need Federal  benefits, but those who have opportunities to do more and to do better  for their families have partners in both their Federal and State  governments to make that happen. I think that is what all my colleagues  here want.   I encourage my friends to reject my friend's point of order and to  vote to consider this bill today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate  only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), an Ag Committee member and my fellow  Rules Committee member, pending which I yield myself such time as I may  consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is  for the purpose of debate only.   I thank my colleagues for standing with me to consider this rule and  then these three underlying measures today.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, the rule before us today, House Resolution  891, makes in order three pieces of legislation. The one that you heard  discussed already today is H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of  2018. Two other measures included in this rule are H.R. 5698, the  Protect and Serve Act of 2018, and S. 2372, the VA MISSION Act of 2018.   Mr. Speaker, as you know, this week is Police Week, and police  officers serving our communities every day with distinction get this 1  week a year that we all take a moment to pause and say thank you.  President Trump made that point yesterday just outside the Capitol  talking about these heroes who put their life on the line absolutely  every day.   To quote the President, he said: ``Your moms and dads were among the  bravest Americans to ever live'' when he was talking to the children of  fallen officers. Of course, he was absolutely right.   For that reason I am particularly pleased that the rule today brings  up the Protect and Serve Act of 2018. It brings it to the floor under a  structured amendment process. The bill makes it a Federal crime to  intentionally cause or to attempt to cause serious bodily harm to any  law enforcement officer. I say that again, Mr. Speaker. It makes it a  Federal crime to attempt to cause or intentionally cause serious bodily  harm to any law enforcement officer.   Mr. Speaker, we are trying to speak in the absolute strongest terms  when we speak on behalf of our men and women in law enforcement  uniforms. In fact, just last night in the Rules Committee, my friend,  Mr. McGovern from Massachusetts, said there is virtually no  disagreement between the parties and the Chambers on this legislation.   Another bill we can agree on, Mr. Speaker, is the VA MISSION Act. In  fact, I was with one of The American Legion chapters in our district  just Monday talking about the very provisions in this bill and how they  can make a substantive difference for our men and women who have served  us in the Armed Forces.   This is a four corners agreement bill, Mr. Speaker, and by four  corners, I mean the chairmen and the ranking members on the House side  and on the Senate side have agreed on this legislation. They have  worked together on this legislation, and they have put it together in a  way that we can all be proudly supportive of that final product.   Let me tell you what this bill will do in specifics, Mr. Speaker.   It consolidates seven duplicative community care programs into one  program that is easier for our veterans to understand and to access. It  ensures that the Veterans Choice Program has enough funding to continue  working for our veterans for yet another year as the committees  continue to perfect that program. I am sure you hear the same  constructive counsel that I do, Mr. Speaker. Good for Congress for  letting us opt out so that we can get the services we need quickly. But  the Veterans Choice Program still has work to do to get those  agreements approved promptly and get those doctors reimbursed promptly.   The VA MISSION Act, Mr. Speaker, also creates a fair and transparent  process for a comprehensive audit of the VA's physical facilities.  Where are those regions of the country that are underserved? Where are  those regions of the country where consolidation would better serve?   The VA can transform its aging infrastructure. This bill provides a  comprehensive audit process so that we can modernize the VA for today's  veterans. It expands the caregiver program, Mr. Speaker, to provide the  benefits to pre-9/11 veterans so that they are in parity with those  benefits of post-9/11 veterans, and it provides VA provider recruitment  and retention efforts so that our veterans have access to those medical  personnel that they desperately need.   These reforms aren't just supported by those four corners that I  mentioned, the Republicans and Democrats who lead the Veterans' Affairs  Committee in the House and who lead the committees in the Senate, but  they are also supported by over 30 veterans' service organizations from  across the country, Mr. Speaker, as Chairman Roe highlighted in the  Rules Committee just last night.   I don't pretend that these measures do everything for everyone, Mr.  Speaker. They do not. But it is another in a long step of bills making  progress on behalf of the American people. Whether we are talking about  our men and women in law enforcement uniforms, Mr. Speaker, or whether  we are talking about our men and women who have worn our military  uniforms, it is another example of how Chairman Roe  [[Page H3995]]  and Ranking Member Walz and our colleagues in the Senate are taking  steps forward to repay our debts.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, as we have already heard discussed, this rule  would make in order H.R. 2, our Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018.  It doesn't just make in order the base text, Mr. Speaker, it also makes  in order 20 amendments that have been offered by both Republicans and  Democrats in this Chamber who would like to try to make that bill even  better. Twenty amendments have been made in order already, and when we  finish debate here on the floor, my colleague from Massachusetts and I  will return to the Rules Committee upstairs, and we will consider yet  another round of amendments this afternoon so that we can continue to  perfect this bill throughout the week.    Mr. Speaker, one rule, three bills--three bills that have the ability  to make a difference for families across the country north, south,  east, and west. I hope my colleagues will support this rule, get  involved in that underlying debate, and support those bills on final  passage as well.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds to say I agree  with my friend. Asking single, working-age, healthy, nondisabled men to  go to work is going to make their life harder. Going to work every day  is hard. But I would also say to my friend that it is going to make  their life better. It is a value that we should share, not a value that  we should repudiate.   This happens to be an area of disagreement, Mr. Speaker. There are so  many areas of agreement we could be focusing on.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  Walden), the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I agree with my friend. I think, as a general rule, partisan  approaches are the wrong way. This is certainly not what my chairman  desired. It is certainly not where any of us wanted to end up. When  folks walk away from the table, it is where we do in fact end up.   This is the start of the process. This is not the end of the process.  I regret the way that this has sorted out for my ag friends. But we  can't do nothing because folks have gotten up and walked away from the  table. We have to continue to do what our constituents have asked us to  do, and this is a good step in that direction.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the farm economy is the biggest contributor to Georgia  GDP. Georgia families wake up every day back home and go out and often,  in some cases, are working land that their father worked before them  and their grandfather worked before them.   We have had the Georgia Farm Bureau in town pleading with us to bring  some certainty to ag policy.   There are two parts to a farm bill, for all the reasons that folks  who got here long before I did can explain: why it is we do a food  stamp half of a farm bill and an actual farmer half of the farm bill.   It is so often true that the SNAP program gets all the conversation,  Mr. Speaker. But as you heard from my friend from Colorado, while the  money is not where the farmers and those farm families are, that is  certainly where the policy is.   It has been true time and time again that, in a collaborative,  bipartisan, bicameral way, we have come together as a House and a  Senate and moved policy forward to provide market certainty for those  farmers.   You don't always appreciate the farmers in your community, Mr.  Speaker, when you can go to the grocery store and grab anything you  want  [[Page H3998]]  at absolutely any time you want. Those things don't happen by accident.  They happen with a whole lot of sweat equity, a whole lot of risk- taking, and, candidly, with a whole lot of prayer going on across farm  communities in this land.                                time  1345    This bill responds to some of the marketplace needs that we are  finding in the 21st century. You are going to see those collaborative  veins throughout this measure, Mr. Speaker. I hope my colleagues will  look not just at the SNAP program, but also at the certainty that we  will provide to the very hardworking farm families across this country.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, it is my first time on the floor with our new colleague  from Pennsylvania. I appreciate not just his service here, but his  service to our country in general. I feel his pain.   It is a good bill, but it is not a perfect bill, and we have got ways  to do it. I have been here 7 years. I come down here time and time  again to find good bills, Mr. Speaker, and I am always frustrated that  we can't get it there.   What I have determined, Mr. Speaker, that I will share with you and  with my friend from Pennsylvania is that the reason is because you  folks don't agree with me. That is what I have decided is why I can't  get to those perfect bills, because try as I might, I cannot get 434  other people to agree with me on everything all the time.   I will tell my friend from Pennsylvania, Mr. Speaker, the most  discouraging day I have had in this institution was after we passed the  Budget Control Act and we picked four of our finest Republicans and  four of our finest Democrats from the House and also four from the  Senate--Republicans, Democrats--and we locked them in a room together  for 3 months. We said: Look at some of these mandatory spending  programs like you have talked about. Look at the discretionary  programs. Across-the-board budget cuts are nonsensical. They don't  reflect American priorities at all. So get together, talk to one  another, work through it, and figure out a way that we can make the  books balance so we don't mortgage our children's and our  grandchildren's futures but so that we also keep the commitments that  we have made to families today.   They met for 3 months, and they walked out of that room having looked  at hundreds of trillions of dollars in Federal spending and agreed on  not one penny of change together. I cannot tell you, Mr. Speaker--well,  you remember how discouraging that day was.   Moving these dollars from mandatory spending to discretionary  spending is absolutely going to put additional pressures on the budget  process--I see my friend from Minnesota nodding his head; he is a true  champion for our veterans--but, by golly, we have got to stand up and  say yes to those dollars.   I got excoriated back home for voting in favor of raising the  nondefense discretionary limits, but I have to go home and tell the  story of how I am meeting promises to veterans that were not going to  get met otherwise. I have got to go home and tell the story about how I  am meeting promises for children that weren't going to get met  otherwise. And I have got to go home and tell the story of how I don't  have 218 votes to do it my way, and the only way to get anything done  around here is in partnership.   Candidly, Mr. Speaker, we don't have a better example than the  Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Mr. Walz' leadership, Dr. Roe's  leadership. Time and time again, I see these two men go and not follow  their own hearts and passions but try to do what is best for everyone,  try to find a way forward when folks had bet against them and said you  couldn't find a way forward.   I hear the concerns of my new colleague from Pennsylvania, Mr.  Speaker, and I believe he is absolutely right; we are going to run up  against that conversation next year. The question is will we have the  courage to stand up together and fund those priorities next year.   I am looking forward to the great outpouring of bipartisanship we are  going to see in support of the VA MISSION Act today, and I will look  forward to the great outpouring of support when the funding time comes  to make sure we are as committed to those promises tomorrow as we are  together this afternoon.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I do not have any further speakers  remaining, so I am prepared to close when the gentleman from  Massachusetts is, but I will reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, my friend from Minnesota mentioned folks who might be  watching this debate from their offices or from their homes. I think it  is a shame that we don't often get to the core of what some of our  disagreements are.   As we sit here today, it is a fact that there are more job openings  in America than at any other time in American history. That is a fact.   It is a fact that, as we sit here getting ready to move further into  the new millennium, there are more able-bodied single men out of the  workforce than ever before--that is a fact--folks who have decided not  to work.   Now, there is no disagreement in this body about providing food  assistance to hungry kids--none. None. The disagreement in this body is  whether or not, with more job openings than ever before in American  history, with more employers saying they cannot find workers, with more  employers saying ``we need to find new visa programs to get unskilled  labor into America because we don't have enough unskilled workers to do  the work here in America''--should the working families who pay the  bills in this country support able-bodied, childless, healthy men?                                time  1400    That is part of the question, and I would think that is something on  which we can agree. But we are not going to have that pointed  conversation, Mr. Speaker, because there are more sympathetic targets  to go after.   If you walk in to a USDA facility or your State facility that is  administrating and you apply for food stamps, Mr. Speaker, if you  qualify for food stamps, you will get them. You heard my friend from  Massachusetts reference categorical eligibility. That means if you  qualify for a different benefit, not food stamps, we will throw in food  stamps, too.   Well, now, to be fair, that idea came about in some conservative  circles, as well, to say let's eliminate some of the paperwork  requirements. Let's make it easier for folks to apply for a whole host  of benefits. But categorical eligibility, as it exists today, Mr.  Speaker, says you don't qualify for the benefit on your own, but you do  if you--if you qualify for a second benefit, we will give you this one  as well.   Mr. Speaker, saying that you are going to eliminate categorical  eligibility is to say you are going to give food stamps to people who  qualify for food stamps. You are going to give  [[Page H4000]]  SNAP benefits to people who qualify for SNAP benefits. If one wants to  expand the pool of people who qualify for SNAP benefits, that is a  debate that we can have.   But time and time again, Mr. Speaker, there are things on which we  agree in this Chamber. Programs should follow the rules that programs  have. People who qualify should get benefits. People who don't qualify  shouldn't.   We are going to continue to have this conversation in the next couple  of days, and it is going to continue to be highlighted as a source of  vast disagreement among us. But if we were having this same  conversation back home around the dinner table, if we were having this  same conversation back home at a local park or veterans organization,  we would say the very same thing: Hungry kids should have access to  food, on this we agree; and healthy, childless working age men should  have access to a job, on this we agree.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I agree very much with what my friend had to say. She  may be a freshman, but she has got a lot of experience working in  departments of labor putting people to work, and I think that is a goal  that we all share.   And, again, it is a missed opportunity. Undeniably, that is true, and  there is lots of blame to go around about why it is a missed  opportunity. Again, my friend from Massachusetts and I, we are going to  go back up to the Rules Committee this afternoon. We are going to make  some more amendments in order. We are going to work harder to try to  perfect this bill.   But walking away from the table has consequences. Setting lines in  stone has consequences. We are not going to get the best work product  in this Chamber when anybody walks away from the table. I am just going  to stipulate that is true. We never ever will.   But while my friend identified that the program benefits the elderly,  the disabled, and children, and she is right, and it does, and I  support that, she didn't mention those able-bodied, healthy, childless  men who also benefit from the program. And we do those men a  disservice, not a service, when we make that benefit available in the  absence of job searching.   Categorical eligibility--we talk about it today like it is a word  that we are hearing for the very first time. As my colleagues who were  here remember, we have already been to the table  [[Page H4001]]  on categorical eligibility. As my friend from Massachusetts referenced,  States that have nothing to lose by giving away Federal money were  gaming the system by giving away a dollar in State benefits so that  folks could qualify for hundreds of dollars in Federal benefits.   Well, we came together in a bipartisan way and said: Hey, that is not  right. That is not right. Folks should have skin in the game. We should  be working at this together. It shouldn't be a giveaway program. It  should be a helping program. We should be making a difference in  people's lives.   We did that in a collaborative way. We can come back and tell the  story differently today, but we remember coming together and doing  that, and we can come together and do that again, Mr. Speaker. This  isn't going to be our last opportunity. We are going to have another  opportunity.   Nothing goes to the President's desk unless we get 10 Democrats in  the United States Senate to get on board and do it. Collaboration is  not the exception. It is the rule to get things to the President's desk  and to pass new laws of the land.   I wish we could talk more about what those successes are, how we  found those successes in the past, and how we remain committed to  finding those successes again in the future.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I told you when we started this debate, Mr. Speaker, you were going  to hear some passion from my friend from Massachusetts because he is,  in fact, passionate. He is a public servant, and he serves his  constituency well.   But I want to read to you from Politico, one of our Washington, D.C.,  newspapers, that follows what goes on here  [[Page H4005]]  in politics. I don't sit on the Agriculture Committee, as my friend  from Massachusetts does, but Politico reported this, as talks around  the farm bill broke down in March:         Bipartisan negotiations over the farm bill stopped--    There were bipartisan negotiations. Those negotiations stopped, Mr.  Speaker.         Thursday afternoon, after House Agriculture Committee       ranking member Collin Peterson--    The ranking Democrat.       --faced pressure from fellow Democrats, who complained that       discussions about changes to the food stamp program were       being kept secret.    My friend from Massachusetts mentioned that. I have that same  frustration on committees that I serve, Mr. Speaker. Very often, the  chairman of the committee, who is a Republican, and the ranking member,  who is a Democrat, and their subcommittee chairmen very often they get  together and have negotiations before rank-and-file Members get  involved. It happens, and I am frustrated about it, and my friend from  Massachusetts is frustrated about it.         The development--    Politico goes on to say.       --is a considerable blow to the sweeping bill, which was seen       by many as one of the only real chances for bipartisanship in       this Congress. Congress is supposed to reauthorize the farm       bill every 5 years, but political wrangling has threatened       its fate. Current law expires September 30.        Peterson's decision--    Collin Peterson is the ranking Democrat.       --to pause talks comes after House Democrats demanded that he       stop negotiations until the text of the bill is made to       everyone.    The Democratic Members have made clear that they unanimously oppose  the farm bill's SNAP language as it has been described to them or  reported in the press.   Well, Mr. Speaker, if when you hear things you don't like, or see  things you don't like, you leave the negotiating table, I promise you  we are going to get a worse result every single time.   I go up to this Rules Committee, right up here on the third floor,  and we debate and talk and debate and talk and debate and talk hour  upon hour upon hour, late into the evening, often into the next  morning. I hear things I don't like. I hear people say things I know  are not true. But I don't pick up my toys and go home. I stay at the  table, I debate the issues, and I work through the issues. If it was  easy, someone would have done it before this Congress got here. All  that is left is hard.   My friend from Massachusetts is absolutely right, Mr. Speaker. He is  absolutely right. He is absolutely right. If we are to reform the  social safety net, we are going to have to expand benefits, not  restrict them. He is absolutely right. But if we can't stay at the  table to have that conversation, we are never going to bring people  together to get that done.   You can't blame people who follow their self-interest. If the rule  says you don't have to work, you don't have to work. If the rule says  if you work too much, you will lose your benefits, then you don't work  too much. That is crazy to encourage people to stay home.   You ought to be encouraging people to seek that next promotion, take  on those extra hours, work that overtime. That has always been who we  are and what we have done, and we have not taken on that challenge in  welfare reform. I believe we can. I believe we can.   I need my colleagues to support this rule today. I need them to  support the rule so we can bring up not just the farm bill, so that we  can bring up the VA MISSION Act, a bipartisan, bicameral bill that will  go to the President's desk and change the lives of veterans.   I need my colleagues to support this rule, not just so we can bring  up the farm bill, not just so we can bring up the VA MISSION Act, but  so that we can make the harming or threatening the harm of a law  enforcement officer a Federal crime, to give the men and women who wear  blue across this country the protections they deserve.   This is a bipartisan bill, Mr. Speaker, that is going to make a  difference for our constituents back home. These are going to be issues  that get folks exercise, Mr. Speaker. The most difficult issues we take  on always do.   But if we pass this rule and take up this legislation, we will be one  step closer, not just to succeeding for our veterans, not just to  succeeding for our law enforcement officers, not just to succeeding on  behalf of our farmers, but one step closer to taking on what is a  collaborative challenge of how to return the incentives to work to the  American people, while keeping the social safety net strong for all of  the families that depend on it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the  previous question on the resolution.                            Parliamentary Inquiry     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to reclaim the time  that I have yielded back. I would be happy to yield a portion of it to  my friend.    Mr. Speaker, could I inquire how much time is remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for granting my  unanimous consent request to reclaim my time. I do believe that we  advantage all of our causes, rather than disadvantage them, by  promoting debate.   But I want to take issue, Mr. Speaker. I didn't mischaracterize  anything. I read the media reporting. I will be the first--when you  want to have the fake news conversation--there is too much fake news in  this country--I will be happy to join you and have that debate with  you. But I didn't mischaracterize a thing.   I agree with what my friend had to say about Collin Peterson from  Minnesota. He is a fabulous Member, who works as hard as he can on  behalf of his constituents to get work done. Nothing in the article I  read said Collin Peterson walked away from the table. Everything in the  article I read said he  [[Page H4006]]  was pressured by his Democratic colleagues to walk away from the table.    I will not yield again to my friend. I am going to  close.   I take umbrage at the fact that we would have an opportunity to use  each other's time, and you would use it to continue to say I  mischaracterized, that we would have an opportunity to have a  discussion, and you would continue to use it to say that folks just  aren't as well informed as you are about those issues.   We have opportunities in this Chamber to make things better, and we  have opportunities to make things worse. And I will say to my friend,  Mr. Speaker, if we take advantage of our opportunities to make things  better, I believe that we will. If we take advantage of our  opportunities to make things worse, I am absolutely certain that we  will.   I choose the latter. I choose the latter. A vote in support of this  rule is a vote for the latter.   I am sorry, I am choosing the former. I am choosing the former. My  colleagues out there are saying: Hey, I know Woodall; that is not  right. He is not choosing to make things worse.   I choose the former, Mr. Speaker. I choose the former. A vote for  this rule is a vote for the former.   Mr. Speaker, I apologize to the Chair for my confusion.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 891 Offered by Mr. McGovern         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 4. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       5805) to designate certain amounts authorized to be       appropriated for the provision by the Secretary of Veterans       Affairs of hospital care and medical services in non-      Department of Veterans Affairs facilities pursuant to       contracts as changes in concepts and definitions for certain       budgetary purposes, and for other purposes. The first reading       of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate       shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour       equally divided among and controlled by the respective chairs       and ranking minority members of the Committees on Veterans'       Affairs and the Budget. After general debate the bill shall       be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At       the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the       Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with       such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and       amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit with or without       instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports       that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the       next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the       third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV,       resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 5805.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
