 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Coachella Valley's  very own, Librado ``Lee'' Espinoza, an icon, a legend in the boxing  ring, and an inspiration to us all.   From picking peanuts in the fields of Michoacan, Mexico, to training  world-renowned boxers on the national stage, Lee is a fighter.   The owner of the Coachella Valley Boxing Club, Lee is truly the  godfather of boxing in the valley. He has trained world champions and  put Coachella on the map for producing some of the best boxers in the  game.   Born in 1949, in La Piedad, Michoacan, Lee's success stems from his  humble beginnings. In his early years, he worked on his father's farm,  picking peanuts alongside his grandfather. After the devastating loss  of his father, Lee eventually moved to the U.S. with his mother, where  they lived in Coachella and, later, Tulare. Ultimately, Lee settled  back in Coachella in the Coachella Valley, where he married his wife,  June, and worked as a foreman installing irrigation systems.   Together, June and Lee had four children: Vince, Luis, Reuben, and  Candy. It was his son Reuben whose interest in boxing and winning big  trophies opened the door for Lee to become the coach that he is today.  Lee took Reuben to the Indio Boys and Girls Club every day after work  to train with his coach, Lalo Gutierrez, who, in turn, taught him the  ways of coaching.   When Lee took over coaching for Lalo, he formed a boxing club that  competed successfully against others throughout southern California and  Arizona.   While training in a cramped, single room in Indio, Lee's steadfast  dedication as a coach shined through in the success of the athletes he  guided both inside and outside the ring.   His first professional fighter, Francisco ``Pancho'' Segura, fought  twice for the International Boxing Federation world featherweight title  and competed in the 1984 Olympic tryouts.   Even when Pancho decided it was time to retire, Lee helped him find a  job so that he could take care of his family. You see, that is the  thing about Lee. When he is in your corner, you know that he is going  to do everything that he can to help you succeed. In the ring and out  of the ring, he is truly a caring man, a man of character with a lion's  heart of gold.  [[Page H7078]]    In 1985, he officially opened the Coachella Valley Boxing Club in an  old fire station next to Coachella City Hall. What started as a club  with six kids quickly grew to 50.   Over the years, he has trained outstanding athletes like Sandra  ``Sandy'' Yard, who won two International Female Boxing Association  world titles; Randy Caballero, an International Boxing Federation World  Champion; the Diaz brothers, Joel, Jesus, Antonio, and Julio, each of  whom won national titles and competed before international audiences;  and Jocelyn Camarillo, from Indio, who won the 2021 USA Boxing National  Championships.   For Pancho, Sandy, Randy, the Diaz brothers, Jocelyn, and countless  others he has trained, Lee's mentorship did more than help them triumph  in the ring. His relentless devotion to their growth laid the  foundation for their long-term success.   Through his own success and his own stories, he has given the  athletes that he has trained someone to look up to and something to  fight for. His contributions to our communities have shaped our  valley's history and left a lasting mark on the sport of boxing.   In fact, he has been inducted into the California Boxing Hall of Fame  and the West Coast Boxing Hall of Fame for all that he has achieved.   Growing up in Coachella, I was personally inspired by Lee and his  grit, determination, and work ethic. I looked up to Lee because I knew  he was making a difference in our humble farmworker community.   It is my hope that by telling his story here today and recording it  in our Nation's history, athletes across the country and future  generations will also be inspired and will feel that same sense of hope  that he has given to many of us in our valley and across the Nation.                            ____________________
