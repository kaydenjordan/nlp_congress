 Mr. Speaker, summer is the hungriest time of year for over  11 million children currently facing food insecurity. That is 11  million children who rely on school meals as their only meal of the  day.   The Federal waivers that provide free or reduced-price meals-- especially during the prolonged school closures--are set to expire at  the end of the month, leaving far too many students without a reliable  food source.   Local schools are facing an uphill battle: Four-decade high  inflation, skyrocketing costs of food, and supply chain disruptions  have made for unique challenges in my district and across the country.   The Keep Kids Fed Act will transition schools--and the families  served--back to paid school meal programs without increasing costs to  taxpayers.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be a cosponsor to the Keep Kids Fed Act,  and I urge Congress to do its part and pass this important legislation.                            ____________________
