 Mr. President, I would like to recognize the John F.  Kennedy Space Center--KSC--for celebrating its 60th anniversary, which  we observed on July 1, 2022. While the complex was not named after  President Kennedy until November 29, 1963, it was on July 1 six decades  ago that the launch operations center on Merritt Island, FL, was  created.   Since the Apollo program in 1968, every U.S. crewed orbital  spaceflight has launched from the Kennedy Space Center property, making  it the unambiguous leader in American spaceflight. The National  Aeronautics and Space Administration--NASA--has carried out launch  operations for its Apollo, Skylab, and space shuttle programs from  Launch Complex 39, managed by KSC's personnel. For the past 60 years,  millions of Americans have visited the area to watch astronauts slip  the face of Earth and explore the final frontier.   After the retirement of the Space Shuttle program in 2011, the  Kennedy Space Center transformed from a government-focused launch base  to a multi-user spaceport. Today, it provides a home to more than 90  private-sector partners and nearly 250 partnership agreements in  support of different vehicles, systems, and launch providers, enabling  a new era of space exploration. The Kennedy Space Center further  contributes to our Nation's space program through the Exploration  Ground Systems, as well as the Commercial Crew, Exploration Research  and Technology, and Launch Services Programs.   As NASA prepares for the launch of Artemis I at KSC, the center  remains a cornerstone of Florida's economy by employing thousands of  civil servants and government contractors throughout the State's Space  Coast.   I express my thanks and deepest gratitude to the many hard-working  men and women at the Kennedy Space Center as they continue to advance  American space exploration further into the 21st century.                            ____________________
