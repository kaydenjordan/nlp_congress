 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment,  based on the bipartisan Documents for Continued Safety Act that I  introduced with Resident Commissioner Gonzalez-Colon of Puerto Rico.   This amendment would allow STOP grants from the Department of Justice  to be used to replace vital documents for survivors of domestic  violence, free of cost. Some survivors grab all they can when they  flee, leaving vital documents behind. Other didn't have access to their  vital docs.   Rebuilding can be tough, but our amendment will help survivors turn  the page and write a new chapter, on their terms, safe and free.                                time  1230
