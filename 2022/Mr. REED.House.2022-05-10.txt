 Mr. Speaker, after almost 12 years in Congress, today is my  last day. It has been an honor to serve with you all from both parties.  I love this institution as it still exemplifies what is best about our  government. We are the people's House. While I am proud that we put  people before politics, there is much more to do. I am leaving to  continue that work and hope to have a greater impact on our country.   I believe the current focus on extremism demands us to heed the words  Abraham Lincoln uttered years ago as we face a similar threat to our  existence today--a house divided cannot stand. But I add--a house  united will not fail. It is time for petty political posturing to end.  Leadership must emerge and in God I trust. His divine protection will  extend again if only we acknowledge and accept His love and the divine  spark that exists in each of us as citizens of our great Nation.  [[Page H4727]]    I thank my family, who without their love and support I am nothing. I  also thank the people who have worked for us and helped so many. I am  grateful.   My most profound appreciation is for the people of western New York.  Thank you for giving a country lawyer, the youngest of 12, raised by a  single mother, whose father passed away when I was just 2 years old,  the honor of representing you at the highest level. Only in America can  such a dream come true.   I humbly bid farewell and submit my resignation as a Member of the  House. I wish you all Godspeed.                            ____________________
