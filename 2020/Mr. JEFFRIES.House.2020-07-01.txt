 Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished chair of the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for yielding and for his  tremendous leadership as it relates to the Moving Forward Act.   House Democrats throughout the 116th Congress have been working on  lowering healthcare costs and bigger paychecks leading with an emphasis  on fixing our crumbling bridges, roads, tunnels, airports, mass  transportation system, public schools, public housing, and all other  aspects of infrastructure.    I oppose this amendment because Davis-Bacon protections are central  to the effort to deliver a living wage to everyday Americans.   Here in this country, when you work hard and play by the rules, you  should be able to provide a comfortable living for yourself and for  your family. But that basic contract has been broken. It is broken  because of the globalization of our economy. It is broken because of  the outsourcing of good-paying American jobs. It is broken because of  poorly negotiated trade deals. It is broken because of the rise of  automation. And it is broken because of the decline in unionization.   So the central question that we face in the aftermath of the Great  Recession and now in the midst of another dramatic economic decline is,  will we be able to preserve the great American middle class and all  those who aspire to be part of it? That is what Davis-Bacon prevailing  wage protections are all about. And we on this side of the aisle stand  with those everyday Americans, stand with those hardworking Americans,  yes, stand with those unionized Americans who are pursuing the American  Dream, and we should be facilitating that, not undermining it here in  the United States Congress.   Vote ``no'' against this amendment.
