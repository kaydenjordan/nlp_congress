 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call for bold action to lower  the cost of prescription drugs.   Over the last year, I have held 15 townhalls across Burlington and  Ocean Counties, and the number one issue I continue to hear about is  the high cost of drugs and healthcare.   We have a real chance right now to pass critical legislation that  will have a tangible and real impact on the lives of the people we  serve:   By passing H.R. 3, we can help lower the cost of critical drugs like  insulin for the tens of thousands of New Jersyans struggling with  diabetes.   By passing H.R. 3, we can save lives by making cancer medication more  affordable.   By passing H.R. 3, we can finally deliver comprehensive dental,  vision, and hearing benefits for seniors under Medicare, including over  130,000 people in our district.   And by passing H.R. 3, we can expand access to the Medicare Savings  Program, a provision I was proud to introduce and champion to help 3.5  million seniors afford quality healthcare.   Mr. Speaker, we must take big, bold action because the challenges  that our neighbors face in affording their healthcare is critical. I  hope my colleagues will join me in passing this bill and making an  impact we can all be proud of.                            ____________________
