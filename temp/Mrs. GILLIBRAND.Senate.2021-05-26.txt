 Madam President, I rise to once again call for this  entire body to have the opportunity to consider the Military Justice  Improvement and Increasing Prevention Act, which would ensure people in  the military who have been subjected to sexual assault and other  serious crimes get the justice they deserve.   I rise on behalf of the supporters of this bill, including a  bipartisan, filibuster-proof group of 65 Senators, major veterans  service organizations, and the veterans they represent. Every day we  delay a vote on this bill is another day that their voices are being  silenced.   Our legislation makes the commonsense reform that our veterans and  our servicemembers have asked for. It takes a decision on whether to  prosecute serious crimes out of the chain of command and moves it to  independent, trained, military prosecutors. This will create a system  that is free of bias and capable of fairly trying these complex crimes.   This legislation, as I mentioned, is supported by the Nation's major  veterans service organizations. These organizations recognize that this  reform would build a military justice system worthy of the service of  our members--a system that delivers justice, consequences, and  convictions.   This bill is supported by the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of  America. Their CEO, Jeremy Butler said:         The status quo with our military chain of command's       response to military sexual assault is not working and this       continuing threat to our military requires this commonsense       solution to protect our servicemembers.    It is supported by the American Legion, which recognizes that this  legislation will ``improv[e] the system by which the Department of  Defense investigates and prosecutes reported cases of military sexual  trauma so that it is on par with the civilian system.''   It is supported by Protect Our Defenders. Retired Col. Don  Christensen, the president of Protect Our Defenders said:         Every year, generals come before Congress and tell Congress       that sexual assault is a cancer in the force. This is a       readiness issue. This is a force protection issue. This is an       issue that drives out thousands of good men and women every       year who want to serve. This [reform] will finally see the       justice that our members deserve and the prevention they       deserve.    It is supported by the Vietnam Veterans of America. In a letter of  support for this legislation, national president John Rowan wrote:         After decades of hearing that the military will not       tolerate military sexual assaults and that it has zero       tolerance of such, the numbers continue to climb.    Vietnam Veterans of America believes it is time to make real change  to the process if real action is to be taken in its attention to the  victims and the violence. Fear of reporting the crime of sexual assault  is a barrier in addressing the justice these victims deserve. Their  legal counsel and defense counsel should be no less than a civilian  receives in our court system.   This bill is supported by the Veterans of Foreign Wars, which  accounts for more than 1.5 million veterans as members. It is supported  by Common Defense. It is supported by SWAN, the Service Women's Action  Network. It is supported by the Veterans Recovery Project. It is  supported by the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence and the  National Coalition Against Domestic Violence.   These are veterans. These are our constituents, our fellow Americans,  and these are people who have put their lives on the line for this  country and seen firsthand the way the current  [[Page S3485]]  military justice system fails our servicemembers. They know better than  anyone else what change needs to be made, and they are asking to pass  this bill.   Do not silence their voices. Let this vote come to the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at a  time to be determined by the majority leader in consultation with the  Republican leader, the Senate Armed Services Committee be discharged  from further consideration of S. 1520 and the Senate proceed to its  consideration; that there be 2 hours of debate equally divided in the  usual form; and that upon the use or yielding back of the time, the  Senate vote on the bill with no intervening action or debate.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I yield back all time, and I support  this amendment.
