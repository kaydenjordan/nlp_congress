 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on  the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order  that a quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today on Religious  Freedom Day to celebrate the numerous faiths that people hold across  this great Nation.   Today, we commemorate the 232nd anniversary of the passing of a State  law that has shaped and secured our important legacy on religious  liberty.   On January 16, 1786, the Virginia General Assembly passed the  Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom. The bill, written by Thomas  Jefferson, states: ``. . . all men shall be free to profess, and by  argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of reli- gion. . . . ''   Just a few years later, this bill served as the inspiration for the  First Amendment, which affirms our right to choose and exercise faith  without government coercion or retaliation.   Today, Americans from diverse ethnic and religious backgrounds remain  committed to the values of faith, honesty, integrity, and patriotism.   Mr. Speaker, our Constitution and laws guarantee Americans the right  not just to believe as they see fit, but to freely exercise their  religion.   We observe this day in our homes and schools and houses of worship  because we have the freedom and the right to do so.                            ____________________
