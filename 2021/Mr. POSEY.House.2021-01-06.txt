 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the objection.    Madam Speaker, as you have heard from both sides of the  aisle over and over and over today and tonight, Members of Congress  take an oath to protect and defend the Constitution.   Clearly, the Constitution says State legislatures make voting laws,  period, end of subject. And, clearly, in Pennsylvania and some other  States, nonlegislators changed those voting laws.   No matter who wins or who loses, those are violations of the  Constitution whether you, me, or anyone else likes it or not.   As Congressman Davidson pointed out, over a dozen FBI agents were  immediately dispatched to fully investigate Bubba Wallace's garage  door. But, sadly, the FBI never responded to my request to investigate  massive voting irregularity accusations, like the video footage from  Georgia that we all wished we didn't see.   Neither has the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of  State, the Postal Inspector General, the Director of National  Intelligence, the CIA, and, saddest of all, the U.S. Department of  Justice.   The right to vote is not only a constitutional right, it is also a  civil right, and we must protect it. Running a fair and transparent  election is not something America should run away from. It is something  we must live up to.   Every eligible American has a right to have their vote counted and  the right to feel confident that his or her vote was counted, not  neutralized by an illegal vote.                                time  0220    Otherwise, I fear our Republic is doomed. That is why I implore you  to support a full investigation.   Madam Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the fine gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly).
