 Madam Speaker, I rise today for former Representative  Katie Hill and the people of California's 25th District.   Madam Speaker, 261 days ago, Republicans and Democrats came together  in this Chamber to pass meaningful legislation to address our Nation's  gun violence epidemic.   Madam Speaker, 261 days ago, Members representing cities, suburbs,  and rural America did their job and voted to pass commonsense reforms  that 89 percent of Americans support.   Madam Speaker, 261 days ago, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  could have done his job and brought those bills to the floor of the  United States Senate, but he did not; and now, once again, we watch  shooting after shooting occur across our country.   Yesterday, Saugus High School in Santa Clarita, California, was added  to the lengthy list of sites of senseless tragedy.   We fought for the will of the people--89 percent of Americans. We  crafted legislation that will save lives. We passed the bill. We did  our jobs. It is time for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to do  his.   Enough is enough. Children are dying.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment to add  sexual orientation and gender identity to the agency's Office of  Minority and Women Inclusion standards for workforce diversity.   The bill already requires the agency's newly established Office of  Minority and Women Inclusion to develop standards for equal employment  opportunity in the racial, ethnic, and gender diversity of the  workforce and senior management of the agency.   This agency, which aims to develop a level playing field for American  businesses in the global economy, must be representative of and able to  understand all businesses across the country. True diversity includes  representation of the LGBTQ community.   That is why I have offered this amendment to add consideration of  sexual orientation and gender identity as part of the agency's equal  opportunity and diversity standards for its own workforce.   Mr. Chair, I ask that my colleagues join me in supporting this  amendment. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina for  his comments. I also thank the chair for her leadership on this bill.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment to add  LGBTQ-owned businesses to the United States Export Finance Agency's  small business outreach plan.   American businesses, specifically small businesses, are the backbone  of our economy and a cornerstone of the American Dream.   The bill before us today requires the agency to develop a  comprehensive outreach plan to ensure small business owners are aware  of the financing options available to them through the agency. This  plan already includes an emphasis on outreach to businesses  [[Page H8891]]  owned by women, minorities, veterans, and persons with disabilities.   I believe it is critical we include an emphasis on outreach to LGBTQ  entrepreneurs as well, who create jobs across the country and  contribute hundreds of billions of dollars to the U.S. economy every  year.   My amendment ensures all Americans, regardless of who they are or who  they love, can access the tools needed to jump-start their American  Dream and contribute to our economy.   It is a simple, but meaningful, step to ensure greater equality on  Main Streets across the United States.   Mr. Chair, I ask that my colleagues join me in supporting this  amendment. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina for  his support for the bill, and once again I thank Madam Chair for her  extraordinary leadership on this bill.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
