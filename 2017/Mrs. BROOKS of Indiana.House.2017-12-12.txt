 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in favor of H.R. 1733.   Like many Hoosiers, I believe in the value of recycling and the  benefits it brings to Indiana and our country. This bill would help us  understand how we can better recycle lubricating oil.   H.R. 1733 requires a 2006 study mandated by the Energy Policy Act of  2005 be updated to reflect current information about the benefits or  re-refined lubricating oil and how its production and use could be  increased in the country.   Re-refining removes contaminants from the oil and blends additives to  restore the oil to its original effectiveness. Used oil can be re- refined infinitely and is suitable for use in many types of gas and  diesel engines. In fact, the Federal Government already requires re- refined oil to be used within many agencies' vehicle fleets and many  State and local governments require its use as well.   Ensuring that Congress has up-to-date data on the value of recycled  oil will allow legislators to make smarter decisions when developing  environmental and energy policies moving forward. By updating this  study, companies across the country that produce re-refined oil, like  Indiana's own Crystal Clean, will have a better understanding of the  latest trends regarding this product and how they can better anticipate  the needs of the Federal Government.   I am proud to say that Members on both sides of the aisle supported  this bill when it passed through the Energy and Commerce Committee  because it is environmentally conscious and supports an all-of-the- above energy strategy.   I thank my colleague, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy)  for his continued support on this bill, and the Ranking Member on the  Energy Subcommittee, Mr. Rush, as we introduced this together earlier  this year to move this through committee.  [[Page H9809]]    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure.
