 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Nadler for  yielding.   In Texas, many years ago, I marched in support of the equal rights  amendment. Today, I join my colleagues to reaffirm that support.   Women are behind some of this Nation's greatest achievements. We  fought for civil rights, set athletic records, sent men to space, and  then went there ourselves. We have forged  [[Page H1135]]  our paths in history, yet we are still not equal to men under the eyes  of the law.   We must remove this stain from our Constitution. Today, we are voting  to remove an arbitrary deadline so we can finally prohibit gender  discrimination under the Constitution.   Madam Speaker, I will proudly vote in favor of the resolution, and I  urge all my colleagues to do the same.   As many in my district would say, ``It is time to approve the ERA.''  ``Ya es hora de aprobar el ERA.''
