 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Speaker Kevin  McCarthy.   Under his leadership and a very small, five-seat majority, House  Republicans have achieved, contrary to popular belief, numerous  victories. We passed the Parents Bill of Rights; the Lower Energy Costs  Act to lower the cost of gasoline and restore American energy  independence; the Fiscal Responsibility Act, which was one of the  largest enacted cuts with enforceable spending caps in American  history; and H.R. 2, the most conservative southern border security  bill in history--all of this while fully funding our military and our  Nation's veterans.   Let me be abundantly clear: Attempting to remove Speaker McCarthy  will put this House in a stalemate and paralyze our ability to fight  for our constituents and instead create a fight amongst one another.   We have 43 days to restore fiscal responsibility and advance  conservative appropriations priorities, which is exactly what my  colleagues have asked for. Instead, we are threatening any House  proceedings.                                time  1545    This is an unnecessary distraction. Working together under the  leadership of Speaker McCarthy is of the utmost importance.   Mr. Speaker, I stand and strongly support Kevin McCarthy for Speaker  of the House, and I encourage my Republican colleagues to do the same.
