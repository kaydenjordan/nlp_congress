 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  following disposition of the joint resolution, the Senate proceed to  executive session to consider Executive Calendar No. 175, Jeremy C.  Daniel, of Illinois, to be United States District Judge for the  Northern District of Illinois; further, that the Senate recess from 4  p.m. to 5:30 p.m. for the all-Senators briefing.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
