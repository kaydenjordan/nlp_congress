 Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 1, line 16, strike ``$25,000,000,000'' and insert       ``$10,000,000,000''.        Page 2, line 20, strike ``30,000'' and insert ``20,000''.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 647, the  gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman) and a Member opposed each will  control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.    Mr. Speaker, this bill began with a proposal by Mr.  Luetkemeyer of Missouri two Congresses ago. Last Congress, I introduced  it, and now the gentlewoman from New York is carrying the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I wouldn't be here supporting this bill in any form if  it undermined Dodd-Frank--I cosponsored Dodd-Frank--or if it undermined  the CFPB, an institution that I think is very important and was created  by Dodd-Frank.   With the amendment that I am proposing, this bill goes back to the  text that I introduced last year. That text came before the Financial  Services Committee and secured the vote of all Republicans and 60  percent of the Democrats. Now, you can't get all the votes all the  time, but if you can get, for any particular draft, 100 percent of the  Republicans and 60 percent of the Democrats on the committee, that, I  think, is bipartisan legislation.   Now, the first part of this bill and, by far, the most important part  deals with loans made by small institutions that would otherwise be  required to have an impound account. An impound account is when the  bank collects from you not only your mortgage payment but collects,  every month, some money toward your property taxes and toward your  insurance, and then the bank pays those bills for you.   Small institutions are not set up in order to keep track of how much  property tax to collect and pay or fire and other homeowners insurance.  They would rather rely on the borrower, somebody they know, to pay  their fire insurance, to pay their property taxes.   Now, we can count on them to make sure that they are not giving this  responsibility to somebody who can't handle it, because they are  required, under this bill, to hold the mortgage for 3 years in their  portfolio.   Keep in mind that the whole requirement only relates to the first 5  years. So here, they have to keep it in their portfolio for 3 years.  This, I think, ensures that the bank or credit union or other small  institution will make sure that the property taxes and property  insurance are paid, while, at the same time, it won't take out of the  market those small institutions that can't set up special impound  accounts.   A second part of this bill deals with simply telling the CFPB to make  whatever adjustments it thinks are appropriate for small institutions  with regard to the small servicer exemption. That leaves that authority  with the CFPB. Under this amendment, the rule, whatever they decide to  do for smaller institutions applies to those that are servicing not  30,000, but only 20,000 total loans, because it makes sense to have  different, less complicated rules for smaller servicers.   So I don't think my amendment is sufficient to gain support for the  bill from the ranking member. The bill in its amended form, it was  sufficient to get 60 percent of the Democrats to vote for it in  committee last year.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from New York for her  work on this issue and what I understand is her support for this  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, seeing no further speakers, I yield back  the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the previous question  is ordered on the bill, as amended, and on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman).   The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from  California (Mr. Sherman).   The amendment was agreed to.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third  reading of the bill.  [[Page H9807]]    The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was  read the third time.                                time  1330                              Motion to Recommit
