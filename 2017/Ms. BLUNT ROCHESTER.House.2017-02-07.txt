 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.J. Res.  57 today for two reasons. I believe that the majority's repeated use of  the Congressional Review Act this week  [[Page H1051]]  and last week is unnecessary, constraining, and, in this case, adds  cost. The Congressional Review Act has only been used successfully in  2000 one time, and already this month the House is considering its  eighth joint resolution of disapproval.   I believe in our role of oversight of the executive branch, but using  the blunt tool of the CRA to block regulatory action in an effort to  support and improve public education is an abuse of the CRA. The newly  confirmed Secretary of Education can already amend targeted rules like  the one this resolution is addressing without fully repealing the  guidance and preventing similar rules in the future.   The Every Student Succeeds Act was a major bipartisan accomplishment,  and I am particularly concerned about the uncertainty for the States  and local stakeholders caused by repealing these accountability  standards in the underlying rule.   In Delaware, just as in States across the country, local stakeholder  groups and State departments of education have been working together to  provide thorough feedback and guidance on these accountability rules  that the majority wants to repeal.   I have heard from my State board of education that repealing these  regulations would cause States to delay the development of their plans,  potentially costing them both time and money to gather feedback on a  significantly different set of guidelines for the plan, and, most  importantly, further delaying the implementation of changes to the  education system that our students need and deserve.   Mr. Speaker, my question to my colleagues would be: Why get rid of  the whole rule when it comes from a bill that ultimately happened in  such a bipartisan way? Why prevent accountability and guidance for  States?    I will oppose H.J. Res. 57, Mr. Speaker, and I  urge my colleagues to oppose H.J. Res. 57.                                time  1615
