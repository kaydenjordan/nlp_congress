 Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for allowing me 2  minutes.   We are here today to talk about a global problem that demands a  global solution. Since the Industrial Revolution, a significant amount  of carbon has been building up in the atmosphere; and, until just  recently, the United States was the number one emitter of carbon  pollution.   As China ramped up its emissions, we lost that dubious title, but we  are still dumping massive amounts of carbon into the atmosphere.   This carbon in the atmosphere has caused energy to accumulate in the  oceans and the skies, and that is now causing changes in our  environment. And these changes will continue to grow.   The global solution we need is one that the United States actually  had a hand in crafting. We led the efforts in the development and  adoption of the Paris climate accord; but now, because of this  administration's decision, we are telling the world to do as we say,  not as we do.   The Paris climate accord is one of the most comprehensive deals to  date and is a worldwide agreement to begin reducing carbon emissions.  It is the important first step in the battle to stop the dangerous  spiral of climate change.   If we retreat from the Paris accord, we are condemning future  generations to a world filled with catastrophic climate change and  conflict.   H.R. 9 will help heal this rift by putting us in alignment with the  rest of the global community and holding us to standards that we helped  put in place.   My Republican colleagues say they believe in climate change but have  always refused action.   The Paris climate agreement is action. Let's get with the program.   The United States has led by example, so, today, I inform my  colleagues: Adopt H.R. 9. Don't make us the past villain for future  generations.
