 Mr. President, I rise today to honor a longtime  advocate for sustainable living and conservation who has worked  tirelessly to make the world around her a better, healthier place.   Kathy Hadley is retiring from her position as the executive director  of the National Center for Appropriate Technology in Butte, MT. For  over 30 years, Kathy has devoted her life to NCAT's mission:  championing small-scale, local, and sustainable solutions to reduce  poverty, promote healthy communities, and protect natural resources.   Kathy has had a hand in some of the most important conservation  movements of the past 30 years, and programs at NCAT under her  direction have ranged from developing energy-saving strategies for low- income communities to helping out farmers looking to adopt more  sustainable farming practices, as well as AmeriCorps program that gives  young people an opportunity to serve the public while working towards  clean air and clean water.   I am particularly fond of the Armed-to-Farm Program, which teaches  veterans the ins and outs of farming.   Her career has also led her to distinguished service with the  National Wildlife Federation, where she fought to ensure wildlife  continues to thrive in our rapidly changing world.   I am thankful for Kathy's commitment to the environment, to  sustainability, and to building a better future for our children and  grandchildren. She has left an indelible mark on Montana and on the  world, and I wish her and her husband Wayne and their two sons, Erik  and Liam, the best.   Enjoy your retirement, and job well done.                            ____________________
