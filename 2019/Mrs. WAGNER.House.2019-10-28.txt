 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I appreciate the majority moving H.R. 2514, the COUNTER Act of 2019,  again, this week, as a standalone piece of legislation.   Both Republicans and Democrats agree, protecting the financial system  from bad actors is a priority. We must give financial institutions the  tools and resources they need to fight these bad actors.   According to a 2016 report by the U.S. Government Accountability  Office, from January 2009 to December 2015, Federal agencies assessed  roughly $5.1 billion in fines, forfeitures, and penalties for  violations of the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering  regulations, often referred to as BSA/AML.   A separate 2016 analysis of anti-money laundering enforcement found  that penalties and fines for BSA violations significantly increased  since the 2008 financial crisis. This report concluded that regulators  had become more aggressive in pursuing BSA violations in the wake of  the crisis.   However, this data is from 2016. We know that the current enforcement  regime is outdated. Technology has outpaced the tools and resources  available to Federal agencies to pursue these bad actors.   H.R. 2514 makes important changes to strengthen BSA and AML  enforcement. The bill includes key aspects of the BSA/AML reform  package from last Congress, including a provision that allows for  tailored information-sharing by financial institutions with their  foreign branches to better identify suspicious activity.   The bill also includes important updates to the reporting thresholds  for Suspicious Activities Reports, or SARs.   H.R. 2514 reforms the SAR framework by requiring the Financial Crimes  Enforcement Network to carry out a study examining whether the current  SAR thresholds are adequate.   This study will provide the necessary data to alter the current SAR  filing regime in the future. There is clearly a recognition on both  sides of the aisle that the status quo is unacceptable.   The bill also encourages greater innovation, ensures efficiency, and  requires treasury to play a prominent role in coordinating AML policy.  These measures will help ensure that the most effective AML policies  are being used to stop terrorists and bad actors.    I want to thank the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Cleaver) and the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Stivers) for all their hard work and effort on  this bill.   Additionally, I want to thank the gentleman from Missouri (Mr.  Luetkemeyer), the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Riggleman), and the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Gonzalez).   Mr. Speaker, their priorities have made the bill stronger, and more  focused, which will enable the Treasury Department and other Federal  agencies to carry out critical anti-money laundering processes.   I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 2514, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I thank and congratulate the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.   David  Scott), my good friend, on so much heavy lifting and the work that he  has done to bring this bipartisan piece of legislation to the floor,  along with our former colleague from Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy) who was also  very involved with you, Madam Speaker, on this bipartisan piece of  legislation, H.R. 4067.   According to the most recent FDIC survey of unbanked and underbanked  households, 6.5 percent of U.S. households were unbanked in 2017,  meaning no one in the household had a checking or savings account. That  equates to approximately 8.4 million American households.                                time  1715    The same survey showed that an additional 18.7 percent of households  were underbanked, meaning that the household had a bank account but  also obtained financial services outside the mainstream banking system.  That is more than 24 million U.S. households composed of nearly 50  million adults and 15 million children, Madam Speaker.   These statistics point to the staggering number of Americans who have  limited access to traditional banking services.   While these numbers have, thankfully, declined since the financial  crisis, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Office of Community  Affairs has and continues to engage in efforts to examine the unbanked  and underbanked, as well as allocate resources to Americans who remain  credit invisible.   The Office of Community Affairs works with the CFPB's Office of  Research and the Office of Fair Lending to examine credit deserts and  equip communities with tools for financial education.   The Bureau's Your Money, Your Goals program offers a variety of  materials to help consumers pursue financial empowerment and resources  for organizations aimed at helping financially vulnerable individuals.   Despite the progress that has been made, this remains an important  issue that merits our attention. By further directing the CFPB's Office  of Community Affairs to focus its work toward the underserved, we are  working to assure these consumers are not overlooked.   This bill reaffirms our intent to engage in efforts to examine the  unbanked and underbanked and identify solutions to deliver resources to  Americans who remain credit invisible.   All Americans deserve access to the basic financial tools that will  help them achieve financial independence, and this bill takes an  important step in promoting financial inclusion and providing access to  all Americans.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.   David Scott)  for all of his tireless efforts on this bill, and I urge my colleagues  to support the Financial Inclusion in Banking Act.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am ready to yield back if the gentleman  is ready to close.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, will the gentleman yield?    Madam Speaker, I share the gentleman from Georgia's  sentiment completely, and we are grateful to Sean Duffy. We wish him  and his family the very, very best in making the choice to choose to  put his family first and retire from this wonderful institution.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.   David Scott)  for yielding to me to say a word or two about my friend, Mr. Duffy.   Madam Speaker, I urge passage of this wonderful, bipartisan piece of  legislation, H.R. 4067.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1865, the National Law  Enforcement Museum Commemorative Coin Act.   I would like to also thank the gentleman from New Jersey,  Representative Pascrell, and my colleague, Senator Blunt from Missouri,  for all of their hard work on this important, bipartisan piece of  legislation.   Madam Speaker, in 2000, Congress authorized the creation of the  National Law Enforcement Museum, and just 18 years later, the museum  was formally opened on October 13, 2018, in Washington, D.C., across  the street from the National Law Enforcement Memorial.   Every day, our Nation's law enforcement officers put their uniforms  on and go to work not knowing if they will make it home. They  selflessly protect us while asking nothing in return.   The establishment of this museum serves as a reminder of the great  sacrifices that law enforcement officers make. By educating the public  on their work, the museum serves as a vital resource in sharing the  daily experiences of our men and women in uniform.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 1865, the National Law Enforcement Museum  Commemorative Coin Act, directs the U.S. Treasury to mint a coin in  2021 in commemoration of the opening of the National Law Enforcement  Museum here in Washington, D.C.   Additionally, the proceeds of this important commemorative coin will  go to support the National Law Enforcement Museum and to ensure that it  is able to maintain a robust and diverse level of programming.   Madam Speaker, the passage of H.R. 1865 will greatly honor our  Nation's law enforcement and further support this remarkable  institution. We should do our part by passing this bipartisan piece of  legislation to create this commemorative coin.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, it is now my privilege to yield 3 minutes  to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Rutherford), the Republican lead and  cochair of the Law Enforcement Caucus.    Madam Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2423, the Women's Suffrage  Centennial Commemorative Coin Act.   I thank the gentlewoman from New York, Congresswoman Stefanik, my  good friend, who has introduced and brought this bill forward to the  floor, as well as the gentlewoman from Tennessee, Senator Blackburn,  for their tireless work on this commemorative coin bill. Congresswoman  Stefanik, Senator Blackburn, and all of the women in our conference  have been tireless supporters of this issue. 2020 marks the 100th  anniversary of the passage of the 19th Amendment guaranteeing and  protecting a woman's constitutional right to vote in this country.   I would be remiss if I did not recognize and honor the work of the  late Congresswoman Jeannette Rankin. Congresswoman Rankin founded the  Committee on Woman Suffrage, which led the fight in the House of  Representatives for the constitutional amendment that would grant  women, nationwide, the right to vote. It is these efforts for equality  that we are commemorating today.   This historic centennial offers an unparalleled opportunity to  commemorate a milestone of democracy and to shed light on and honor the  legacy of pioneers and patriots who blazed new trails to lead women to  the voting booth.   Beginning in July of 1848, the first women's rights convention was  held in Seneca Falls, New York. Yet, it was not until August of 1920,  140 years after signing the Declaration of Independence, that the fight  for a woman's right to vote concluded in Nashville, Tennessee.   Mr. Speaker, Tennessee became the 36th and final State needed to  ratify the 19th Amendment, marking the single largest extension of  voting rights in our Nation's history, enfranchising 27 million  American women.   Mr. Speaker, this bill will help ensure that the upcoming  anniversary, and the 72 years of tireless perseverance by three  generations of dedicated suffragists who sought to overturn centuries  of law and millennia of tradition, are commemorated and celebrated  throughout the United States.                                time  1745    Mr. Speaker, additionally, the Women's Suffrage Centennial  Commemorative Coin Act will not cost any taxpayer dollars. All funding  will come from the sale of the coins to private citizens, with proceeds  from the coin going to support the Smithsonian Institution's American  Women's History Initiative.   This initiative is intended to be the Nation's most comprehensive  undertaking to document, research, collect, display, and share the rich  and compelling story of women in America.   Mr. Speaker, passage of H.R. 2423 will honor this unforgettable  movement and support educating our future generations about the fight  for women's equality. We should do our part by passing this legislation  to create this commemorative coin.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Ms. Stefanik), the author of this piece of legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the gentlewoman from New  York (Ms. Stefanik) and Congresswoman Lawrence, also, for their  tremendous work on this, and I yield back the balance of my time.
