 Mr. Speaker, on September 7, 2017, the Philhower family  will have its 100th annual family reunion. I am proud to join my fellow  family members in celebrating this very special occasion. My great- grandmother was Elizabeth Philhower Lance.   The Philhowers were some of the earliest settlers of Hunterdon  County, New Jersey. The patriarch of the Philhower family was Philip  Wulhauer, who emigrated from Germany on the ship the Patience, landing  in the port of Philadelphia on September 16, 1738, at the age of 24. He  met his wife, Anna Maria, on their voyage to the Colonies. Together  they traveled to Hunterdon County, New Jersey, to start a new life.   Philip went on to lease 14 acres in what is now Tewksbury Township in  1758 and established the Philhower homestead, which was first a log  cabin that included one room and a loft. Shortly after, he built the  house that still stands on the property. It was constructed of mortar,  lime, sand, and clay, and its walls are 18 inches thick.   The Philhower homestead had grown to 100 acres when the house was  completed. The Philhowers have occupied the land since then and have  spread their roots all over Hunterdon County, all over the State of New  Jersey, and, indeed, all over the rest of the country.   Among the family names entwined in the Philhowers are Apgar, Sutton,  Fleming, Hoffman, and Lance. Philhowers have represented Hunterdon  County in many of the military conflicts that have faced our Nation.  They have also been farmers, millers, physicians, ministers, merchants,  bankers, and educators.   In 1917, the Philhowers held their first family reunion at their  homestead, attended by nearly 400 descendants of Philip and Anna Maria.  This fine tradition has continued over the last century, usually marked  by a turkey dinner, finance meeting, and exchanging of family mementos  at Cokesbury United Methodist Church in Hunterdon County. This year,  however, family members will travel back to the  [[Page H5439]]  original Philhower homestead to be together.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to be a descendant of the Philhower  family. This is but one example of the strong immigrant tradition in  this country that continues to be one of our greatest strengths as a  nation, as much a strength today as in the middle of the 18th century.   I am honored to share this milestone with colleagues in the United  States House of Representatives and with the American people.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the chairman, the ranking  member of the full committee, and the chairman and the ranking member  of the subcommittee for this important work.   I rise in strong support of the Food and Drug Administration  Reauthorization Act. We need a strong FDA to make sure lifesaving  medicines reach the market and that patients have the peace of mind of  a safe regulatory process. This bill ensures the wheels of creation  keep turning, and in no part of our Nation is this more important than  New Jersey, one of the medicine chests of the world.   It means that patients here in the United States and hundreds of  millions around the world have benefited from the genius of our  biopharmaceutical and life science industries. Patient safety is always  the critical priority, and I am pleased this legislation includes  language I authored to crack down on counterfeit drugs that are  flooding into the United States. Too many Americans are falling victim  to knockoffs that have infiltrated the U.S. supply chain, and this  legislation significantly changes that.   Disease knows no bounds and, one way or another, each of us is  affected by disease. This work makes a difference in patients' lives  and makes sure the system from idea to pharmacy is working.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to support this product.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Walberg for his invitation  to join him on the floor today to discuss combating human trafficking  and in support of the Enhancing Detection of Human Trafficking Act.   When people hear the term ``human trafficking,'' they often think of  faraway places, or perhaps even movie  [[Page H5488]]  plots. But, unfortunately, human trafficking is a horrible 21st century  problem here in the United States.   We have to do all we can to help combat the scourge of human  trafficking, and this measure is a strong addition to the actions  already taken here in the House, and I commend the chairman, Ranking  Member Sablan, and also the full committee chair, Ms. Foxx, and Ranking  Member Scott for their leadership on this issue.   Making sure Department of Labor employees can identify these  practices will be another tool to work against these terrible crimes.  We need workforce law violation investigators to be on the lookout for  patterns of human trafficking and labor exploitation, and this bill  will make it happen.   Since 2007, the National Human Trafficking Hotline has received  nearly 150,000 reports of trafficking here in the United States. The  majority of these victims are women and children forced into heinous  situations. They need our help. I urge all my colleagues to join me in  supporting this measure and to continue to do all we can to combat  human trafficking.
