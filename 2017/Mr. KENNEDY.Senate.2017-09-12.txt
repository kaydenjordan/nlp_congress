 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, let me say that my heart goes out to the  people of America who are, right now, dealing with Hurricanes Harvey  and Irma and their aftermaths.                   Tribute to Steve Gleason and Donna Britt    Mr. President, ALS, which I think most of us refer to as Lou Gehrig's  disease, has hit us hard in Louisiana. It has hit our world hard, but  it has hit especially hard in my State.   A number of my colleagues and a number of Americans, I hope, were  watching the night the New Orleans Saints returned to the field after  our State was devastated by Hurricane Katrina. That night in the  Superdome, a young man named Steve Gleason became a legend. I know it  was just a football game, but he blocked a punt deep in the territory  of the Saints' opponent, the Atlanta Falcons, for a touchdown. It was  more than just a touchdown; it was a declaration that Louisiana was  going to come back, that our spirit was not broken.   Today, Steve Gleason is battling ALS. The medical term for ALS is  ``amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.'' We call it, as I said, Lou Gehrig's  disease. It is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that destroys  nerve cells in the brain and in the spinal cord. Regrettably, there is  no cure. Steve, however, is determined to thrive and help others who  have ALS.   Within the past few weeks, we have also learned that another  Louisianan has ALS--well-known Baton Rouge television news anchor Donna  Britt. I will tell you, like Steve, Donna is showing true grit in the  face of this horrible disease. Most of us would probably curl into a  fetal position and cry if we were told we had a progressive  neurodegenerative disease that is almost always fatal--but not Steve  and certainly not Ms. Donna Britt. Their valor and their courage is  inspirational to me and, I think, to all Louisianans. As Donna herself  put it, she is going to continue living as a living person and not as a  dying person.   There is a famous line in a famous movie in which the main character  says: I have a choice here--it is time to get busy living or get busy  dying. Donna has chosen to get busy living. She is going to keep going  to work, and she is going to keep caring for her family. Donna is  educating herself about ALS. She has ordered a state-of-the-art  wheelchair with Bluetooth technology, and she is adding words to a  voice bank for when she can no longer speak because of this horrible  disease. Donna Britt--I am not surprised--is determined to meet every  challenge.   Let me say it again. This is pure valor. It is the type of courage in  the face of adversity that inspires us all. It is also Donna. I do not  know how to put that any other way. That is Donna Britt. Donna is a  person who plays the oboe and who has survived breast cancer. She  donates books to school libraries, and for charity she sings outside  the Walmart during the holidays. She travels the world, and she  delivers the news. She is a voice of comfort to all of those in her  television media market, and she loves her family. She and her husband  Mark Ballard have a son and a daughter. Her daughter Annie is a  scientist working in DNA research, and their son Louie is a bright,  young student in high school.    Donna has delivered the news in the Baton Rouge metropolitan area for  36 years. She spent her entire career, which is very unusual, at one  television station--WAFB in Baton Rouge, which Donna has helped to make  a powerhouse in Louisiana media. Donna has done her job so  extraordinarily well that she has become a role model for young  journalists--all journalists but particularly female journalists. I can  tell my colleagues that folks in Baton Rouge feel Donna Britt is a part  of their family. They trust her. That is because she is impartial, she  is objective, and she is insightful. Since 1981, she has been on the  air with the people of the Baton Rouge metropolitan area through  storms, through inaugurations, through just about every major news  event, good times and bad, that one can imagine. Donna also takes our  people into the community and introduces them to interesting people.   A few months ago, Donna realized her health wasn't what it should be.  There is no definitive test for ALS, as perhaps my colleagues know.  Basically, the doctors have to rule everything else out before  determining that one has ALS. As she struggled to figure out why she  was losing the use of her fingers and her legs, Donna didn't keep her  viewers in the dark. She brought them along for the journey in frank,  candid Facebook videos. Along the way, she educated them--ever the  journalist--on what it is like to have a degenerative disease.   At a family reunion this summer, Donna all of a sudden could not  stand any longer. Now, that is a problem when you stand behind a desk  to deliver the news--not for Donna. It was just another challenge to  conquer. She promptly ordered a wheelchair that would adapt to her new  reality.   Now Donna Britt is working with Louisiana State University to prepare  for the day when her respiratory and diaphragm muscles are too weak for  her to vocalize what she is thinking. With LSU's help, she is putting  words into a voice bank for the future. Once again, it is just another  challenge for Donna Britt to conquer.   I am very proud of Steve Gleason, and I am also very proud of Donna  Britt. As angry as I am that anyone has to live with this dreadful  disease ALS, I am proud they are inspiring an army of ALS sufferers by  meeting every challenge and battling to thrive. I am proud that Steve  and Donna are inspiring all of us with their valor and their courage.   Thank you.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
