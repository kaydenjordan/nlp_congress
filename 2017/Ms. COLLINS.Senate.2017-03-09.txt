 Mr. President, I am once again delighted to join my  colleague, Senator Patty Murray, to introduce the Military and Veteran  Caregiver Services Improvement Act of 2017. Our bill would greatly  expand eligibility for VA caregiver support services by including  veterans from all eras, allow veterans to transfer their post 9/11 GI  bill benefits to their dependents, expand eligibility for the VA  caregivers program to include a wider range of injuries that may have  previously gone unrecognized, and provide crucial support for our  Nation's caregivers themselves.   In 2014, my former colleague and friend, Senator Elizabeth Dole,  commissioned a study by the RAND Corporation to learn more about the  military caregiver population and explore common issues experienced by  America's caregivers. The experts at RAND found that those caring for  our servicemembers and veterans provide nearly $14 billion worth of  unpaid services every year--an incredible cost that would otherwise be  passed on to the Nation.   There are more than 5.5 million military caregivers in the United  States, and of those, 1.1 million are caring for post-9/11 veterans.  These are spouses, parents, children, and other loved ones who have  voluntarily put their lives on hold to provide our returning  servicemembers with a trusted continuum of care that could not be  replicated without them. Many of them will provide this care for years,  if not decades, to come.   Tragically, caring for those suffering from the scars of war takes an  enormous toll. According to the RAND study, military caregivers face  increased instances of mental and physical health problems, chronic  absenteeism from work, deteriorating personal relationships, legal and  financial troubles, and feelings of isolation. These difficulties are  often more pronounced for post-9/11 military caregivers.   Our Nation owes America's veterans our deepest gratitude. Their  sacrifices are often very visible. In many cases our veterans have  earned medals or awards for their bravery that they can wear proudly on  their chest. But our military and veteran caregivers truly are hidden  heroes, serving alongside our veterans to provide the love, care, and  support they need. Despite their enormous sacrifice, these hidden  heroes often do not receive the awards and admiration. That does not  mean that they don't deserve it. We must honor our commitment to  veterans by answering the call to better support those caring for our  wounded, ill, and injured warriors.   Our legislation would help strengthen the services offered to  caregivers.  [[Page S1745]]  The Military and Veteran Caregiver Services Improvement Act is an  important step in helping those who have assumed the mantle of caring  for the men and women who have served our Nation so honorably. I urge  all of my colleagues to join Senator Murray and me in honoring and  supporting our Nation's military caregivers.                                  ______                                         By Mr. KAINE (for himself, Mr. Rounds, and Mr. Perdue):   S. 592. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to support  meeting the increasing needs of the United States for a cybersecurity  and information assurance workforce by reinvigorating and modifying the  Information Assurance Scholarship Program of the Department of Defense,  and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.    Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Fire Sprinkler  Incentive Act. I am pleased to be joined by my colleague from Delaware,  Senator Carper, in introducing this bipartisan bill.   In the United States, the annual cost of fires is enormous. In 2015,  according to the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), fires  resulted in approximately $14 billion in direct property loss. In  addition, more than 3,000 civilians were killed and more than 15,000  people were injured in fires. The NFPA also reports that a fire  department responded to a structure fire every 63 seconds.   These statistics are of particular concern in Maine, which has some  of the oldest housing stock in the country and which has experienced  deadly apartment building fires. In 2014, an apartment fire resulted in  the deaths of six people--Maine's deadliest fire in nearly four  decades.   Historically, Maine has also seen commercial property damaged by  fires. In fact, much of the construction in the historic areas of  Portland was done following a devastating fire in 1866. This fire  destroyed a third of the city, including most of Portland's commercial  buildings, many of its churches, and countless homes.   The NFPA reports that when fire sprinklers are present during a large  fire, they are effective 96 percent of the time, saving billions of  dollars in property damage but more importantly, thousands of lives.  Our bill would encourage commercial building owners to invest in fire  safety upgrades. While building codes require sprinklers in new  commercial buildings, a great number of structures across the U.S. were  built and put in service before sprinklers were required.   Small business building owners, however, may find it difficult to  fund retrofit sprinklers. To help these owners, our bill would provide  two tax incentives to encourage them to make this lifesaving  investment.   Currently, commercial building owners must depreciate fire sprinkler  retrofits over a lengthy 39-year period. The period for residential  buildings is 7\1/2\ years. This bill reclassifies fire sprinkler  retrofits as 15-year depreciable property, thus allowing building  owners to write off their costs more quickly. The bill also provides an  option for certain small businesses to deduct the cost of the fire  system upgrades immediately under Section 179 of the tax code.  Together, these proposals will provide a strong incentive for building  owners to install fire sprinkler systems.   This bill was originally drafted in response to the deadly nightclub  fire in West Warwick, RI, in 2003, which killed a staggering 100  people. That building did not have a fire sprinkler system. Let us work  together to lessen the chances of another tragedy like this one. I  invite my colleagues to join Senator Carper and me in support of this  bipartisan, common sense legislation.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the letter of support was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                           International Association                                                  of Fire Chiefs,                                         Fairfax, VA, March 6, 2017.      Hon. Susan Collins,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the more than 12,000       chief fire and emergency service officers of the       International Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC), thank you       for introducing the Fire Sprinkler Incentive Act (FSIA). The       IAFC appreciates your leadership in creating an incentive for       property owners to retrofit their properties with automatic       fire sprinkler systems. If passed, the FSIA will be an       important tool to save lives in the future.        Fires continue to be a devastating problem in Maine and       across the United States. According to the National Fire       Protection Association (NFPA), in 2015 alone, there were more       than 1.3 million fires in the United States which resulted in       nearly 3,300 civilian deaths, 15,700 civilian injuries, and       $14.3 billion in property damage. Additionally, the U.S. Fire       Administration reports that the relative risk of fire death       in Maine is 1.5 times higher than the U.S. average. Fire       sprinkler systems play a crucial role by significantly       increasing the chances of surviving a fire and reducing       property damages. The NFPA found that a fire sprinkler system       decreases the likelihood of dying in a fire by 83%, reduces       property damage by 74%, and confines a fire to its room of       origin in 95% of instances. Incentivizing fire sprinkler       systems simply makes sense from both life safety and public       policy perspectives.  [[Page S1749]]         Despite the clear benefits of fire sprinkler systems, the       current tax code fails to incentivize these lifesaving       systems. Your legislation would fix this oversight by       classifying fire sprinkler systems as Section 179 expenses       and allowing property owners to deduct the cost of       retrofitting their buildings. Additionally, the FSIA will       allow high-rise building owners to depreciate the costs of       these systems much faster than the current tax code allows.       The FSIA provides a real incentive for building owners to       protect not only their properties but the lives of those       people inside them.        Thank you again for your strong support for the fire and       emergency service. The IAFC looks forward to continuing to       work with you to protect communities across Maine and the       entire United States.            Sincerely,                                       Fire Chief John D. Sinclair,                               President and Chairman of the Board.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DAINES (for himself and Mr. Tester):   S. 605. A bill to amend the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources  Planning Act of 1974 and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of  1976 to discourage litigation against the Forest Service and the Bureau  of Land Management relating to land management projects; to the  Committee on Environment and Public Works.
