 Mr. President, tonight I ask your support for this  commonsense amendment, which will expand the already immensely popular  529 college savings plan so that parents can also save for K-12  elementary and secondary school tuition, including educational expenses  for homeschool students.   This change will have real and significant effects. Your vote will  expand options for parents and children spending their own money and  will prioritize the education of the next generation of Americans. By  expanding 529s, which Americans already value greatly, we will help  ensure that each child can receive an education that meets his or her  individualized needs, and this reasonable expansion will enable hard- working parents to better save for the educational future of their  kids.   This amendment was in the House bill, and it is fully paid for, and I  urge your support.
