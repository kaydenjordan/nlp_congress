 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   When considering any legislation, the House should first determine  whether the legislation is needed and, next, whether the bill under  consideration will adequately address or improve the situation.   The Committee on Education and Labor, unfortunately, did not have a  full hearing on H.R. 1230 and heard from only one witness, invited by  the Democrats, about the bill at a general hearing on multiple topics.   This legislation, at the very least, deserved a standalone hearing so  that committee members and the House could get more information to make  a considered decision regarding this legislation.   Publicly available data does not show the Supreme Court decisions in  Gross v. FBL Financial Services or Nassar v. University of Texas  Southwestern Medical Center have discouraged individuals from filing  discrimination charges with the EEOC, which is the primary agency that  enforces Federal laws that make it illegal to discriminate. A  discrimination charge is a signed statement asserting employment  discrimination.   The lone Democrat-invited witness who testified in favor of H.R. 1230  at the Committee on Education and Labor's hearing in May, which covered  [[Page H268]]  several topics and bills, acknowledged that it is difficult to quantify  the impact that the Gross decision has had on the number of older  workers who bring cases and the number of those who win them.   This witness also acknowledged that when we might have expected a  drop in charges due to Gross-inspired discouragement from employment  attorneys, there was a sizeable jump in the number of ADEA charges  filed at EEOC.   EEOC data shows that the rate of EEOC age discrimination charges as a  percentage of all charges filed is approximately the same for the 9  years before and after the Gross decision.   There has been a slight uptick in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act  retaliation charges as a percentage of all charges filed in the 4 years  following the Nassar decision, which does not indicate individuals have  been discouraged from filing these charges.   Court decisions show that the plaintiffs have continued to win age  discrimination and Title VII retaliation cases in the wake of the  Supreme Court's decisions in Gross and Nassar.   This amendment will provide Congress much-needed data on the impact  of the two Supreme Court cases at issue in H.R. 1230.   If the GAO report indicates Gross and Nassar have not discouraged  individuals from seeking relief or from achieving it, the bill would  not go into effect.   The House should look before it leaps, and Members should vote in  favor of this amendment to ensure this happens.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, again I repeat, the lone witness, a  Democratic witness at the Committee of Education and Labor's hearing in  May on H.R. 1230, acknowledged that it is difficult to quantify the  impact that the Gross decision had on the number of older workers who  bring cases and the numbers of those who win them.   This witness also acknowledged that we might have expected a drop in  charges due to the Gross-inspired discouragement from employment  attorneys, but that there was a sizeable jump in ADEA charges filed  with the EEOC.   I merely present this amendment to make sure that the committee and  this House look at the data before we have some law here that is going  to create, really, fewer opportunities for people to file these  charges.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``yes'' vote on my amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Speaker, I have 4 children and 13 grandchildren, and I  can't imagine life without them and the love that we have for each  other. In fact, every human life from the moment of conception is  precious, worthy of dignity and respect.   The right to life should not be a political debate.                                time  1900    As a society, we should be united in the understanding that killing  another human being, a baby, an unborn child, is immoral and  unconstitutional. But in 1973 the Supreme Court ruled to make abortion  available throughout pregnancy for nearly any reason.   Mr. Speaker, there are only five countries in the world that allow  abortion after the first 5 months, and, unfortunately, the U.S. is one  of them. But Americans want better: 82 percent of Americans believe  that abortion should be restricted. However, radicals on the left are  taking abortion to a new extreme trying to justify killing a healthy,  7-pound baby up until the point of birth.   Can you imagine?   Some even try to justify killing a baby who survives an abortion  attempt. In fact, we have a petition on this floor called the Born- Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, and there are 240 Members of  this body who refuse to sign that petition. This is repugnant.   Can you imagine, as the Virginia Governor described, a baby born in a  botched abortion: What we do is make the child comfortable and then  talk with the mother and the other stakeholders to decide whether we  kill the baby.   That is un-American.   In the 47 years since Roe v. Wade, we killed over 60 million of these  children. That is why I am proud to cosponsor H.R. 50 which will  memorialize the unborn by lowering the United States flag to half-staff  on the 22nd of January each year.   Mr. Speaker, I pray that the hearts and minds of every person in this  country, particularly those who are Members of this body, will change  and vote for life.
