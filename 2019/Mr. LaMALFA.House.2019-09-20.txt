 Madam Speaker, I rise today to applaud the efforts of  U.S. EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler and Department of Transportation  Secretary Elaine Chao with regard to the unreasonable automobile fuel  mileage standards put upon consumers by a 2015 Obama-era rule.   In only 5 model years from now, all U.S. cars would have to average  55 miles per gallon under this current standard. Most people drive cars  these days that are somewhere around 25 to 33 miles per gallon. They  would be forced into very small cars that don't fit their family's  needs.   What the administration is seeking to do is freeze this timeline at  37 miles per gallon until technology can catch up, et cetera, so people  can choose to buy cars that fit their lives. Under the old rule and  what the California Air Resources Board is trying to foist upon all 50  States in meeting the Obama rule, they will not have that choice  anymore.   Unfortunately, a few scared automakers have sat down with CARB to try  to cut a deal to fix the one they agreed to a few years ago with no  real idea of how they would meet 55 miles per gallon with current  technology and physics at the time. At this point, there are very few  55-mile-per-gallon vehicles to even choose from. Most people don't want  to buy those cars because it doesn't fit their family, their life, what  they want, and what they desire.   CARB is trying to foist that on all 50 States, and auto manufacturers  will be herded toward it by desiring to make the same car type for all  50 States, not just California. This needs to be stopped, and we must  draw the line here.                            ____________________
