 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Bucks  County Community College, which recently received a $200,000 grant to  raise awareness and promote its metal working apprenticeship program.   This 12-week program provides entry-level training, forklift  certification, and other skills necessary to begin a career in  manufacturing. The Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic  Development grant will be used to promote Bucks County Community  College's manufacturing preapprenticeship training programs.   Mr. Speaker, earlier this week I partnered with Bucks County native,  Congressman Ro Khanna, to introduce the Student Apprenticeship Act, a  bill that would close the gap between higher education and labor by  modernizing workforce training and catalyzing the growth of registered  apprenticeships nationwide.   Apprenticeship programs provide skills and education for high-paying  jobs and vital careers, and we need to be sure we give them the  attention that they deserve.                         Recognizing Aileen Torrente     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Sergeant  Aileen  [[Page H1230]]  Torrente of the Middletown Township Police Department.   Sergeant Torrente was the first woman in the history of the police  department to be promoted from patrol officer to detective in 2014.  Recently Aileen was promoted again; this time from detective to her  current rank of sergeant.   Sergeant Torrente's success will set a great example for current and  future officers at my hometown township police department in  Middletown. Aileen's hard work, determination, and diligence led to her  promotion. She is a great role model for our community, and I look  forward to seeing more promotions in the future as she works her way up  to her dream job of chief of police. Mr. Speaker, I wish her well.                    Recognizing Bensalem Township Council     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Bensalem  Township Council, who took a huge step to ensure the safety and well- being of their residents by prohibiting vaping in public township  facilities, including parks and other recreational areas.   The health and safety of our children should be our top priority, and  the recent youth vaping epidemic has been a huge health issue in our  community and across our Nation.   I recently had the opportunity to meet with students from New Hope  Solebury Cares who expressed their concerns with how prevalent vaping  has become in their schools, and they talked about solutions that we  can work on to bring attention to this issue.   Part of the rise in youth vaping has been attributed to flavored  nicotine. Flavors such as mango, cucumber, and other types of flavors  undoubtedly target our children.   Tomorrow the House will vote on final passage of H.R. 2339, the  Protecting American Lungs and Reversing the Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act.  This legislation would ban all flavored vaping products, e-cigarette  ads targeting youth, and remote cigarette sales. As a cosponsor of this  bill, I look forward to voting in favor of this bill and taking a much- needed step to mitigate tobacco use among our children.                            ____________________
