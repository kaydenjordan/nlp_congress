 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to raise  concerns about the unprecedented and partisan obstruction of a highly  qualified nominee to a critical agency.   In this country, it is illegal to discriminate against someone in the  workplace because of the traits that make them who they are--their  race, religion, sex, disability, and more--and it is the Equal  Employment Opportunity Commission's responsibility to enforce those  laws and give every person the opportunity to make a living for  themselves without fear of discrimination or harassment.   Right now, a single Republican Senator is threatening to derail the  confirmation of Ms. Feldblum for another term on the EEOC. Ms. Feldblum  has served two terms on the EEOC, where she has earned the respect of  her professional colleagues on both sides of the aisle. She has strong  support from Republicans and Democrats in the Senate, and she has been  confirmed by this Senate twice.   When it comes to independent boards and commissions, including the  EEOC, the Senate has a longstanding practice of pairing nominees--one  from the majority party and one from the minority party. This is so  important because it allows the minority party the opportunity to have  a voice. In this case, it allows my Democratic colleagues and me to  ensure that employers are held accountable for workers' rights and  safety on the job. This practice is also important to bipartisanship in  the Senate. Part of that longstanding practice is that the majority  cannot railroad  [[Page S7862]]  the nomination of a well-respected and well-qualified individual chosen  by the minority.   If Ms. Feldblum's nomination is blocked by this Congress, it will be  an unprecedented power grab by the majority that would permanently  shift the balance of power in the Senate. I hope all of my colleagues  take seriously what it would mean if yet another power of the minority  in the Senate was taken away. Most importantly, if one Republican  Senator insists on blocking Ms. Feldblum's nomination, the work of the  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission--an agency workers rely on to  protect their rights and safety on the job--is going to come to a  grinding halt.   Over the past 2 years, we have seen a shift in this country toward  acknowledging and taking action against sexual assault and harassment,  especially in the workplace. For far too long, this epidemic of  powerful men taking advantage of their subordinates, employees, or  those without a voice was swept under the rug. Women and men were told  to brush it off or have a sense of humor or just endure the harassment  or abuse they were facing in the workplace. Many did because they knew  they would be punished, retaliated against, or even fired.   After the Presidential election and the Women's March, when so many  women and men around the country made their voices heard and fought  back against misogyny, sexism, racism, and tilted the playing field  that has favored those at the top for too long, we started to see women  and men bravely come forward at a level we have never seen before to  say ``no more'' and to speak out against their experiences of sexual  assault and harassment in the workplace.   Because of that courage, a lot of powerful men in Hollywood, in the  media, and in Congress have finally been held accountable for their  actions, especially when it came to using their power to take advantage  of younger or less powerful women and men.   For women and men in industries outside the spotlight--in  hospitality, in technology, in farm fields, and in so many offices and  workplaces around the country--there has not been the same kind of  reckoning. For many of those workers, the EEOC is one of the very few  places they can turn to. The EEOC is a resource for workers who need to  file complaints of harassment or discrimination. It holds employers and  businesses accountable for widespread discrimination and harassment.   Again, because of the objection of a single Republican Senator, it is  possible now that the EEOC will be unable to conduct some of its most  critical work. Here is what that means for workers in our country. The  EEOC would no longer be able to bring some large cases when  discrimination is part of employers' general operating standards. That  often includes hiring practices, equal pay, or sexual harassment. It  means workers will not be able to file complaints to stop what happened  to them from happening to anyone else.   The EEOC would not be able to rule in cases where the Commission has  not previously taken a position and a new policy must be created, and  regional EEOC offices would not be able to hire expert witnesses in  some cases, meaning that many cases would be stalled or even punted.   This is not hypothetical. Without a quorum--without a quorum--the  EEOC would not have been able to participate in the 2016 case against a  tire company that refused to hire women for field positions. After the  EEOC intervened, that company settled with 46 women and implemented  safeguards to prevent further discrimination. The EEOC also would not  have been able to participate in a case against the outdoor store that  discriminated against African Americans and Hispanic workers in hiring  practices and retaliated against workers who stood up against unlawful  practices.   Workers around the country rely on the EEOC every day to intervene  when they are being harassed, discriminated against, or unfairly  treated at work. Whether they are being told they must work on their  day of religious observance or being told they cannot do a certain job  because of their sex, the EEOC is there for them.   In this moment when sexual assault and harassment in the workplace  are at the forefront of our national conversation, this is the wrong  message to send to the American workers and their employees. We need to  prove to the millions of women and men that we are taking the epidemic  of harassment in the workplace seriously.   I have spoken to many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  make the case for confirming Ms. Feldblum before the end of this  Congress. There is strong support on both sides of the aisle to get  this done, with the exception of one lone Republican Senator.   I urge my colleagues across the aisle to push aside this  unprecedented obstructionism, and I call on the Senate to move forward  with confirming the full slate of nominees to the EEOC before this  Congress ends so the Commission can continue to fulfill its duty to  workers by enforcing protections and ensuring people are able to go to  work and make a living without the fear of discrimination, harassment,  or abuse.   I hope that as we are confirming the EEOC nominees, the Senate will  also confirm Mark Pearce to another term on the National Labor  Relations Board. Like the EEOC, the Senate has a long history of  confirming majority and minority members to the Board in pairs.  However, this year, Senate Republicans jammed through the majority  members without reconfirming Mr. Pearce, allowing a minority seat to  sit empty.   Mr. Pearce is extremely qualified and has a long track record of  serving his country for 8 years now as a member of the Board. He has a  distinguished background representing unions and workers. Right now,  when the Republican Board members are rushing decisions through that  chip away workers' rights, even violating ethics pledges to do so, it  is clear that the Board could benefit from his knowledge and expertise  and voice for workers.   As I have told my colleagues across the aisle, I will not allow the  Senate to jam through any HELP Committee nominees until Mr. Pearce and  Ms. Feldblum are reconfirmed to their positions on the Board and the  EEOC.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the HELP  Committee be discharged from further consideration of PN 1318 and the  Senate proceed to the en bloc consideration of the following  nominations: PN 1318, Executive Calendar Nos. 379 and 381; and that the  Senate vote on the nominations en bloc with no intervening action or  debate.    I object.
