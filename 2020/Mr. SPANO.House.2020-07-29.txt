 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to bring attention to an  alarming trend: the censorship of Americans by American companies,  particularly those in the social media sector.   Over and over, we hear about social media platforms silencing  conservatives and their views, only to turn around and ask this  Congress for continued liability protections.   If social media companies expect such legal protection, they must  recognize the fundamental free speech of their users. To be clear, I am  not referring to hate speech or calls for violence. I am referring to  political views that differ from those who own and manage these  companies.   As this Congress considers and debates the regulation of these  companies into the 21st century, we should take this political  censorship into account. No American, no matter what their affiliation  or opinions, should ever be prevented from lawfully exercising their  constitutional rights, whether online or in person.   Social media, for sure, has done wonders to connect people, but it  has also  [[Page H3889]]  been used as a tool to further a specific political agenda, all the  while expecting Government's protection, and that must end.                            ____________________
