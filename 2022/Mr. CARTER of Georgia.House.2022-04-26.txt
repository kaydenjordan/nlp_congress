 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  90th birthday of the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 660 in Savannah.   Post 660 is the oldest veteran service organization in Savannah and  has helped the veteran community tremendously through fellowship,  charity, and patriotism.   The VFW Organization traces its roots back to 1899 when veterans of  the Spanish-American War and the Philippine Insurrection founded local  organizations to secure rights and benefits for their service.   Since then, the VFW has aided countless veterans in their post- service life and continue to carry on the legacy of service. Post 660  in Savannah has been a prime example of what the organization was  founded on and what it set out to do. The VFW has raised money for  memorials, such as the Vietnam and Korean War memorials in Washington,  D.C.   It has also worked with the Veteran's Administration to craft the GI  Bill for the 20th century. These feats are only a few that speak to the  impact this organization has had on our community and our country.   I thank and congratulate VFW Post 660 for their 90 years of service  to Savannah's veterans, and I look forward to the years to come.                            ____________________
