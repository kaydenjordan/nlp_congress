 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge  immediate consideration of the American Energy Independence from Russia  Act.   Innocent blood is being spilled in Ukraine as we speak. Women and  children are being separated from their fathers. Democracy is under  attack. Freedom must prevail. What do the people in Ukraine want? They  want self-determination and independence from Russia.   Mr. Speaker, Russia's economy is entirely dependent upon energy  production and exports. Putin uses energy and pipelines as weapons,  threatening to cut off supplies or hike prices when the West confronts  Russia's aggression. Russia's energy exports fund its military and its  current attack on Ukraine. America, not Russia, is the world's number  one energy producer. We should act like it and lead.   President Biden must restore American energy dominance and use energy  resources to help Ukraine and Europe fight back. We shouldn't be buying  a single barrel of oil from Russia, and our allies shouldn't be  beholden to aggressors that attack their freedom. Europe should have  the choice to buy American energy and say no to Russian pipelines and  Nord Stream 2.   That is why Congressman Bruce Westerman and I are leading on the  American Energy Independence from Russia Act. This bill flips the  switch on American energy. We need more pipelines, including Keystone  XL, so this bill immediately approves the Keystone XL pipeline so that  we can import crude oil from Canada, not Russia.   It also removes all restrictions on U.S. energy exports to deliver  natural gas to our allies in Europe, and it restarts oil and gas  leasing on our Federal lands and offshore waters.   This is how we shut down Putin's war chest, stand by Ukraine, empower  our allies, protect our national security, and create jobs here at  home.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to say ``no'' on this previous  question and ``yes'' on the American Energy Independence from Russia  Act.
