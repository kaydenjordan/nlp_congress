 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, our country is facing a medication shortage  crisis. Americans can no longer count on their medicines being  available at the pharmacy counter when they need them.   Unfortunately, it is actually worse than a simple shortage. It is, in  particular, that America doesn't have access to an adequate supply of  generic drugs that can be stocked by our pharmacies.   I have heard from parents throughout my State whose kids are sick  with a strep throat, and they are out there scrambling from pharmacy to  pharmacy trying to track down a basic antibiotic. These concerns are  especially serious in rural parts of my State--I think this is true in  a lot of parts of this country--because of the long distances families  have to drive if their community pharmacy in a rural area can't meet  their needs. This, in my view, is an enormous and urgent national  challenge.   There are, for example, cancer patients who can't get treatment  because  [[Page S2024]]  the medication they need is in low supply. With cancer, we know every  single second counts. In many cases, people die if they are not  treated. This makes the crisis not abstract, but it is a real life-or- death crisis. There are Americans suffering from ADHD who can't get  their hands on the medications they rely on that their doctor  prescribed to them to help so they can function at school, at work, and  at home.   A pharmacist in southern Oregon told me that one of their patients  went without their medication for almost 2 months, and it undercuts  their ability to complete daily tasks. Derailing these lives--young and  old--due to a generic drug shortage just has got to be unacceptable-- unacceptable--to the richest country in the world.   Now, the crisis is hurting Americans in many places; but as I have  indicated, it is especially stark in rural America. Independent  pharmacies have been essential in rural communities in my State. These  pharmacies can't always afford to keep brand-name drugs stocked,  especially during a shortage. They rely, as do so many of these  pharmacies across the land, on available generic medicines so they can  serve their customers and stay in business.   And the travel I mentioned from pharmacy to pharmacy to get needed  medications is no simple challenge. I'm having a whole group of town  halls in eastern Oregon at the end of this month. I made a commitment  to have an open-to-all town meeting in every county that I have the  honor to represent. I've had 1,050 of them, and I can tell you the  distance between small towns in eastern Oregon is often measured in  hours, not miles or minutes. So if you live in rural Oregon and your  local pharmacy lacks your medication, you have got to find the time and  the gas money to travel anywhere from 60 to 90 minutes to the next  closest pharmacy and hope and pray that the medication hasn't just been  sold before you got there. These commute times are even longer in the  winter months when the weather conditions are especially serious.   I heard recently about an Oregonian who went to the pharmacy every  day for 2 weeks--2 weeks--to get that day's shipment of the  prescription they needed. Every single day, they went to the pharmacy.  That is a lot of time spent on top of working, taking care of a family,  and trying to get your basic needs met. This is going to get worse in  pharmacies across Oregon and the Nation without this Congress and our  country acting.   Shortages of these generics has generated a domino effect. It's  caused shortages of alternative medications to treat ADHD. And so many  Americans--millions and millions--have looked for this drug, and they  are looking for alternatives. And some of these other medicines may be  less effective. We ought to be clear, in some cases there is no domino  effect because some generics don't have any alternatives at all.    I asked a pharmacist in eastern Oregon to share with me how this has  affected the people she and her family serve. She told me that many  customers who took medication that were working very well are now  bumping up against this shortage. So now a patient's doctor, according  to this pharmacist, will write a prescription for another medication  and then change the patient back to the original preferred medication-- the one that has been working for them--if and when it is available. In  essence, the doctors are forced to lurch as their patients go back and  forth from one medicine to another--medicines that can have a different  effect--if they can get them.   Another patient in rural Oregon was receiving the generic for  Adderall at a 30-milligram dose, which suddenly became unavailable.  Their insurance wouldn't pay for the brand-name drug, so the patient  was forced to take a lower dose version of the generic. This patient  has to change the medication every month, not based on their medical  needs, but trying to figure out what their rural pharmacy is going to  be able to provide.   Then, because ADHD medicines are Schedule II drugs, the prescriptions  can't be transferred between pharmacies. If a person's medication isn't  available at their local pharmacy but is available at a pharmacy 90  minutes away, patients in this situation have to double back to their  doctor to get a new prescription before they can even start the trek to  the distant pharmacy. So sometimes this means the patient has to  physically drive to the doctor's office and pick up a hard copy of the  prescription if the doctor isn't registered with the Drug Enforcement  Agency, the DEA.   Just picture this kind of bureaucratic nightmare for people who are  just hoping--hoping--in small towns that somebody is thinking about  their needs. But the idea of physically driving to a doctor's office,  getting a hard copy of the prescription when the doctor, as I said,  isn't registered with the DEA to prescribe the drugs electronically is  just a microcosm of what these patients in rural Oregon and rural  America are telling us.   A rural pharmacist told me that what I just described happened this  week with a patient who was forced to drive from Heppner to Pendleton,  an hour and a half away, to pick up their physical, paper prescription,  and then off they went to their pharmacy.   Now, there are a variety of reasons of why we have these shortages;  but when it comes to the ADHD medication, specifically, part of the  problem may be that the generic drug manufacturers are not  communicating with the government Agencies who regulate the  manufacturing of these drugs. And neither the generic manufacturers nor  these Agencies are communicating effectively with the public, which is  why so many Members of Congress are getting these calls asking them to  step in and help.   Now, the DEA is in charge of how much of this ADHD medication can be  produced and dispersed. Okay? This is the Agency that tells you how  much of this medication is going to be available. They are telling me  drug companies can make more medication any time they want to. The  companies say, not so. They are saying what the DEA says isn't true.  The companies claim that the DEA is denying their applications to make  more medicine during the shortage. Now, add to this the Food and Drug  Administration, the FDA, saying they don't know of any denials to make  more drugs handed down by the Drug Enforcement Agency to the drug  manufacturers and that the DEA has approved applications that the FDA  has weighed in on.   So if your head is now spinning as you try to sort through the word  salad, as I call it, of American healthcare, it is understandable,  because at every level, there are new requirements that you try to  reconcile with what I have already described.   The Secretary of Health and Human Services is required by law to post  justifications when the DEA denies these kinds of applications on the  FDA's website, but none have been posted. So if you are a patient who  is hurting or a family who is trying to treat a sick child or an elder,  you deserve something better--something better--than the chaos I have  just described. Again, companies are saying their applications to make  more medicine have been denied.   So I have just given you the conflict between these Agencies that,  heaven forbid--quaint idea--would actually talk to each other.  Something doesn't add up, so the Senate is going to have to step in and  sort this out so that the citizens of this country get straight  answers. And this bureaucratic doublespeak is particularly hard on  Oregonians who come to me and ask why they are suffering from a crisis  that is not of their making.   Now, I recently spoke to the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement  Agency. She was aware I had an interest in this as I serve as chairman  of the Senate Finance Committee, and she agreed that greater  transparency in the process is going to help the ongoing work of the  Agency to reform the system.   Well, we are sure going to hold them to that. Certainly some clear,  at least coherent language is desperately needed and better  communication for the patients. That is what I am insisting on from the  Drug Enforcement Agency and the FDA because they have a responsibility  to reach out to these companies of these essential medicines to sort  these out and make these medicines accessible to the American people,  and the Agencies ought to give the manufacturers clear guidance on how  to navigate the bureaucratic fiefdoms that exist here in Washington.  [[Page S2025]]    I will also say that I am concerned that despite this heightened  attention to medication shortages, these Agencies appear to be solely  focused on production at the national level, and there is no real  connection to the local pharmacy window. We know that when we finally  took away the grail--the Holy Grail--from the pharmaceutical companies  and that Medicare could negotiate to hold down, you know, prices, one  of the reasons we did is that we knew this issue really mattered at the  pharmacy window. That is when people in New Jersey and Oregon and  everywhere else want to have available drugs and have them made  affordable. It has to become local.   Further, it is important not just to focus on the production and  availability of these drugs like Adderall but to ensure that the  generic equivalents are broadly available and recognized as a part of  access for patients. For instance, a copay for the generic medicine  could be $10. If it is not available, and after the pharmacy spends 45  minutes on the phone with the patient's insurance company and the  patient, the name brand Adderall could be approved, but even with  insurance, the patient could face a copay of anywhere from $75 to $200.   For all of those families in America who are walking an economic  tightrope in balancing their food bill against their fuel bill and  their fuel bill against their rent bill, they are not going to be in a  position to pay these constantly escalating prices, and, you know, when  you are trying to feed your family, you might make your own health your  lowest priority.   So the Federal Agencies need to help manufacturers get better at  reporting spikes in consumer demand for important medicines that they  are going to have a hard time meeting, and Congress has to work on  making it a requirement--a requirement--for the manufacturers to report  this information.   I am going to close by offering a really radical idea: that the Food  and Drug Administration and the Drug Enforcement Administration get  together and work this out, because it is not about Democrats and  Republicans. I am a Democrat, and the Republicans sit over there. This  has nothing to do with that--nothing--but it has everything to do with  the proposition that Americans deserve better. These Agencies that I  have cited ought to give a full explanation to the American people  about what they are doing now, what they are doing a month from now,  and what they are going to be doing until they get this fixed.   In my call to these two Agencies, I believe--and I know the Presiding  Officer does--that Americans ought to be able to get the healthcare  they need when they need it, and right now, too many Americans are  suffering because they can't, particularly with respect to those who  need medicines to deal with ADHD.   We are hurting people's lives. In the worst case, I believe Americans  may be using drugs not prescribed by their doctors as a result of all  of this bedlam I have described.   I will tell the Presiding Officer, in wrapping up, you know--and he  and I have talked about this--that I was the co-director for the Oregon  Gray Panthers for many years, and this has been the area of healthcare  I have really tried to specialize in because I have always felt that if  you and your loved ones don't have your healthcare, everything else  goes by the board. I don't recall very many examples of this kind of  dysfunction. I don't know any other way to sum it up. This kind of  dysfunction is unacceptable to the millions of Americans who need this  medicine.   So I am going to stay at it. I know the Presiding Officer well enough  to know that he feels strongly about helping exactly these kinds of  people. It is a problem that is hammering families from one end of the  country to another. It is particularly hard right now as we speak on  the folks I represent in rural Oregon, the folks I am going to see at  the townhall meetings here in a few days. We are going to stay at it  until we get it fixed.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of the following nomination: Calendar No.  167, Eric G.
