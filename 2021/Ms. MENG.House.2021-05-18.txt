 Madam Speaker, for over a year, against the backdrop of a  raging COVID-19 virus and an economic crisis, Asian Americans have been  fighting an additional pandemic: the virus of hate and bigotry.   Over 6,600 incidents of physical, verbal, and online attacks against  those of Asian descent have been reported since March 2020. Of these,  about two-thirds were reported by women.  [[Page H2467]]    Throughout this pandemic, over 2 million Asian Americans served our  Nation as frontline workers, including those in healthcare, and yet  some of these same Asian Americans became victims of hate as they were  commuting to or from work.   Children as young as my two boys have been attacked on playgrounds in  their own neighborhoods across the country in every single State.  Elderly are being assaulted, tragically resulting in deaths. This  culminated in the worst kind of tragedy, with the mass shootings in  Atlanta.   We need to address this hate once and for all. That is why I  introduced the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act. I am proud the Senate  companion bill, led by Senator Hirono, passed in the Senate last month  with resounding bipartisan support, 94-1.   The COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act is a necessary step to confront the  second pandemic of racism and discrimination. We cannot mend what we do  not measure.   I strongly urge my colleagues to stand with me and vote for the  passage of this bill.
