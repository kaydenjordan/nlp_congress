 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the service of  esteemed public servant, activist, and great American Betty Reid  Soskin.   Betty is a constituent, a friend, and a pillar of Contra Costa County  in the Bay Area in California. She is fondly known as the National Park  Service's oldest serving ranger, at 98 years old, and is assigned to  the Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home Front National Historical Park  in Richmond, California.   As an interpretive park ranger for the past 13 years, Betty has  educated thousands of visitors about the Rosies and her own experience  as a young Black woman working in Richmond during World War II. She  worked as a file clerk for the Boilermakers Union A-36, a Jim Crow, all  African American union auxiliary.   Betty has been an activist her whole life. She fought for civil  rights during Freedom Summer, was an activist against the Vietnam war,  helped with faith-based racial healing work in the Unitarian  Universalist church, and became a delegate to the 1972 Democratic  National Convention.   Betty also served as a legislative aide for a Berkeley city council  member and as a field representative for two California State Assembly  members, which led to her involvement in designing the Rosie the  Riveter National Park. Her advocacy ensured that marginalized  communities' narratives and stories were included in the park's  historical exhibits and resources on the war efforts in Richmond,  California.   In 1995, Betty was named a Woman of the Year by the California State  Legislature. She was also named one of the Nation's 10 outstanding  women in 2006 by the National Women's History Project.   In 2015, she was formally recognized by President Barack Obama, who  gave her a silver coin with the Presidential seal.   Born in 1921, Betty has lived through many pivotal moments in U.S.  history and is a crucial voice in speaking to the value of American  democracy, the realities of the African American struggle, and the  importance of continued progress.   In an interview for a feature in Glamour magazine, Betty said, when  she was Woman of the Year: ``Democracy has been experiencing these  periods of chaos since 1776. They come and go. And it's in those  periods that democracy is redefined. History has been written by people  who got it wrong, but the people who are always trying to get  [[Page H8304]]  it right have prevailed. If that were not true,'' Betty said, ``I would  still be a slave like my great-grandmother.''    Betty's colleagues, fans, and friends deeply admire her activism, her  leadership, and her dedication to social justice and to America. Her  positivity, sense of self, and commitment to doing what is right and  preserving and honoring our past continue to inspire us all.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating and celebrating this  wonderful American's dedicated service and in wishing her a speedy  recovery and good health. Her strong spirit and perseverance are an  inspiration to us all.                            ____________________
