 Mr. President, I am going to keep my remarks short and  simple. America and the world need immediately the toughest possible  sanctions against the Russian oligarchs, who are working constantly to  devise Byzantine schemes to get around the kind of sanctions that are  in this trade bill.   We all understand what is at issue here, and that is that we need to  move quickly. We need to move while the President is mobilizing the  collective strength of our allies.   And I am interested in working with all of my colleagues. With the  majority leader's leadership, we have been working for days on this.  But what is important--and our friend from Maryland has touched on it-- is that we not just relitigate what came up in one committee or  another, if it is going to hold up the essential task ahead, and that  is that these oligarchs who are Putin's  [[Page S1765]]  best allies and are working with him constantly to figure out ways to  get money to fuel the Putin war machine--what they really don't want is  what the sanctions will do: rein them in and limit them as they  continually try to devise these schemes.   So I would just urge my colleagues--and we are here to continue to  work on this--to get this done and get it done now because to do  otherwise allows the oligarchs and all their lawyers and financial  managers to look at what is happening in the U.S. Senate. And those  oligarchs say, ``Doesn't look like there is going to be anything right  now--don't have to worry immediately.''   The Senate is better than this. I urge my colleagues to pass this  bill, which would impose the harshest economic consequences of a  generation on the Russians, and particularly the oligarchs, who have  done so much to prop Putin up against the odds.   Pass this bill. Pass it now.   I yield the floor.
