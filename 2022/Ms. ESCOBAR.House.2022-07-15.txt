 Madam Speaker, it has been 22 days since the Supreme  Court overturned Roe v. Wade, taking away women's ability to make  choices about their own future, setting us back nearly 50 years. But  even that is not enough for Republicans.   In the last 24 hours alone, we have gotten a glimpse into the dark  future Republicans have in store for women, doctors, and vulnerable  children:   The Indiana attorney general says he is investigating the doctor who  treated a 10-year-old rape victim.   Texas sues the Biden administration for requiring abortions in  medical emergencies so that women's lives could be saved.   And the National Right to Life official who said the 10-year-old  should have had her baby.   Yes, according to Republicans, even a little girl impregnated by a  brutal rape should be denied an abortion and have to endure a  government-mandated birth.   Remember, this is the same party that has voted against:   Paid family and medical leave for parents of that baby.   Childcare for babies.   Universal pre-K for babies.   The Child Tax Credit, which helps babies.   School lunch programs that help babies.   Commonsense gun violence prevention measures that keep those babies  safe in school, and much more.   The Republicans' war on women has never been more dangerous. Today,  we will vote on the Women's Health Protection Act to ensure that women  across this country have access to abortion and the freedom to make  their own decisions about their bodies and their futures.   America, Democrats have your back.
