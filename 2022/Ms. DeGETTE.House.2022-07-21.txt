 Madam Speaker, at the hearing I had on this issue in my  subcommittee the other day, Dr. Resneck, the president of the AMA, said  he doesn't want to have, when he is in clinic with a patient, a State  Attorney General sitting on his shoulder.   I know how he feels because many of my colleagues on the other side  not only want to stop a patient's ability and decision to have an  abortion, they apparently want to tell people now what kinds of birth  control they can use.   Today I have heard my colleagues on the other side say falsely that  IUDs, that chemical birth control, that other forms of birth control  are ``abortifacients.'' Not only is this patently untrue, but it harms  millions of Americans.   I would say that I think everybody listening to this debate is  probably confused. My colleagues say, oh, we support birth control. But  make no mistake about it, there have been bills in a number of States,  and there have been bills in this body to ban common forms of birth  control--not abortion, birth control--and that has got to stop.   My colleagues across the aisle, they think that the rhythm method or  condoms or something like that are okay, but the things women use to  stop getting pregnant can't be used, and I think that is important to  point out.   I think every woman in America needs to know this, and, frankly,  every patient in America should be able to make their open decision  about their healthcare for abortion and birth control.
