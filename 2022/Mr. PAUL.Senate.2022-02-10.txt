 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize the  small business, Cruise Customs of Shepherdsville, KY, as the Senate  Small Business of the Week.   It is not every week that I have the privilege of honoring a veteran- owned small business, but when I do, it is with profound respect and  gratitude not only for this Kentucky entrepreneur, but for our men and  women in uniform. Cruise Customs was started by Chris Cruise, a veteran  paratrooper who served in the 82nd Airborne Division during Operation  Iraqi Freedom. After serving his country, like many veterans, Chris  Cruise returned to the U.S. carrying with him the traumas of war.  Woodworking became a sort of therapy for him, and he combined that  passion for working with his hands with his deeply rooted patriotism  and founded Cruise Customs in 2017.   Cruise Customs not only honors the great Nation that we live in, it  also pays tribute to the wonderful State of Kentucky. The idea behind  his business came from Chris and his wife Amber's desire to create  something that honored both the Nation that he fought for and his  wife's native State. The final product was a large American flag  constructed from the wood used in old Kentucky bourbon barrels. While  bourbon-barrel flags continue to be their most popular item, the  business has expanded their scope of products offered. The Cruises'  patriotic mission has remained at the heart of their business  throughout its steady growth, as they broadened their service to the  veteran community and to their local area when Cruise Customs' unique  craftsmanship gained national recognition.   The whole Cruise Customs team use their dedication for service as  inspiration for designing new products. These days, one can buy Chris'  signature bourbon-barrel flag not only in a variety of sizes, one can  also find various flags with a different colored stripe running through  the center of the flag. The colors symbolize the business' support for  various causes: blue, in honor of our Nation's police officers; red, to  show their support for our Nation's fire fighters; pink, to spread  breast cancer awareness and to champion its survivors. While these  limited edition pieces stand out against their array of merchandise,  the America ``One Heartbeat'' flag is perhaps their most impactful  creation.   Their America ``One Heartbeat'' flag, a limited edition piece  displaying the EKG sign of a heartbeat down the center stripe, was  designed by Chris and Amber Cruise during the early days of the  pandemic. Always wanting to give back to their community, Cruise  Customs donated all proceeds from the sale of their America ``One  Heartbeat'' flags to the medical frontline heroes at Norton Healthcare  and U of L Health in Louisville. This noble idea quickly gained  national attention, which allowed Cruise Customs to sell over 4,500 of  these flags and donate over $70,000 to their local medical community.   Cruise Customs' dedication to their community has not gone unnoticed.  Last year, Chris Cruise was named one of Louisville Business First's  Business Impact Award Nominees. Chris and Amber Cruise have also  broadened their venture by opening and codirecting Kentucky's first  local chapter of USA Cares, a nonprofit dedicated  [[Page S645]]  to ``providing military families with financial and advocacy support  during their time of need.'' From serving his country, to founding a  small business dedicated to giving back to the veteran community, Chris  has consistently displayed a generous and patriotic spirit which  permeates throughout his business and his family. Congratulations to  Chris and Amber Cruise and the entire Cruise Customs team. I thank you  for your brave service to this country and for your charitable spirit.  I wish them the best of luck and look forward to watching their  continued growth and success in Kentucky.                            ____________________
