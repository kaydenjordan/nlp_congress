 Madam President, I am sorry I didn't have the chance to  say thank you to our colleague from Connecticut for his speech tonight  about loneliness in the United States. I was grateful that he gave it  and grateful that he is in the Senate and grateful to know that another  parent of young kids has the perspective that he has shared tonight  because I think it is so important. And strangely enough, I am here to  talk about something similar tonight.   First, Madam President, I will put it away because it is not supposed  to be on the floor, but I wanted to come here tonight to talk a little  bit about this smartphone and the world of social media, the world of  machine learning algorithms and generative AI that has now been put at  our fingertips.   The rise of smartphones and social media is one of the most rapid,  profound, and, I would argue, poorly understood transformations in  American life in our entire history.   If you had asked me when I was the age of the pages who are here,  when I was growing up, and you had said to me: Someday, Michael, there  is going to be a device--well, here is the device--there is going to be  a device that looks like this; it doesn't even have a wire next to it,  that would have been astonishing in and of itself. How can an  electronic device not have a wire? But it does not have a wire. Not  only does it not have a wire, but you can FaceTime anybody on Earth the  way Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock FaceTimed each other.   The Presiding Officer knows what I am talking about. These folks may  not know who Captain Kirk was or who Mr. Spock was. But the idea that  you could reach somebody and communicate with them on video, on a  telephone, or a device that had no wires, that alone would have been  shocking.   If you had said: Well, let me tell you something else about that  device, I would say: OK. What else can you tell me about that device?   And you said: Well, you can buy any book that has ever been written  by humans, basically, on that device. And if you want it, you can make  a choice. You can have it digitally, and it will just download  immediately on your device, or you can order it, and it can be at your  house by tonight, if you would rather have a print version of the book  rather than getting it digitally. And I will tell you something else,  Michael, it will translate any language that you care to hear.   I was, today, with the CEO of Google who was in my office talking  about how one of their projects now is to help recover and sustain lost  languages or languages we are in danger of losing in this country and  around the world, which I think is a worthy project. We definitely, in  my State, are at risk of losing Native American languages that really  are at risk.   But in any case, if you said to me: You can translate any language or  you can translate yourself into any language, and somebody would ask:  What do you think that device is worth? In 1983 or 1987, when I was  graduating from high school or college, I think I probably would have  said that is probably--I can't imagine what it is worth--millions of  dollars. Millions of dollars. To have every book that has ever been  published that is in every library in the world? Millions of dollars,  to be able to translate every language that you can translate? Millions  of dollars.   And if you told me that it actually only cost a few hundred dollars,  which it does, and that everybody on planet Earth would have one, which  is almost in many ways the case, I would have asked what you were  smoking. But it is true. It is true. And that is the world we have  inhabited for almost 20 years. It is not new: the digital age, the  information age, the age of ubiquitous smartphones, social media, and a  handful of digital platforms that control them.   And for all of the extraordinary convenience and extraordinary  productivity and entertainment that these technologies have allowed, as  a country, we still haven't come to grips with the profound cost to our  economy, to our society, and to our democracy, and that is before we  even consider AI.   This is what everybody around here is talking about, what some would  call the most consequential technology for humanity since the invention  of fire. But unlike fire, this technology can improve itself, and it  has the potential to move faster and transform more than any innovation  in our history, for better or for worse.   Even in its early days, generative AI has already demonstrated the  power to write the code to animate and even compose in ways that would  have been absolutely unimaginable 20 years ago or 10 years ago, to say  nothing of when we were in school.   It is easy to forget how different the world was just 20 years ago.  Twenty years ago, General Motors topped the Fortune 500 list. Apple was  285, and Amazon didn't even make the cut. Twitter was still an idea  somewhere in the recesses of Jack Dorsey's head. Mark Zuckerberg was  barely old enough to vote, even though he likely already acquired the  undeveloped view of the First Amendment that he seems to hold to this  day. No one on this planet had ever heard of Gmail or TikTok or  ChatGPT. That was only 20 years ago, but it might as well have been 200  years ago.   Today, Americans spend over 2 hours a day on social media, more time  socializing online than in person. The average TikTok user in our  country spends 90 minutes a day on the app--more than 3 weeks a year.   Facebook now hosts 2.7 billion friends--a half a billion more souls  than Christianity.   Twitter has fewer followers, but they include every single  politician--probably almost every single person in this Chamber--every  journalist, every TV producer in America, withering our political  debate to 280-character effervescent posts.   In just two decades, a few companies--less than a handful, really-- have transformed much of humanity's daily life: how we amuse ourselves,  how we discover, how we learn, how we shop, how we connect with friends  and family and elected representatives, how we pay attention, how we  glimpse our shared reality. This transformation is a staggering  testament to American innovation.   And we can all think of a dozen ways that platforms have improved our  lives. I, for one, have been entirely relieved of the stress of sitting  in rush-hour traffic, wondering if there is a better route. I am now  confident that Waze is guiding me like my own personal North Star, and  that has made an enormous difference to my sense of well-being.   But this dramatic shift from our analog to our digital human  existence has never been guided and has never been informed by the  public interest. It has  [[Page S2177]]  always been dictated by the unforgiving requirements of a few gigantic  American corporations and their commercial self-interests. And what are  those interests? To make us better informed citizens? To make us more  productive employees? To make us happier people? Of course not. It is  to turn a profit and protect their profits through their own economic  dominance, and they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams.   This is the market capitalization of some of the largest industries  in America. You can see at the top here that this is Apple and  Microsoft and Alphabet and Amazon and Meta combined. They are at $9  trillion in market cap. To get to $9 trillion, you basically have to  add up our entire banking sector, our entire oil and gas sector, and  our entire pharmaceutical sector just to give you a sense of the size  of the market cap of these companies alone and the reason they have  become so dominant.   Through it all, unlike almost any small business in Boulder, CO, or  in any town in New Hampshire, these digital platforms have remained  almost entirely unregulated--moving fast and breaking things, as they  have famously said, and forcing the rest of us to sweep up the  wreckage.   There is another way these companies are different from the brick- and-mortar companies in Boulder, CO, or in New Hampshire. Digital  platforms aren't burdened by the fixed costs of an analog world. Beyond  the blinking lights of their energy-intensive server farms, their  businesses are on the cloud, a place where no one works and that  requires little physical investment. They have no need to use their  profits to invest in America by building the kind of infrastructure  these other industries do or had.   Unlike their industrial forbearers, today's platforms have devised a  new digital barrier to entry to protect their profits. It is different  from the way it was in the past. They have figured out how to protect  their profits and economic dominance, and we know that digital barrier  as the network effect.   The network effect means that platforms become exponentially more  valuable as more people join and spend more of their waking moments  there--more valuable to users because their friends and families are on  it; more valuable to the platforms themselves, which hoover up our  identities for their profits and train their machine-learning  algorithms; more valuable for advertisers, who pay the platforms for  our identities to barrage us with ads; and so valuable--so valuable--to  the markets, where the top tech companies now equal, roughly, a quarter  of the entire S&P 500.   In the name of building this barrier to entry--this network effect-- they have stolen our identities and our privacy, and they have addicted  us to their platforms. The platforms' imperative to grow big and stay  big poses a very basic question: How do you get people on your  platform, and how do you keep them there?   For platforms like Apple and Amazon, it is to sell products that  people want, to offer subscriptions, and, if they are lucky, to enmesh  them in your closed ecosystems. For social media platforms with free  services, like Meta and Twitter and TikTok, the answer is more  sinister, I am afraid--to harvest as much data on your users as you  can, to feed that data to your algorithms to serve up whatever content  it takes to keep people hooked so you can keep selling ads.   That is the core business model. That is the model that has led to  these market caps. Although this particular business model has bestowed  enormous value on a few companies, it has imposed profound costs on  everybody else, even in places we don't necessarily expect it.   A senior law enforcement official just told me, within the last  couple of weeks, that social media is the ``last mile of every fentanyl  and meth transaction in America.'' The Presiding Officer knows that in  being from New Hampshire. It took my staff 20 seconds to find illegal  drugs for sale on Instagram.   I would ask the pages, please, to avert your eyes here. The image on  the left appears to be pills of MDMA. The image on the right shows you  how to contact the dealer through Whatsapp and pay him through another  app called Wickr. Below that are all of the places you can purchase  this stuff, including in Denver, CO, where we are having a terrible,  terrible problem with fentanyl and with methamphetamines.   Even though the vast majority of Americans never interact with  content like this, we all pay a price. Millions of Americans have  surrendered to private companies an endless feed of data on their  lives, all for the convenience of being served up self-gratifying  political content on YouTube, less traffic, or better movie  recommendations. Most Americans have made that trade without ever  really knowing it.    The young people who are here today don't know a world where that  trade was something that wasn't automatically made. Any suggestion that  we have made that trade fairly, I think, is ludicrous. It mocks any  sense of consent. These are contracts of adhesion, really. As a  society, we have never asked how much of our identity or our privacy we  are willing to trade for convenience and entertainment. We have never  had a negotiation with Mark Zuckerberg about that. Until today, these  questions have been resolved entirely to the benefit of the platforms'  bottom lines.   I suppose it would be one thing if the only consequences of the  digital platforms' use of our data were to sell better advertising-- although even that would be a fairly pathetic concession, I think, of  our own economic interests and of the precious value of our data and  our privacy and our identities. But, as every parent knows and as every  kid suspects, better advertising is not the only consequence of this  model.   Over the years, digital platforms have imported features from gaming  and from gambling--from brightly covered displays to flashing  notifications, to likes--and they unleash secret algorithms to reverse- engineer our most basic human tendencies, which are to seek out tribe  approval, conformity, and to create an almost irresistible feed of  content.   Americans now spend a third of their waking hours on their phones,  which we check an average of 344 times a day. In speaking as a parent  who has raised three daughters in this era, we certainly have not  agreed to run a science experiment on our children with machine- learning algorithms and generative AI chatbots that the companies  themselves barely understand at all.   While we are still coming to understand the specific role social  media plays in the epidemic of teen mental health, the early evidence  gives us plenty of reason to worry. Here is what we do know:   In 2006, Facebook became available to the general public. The  following year, Apple released the iPhone. By 2012, just 5 years later,  half of Americans had a smartphone. Today, everyone has one. Everybody  has got one, I think, except for Chuck Schumer, the majority leader,  who is still using a flip phone.   A similar story unfolded with teens and with social media. By 2012,  about half of teens used social media. Today, 95 percent of teens use  it. When my parents excoriated me--and they did, just like your parents  excoriated you for being glued to the television in the 1970s--the  average American teen watched TV for 4 hours a day. Today, teens are on  their screens for twice as long. Half are online almost constantly,  they say. More than one in five 10th grade girls spend 7 or more hours  a day on social media. That is 35 hours a week. In France, that is a  full-time job.   As our children retreat into the digital world of someone else's  making, they pay for it. They are paying for it with less sleep and  exercise and time with their friends, as my colleague from Connecticut  was talking about. All of this has contributed to an epidemic of teen  anxiety, to depression, and to loneliness, especially among teenage  girls.   Today, girls who use social media heavily are two to three times as  likely to say they are depressed, compared to those who use it less  often or not at all. And since the introduction of smartphones and  social media, we have seen a dramatic and unprecedented rise in serious  depression among Americans under 25.   To be fair, I am not saying social media is the only cause of this.  But as the father of three daughters who have  [[Page S2178]]  grown up in its shadow, I know it has played a role.   Kids are in despair in our country. Today, almost half of teens  believe they can't do anything right. Almost half of teens say: I don't  enjoy life, and my life is not useful.   All of these numbers began to rise around the time that smartphones  and social media began to pervade the country and hook a generation to  their screens.   Over this same period, we have tragically seen the suicides of young  people increase 60 percent compared to 2007.   I see this crisis of teen mental health everywhere I go in Colorado-- everywhere I go in Colorado. Parents tell me about how social media has  undermined their children's sense of well-being and especially-- especially--a girl's body image and sense of self.   A teenager recently told me that the ``electronic bullying follows me  home.''   ``There is no escape,'' she said, ``at any hour, on any day.''   And I felt the panic. I felt the panic of a parent who can't fix it  and make it better. It felt like there was nothing that I could do. It  was beyond my control to make it better.   It has become common now, at the end of my townhalls, for parents to  come up to me. They are usually not people--or they are often not  people--who have come to the townhall to listen to the townhall; they  are people who might be working the slide projector or who might have  set the chairs out for people to sit in. They come to me after the talk  is over, the conversation is over, and they will say something like: My  daughter is 5 feet 10 inches, she is 105 pounds, and her confidence is  in tatters because of the way she has interacted with social media and  the way it has shredded her body image.    All of my young staff and my two eldest daughters universally say how  lucky they are to have avoided middle school in the age of social media  or to have gone to middle school before there was social media. Their  younger siblings aren't so lucky, and they know that about their  younger siblings.   Maybe the most poignant expression of this concern were the moms whom  I met in the Mississippi Delta, in my wife's hometown of Marianna, AR,  which is the county seat of Lee County, AR. One after the other of  these moms told me that their kids in this rural, poor county in  America just don't read because no book can compete with their phone-- even as the Silicon Valley executives who designed these phones send  their kids to social media detox camps every single summer. That is not  something that is available to these parents in Marianna. These parents  work two or three jobs. They can't afford childcare. And they have to  compete for their child's attention against algorithmic poison. They  have never stood a chance, and neither have their kids. Now these  parents also have to compete with generative AI, virtual reality, and  the power they bestow to fully immerse yourself in the digital world.   My constituents in Colorado are most worried about what digital  platforms have done to their kids and their families. I will tell you,  I don't have a bunch of data tonight about the causal link between  social media and the phones and the mental health epidemic that is  going on in America, especially among American youth, but there is no  doubt that we are having that epidemic. There is no doubt that it  correlates to the advent of the phone and social media. There is no  doubt it has been compounded by COVID and the effects of that.   This has been a hard time to be a young person in our country, to be  a high school student, to be a college student, to have your life  interrupted by a once-in-a-generation, once-in-100-years pandemic on  top of everything else. I just think about all the kids like my  daughter Anne, who spent so much of that time in her room at home on  that phone.   When I was superintendent of the Denver public schools 15 years ago,  we were working, focused so much on student achievement. It is amazing  the way things have changed. When I was asked about this--about  education in America--long after I had been superintendent but before  COVID happened, I had an easy answer back then. My answer was mental  health. Mental health. Mental health. And that was pre-COVID. There  isn't anybody in America who thinks things have gotten better since  then.   This is a tough time to be a kid in our country. It is a tough time  to be a kid because of this dynamic. It is a tough time to be a kid  because we haven't, as the Senator from New Hampshire has told us here  over and over again, figured out how to stop this epidemic of fentanyl  in this country, so that we are living in a time now, unlike when I was  superintendent, where kids have to lobby their school nurses to be able  to put antidotes in the nurse's office so their friends don't die  because they took one pill that was labeled a prescription drug, and  that pill killed them or almost killed them. We didn't do that--worry  about that when I was superintendent 15 years ago.   This is off-topic tonight, but add on to that the fact that in  America--this is the only country in the world where the leading cause  of death for kids is guns, and two-thirds of that is people killing  people, other people, assaults or suicides. Only 5 percent are  accidents.   This is a tough time to be a kid in America.   I would argue that a lot of what we are dealing with here is manmade,  human-made. It is not just a natural occurrence out there, somehow, in  the world. We have to come to grips with it. We have to understand it.   Among other things, we need these companies, like other companies in  the past, to share their data so that independent researchers can help  us make the assessments we need to make in order to make the judgments  we need to make to provide oversight--kind of like the tobacco  companies finally had to cough up the data way back when.   As I say, my constituents are most worried about this, these issues,  about their kids and about their families, but they also worry a lot  about the effect on our democracy, and they have a lot of reason to be  concerned about that too.   When I first joined the Senate, it was around the time of the so- called Twitter revolutions in Egypt and Libya and Tunisia that we then  heralded as the Arab Spring. At the time, people in Washington and  around the world hailed social media as a powerful tool for democracy.  It didn't take long, though, for tyrants to turn those tools  against democracy. The dictators who once feared social media soon  harnessed it for their purposes--to track opponents, to dox critics,  and to flood the zone with propaganda.    Vladimir Putin understood this better than most. He saw the vast and  unregulated power of social media over our democracy, and he wielded  social media as a digital Trojan horse to inflame our divisions and  undermine trust in our democracy. The damage inflicts us to this day.   Ahead of the 2016 elections, Putin flooded our social media with  disinformation. According to the Mueller report, the Russians  ``conducted social media operations . . . with the goal of sowing  discord in the U.S. political system.'' We know that, of course, now.   They sought to fracture our country along every conceivable line-- race, religion, class, sexuality, politics--playing both sides. They  didn't care. Half this stuff is pro-immigrant, for example; half is  anti-immigrant. Half of it is pro-Muslim; half is anti-Muslim. What  they wanted was to divide this country, to divide this democracy.   By the way, it took us more than a year to figure out this was  Russian propaganda and not just our own political discourse, which says  a lot about our own political discourse, where we might want to reflect  on that.   The Russians played both sides over 10 million tweets and nearly  4,000 fake accounts. Imagine what Putin would have done with generative  AI or could do with generative AI and the power to create fake images  and videos that most of us would fail to distinguish from reality.   Back in 2016, as I said, we let it all happen because we couldn't  tell the difference between this discourse and our discourse.   I published a book during my not-very-well-noticed campaign for  President about this because I kept running into people--I can remember  I ran into a senior at a nursing home in New Hampshire who was  repeating stuff that I knew was Russian propaganda.   He was saying: What are you going to do about it?  [[Page S2179]]    I am not saying that you couldn't find something on the internet that  is true. Obviously, there is a lot there. But he was repeating Russian  propaganda, and he didn't have any idea.   When I joined the Senate Intelligence Committee after that, I began  to realize that this problem extended far beyond our borders and that  it was serious. That is why 3 years ago I wrote to Mark Zuckerberg,  warning him--warning him--that Facebook had become authoritarians'  ``platform of choice'' to suppress their opposition around the world.   The consequences have been horrific. In Myanmar, the United Nations  named Facebook ``a significant factor'' in stoking communal violence  against the Rohingya after it repeatedly ignored calls to remove hate  speech and hire more staff who actually knew the country.   Around the world, we have seen fake stories on these platforms spark  violence--in India, in Sri Lanka, in Kenya, and on January 6, 2021,  here in the United States of America.   In the weeks before January 6, President Trump--our first President  who ran his campaign and administration through Twitter--incited a mob  to invade this Capitol. I remember sitting in a windowless room with  the Presiding Officer in the Capitol on the 6th. We watched CNN as our  fellow citizens invaded the U.S. Capitol with their racist banners and  with their anti-Semitic t-shirts to ``save'' an election, they said,  that had not been stolen.   In these moments, we cannot bury our heads in our digital feeds. All  of us are called upon to defend this democracy and to burnish our  example at home. We can help--the people in this body can help by  reining in the vast power of digital platforms and reasserting the  interests of the American people and our public interest.   The Americans who came before us would never have known about  algorithms. They wouldn't have known about network effects. But they  would recognize the challenge that we face, and their example should  guide our way.   The Founders themselves designed one of the most elegant forms of  checks and balances to guard against tyranny.   After Upton Sinclair exposed ghastly conditions in meatpacking  facilities, in 1906, Teddy Roosevelt joined Congress to create the Food  and Drug Administration. As broadcasting became more central to  American life, in 1934, FDR and Congress created the Federal  Communications Commission. After the 2009 financial crisis, President  Obama and Congress established the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau. In each case, Congress knew it lacked expertise to oversee  complex new sectors of the economy, so it created independent bodies to  empower--to empower--the American people.   Today, we have no dedicated entity to protect the public interest,  and we have been powerless as a result. That is why last year, I  introduced a bill to create a Federal Digital Platform Commission. I  reintroduced it earlier this month with our colleague Senator Welch  from Vermont.   We have essentially proposed an FCC for digital platforms--it is not  really more complicated than that--an independent body with five  Senate-confirmed Commissioners empowered to protect consumers, to  protect competition, and to defend the public and the public's  interest. The Commission would hold hearings, conduct research, pursue  investigations, establish commonsense rules for the sector, and enforce  violations with tough penalties. Most important, the Agency would  finally put the American people in a negotiation with digital platforms  that have amassed vast power beyond our imagination and over the  American people's lives and the lives of our children.   Previous Congresses knew they would never have the expertise to  approve or disapprove new drugs, for example.   We didn't have a debate on this floor about that because we knew that  expertise would better lie with the FDA. We don't write the safety  guidelines for airlines on this floor either. We have a commission that  will do that.   Why would we expect Congress to be able to regulate technologies that  are moving at quantum speed like AI? It is not possible.   And perhaps this is why Sam Altman, the creator of ChatGPT, testified  that we urgently need a new regulator--assuming that he wasn't a deep  fake.   Some may say: We don't need a new government Agency. We already have  the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice.   These Agencies are staffed by hard-working public servants, but they  don't have the expertise or the tools or the time to regulate this  brandnew sector. And that was before generative AI.   And I want to say, on that note, I am very grateful to Chuck Schumer,  the majority leader, for his remarks earlier today. I completely agree  that we need to chart a responsible course between promoting innovation  in AI and ensuring the safety of our children and our democracy.   And while I think a dedicated, expert Agency is the best solution,  and I believe others will come to that judgment as well, I welcome the  debate that we are going to have on this. And I am the first to admit  that I don't have a monopoly on wisdom on anything but certainly on  this.   But whatever we do, we cannot accept another 20 years of digital  platforms transforming American life with no accountability to the  American people. We are still coming to terms with the harm from 20  years of unregulated social media. And we haven't come to grips with  that. Every parent knows that. I shudder to imagine what our country  will look like if we allow the same story to work its way out with AI.   That particular technology may be new, but we face a familiar  American juncture. We have been here before. In the late 19th century,  when Gilded Age robber barons abused their dominance of the coal,  steel, and railroad industries to stifle competition, to exploit  workers and undermine democracy, government stepped in to assert the  public interest.   And, looking back, it is hard to imagine American life without the  victories of that era--from basic antitrust laws and consumer  protections to the direct election of Senators and the income tax. And  I think, looking forward, we have similar questions to answer.   What will our response be to the digital robber barons of our era  that addict our children, that corrode our democracy and plunder our  privacy, our identity, and our attention? Will we allow them to  continue transforming American life according to their self-interest,  or will we step up to safeguard the interests, civil liberties, and the  freedoms of the American people?   You know, especially for young people that are listening to this who  might say: There is nothing you can do; the cat is out of the bag; you  can't hold back the ocean--my answer to that is not very helpful  because it is to recall something that young people here won't  remember, but it is in my mind when I am talking to families and to  young people in my State and I am listening to them talk about the  mental health impacts of what they are facing.   It reminds me of when the Cuyahoga River caught on fire in Cleveland.  And that moment, for those of us who were around then, was so  extraordinary because that unbelievable image of a river in America  burning, catching on fire, flames shooting into the sky, that is what  finally forced us to come to grips with the pollution that we were  allowing to flow freely into our watersheds and into our communities.  The same thing with our air. And we finally did something about it, and  the country is better as a result.   This is another case, by the way, just like those environmental  regulations, where I think it is critically important for the United  States, with our set of values and our commitments to democracy, to  help set the international standards here and to not take standards  from authoritarian regimes like China, for example.    And that is a big risk if we don't act here. But I think we will, and  I think we can. And I think that is going to not only give the American  people a chance to negotiate with these companies but give America the  chance to lead on questions that are fundamentally important for  humanity.   None of this is going to be easy. It never is. But when the stakes  are nothing less than the health of our children and the health of our  democracy, we have no choice but to try. And we  [[Page S2180]]  should try. I think we have a unique responsibility to lead here, not  just for the reasons that I just said but also because, after all, it  was American companies that blazed the trail into the digital age and  invited all of humanity to follow. And we now live in the world that  they created, for better and for worse, with its wonders and with its  conveniences but also with its risks and dangers and difficult  questions.   The same platforms that amplify a protester's cry for freedom in Iran  also equip tyrants around the world to suppress democratic movements.  The same technologies that liberated anyone to say anything also  unleashed a perpetual cacophony, leaving all of us screaming louder to  be heard. The dazzling features that brought the world online have also  trapped us there, more connected but more alone, more aware but less  informed--enthralled to our screens, growing more anxious, more angry  and addicted by the day.   Overcoming all of this will not be easy, but we can't simply hide  under our covers or scroll through TikTok and hope these problems are  going to solve themselves. That is our job. The health and future of  our children lie in the decisions that we make or the decisions that we  fail to make.   Our objective, my objective to being here tonight, is not to hold the  world back. In Colorado, we have always welcomed innovation, but we  also understand that not all change is progress and that it is our job  to harness these changes toward a better world.   We are the first generations to steer our democracy in the digital  age, and it is an open question whether democracy can survive in the  world that digital platforms have created. I may be wrong, but the  evidence so far does not fill me with confidence. It fills me with  urgency--urgency to reassert the public interest; to reclaim our public  square and exercise in self-government; to level the playing field for  America's teens, for our parents, for teachers and small businesses  who, for 20 years, have battled alone against some of the most powerful  companies in human history.   This is a fight worth having. This is a fight worth winning. And if  we succeed, we may help save democracy not just in this country but  around the world.   I yield the floor.
