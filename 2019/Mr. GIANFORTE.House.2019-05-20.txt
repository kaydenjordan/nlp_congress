 Mr. Speaker, we have a crisis on our southern border,  even if Democrat leaders try desperately to deny it. Nearly 100,000  people were detained last month trying to illegally cross our southern  border.   Mr. Speaker, imagine if the population of Billings, Montana, was  caught crossing the border in just 1 month. That is the crisis our  country faces.   Last week, a U.S. district court judge in Billings sentenced a  Mexican citizen to prison for possession of 34 pounds of meth with the  intent to distribute. That is nearly 125,000 doses. With Montana facing  a meth epidemic, we must secure our border and stop the flow of Mexican  meth into our communities.   Mr. Speaker, I saw firsthand the crisis on our southern border.  Congress has an obligation to act. I have stood with President Trump to  secure it. Let's build the wall where feasible. The safety and security  of our country and our communities depend on it.                            ____________________
