 Mr. President, I come to the floor to mark a very  unfortunate date. We are recognizing the 2-year anniversary of the  shooting at Pulse nightclub on June 12, and on Sunday, June 17, we are  going to mark the 3-year anniversary of the shooting at a church in  Charleston. The killer in Charleston murdered nine people attending a  Bible study. The killer in Orlando murdered 49 people who were at a  nightclub.   I just came from my office meeting with one of the survivors of the  Pulse nightclub shooting.   About 93 people are killed every day from guns. That is a mixture of  suicides, homicides, and accidental shootings. That means that in the  731 days since the Pulse nightclub shooting, we have had somewhere  around 70,000 people killed by guns in this country. That is a  statistic that has no comparison anywhere else in the world. In the  United States, we have about 20 times the number of people on a per  capita basis who are being killed by a gun than the average OECD  competitor nation. Something is going on here that is different than  what is happening anywhere else.   As my colleagues know, I try to come to the floor every few weeks to  talk about who these victims are to give a sense about the lives that  are cut short, all the promise that is erased from this Earth 93 times  every single day because of what is happening inside the epidemic of  gun violence and to try to relate to people how furious this mounting  cavalcade of those left behind is by our inaction. Remember, we have  done virtually nothing meaningful since the tragedy in my State at  Sandy Hook, and thus the slaughter continues.   Melvin Graham's sister, Cynthia Graham Hurd, was murdered in  Charleston in that shooting. Earlier this year, he talked about how  angry he is that Congress has done nothing meaningful to try to affect  the reality of gun violence in this Nation. He said:         You would think that this would be the time. Each time       something happens, you think, this is the time we're going to       get some action, some movement, some unity in Washington to       do something. . . . And each time they have let me down, they       have failed me. They've shown me . . . that they simply do       not care.    On the evening of June 17, 2015, Dylan Roof walked into the Emanuel  African Methodist Episcopal Church and killed nine people. He had a  criminal record and shouldn't have had a gun, but because of a loophole  in the background checks law that allows for a gun seller to transfer  weapons to someone if the background check takes a long time, Roof was  able to get a weapon, immediately go to this church, and kill nine  people. The reality is, FBI data indicates that over the last 5 years,  15,000 people have been sold weapons who shouldn't have gotten weapons  under this loophole. That means 15,000 people are walking around the  United States today with firearms who have criminal records because  their background check took 3 or 4 or 5 days. The reason background  checks take a long time--most of them take about 10 minutes--is some  people have complicated criminal histories, like Dylan Roof did. So it  simply belies commonsense to say you are going to give a gun to  somebody simply because they have a complicated criminal background and  it takes a few days to sort out. This is an example of a crime that may  not have been committed had our laws been different.   Until October of 2017, the Pulse nightclub shooting, which happened  on June 12, 2 years ago, was the deadliest in U.S. history. These  massacres that reach that tragic landmark of being the worst in U.S.  history don't last for long, given the increasing pace of gun homicides  in this country. This was an individual who was known to law  enforcement, who had been in the system because of activity on line  with respect to his connection with terrorist groups. Had we had a  comprehensive no-fly ban in this country that gives the Attorney  General the power to put people who are having conversations with  terrorist  [[Page S3869]]  groups on the list of those who can't buy guns, it is also very  possible that Omar Mateen, the shooter in this case, would never have  been able to buy a gun, killing 49 people and injuring 53 others. This  is another example of our laws being inadequate to meet the moment.   Unfortunately, this country tends to only pay attention to the issue  of gun violence when these mass shootings happen. They are truly soul- crushing, community-changing events. Newtown, CT, is never ever going  to recover from what happened there.   Every single day, whether or not we see something scrolled across the  bottom of our cable news screen about a shooting, there are still  upward of almost 100 people dying every single day--people such as  Malachi Fryer, who was 6 years old when he walked into a room where a  handgun was left unattended on a table. He took the gun back into his  bedroom to play with it, and he accidentally shot himself. He was 6  years old, and he had just finished first grade in Elizabethtown, KY.   His school principal said:         Malachi was special in many ways. He had a smile that       warmed your heart, a contagious laugh and a positive       attitude. He was a little comedian and the classroom was his       stage. He loved people and he didn't meet a stranger.       Basketball was his pleasure and joy. Our hearts are heavy       because a piece of our New Highland family is gone.    Age 6, Malachi is one of the victims of the many accidental shootings  that happen in this country.   In my State, Antonio Robinson was recently ready to graduate from  Stamford Academy. He was a former cocaptain of the Stamford High School  football team. He was standing in an overpass, and he was shot to  death. His sister said: He never bothered anybody, so he never thought  he had to dodge or hide from bullets. He was on his cell phone standing  at an overpass. He wasn't even aware he was about to be shot.   His former coach and sixth grade teacher said:         He wasn't the biggest kid out there [on the basketball       court], but he played with a lot of heart and soul. He gave       it everything he got.    Another one of his football coaches said that he was ``very  respectful.'' He was just an ``awesome, awesome kid,'' just 18 years  old. Antonio Robinson is gone.   Ryan Dela Cruz was 17 years old, from Seattle, WA. He was a senior at  Franklin High School. He dreamed of a career in the Marine Corps. He  and his friends went to a local park one recent Friday night. They  encountered another group, words were exchanged, and shots were fired.  Ryan Dela Cruz isn't living any longer.   He was described by his high school principal as ``a sweet,  thoughtful, inquisitive, and compassionate young man. . . . He was  determined to commit his life to the service of others.''   His father didn't want him to go into the Marines. His father was  worried about the safety of his son, but, increasingly, you couldn't  change Ryan's mind. He was committed to serve this country. What Ryan  said to his father sticks with his dad. When he raised the issue of  Ryan's safety, Ryan said to his father:         Papa, wherever you are, it's God's will. If you die, you       die.    Ryan Dela Cruz died at age 17.   Bob Stone was 64 years old when he died. From South Beloit, IL, he  was a community pillar, longtime member of the city council,  commissioner of the police and fire department. He and his wife Rebecca  were known throughout the community because they had put together a  festival every year in town. They were the organizers. It started with  Rebecca's parents back in 2006, and they kept it up, something to bring  the community together.   This story is particularly hard to hear because it is a murder- suicide involving his son Vito. The two of them were in a tent in the  backyard. They were spending the night with Vito's two young children.  Something happened inside that tent. Vito shot his father and then shot  himself. Luckily, the children were unharmed, but for the rest of their  lives, they are going to have to deal with the unspeakable,  indescribable trauma of that murder-suicide that took the lives of  their father and grandfather right in front of their eyes.   The young woman I met with today has gone through one of these  traumas herself, having survived the Pulse shooting from 2 years ago,  and speaks about that same kind of trauma.   Her life has been fundamentally changed from that day. Relations with  her family members have been ruptured. She lost her cousin inside the  nightclub that evening. It is a reminder. Researchers tell us every  time 1 person is shot, there are likely 20 other people who experience  some kind of trauma from that 1 shooting. Take the average of 93 people  every single day and multiply that times 20, and that will give us a  sense of just over a 24-hour period the catastrophe that happens in  families and communities across the country because of gun violence.   Well, today I will not go into the details about all the things we  can do to solve this, but I will share a statistic I came upon the  other day. My head is full of statistics, trying to explain what is  happening when I come to the floor to tell the stories of these  victims.   Here is an interesting one. I heard some of my friends say to me:  Well, America is just a more violent place. Sure, we have more guns  than other places have, but there are a lot of things happening in the  United States, different cultures living side by side, people with  different backgrounds, which may lead to more episodes of violence.   Here is a really interesting statistic. Let's go back to the OECD  countries, which are what you consider to be the most advanced 20 or so  countries in the world. If you look at rates of gun violence, the chart  tells only one story. The United States has a rate of gun violence of  about 10 people per 100,000 in terms of gun deaths, and there is no  comparison. The next highest country is Finland, which has a rate of  about 3 per 100,000. The average country is down around 1 per 100,000.  We are talking about a rate that is 10 times higher in this country  than other countries.   Let's go to another measure of violence because some people will say  we are just a more violent country. That actually is not true. We are  actually, by other measures, a less violent country than all the rest  of these.   Let's take another measure of violence. Let's take a look at  assaults. There is a statistic that measures reported assaults in these  same countries. When you look at reported assaults, the United States  is actually almost last. We aren't the country with the most assaults;  we are close to the country with the lowest number of assaults. Belgium  has more; Israel has more; Portugal has more, as does Sweden, France,  Netherlands, Italy, Switzerland, Spain, Denmark, Germany, Austria,  Norway, Ireland, Finland, New Zealand, Australia, South Korea, and the  United Kingdom. Only Japan and Canada report fewer assaults per person  per capita than the United States.   So it is not that we are a more violent nation. It is that we are, in  particular, a nation plagued by one type of violence--gun violence,  which tends, of course, to be the most lethal kind, the kind that comes  with the greatest degree of cascading trauma.   I know we have important business to do today with respect to the  Defense authorization bill. I and my State have important equities in  that bill that I hope to advance, but I still think it is worthwhile  every now and again to come to the floor and remind my colleagues that  even if they don't read about an episode of mass violence today, there  will still be nearly 100 people who lose their lives. It is an epidemic  that happens only here in the United States and is not explained by the  United States being a more violent nation in general. It is simply  explained by a nation that has more guns per capita and a Congress that  is unwilling to make sure that only the right people get their hands on  those weapons.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, we have begun the period of time in the  year when insurance companies start to declare what their intention is  with regard to rate increases, and the news is not good for American  healthcare consumers.   I am going to be joined on the floor today by a few of my colleagues  to talk  [[Page S3888]]  about what the impact of these radical increases in premiums is going  to be for our constituents. The news is not good, but, frankly, it is  no surprise because for a year and a half now, the Trump administration  has been waging a very deliberate assault on the American healthcare  system, trying to sabotage it as retribution for the country not  agreeing to overturn the Affordable Care Act, which now enjoys  widespread popularity across the country. This deliberate campaign of  sabotage--beginning the first day Trump got into office with an  Executive order, leading up to these last 2 weeks in which the Trump  Justice Department is trying to rule that protecting people with  preexisting conditions is unconstitutional--has had an impact. It has  had an impact.   I want to quickly run through what we have seen thus far with respect  to premium increases all across this country as a result of the Trump  administration's and Republicans' campaign of sabotage.   First is in Maryland. The highest increase we saw in Maryland--these  were announced about a month ago--was one plan announcing a 91-percent  increase--in 1 year, one time, a 91-percent increase. It is almost a  doubling of premiums for a PPO plan in Maryland that was primarily  being used by people with preexisting conditions, people who were sick.   The reason this plan is going up by 91 percent is because, as the  Trump administration and this Congress take steps to move healthy  people off of insurance plans to either no insurance at all or to junk  plans, only sick people or people with preexisting conditions are left  on plans like the CareFirst PPO plan. A 91-percent increase. Who in  Maryland with any kind of middle-class income can afford a 91-percent  increase?   Virginia is not much better. In Virginia, at about the same time, one  plan asked for a 64-percent increase. Again, I don't know many families  who are making $30,000 a year who can afford a 1-year, 64-percent  increase in premiums.   Remember, overall, medical inflation in this country--meaning on a  percentage basis, the amount of increase in medical costs from year to  year--is about 6 percent. So if you were just passing along the costs  to your consumers, the rate should be somewhere in the neighborhood of  5, 6, or 7 percent. Instead, in Virginia, it is 64 percent.   Senator Merkley is going to talk about Oregon, but premiums in Oregon  are going up by double digits--14 percent.   Washington State is looking at a premium increase of 30 percent. The  Kaiser plan in Washington is asking for a 30-percent increase. The  statewide average is right around 20 percent. Kaiser, in Washington,  says: ``The rate changes shown are primarily driven by the claims  experience of the single risk pool, medical inflation, and projected  changes in the risk profile of the membership due to the elimination of  the individual mandate.'' That is the change that Republicans made to  the Affordable Care Act.   You are actually in decent shape in Maine, so I will give you the  good news too. In Maine, you are only seeing a 10-percent increase in  premiums--just slightly above the rate of medical inflation.   In one of the more popular States in the country, New York, the news  is catastrophic--a 39-percent increase in premiums in the largest  health insurance plan in New York. Fidelis, which is on the State  healthcare insurance exchange, is asking for a 39-percent increase.   Let me read to you what the New York Department of Financial Services  said about this requested 39-percent increase:         With respect to the individual market, the single biggest       justification offered by insurers for the requested increases       is the Trump Administration's repeal of the individual       mandate penalty. The individual mandate, a key component of       the Affordable Care Act, helped mitigate against dramatic       price increases by ensuring healthier insurance pools.       Insurers have attributed approximately half of their       requested rate increases to the risks they see resulting from       its repeal.    It is not as if the Republicans in this body didn't know what was  going to happen. The CBO said that rates will go up by at least 10  percent in the first year if you repeal that part of the Affordable  Care Act and 13 million people will lose insurance. That is what  happens when rates go up by 40 percent. Some people just cannot afford  to pay it. So whether the number is 39 or 91 or 64, these rate  increases that are happening because of this campaign of sabotage by  the Trump administration are simply unaffordable.   Before I turn this over to Senator Merkley, let me quickly run  through what I am talking about.    In January 2017, President Trump signs an Executive order telling all  his agencies to dismantle the ACA, despite the fact that Congress  didn't repeal the Affordable Care Act and never would appeal the  Affordable Care Act.   In April of 2017, he cuts open enrollment in half for the Affordable  Care Act just to try to make sure that fewer people can sign up for  health insurance.   In May, Republicans start voting to try to take insurance away from  23 million people. Actually, one of the proposals would have taken  insurance away from 30 million people. In December of 2017, they  finally settle on legislation that takes insurance away from 13 million  people and drives costs up by at least 10 percent.   In February of this year, the Trump administration starts to allow  insurance companies to expand the use of junk plans. These are plans  that cover very little. They might not cover prescription drugs or  mental health or addiction care, but they are cheaper, so healthy  people tend to move to these plans, leaving the sick people on the  plans that are now going up by 39 percent.   The final cherry on top is that right now as we speak, the  administration is making an argument before the Supreme Court that the  remaining scraps of the Affordable Care Act that the Republicans left  are unconstitutional.   The protection for people with preexisting conditions, which Trump  promised over and over and over again to keep--Lesley Stahl pinned him  down in a ``60 Minutes'' interview and asked: You are going to keep  protection for people with preexisting conditions, right? You are going  to keep the part of the Affordable Care Act that is wildly popular,  aren't you?   He said: Yes, I am going to keep that part.   In fact, he has now instructed his Department of Justice to break  precedent and argue the unconstitutionality of a statute of the United  States, that statute being the portion of the Affordable Care Act that  protects people with preexisting conditions.   Believe me, insurance companies are paying attention to this unending  withering assault on the Affordable Care Act and the American  healthcare system. That is why we are seeing these big premium  increases.   We want to make sure that our colleagues understand what is happening  here and that the American public understands what is happening here.  These increases in healthcare costs are unprecedented, but they are not  surprising, given what this administration and what this Congress have  been doing.   With that, I yield the floor, seeing that Senator Merkley is ready to  speak.
