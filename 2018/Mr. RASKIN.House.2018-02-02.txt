 Mr. Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry.    Mr. Speaker, does the chairman of the House Intelligence  Committee have the authority to transmit a classified document under  House rule X, clause 11(g) that was never approved for release by a  vote of the committee?    Even if it relates to current events?
