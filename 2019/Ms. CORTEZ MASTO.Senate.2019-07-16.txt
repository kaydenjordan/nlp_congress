 Madam President, today I honor the memory of  a distinguished Nevadan: retired Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Captain  Larry Burns. For decades, Captain Burns served his community with  distinction, earning the respect of Nevadans from all walks of life.   Captain Burns was raised in Maine and went on to attend Brigham Young  University in Utah. It was in college that he met his wife Elizabeth  Annie Burns. After college, he served a 2-year mission in Ecuador for  the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This began his life's  calling to serve others. In 1980, he moved to Las Vegas and worked in  construction before becoming a police officer.   Captain Burns' remarkable career included 27 years as a police  officer, where he put his life on the line for Las Vegas. He became the  longest serving SWAT commander in metro history, a criminal  intelligence section supervisor and a nationally recognized tactical  instructor. He also served as captain of the Bolden Area Command.  Captain Burns was revered by his colleagues for his extraordinary work  ethic, intellect, and devotion to community.   Throughout his career, Captain Burns worked hard to build meaningful  relationships with Las Vegans and develop positive ties between  community members and law enforcement officers. In his spare time, he  could often be found speaking to children at his church about life as a  police officer and the proud work of serving our community. He was also  committed to the idea that people can change and dedicated himself to  helping those working to turn their lives around. He always offered  everything he had to support the men and women of law enforcement in  making our community a safer place to live and selflessly upheld his  promise to protect Nevada's families like he protected his own. From  his work to rehabilitate the communities he helped protect to his  fierce commitment to the department, Captain Burns was a man with  unwavering integrity.   Captain Burns lived a life of many accomplishments, but I have no  doubt that he will be remembered most for his commitment to family and  lasting contributions to others. He adored his wife Annie and was most  proud of their life together and their seven wonderful children, two  grandchildren, and their extended family and friends. I know his family  will continue his rich legacy of service to others.   All who had the pleasure of knowing Captain Burns will remember him  as a dedicated public servant who bravely and tirelessly worked to  support our community. Nevada is a safer place because of his  commitment. We are very grateful for all of Captain Burns'  contributions, and he will be deeply missed.                            ____________________
