 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 6,  the American Dream and Promise Act of 2019.   This bill would provide Dreamers, TPS holders, and DED recipients  with the relief and certainty that they and our country need in order  to thrive.   I would like to congratulate the architects of this bill,  Representatives Roybal-Allard, Velazquez, and Clarke, who worked so  tirelessly, as well as our Judiciary Committee Chairman Nadler, and our  Immigration and Citizenship Subcommittee Chairwoman Lofgren for the  tireless work that they put into this.   This bill has the potential to help hundreds of thousands of  hardworking individuals who are American in every way except on paper.   I am so proud that Texas has the second highest Dreamer population in  the Nation, including the more than 9,000 Dreamers in the safe border  community of El Paso, Texas.  [[Page H4286]]    My colleagues on the other side of the aisle vacillate between  arguments intended to stall this legislation that range from get in  line, to build a wall, to painting all undocumented immigrants as  dangerous criminals that Americans should fear. One of my colleagues  even said that this bill would destroy America.   I would like to remind them that America is a nation of immigrants.  Dreamers, TPS holders, and DED recipients are our friends, neighbors,  and colleagues. Some have even bravely served in the military, and  others are pillars within communities across the Nation.   They have built good lives here, started families, created small  businesses, employed thousands of people, paid their taxes, made our  country better.                                time  1700    I stand with Dreamers and TPS holders and will do all I can to ensure  that they are shielded from deportation and have a pathway to  citizenship.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to be on the right side of history  and support this bill.
