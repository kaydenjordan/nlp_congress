 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  the order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, have you ever gone out to eat  at a restaurant with a group of people, but your order was cheaper than  everyone else's? Maybe you weren't as hungry or the restaurant the  group picked was more expensive than you could afford so you were  selective about what you ordered. Then, when the check comes, someone  suggested the group split it evenly.   Now, what is your immediate reaction? You are upset, of course,  because you ordered the salad not the filet mignon or you drank water,  not the expensive bottle of wine. You ordered what you wanted, and they  ordered what they wanted; you shouldn't be on the hook for their cost.   Sadly, this illustration is far too real, as last month, Joe Biden  announced that he would cancel billions of dollars in student loans.   Now, let's be clear. He isn't canceling student debt. No, he is  transferring that debt to every American taxpayer. Now a construction  worker in Florida is having to foot the bill for the loans of a Harvard  grad, which they voluntarily accepted for an education they received.   So here is what Democrats are trying to say to that construction  worker: You didn't go to college; Democrats don't care. You will pay  the debt of lawyers and doctors, and you will pay for those who want  Ph.D.s in poetry. Talk about poetic injustice. You went to community  college or a State school and worked to graduate debt-free. Tough luck.  Joe Biden wants you to pay for the advanced degrees of the privileged  few. Your tax dollars are now the money pot for other people's student  debt.   Of course, Joe Biden's plan doesn't even begin to address the real  reason for rising higher education costs. That is universities'  decades-long practice of unnecessarily raising tuition.   As Governor of Florida, I addressed that problem and challenged our  universities to keep education affordable.   Look at the University of Florida. Undergraduate tuition and fees for  this academic year are less than $6,500. It is the fifth best public  university in the country. You will get a fantastic education  there. Meanwhile, at Harvard, tuition fees for an academic year cost  more than $57,000.    There are ways to make education affordable, but the Democrats and  elites aren't interested in those solutions. That is why Joe Biden is  engaging in this reckless move even though it doesn't solve the real  issue and even though he lacks the proper constitutional authority.   Everybody knows this. That is why, in July of last year, Nancy Pelosi  herself denied that the President had such power.   She said:         The president can't do it . . . That's not even a       discussion.        Yet now the Department of Justice is engaging in       interpretive gymnastics to co-opt legislation that was passed       to help our servicemembers in the aftermath of 9/11. It is a       desperate attempt to stretch a good law well beyond its       intent so that Joe Biden can give handouts to his liberal       voters and Harvard pals.    Biden wants to spend money that Congress has not appropriated for a  loan forgiveness that Congress has not authorized. It is illegal. It is  unconstitutional. It is a gross abuse of authority, and I won't stand  for it. Congress must assert its authority here. We have the power of  the purse, not the President.   That is why I have introduced the Debt Cancellation Accountability  Act. My bill would require the Department of Education to get an  express appropriation from Congress before they could propose waiving,  discharging, or reducing student loan debt to two or more borrowers in  an amount greater than $1 million. If we want to transfer the debt of  some and make everyone pay for it, then Congress has to make that  decision.   We should simply put it up for a vote. Of course, the Democrats here  in the Senate won't do that. Surely, they could have passed a bill by  now if they had really wanted to, but they wanted Biden to do it alone.  It is easy to see why. In just the past few weeks, we have heard  families from across the country speaking out against Biden's unfair  and disastrous proposal. I am hearing about it from Floridians every  day, and I know my colleagues are too.   I would like to thank Senators Barrasso, Lummis, and Braun for  supporting my Debt Cancellation Accountability Act and for choosing to  stand with me against Biden's overreach.   Let's pass this bill today to reverse Joe Biden's unlawful decision  and force Congress to decide this issue.   Before I ask for unanimous consent, I would like to turn to my  colleague Senator Braun from the great State of Indiana.    I am so thankful for Senator Braun's support on  this bill and for all of the work he has done to raise awareness about  Biden's reckless spending agenda and to stand for fiscal sanity.   Mr. President, as in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions be  discharged from further consideration of S. 4483 and that the Senate  proceed to its immediate consideration; further, that the bill be  considered read a third time and passed and that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, so let's remember what we are  talking about here. We are not canceling debt; we are transferring  debt. We are transferring the debt because this obligation doesn't go  away. Somebody still owes this money.   What we are saying is, people who decided--they made the choice--to  go to college or go to some higher education, they are not going to  have to pay their debt. And people who didn't and already paid off  their debt, they are going to pay for it.   My colleague from Massachusetts never acknowledged the example. We  all remember when we went out to dinner and we didn't spend the most  money and how somebody suggested that, oh, let's just share it. So we  paid for the expensive wine, and we paid for the expensive meal. That  is not fair.   When you talk to Americans around the country, and they say: Would  you like to forgive all the debt? Absolutely. Free is great.   But when you say: You are going to pay for it, they say: Absolutely  not. Why would I pay off the debt for somebody else?   Let's remember just what my bill does. It doesn't say we can't  forgive student loans; it says that Congress ought to decide if we do  it. This is going to cost up to $1 trillion.   I don't think we ought to, so-called, transfer this debt, but my bill  will at least give us a chance to have a debate on it. But that is not  what my colleague wants to do.   I hope my colleague understands that her objection is absolutely a  slap in the face to all those workers in Massachusetts and around the  country who didn't go to college: construction workers, small business  owners, chefs, flight attendants, firefighters, landscapers, and so  many other groups of people who have made the decision not to pursue a  higher education for whatever reason.   There are many others who worked hard to get scholarships or those  who worked part time to afford college or plenty others who took the  time to pay off their loans. I am going to stand with those people,  working-class people--people who are responsible, hard-working  Americans who absolutely are willing to pay off their obligations.   I think about people like my dad. My dad had a sixth grade education.  He was a truckdriver. He worked his tail off. I can't imagine what he  would think about working hard every day, then being forced to pay for  some other person's degree as a doctor or a lawyer. He would be beside  himself. He would think it was so unfair.   It is not how the real world works. It is a Democrat fantasyland that  Joe Biden is trying to turn into reality.   People used to take pride in paying off their debts and working hard  to see their commitments come through. Democrats want to destroy that  and destroy ideas of fiscal responsibility. They want to forget that we  are $30 trillion in debt. They want to forget that we still have  record-high inflation as a result of wasteful spending.   My colleague wants to pretend that we are in this fantasyland because  objecting to my bill is an endorsement of Biden's reckless plan and his  unconstitutional debt transfer, from the overachiever, to the Harvard  grad, to the working class.   As Members of Congress, we should be interested in checks and  balances and the separation of powers. We should guard the powers of  the Constitution that is especially reserved for the legislative  branch. Spending a trillion dollars with no congressional oversight is  wrong. That is not exactly how our Constitution was set up. This  shameless decision to block my bill is just another example of how far  Senate Democrats will go to appease the radical left.  [[Page S4601]]    I yield the floor.    Mr. President, first off, my colleague never  addressed the issue that this is a transfer of obligation. I mean, you  can have a conversation about what we should have done with regard to  tax cuts in the past, but this is a transfer of obligation. This is a  transfer of obligation of people who decided to go to school.   We should do everything we can to help people, but we are not  addressing the problem here. I addressed it when I was Governor. When I  became Governor in January of 2011, tuition in Florida was going up 15  percent a year, plus inflation. I stopped it. We didn't see tuition  increase while I was Governor, and we became the No. 1 higher education  system in the country according to U.S. News & World Report.   We solved the problem of the cost of higher education to make sure  people could afford education. We did it because we invested, we kept  tuition low, and we paid our universities based on three things: do you  get a degree, how much money you make, and what does it cost to get a  degree. So, guess what, all of our universities became more efficient  and more accountable.   That is how you fix the problem. This does not fix the problem. This  does nothing to reduce tuition. This does nothing to hold our  universities accountable. This does nothing to stop our universities  from raising tuition. This does nothing to require our universities to  make sure our kids get a job. This does nothing to make sure our kids  get good-paying jobs.   So I am very disappointed in my colleague in that she would still not  address the issue that that is a complete transfer of obligation from  some people who decided to go get a higher education to people who  decided not to.   I yield the floor.    I yield the floor.    Are you finished?    Absolutely. I did everything I could to make  sure all of our students had the opportunity to go to school. We made  sure that they could afford to go to school.   What I have said in my bill today is this ought to be done by  Congress. And let's don't just do some blanket transfer of obligations  here. Congress should be doing this. This is going to cost us up to $1  trillion, and we are going to have people like my dad, if he was still  alive--a truckdriver with a sixth-grade education--pay for some Ivy  League kid to go to school, and that is wrong.    Mr. President, I am not suggesting you  shouldn't borrow money, but what I am suggesting is, if you do borrow  money, you made that decision, all right? You shouldn't transfer it to  somebody like my dad, who had a sixth-grade education, couldn't afford  to go to school, didn't go to school. There shouldn't be a transfer to  make sure they pay off your debt. That is a decision you make. You  should pay it off.    Now, if you have an issue because you can't pay it, let's deal with  that issue. That is not what this does. This says, whatever your  issues, Joe Biden says, by himself, without any act of Congress--he  gets to make a decision by himself: Poof, your debt goes away; somebody  else picks it up. That is not right.    Mr. President, well, first off, let me make  sure my colleague from Vermont knows my background. I actually grew up  in public housing, born to a single mom. I do care about people, making  sure you can get an education. That is why I did exactly what I did in  Florida. I made sure people had the opportunity to get ahead.   The 4 years before I became Governor of Florida, the State lost  832,000 jobs. By cutting taxes and reducing the regulations and  streamlining things, we added 1.7 million jobs so people all over my  State could get a job. That is how people get ahead. You don't get  ahead by just somebody transferring obligations from one person to  somebody else. That improves a few people's lives, but that is  completely unfair. That is not how this country was set up, that some  people are going to pay for somebody else's obligation that they  decided to pick up, and that is all I am talking about.    Mr. President, I think who paid for Jeff  Bezos's yacht is all the people who bought packages from Amazon. And by  the way, if you do get one that says ``Made in China,'' I hope  everybody will send it back.   I yield the floor.
