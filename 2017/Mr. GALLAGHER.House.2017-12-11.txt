 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3359, of  which I am a proud cosponsor.   This bill provides an updated framework to reorganize and grant  additional authorities to the Department of Homeland Security's  cybersecurity and infrastructure protection missions.   Currently, the National Protection and Programs Directorate has  responsibility for overseeing the Department's cyber roles; and while  DHS has come a long way since inception in 2002, the rapid adaptation  of threats in cyberspace demands that we continue to look for ways to  evolve and demands that we who oversee this are more nimble and that we  can adapt accordingly and keep outpacing our adversaries.   As we have seen, Russia, China, Iran, and various nonstate actors  have all demonstrated a willingness to penetrate American networks. We  have had high-ranking military officials in our military claim that we  are already outgunned in cyberspace right now, and it is up to us to  sound the alarm and make sure that we are staying ahead of our  adversaries.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be part of that effort. I salute the  chairman; and, given the Department of Homeland Security's central role  in protecting the Federal Government's civilian networks, it is  imperative that Congress, through its oversight role, ensures that the  men and women at DHS have all the legal authorities they need to carry  out this mission.   Mr. Speaker, this bill has been a priority of the Homeland Security  Committee for several years, and I want to acknowledge the chairman for  his continued leadership on this issue.
