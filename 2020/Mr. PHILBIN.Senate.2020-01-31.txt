 They want to tell you what President Trump       thought.    Mr. Manager CROW. Now, juries, of course, are routinely asked to  determine the defendant's state of mind. That is central to almost  every criminal case in the country. And it is disingenuous for the  President's counsel to argue that the defendant's state of mind in  unknowable, that it requires a mind reader, or is anything but the most  common element of proof of any crime, constitutional or otherwise. But  if you want more information, let's ask the President whether John  Bolton can help fill in any gaps about his state of mind.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         President TRUMP. If you think about it, he knows some of my       thoughts. He knows what I think about leaders.    Mr. Manager CROW. This case is about the President's conduct in  Ukraine. John Bolton knows a lot about that. Let's hear from him. A  fair trial demands it. It is more than just ensuring a fair trial, it  is about remembering that in America, truth matters. As Mr. Bolton said  on January 30, ``the idea that somehow testifying to what you think is  true is destructive to the system of government we have, I think is  very nearly the reverse, the exact reverse of the truth.''   As Manager Schiff started this out, the truth continues to come out.  Again, in an article today, more information. The truth will come out,  and it is continuing to. The question here before this body is, What do  you want your place in history to be? Do you want your place in history  to be let's hear the truth or that we don't want to hear it?   Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Given our time constraints, we will now  summarize the reasons why Mr. Mulvaney, Mr. Duffey, and Mr. Blair are  also important.  [[Page S758]]    Let's turn first to Mr. Mulvaney. To begin with, Mr. Mulvaney  participated in meetings and discussions with President Trump at every  single stage of this scheme. We just talked about motives and intent.  Well, if you want further insight into the President's motives or  intent, further direct evidence of why he withheld the military aid and  the White House meeting, you should call his Acting Chief of Staff, who  has more access than anyone.   Mr. Mulvaney is important because the President's counsel continues  to argue--incorrectly--that our evidence is just hearsay and  speculation. Faced with Ambassador Sondland and Mr. Holmes saying this  was all as clear as two plus two equals four, the President says,  ``[T]hey are just guessing.'' That is simply not true. The evidence is  direct, the evidence is compelling and confirmed by many witnesses,  corroborated by text messages, emails, and phone records. But if you  want more evidence, if you want another firsthand account of why the  aid was withheld for the undisputed quid pro quo for that White House  meeting, let's just hear from Mick Mulvaney.   Over and over again, Ambassador Sondland described to multiple  witnesses how Mr. Mulvaney was directly involved in the President's  scheme. Here is some of that testimony.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Dr. HILL. So when I came in, Gordon Sondland was basically       saying, Look, we have a deal here. There will be a meeting. I       have a deal here with Chief of Staff Mulvaney, there will be       a meeting if the Ukrainians open up or announce these       investigations into 2016 and Burisma. And I cut it off       immediately there.        Ambassador Bolton told me that: I am not part of this       whatever drug deal that Mulvaney and Sondland are cooking up.
