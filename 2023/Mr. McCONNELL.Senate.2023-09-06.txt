 Mr. President, I would like to begin today by quoting  a concise assessment of threats facing the United States and our  interests.         A central continuity in history is the contest for power. .       . . Three main sets of challengers--the revisionist powers of       China and Russia, the rogue states of Iran and North Korea,       and transnational threat organizations, particularly jihadist       terrorist groups--are actively competing against the United       States and our allies and partners. . . . China and Russia       want to shape a world antithetical to U.S. values and       interests. China seeks to displace the United States in the       Indo-Pacific region, expand the reaches of its state-driven       economic model, and reorder the region in its favor. Russia       seeks to restore its great power status and establish spheres       of influence near its borders.    That was the previous administration's national security strategy  back in 2017. If anything, the threats it warned about at the end of  its first year in office are even greater today.   Russia and China have both become more repressive at home and more  aggressive abroad. Just before Russia's escalation of its war against  Ukraine, our two most significant revisionist adversaries announced a  ``friendship without limits.'' In the past year and a half, Putin has  aligned Russia even more openly with rogue regimes hostile to the  United States, like Iran and North Korea. We must not ignore this  contest for power.   Here is another passage from the 2017 strategy:         To prevail, we must integrate all elements of America's       national power--political, economic, and military. Our allies       and partners must also contribute [to] the capabilities, and       demonstrate the will, to confront shared threats. Experience       suggests that the willingness of rivals to abandon or forgo       aggression depends on their perception of U.S. strength and       the vitality of our alliances.    In my view, the lessons are clear.   Under the previous administration, we began to rebuild America's  strength with defense budget increases. Under the current  administration, that strength has been undermined by a disastrous  withdrawal from Afghanistan, desperate diplomacy towards Tehran, and a  head-in-the-sand approach to North Korea.   Our enemies have been encouraged by meager defense budgets across  NATO, including repeated budget requests by this administration that  failed to even keep up with inflation.   Since Putin's escalation in Ukraine, President Biden has not been as  decisive as many of us would have preferred, but this is no excuse for  Congress to compound his administration's failures with failures of our  own.   Now, with NATO unified and Europe awakened from its defense holiday  and starting to spend real money on our collective defense, is  certainly not the time to go wobbly. Now, with Ukraine bravely  defending its sovereignty and  [[Page S4213]]  eroding Russia's capacity to threaten NATO, is not the time to ease up.  Now, with Russia and China's ``friendship without limits'' and Putin's  embrace of Iran and North Korea, is not the time for America to step  back.   I will have more to say on the conflict in Ukraine, how the President  hasn't been decisive enough, how our assistance is being used to good  effect, and how additional appropriations are critical for our defense  industrial base and competition with China, but for now, let's just be  absolutely clear about a few things.   Helping Ukraine retake its territory means weakening--means  weakening--one of America's biggest strategic adversaries without  firing a shot and deterring another one in the process. It means  investing directly in American strength, both military and economic.  Our colleagues will have the opportunity to do all of these when we  pass supplemental appropriations before the month is out.
