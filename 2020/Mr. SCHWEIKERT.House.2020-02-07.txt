 Mr. Speaker, my family accuses me of being incapable  of speaking without moving my hands or without displays, so we are  going to see if we can do a little bit of both that we are good at.   Mr. Speaker, about every week, I try to take a block of time and come  here to walk through both what I see happening math-wise and what I see  happening demographic-wise. I know as soon as I use those words, most  anyone who is watching this is now falling asleep. But the math is  important.   I put this board up because I am a believer that there is a way to  save the country from being buried in debt. There is a way that the  next 30, 40 years can be incredibly prosperous, but we need to invest  in this magic device, which is called a calculator, because much of  what we do here is rhetorical.   We do policy by feelings, and we engage in just absolute absurdity in  our unwillingness to talk about the reality of what is going on.   So, first, a bit of premise, and then we will do a little bit of what  happened in today's job report to demonstrate there is a path, but that  path doesn't exist until we start to be honest with each other.   So just a top-line understanding, the next 5 years, just the growth  in Social Security and Medicare--it is mostly Medicare--and healthcare  entitlements, just the growth equals the entire Defense Department.   Mr. Speaker, you have to understand what is happening. It is not  Republican or Democrat. It is demographics. There are 74 million of us  who are baby boomers, and we are moving into our retirement years. We  have earned benefits, and there is no money in the bank. It is all  going to be borrowed.   So think of that: Over the next 10 years, just the growth of Social  Security, Medicare, and healthcare entitlements is the entire  discretionary budget. Everything else is on autopilot.   Yet how many of our brothers and sisters who are elected, and who  have this incredible opportunity and responsibility to come tell the  truth, are comfortable coming behind this microphone and saying: Hey,  it turns out that we are getting old very fast as a society. We have  stunning numbers of promises that we have an obligation to keep. And we  are unwilling to have the honesty of the discussion of what we are  about to do to our kids in crushing them.   I have a 4-year-old daughter. Doesn't she deserve to have the same  opportunities we all have had?   It turns out there is a path, but we need to stop delusional  thinking. Forgive me when my brothers and sisters on the Republican  side say, ``Well, if we just got rid of waste and fraud,'' it is a  rounding error. It is important, and we need to do it.   ``We just have to tax rich people more.'' It is delusional. It is  fractions of a percent, and you could take all their wealth, Mr.  Speaker.   We don't seem to have our heads around the scale of this math and the  number of zeros that go with it.   Let's sort of walk through this. In the last couple of years, we have  been trying to pitch a concept. You can't just do one thing, Mr.  Speaker. You can't just change entitlements and think you are going to  accomplish anything. You can't just tax people more and think you are  going to get anywhere. You have to do everything.   It is sort of the wholistic--I prefer the term ``unified''--theory  that we have to get the economics working. We have to maximize economic  growth, and we have to maximize labor force participation. We need to  adopt revolutionary and disruptive technology to crash the price of  healthcare because, as I was just sharing with you, Mr. Speaker,  healthcare is what drives the deficit.   I was here last week, and I was showing slides that 90 percent of the  future debt is substantially Social Security but mostly Medicare, yet  the only calls I get when I show that slide is I get people angry: Stop  telling us that. That doesn't fit the folklore I bathe in.   But the fact of the matter is, there are technology disruptions  coming right now that could crash the price of healthcare and be  amazing in changing our debt curve. The problem is a bunch of that  technology is actually illegal because it uses algorithms, sensors, and  things that our current legal framework and reimbursement framework  isn't ready for. We need to modernize.                                time  1400    Employment, we are going to talk about some of the remarkable things  that came out in today's unemployment numbers that should be incredibly  hopeful to both those on the left and the right of what is happening,  where our brothers and sisters--what we refer to as marginally  detached--are coming back into the labor force. This is a good thing.  It makes remarkable differences.   You are going to start to see: Do we add incentives in the earned and  even unearned benefits? Remember, in our society, the vast majority of  our spending, 70-plus percent, is on autopilot. It is what we call  entitlements.   You earned your Social Security. You earned your Medicare. You earned  your VA. You earned these things. There are other benefits you get  because you fell below a certain income. You are part of a certain  Tribal population--those things. These are treaty obligations. They are  societal obligations we have made decisions on.   Are there things we can do to add a spiff? Saying: Yes, you may be 70  years old, you have your earned entitlement, but could we give you a  little spiff? Are you healthy? Do you want to continue to work? Do you  want to stay in the labor force?   Because it turns out to be really good for society. It turns out to  be really important.   We still have a problem with millennial men, which is a different  speech, and one day, we will figure out why they are  underparticipating.   Population stability, a really uncomfortable part of the conversation  to have, but the math is the math. Our birthrates have collapsed. We  are looking at data right now that says half of millennials, more than  50 percent of millennials, will never marry. It doesn't mean they won't  be in long-term committed relationships, but are there incentives we  can produce as a government, as a society, that those stable  relationships bring another generation? Because it is an honest math  problem. We are collapsing population-wise.   Immigration, how do you design an immigration system that is open,  welcoming, but is talent-based? Because the reality of it is, we are  about to hit such a demographic headwind if we do not have brothers and  sisters becoming Americans who have certain skill sets.   In many ways, it is a more elegant system. I don't care about your  race, your religion, who you cuddle with, all of these things. I do  care that you add velocity to our society, to our economy.   Then, there are other things: tax policies, regulatory policy, smart  technology, things we can do to maximize economic growth.   Look, our pitch is: If we can make these things work--and you can't  do one or two of them; you have to do all of them--we have a model that  says, at the peak of the baby boom, so about 15 years from now, or less  than that, we kiss up to 95 percent of debt-to-GDP, but we can hold it.  Then, it fades back to something normal.   If we don't do this, there are charts out there that show a couple  hundred percent of debt-to-GDP. We blow up the  [[Page H973]]  society. We basically become anemic, slow-growth. We raise taxes like  crazy on young people to make them pay our benefits. We become a  country that has crushed any excitement and hope.   Let's talk about the good things, because there is starting to be  some proof that when you get tax policy correct, regulatory policy  correct, some of these incentives, good things happen. I know in  today's rage-based politics, we sit there and attack everything, but  there are good things happening.   How do we figure out what makes them happen and do more of it? And  the things that aren't working, let's do less of them. It is not that  complicated.   Look, today, we got the jobs report. The jobs report we get about  January is really important because they also give us a sense--it is  not the final number but the sense of what was happening in 2019 and  those last 4 months.   Every smart economist we work with--I am the senior Republican on the  House side on something called the Joint Economic Committee. It is  basically for all the kids in your high school who were president of  your math club. If you love the data--and I happen to be blessed to  have a couple of economists who work for me in that capacity--we were  all expecting revisions and some ugly numbers.   Turns out, a few hours ago, we found out that there were 55,000 added  in November and December, the ending parts of last year. The economy  turns out to have been healthier. The employment opportunities were  healthier.   You all saw the number for January, 225,000 jobs, far beyond even the  most optimistic predictions. There should have been joy in this room.  Those are people who are working, who are coming back in the labor  force, who are changing their lives. But this place is incapable of joy  anymore.   These are really, really good things. But there is something even  more remarkable underlying in that data, and it is important. I know it  is not exciting, but it is really important if you care about people.   First, we work on the premise that growth is moral. You are going to  see some numbers here where our brothers and sisters who had basically  quit, they had stopped trying to find employment. They had dropped out.  We called them the marginally detached. Those people who might have a  small part-time job, but they are unhappy. They are basically the  working poor.   All of a sudden, we are seeing, in the last 24 months, remarkable  movement in their wages and even more remarkable movement in their job  opportunities. There is something working out there.   Remember, the first slide we were talking about how we have a healthy  enough economy, a healthy enough economics in our society so we can  keep our promises. This is one of the charts that is really important.   If you all remember your high school economics class, what are the  two components that make wages go up, the two things we focus on? Well,  one is productivity, and the other is inflation.   When your wages go up, well, inflation is up, so we are going to pay  you more, even though you have no improvement in your purchasing power.  And inflation-driven wage growth, you are typically falling behind.    The other side--and that is what this chart talks about--is  productivity. The company invested in a new piece of equipment, new  software, new methodologies, or new supply chains, but it requires  capital investments. But we have gotten more productive, meaning we can  pay our workers more.   We were panic-stricken, functionally, at the end of 2016.  Productivity had collapsed. Lots of the smart people were saying: Well,  you have had the tax reform. People did their investing, this and that.  It is going away.   Turns out, they were absolutely wrong. Look at the last bar. That is  2019. We have had a spike. Now, I still don't think it is enough, but  we are up to what we call 1.7 productivity growth. For an economy our  size, that is remarkable. We can do better, but it is going the right  way.   If we are going to pay our brothers and sisters more, if the working  poor are going to have an opportunity, this is crucial. Can we fixate  on the things that are working in our economy? Because there is  something working now, so how do we do more of it?   This next chart is impossible to read, but it is really important.  You have three layers in here. These are for wages, so those folks who  are at the low end of the scale, middle end of the scale, and those  folks who are making lots of money.   The remarkable thing that has happened since tax reform--I know this  is really hard to see. It turns out, it is the working poor, that  lowest quartile, that is having the most growth in their wages, that  bottom 10 percent of our brothers and sisters that we were writing off  as a society.   I have been on the Joint Economic Committee now for years, and just 3  or 4 years ago, we brought in these fancy, very well-credentialed,  really smart economists who basically said that Americans who didn't  finish high school, Americans with moderate skills, they are part of  the permanent underclass. Start thinking of ways to provide them  subsidies, welfare, housing, because they are going to stay there.   The velocity, the concept that you can start out poor today, learn a  skill, work hard, and move up, they basically said was over. They are  wrong. And this isn't Republican or Democrat. This is hope. This is  what America is supposed to be about, that those folks come back.   You may not have had the opportunity to have great skill training.  Maybe something horrible happened in your life, you dropped out of high  school. Three years ago, we were writing you off. Today, you have  double, more than double, the wage growth of everyone else and the mean  in this society.   I know this is geeky, but it is really important. These numbers are  millions and millions and millions of our brothers and sisters out  there who had a really crappy decade. All of a sudden, something is  happening out there where their wages are growing. The job stability,  the value of their labor, it may be the most elegant way to say it--and  some of this is complex. And this is an uncomfortable part of the  conversation. Forgive me if I am not as eloquent on this as I would  like to be.   For low-skilled populations, it is a combination of a robust enough  economy to have a need for those skills or lack of skills. But there is  a need for that labor. The other side is, you are not flooding your  society with a type of immigration that puts so much low-skilled  population in the society that you crush the working poor.   So think of a little bit of a seesaw. You have to do both to get the  value of that working poor population, to make their labor valuable. It  is happening. That should be joyful. Now, we should figure out how to  do more of it, how to keep this going, because it is working.   Now, here is the one where I may take us a little bit to a level of  complexity in the thinking, but it is really important. When we did tax  reform a couple of years ago, the Joint Committee on Taxation folks-- they are all freaky smart. There is like 50 of them. A number have  Ph.D.'s in econometrics and all these things.   They came to us and said: David, there are two fragilities in tax  reform for the economy to grow. It is capital stock, available cash to  be lent for businesses, for organizations, for things to grow, to buy  that new piece of equipment for that labor productivity. The other  thing was labor itself.   We are getting old very fast as a society. There are some charts out  there that say, within the decade, we functionally have two workers for  one person in retirement. It is not Republican or Democrat. It is those  of us who are baby boomers. It is what it is.    Something has started to happen in the last 2 years, and we saw a pop  of it in this January data. Think about this. This over here is sort of  that 2008, 2009, and we were at 67 percent labor force participation.  Now, labor force participation basically means everyone in society less  those people who are under 16. So those who are eligible to work, up  and to, I believe, being much older.   Now, this number was always supposed to crash because we are getting  older as a society. But it was supposed to continue to just dive down  because we are only halfway through the retirement of the baby boomers.   All a sudden, in the last couple years, we have broken the trendline.  All of a sudden, today, we saw we are up to 63.4 percent labor force  participation. Most people glaze over and go: What the hell does that  mean?  [[Page H974]]    Well, it means it is a number that those smart economists a couple  years ago were telling us we would never get to, but somehow it has  happened. We are functionally living in a time when we are going to be  rewriting textbooks.   But what is also remarkable--and you are going to see this in one of  the other charts here--is those who are coming back, they are starting  to look for unemployment.   So how do you have this weird number today? There are 225,000 people  who moved into the labor force, or took jobs in January, but  unemployment actually ticked up one-tenth of a point. But the labor  force participation, the number in the labor force, also goes up two- tenths of a point. That is actually wonderful.   What it means is that people who had given up, who weren't looking,  hadn't looked in the last 4 weeks, in the last year, they had  functionally given up, almost a couple hundred thousand, maybe 170,000  or so, came back and started looking, coming back into our society's  labor force.   This is really important because there is just that societal concept  of you are less likely to be using bad things if you are working. You  are more likely to be able to start having a functioning family, maybe  even family formation, if you are working. Your future, your optimism,  your health are better if you are working.   All of a sudden, we are starting to see populations that those fancy  economists were writing off just a couple years ago. They are coming  back.                                time  1415    This is moral, but it is also really good. Why does it become  partisan, saying: Well, it is not as good as it should be? It is a  remarkable break of every trend line we had.   You would think we would have this honorable conversation, saying:  Let's understand what is working and do more of it because, if we can  do this for a few more years, another decade, that economic trend line  starts to change remarkably.   And I will try to make that make sense.   So last August, CBO did debt projections. We just got another one  last week. Did anyone come behind these microphones--well, I did--and  say: Hey, did anyone notice that the 10-year window of debt actually  went down $705 billion?   It turns out, if you dive into that, some of that was payrolls. There  are a lot more people working. They are paying a lot more payroll tax.  That is wonderful.   There is another thing that is actually a little more complex to get  your head around: interest rates. We expect the cost of financing the  deficits of the U.S. Government to also came down about $400 billion.   But there is an argument that the tax reform--remember how we said  what were the two fragilities, labor and capital stock? It turns out  that thing called capital stock is remarkably better than anyone had  modeled.   We did something in the tax reform to stop businesses from moving  their domiciles overseas, taking their profits and booking them  overseas, keeping that capital overseas. We changed that.   We have had a remarkable amount of that, billions and billions, I  mean, a few hundred billion dollars come crashing back to the United  States, where they have to pay some taxes here on it, but that cash is  now in our society.   It turns out also savings rates have turned out to be much better  than we modeled.   So just that and the fact that more people are working is about a  $705 billion reduction in the deficit. In that one period between  August and last week when we got the CBO report--and remember, the cost  of tax reform we thought would be about $1.4 trillion. We just covered  about half of it. So it is just an interesting thought on what is going  on.   This is the remarkable chart. This is the one we need to get our  heads around. So think about this.   It is January 2009, January 2010. How many of you remember people  getting behind microphones and talking about the real unemployment  rate? Do you remember the real unemployment rate? It is not these  people who are out looking. It is all the people. It is the worn-out  workers. Those people have quit. We had numbers where it was  approaching 17.6, 17.5 percent of our Nation was part of the real  unemployment.   Take a look at what has happened. This is remarkable. We are now  starting to see numbers that were 6.7 percent of the--this is people  who are looking, not looking, who have worn out, who have given up. It  has been cut substantially, more than half.   And we are at this point where we have been having this amazing  academic debate, conversation: What is real unemployment? Not only  that, what is full employment? How much--and I was told never to use  this word behind the microphone--but this concept of elasticity. How  many of our brothers and sisters are actually available to come back  into the labor force?   It turns out there is a miracle happening out there. Every month, we  will tell you: Oh, 150,000 or, in this case, 225,000 took jobs, because  it is not part of the way they calculate. We are not telling you: Hey,  there may have been another couple hundred thousand who moved back into  the labor force who weren't even looking, so we don't count them.   They deserve to be counted, and they are counted in this data here.  They are what they call the U-6 unemployment.   If we could keep this going for a few more years, we are already  breaking the rules in almost every textbook, but this becomes  remarkably important.   For my brothers and sisters on the left, my brothers and sisters on  the right, we get elected to do our best to make people's lives better  and protect the Constitution, defend the Constitution. If you don't see  this as making Americans' lives better, you don't understand, you don't  own a calculator, or you don't have a heart.   I get behind here and I talk about the math, but this math is people.  It is families. It is folks who are being crushed in the last decade  who now actually have hope.   Why isn't there some joy? Why do we have to live in a time where rage  is the commodity of politics and not joy for the success we are having  for so many people who are part of the working poor that now have hope,  now have futures? It is working.   And the other thing that is also somewhat joyful, you see the red  bar, that is real GDP.   You have got to understand, if we were going back to around `16, even  when we calculated the year `17, how much of our GDP was also being  dragged along, helped, assisted by the rest of the world? Now, when you  look at what is going on, we have had a remarkable level of stability,  but we are dragging the rest of the world with us because the rest of  the world is basically an anemic mess right now.   And, yes, next month I expect some ugly things in some of the numbers  because of the virus and what it has done to trade. There may be an  upside in an odd way where many manufacturers, businesses, will  consider moving their supply chains, making them less fragile, less  concentrated, which will be great for us as a country because we have  just now had USMCA, the NAFTA replacement, pass, so now, all of a  sudden will you think about moving part of your manufacturing back to  North America.   But this is actually a really interesting chart to understand. Even  in a time where the rest of the world's economic growth has been  collapsing, we are still doing remarkably well.    And I was going to come up here and show you the formulas of, hey, a  point of GDP in the EU means this much to us. But just understand, we  had some help 3 or 4 years ago. Now we are the ones helping the rest of  the world.   Now, back to that being remarkable, and this is sort of the closing  on the concept that growth is moral. But there also should be joy.   Those who come behind these microphones and say, ``We care about  people,'' ``We care about the workers,'' ``We care about the working  poor,'' ``We want society to continue to expand and be healthy,'' take  a look at the chart on my side. If you see blue, it is the previous 8  years. If you see the red, it is a function of the last 3 years.   Do you know which bar is the highest and has the biggest separation?  Who has had the biggest growth in earnings on this chart? Turns out it  is the bottom workers in our country.   If you care about our brothers and sisters who have been struggling  for so  [[Page H975]]  many years, this should be joyful, because something amazing is  happening out there.   Now everyone is doing better--well, except high-wage managers. They  are basically static. If you come over here and actually look at the  top income, they are doing fine, but the bottom is the remarkable  change.   This is really important, because for so many years, I would listen  to my friends on the left come behind these microphones and talk about  income inequality. It is a real thing. But what happens when you have  made more progress, particularly in the last 12 months, of closing that  gap of income inequality not because you have crushed those with high  skills, those with high wages, but because you have brought up so much  of our society, you have grown their wages remarkably?   This needs to be our goal. Our goal as a society must be to lift  everyone up, not figure out that one quartile you have identified as  the enemy and go out and decide you are going to crush them. That is  what our modern politics has become.   Back to the first slide again.   Over the next 30 years, if you look at the math of what is coming at  us, if you actually strip Social Security and Medicare out of the next  30 years and say, ``What do we look like 30 years from now?''--so my  little girl, when she is 34 years old, what does the Federal budget  look like as we see it today? It is about $23 trillion. If we don't add  Social Security and Medicare into the number, it is about $23 trillion  cash in the bank. Now, that is not inflation adjusted, but $23 trillion  cash in the bank.   If we put Social Security and Medicare back into that 30-year window,  my little girl and every other young person, every other person who  thinks they are still going to be around in 30 years, we are $103  trillion in debt.   It doesn't have to be that way, but we have got to crush the price of  healthcare with technology. We have got to have people in the economy  who are helping it grow. We need the productivity. We can have a  remarkable future.   But the intellectual capacity of the debates we are having around  here, we have functionally gone a year and done nothing, nothing that  actually helps America, but we have done some great messaging bills and  great politics and great grandstanding and pretty good speeches.   We can do better, and there is a path.   Mr. Speaker, thank you for your patience. I yield back the balance of  my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 2 o'clock and 26 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until Monday,  February 10, 2020, at noon for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
