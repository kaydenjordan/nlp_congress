 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, yesterday the U.S. Senate spoke up  forcefully and clearly for the brave people of Hong Kong. We  unanimously passed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act.   As the author of the original United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of  1992, and somebody who has advocated for Hongkongers for decades, I was  proud to speak out on this back in the summer when the protests began.  I was also proud to secure important policy steps for Hong Kong in the  Senate Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs  back in September.   I am also proud that Senators approved these further steps to update  the original law to preserve Hong Kong's autonomy and democracy and  provide more tools for holding Beijing accountable.   I want to thank the senior Senator from Florida, all the other  Members who led on this issue, and all of our colleagues for securing  unanimous passage.   While this bill moves forward, it is also important for the executive  branch and our allies and partners around the world to fulfill their  roles as well. Even before this new bill becomes law, Congress has  already given the administration significant powers to act, including  authorities to directly sanction individuals who violate human rights.  I urge every trading nation around the world to look clearly at Hong  Kong and at Xinjiang and imagine the costs as China continues to  entrench its surveillance state and export it all around the world.   The Senate continues to do our part. Everyone else must do theirs as  well. The United States and the world must stand with Hong Kong.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, earlier this week, I  got to attend the Kentucky Electric Cooperative's annual meeting. The  group represents 26 co-ops across Kentucky, particularly in rural  communities.   We talked about the positive trends for what you might call Middle  America over the past several years--the nascent economic turnaround in  small towns, small cities, farm country, rural America, and other  places the Obama economy largely left behind.   We also talked about the work still ahead. One of the major  priorities that Kentuckians mentioned is the USMCA. I have heard it  from our farmers, manufacturers, logistics providers, and bourbon  distillers. Almost every sector of our economy would benefit from this  trade deal.   Together, Canada and Mexico make up a $500 billion export market for  the United States. This major update to  [[Page S6682]]  our trading framework with our neighbors would send that number even  higher, generate more wealth here at home, and create an estimated  176,000 new American jobs.   It is no wonder that so many Kentuckians and so many people around  the country want Washington to get it done. I hear from everybody, from  family farming operations to midsize manufacturers, to Fortune 500  firms, such as UPS and Toyota, that employ thousands and thousands in  my State. All of them want this fairer, better playing field in trade  with Canada and Mexico.   In a little more than a week from now, it will have been a full year  since President Trump signed the draft agreement along with the leaders  of Canada and Mexico--1 full year--but for months now, this  generational agreement has been sitting on ice over in the House of  Representatives. Speaker Pelosi has refused to allow a vote.   In public, House Democrats insist and insist that they care about  more things than simply impeaching the President. They insist that they  want to work together and legislate, but actions speak louder than  words, and apparently, thus far, House Democrats have preferred to  block 176,000 new jobs for American workers rather than put impeachment  aside and get along with the White House for 5 minutes. It appears  there is no governing priority--no matter how bipartisan, no matter how  beneficial to American families--that will not take a backseat to  impeachment.   Month after month, every time she has been asked about this subject,  the Speaker of the House has offered the same empty rhetoric. She is  always close to allowing the vote. Her conference is always ``almost  there, almost there,'' but we have been almost there for months and  months with no outcome in sight. Lots of talk but zero results.   Back in February, the Speaker was asked about the USMCA. She said,  ``I'm optimistic.'' That was last February.   We heard the same thing in May and in June. ``We want to pass this  bill.'' We heard the same thing through the summer and in September and  in October. ``Every day we're becoming closer,'' she said. A few weeks  ago the Speaker said: ``I think we are close . . . the last mile,'' and  she called this ``the easiest trade deal that we've ever done.'' A few  days ago, the Speaker insisted, yet again, a vote was ``imminent.''  That was a few days ago.    This has been the House Democrats' wild goose chase. This is what our  American families, American job creators, and our partners in Mexico  and Canada have had to put up with. Every time the Trump administration  meets the Speaker halfway, she tries to move the goal post another 10  yards. She literally has not even updated her own talking points since  Valentine's Day--textbook obstruction.   Just in case anybody did not yet understand that the real roadblock  here is partisan politics, I understand the Speaker hosted Richard  Trumka yesterday, head of the AFL-CIO, a power player in leftwing Big  Labor. He came to the Capitol to quell the uprising of the Democrats'  own Members who can't believe this thing still hasn't passed. How  ironic. We are talking about a trade deal that would create more  American jobs, and Democrats are considering outsourcing their judgment  to Big Labor special interests, who, to my recollection, have not  supported a single major trade deal in living memory.   Let's get this straight. It sounds like the head of the AFL-CIO--an  organization that has never supported any trade agreement--is now the  guy who gives the go-ahead on USMCA? We are talking about a trade deal,  and Democrats are considering outsourcing their own jobs to the head of  AFL-CIO--really? I wish I were making this up.   Reporters got ahold of the chairman of the House Ways and Means  Committee yesterday, and he literally said the deal would move forward  ``if we can get Richard Trumka to agree.'' So the head of the AFL-CIO-- an organization that has never supported a trade agreement--is now the  guy who has to green-light the USMCA, which would create 176,000  American jobs. No wonder they have a problem in the House. The chairman  of the Ways and Means Committee literally said that this major trade  agreement will move forward only if this major Democratic campaign  contributor gives them permission.   Well, it appears that even some House Democrats are getting fed up  with the absurdity. Here is what one of them said yesterday:         [Trumka] still says we're at the five yard line. . . . So       it feels like we've been at the five yard line for a while.    No kidding. This is the biggest opportunity the House Democrats have  had in the entirety of their first year in power to do something  significant and substantive for American families--to actually pass  something new and real that can become law and strengthen our Nation.  In other words, the USMCA is House Democrats' final exam for their  whole first year in power. And unless something turns around very  quickly, after nearly a year of happy talk and empty promises, their  leadership seems determined to flunk that exam. All impeachment, all  the time--and even the most obvious win for American workers and small  businesses gets blocked. That will be Democrats' progress report if  USMCA goes nowhere. Obviously, I hope that is not how this story ends.   Mexico has passed it. Canada is waiting on us. I believe a bipartisan  majority of the Senate is ready to pass it. Our workers, our job  creators, and our neighbors are just waiting on Speaker Pelosi. This is  no time to kill a national victory out of political spite. This is no  time to outsource your judgment to special interests. The Speaker  should allow a vote, and the House should send us the USMCA.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
