 Mr. Chairman, I rise both in appreciation and support  of my amendment included in the en bloc, which will require a study to  identify potential vulnerabilities in U.S. military systems and  infrastructure that could be exploited by adversarial AI applications  used by China, Russia, and other adversaries.   Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman for his leadership in this House and  for supporting a number of amendments that were included and adopted  yesterday.   These amendments will support military families and their children  with intellectual and developmental disabilities, ensure the DOD  guarantees full access and coverage to life-saving opioid overdose  reversal drugs, and requires our Nation's biodefense strategy, along  with helping the Army meet its goals to modernize aircraft and more.   Mr. Chair, I extend my appreciation.
