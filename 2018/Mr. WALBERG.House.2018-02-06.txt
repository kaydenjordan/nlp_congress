 Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues in supporting the  Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act.   Under the Obama administration, the FDA put forward an unworkable,  one-size-fits-all mandate on restaurants and retail food establishments  for providing calorie and nutrition information to customers. As  written, many businesses cannot comply with these rules and would be  subject to onerous, arbitrary penalties.   H.R. 772 is a bipartisan solution that makes compliance possible by  providing small businesses with greater flexibility to provide  nutrition information in a way that best serves their customers. It  ensures customers receive the nutrition information they want, but does  so in a way that takes into account the diversity of restaurants and  food products.   This commonsense bill takes a flexible approach that will actually  increase access to information for customers and allow good,  hardworking Michigan restaurants, grocers, and convenience stores to  continue meeting the needs of consumers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge its passage.
