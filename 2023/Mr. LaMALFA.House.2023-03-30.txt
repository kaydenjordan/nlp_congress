 Madam Speaker, yesterday the House included two of my  [[Page H1681]]  amendments into H.R. 1. Both amendments are important fire prevention  measures that make northern California and rural America safer.   While we can't prevent the outbreak of every fire, we can certainly  take steps to reduce the likelihood and severity of wildfire outbreaks.   The first of the amendments was called the CARR Act, which would  allow the Forest Service, National Park Service, and Bureau of Land  Management to thin forests and manage vegetation within 300 feet of  roadways along these Federal lands.   This amendment is in response to the 2018 Carr fire, which happened  near Redding, California. It spread rapidly due to overgrown vegetation  near the road on Park Service land. Even the term ``firenado'' came  from that fire.   The second amendment, the CLEAR Zones Act, allows us to easily clear  unhealthy or hazardous trees within 50 feet of power lines. It is  especially important for my district, as several fires in the past,  most notably the devastating 2018 Camp Fire which devoured Paradise,  California, started near power lines--in these cases either by trees  falling into power lines or by equipment that is faulty.   Both of these amendments are prudent fire prevention measures that  reduce the risk of fire outbreaks. They will help keep our air and  water clean, our wildlife safe, and our forests green. This is good  reform to help keep our forests as we would see them.                            ____________________
