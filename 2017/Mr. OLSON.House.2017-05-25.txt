 Mr. Speaker, for 8\1/2\ years I have worked for the best  people in America, the people of Texas 22. The people of Texas 22 love  their neighbors. They love their community, they love life, and they  love God.   Texas 22 is Katie Vacek. Katie is a senior at Needville High School.  Three months before using her Blue Jay wings to fly into her future,  God gave her a different flight. She fell out of a tree with her  boyfriend, Kernie, watching. She is now paralyzed from the waist down.   Kernie, her classmates, and the whole town rallied around Katie and  her dreams. Twelve days ago, at her prom with Kernie, she danced.   Katie, I don't want to come between you and Kernie, but I want you to  be my date the next time President Trump speaks in this Chamber in  February of next year. We will lock this down at the Knights of  Columbus on June 6 back home. Keep fighting, knowing that God is with  you always.                            ____________________
