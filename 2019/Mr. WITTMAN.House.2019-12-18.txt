 Madam Speaker, I include my statement in the Record,  recording that I am opposed to these Articles of Impeachment on the  basis that they do not measure up to Article II, Section 4.   Madam Speaker, following the release of reports from the Oversight,  Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, and Judiciary Committees, it is clear  the hearings held by House Democrats over the last month have by no  means proved President Trump committed an impeachable offense. Unhappy  with the results of the election, House Democrats have been working to  build a case for impeachment since the day President Trump took office.  Speaker Pelosi said from the beginning that the impeachment must be  `compelling, overwhelming, and bipartisan;' and today, none of those  are true. In actuality, there is one thing bipartisan about this  impeachment: the opposition to it.   There is a reason why only three presidents have gone through this  before--it is supposed to be an exceedingly rare occurrence. The  founders warned against a single party impeachment because it would  divide the country--and that is what we are seeing right now, we are  seeing Democrats weaponize the impeachment process and I am worried for  the precedent this will set for the future.   The majority has wasted the Fall by being solely focused on  impeachment--leading us to pass two continuing resolutions, miss  important deadlines for the NDAA, and leave funding to the last minute.  I believe we need to be focused on solving problems and working on  solutions for our constituents; the American people are sick of this  partisan stalemate. I hope in the beginning of the next session we can  get back to the real issues--finding a bipartisan solution to lowering  the price of prescription drugs, creating an infrastructure package,  reforming our broken budget process, and expanding access to broadband  in rural areas.
