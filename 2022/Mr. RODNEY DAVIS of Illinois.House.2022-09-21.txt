 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor  Springfield's own Dick Schofield. Dick passed away recently at age 87.  He was the grandfather of my good friend Jayson Werth.   Schofield was an accomplished baseball star, spending 19 seasons in  the major leagues with seven organizations. Schofield's baseball career  began at Springfield High School. Just weeks after graduating, he  reported to the St. Louis Cardinals. In 1960, he became a World Series  champion as a pivotal member of the Pittsburgh Pirates.   Dick is one of four generations in his family to play professional  baseball. He followed in his father Ducky's footsteps, and both his son  Dick, and grandson Jayson, had long and successful careers in MLB as  well.   Though Schofield had opportunities to stay in the league as a coach,  he chose to return to his hometown of Springfield to treasure his time  with his loving wife, Donna, and their three children: Kim, Dick, and  Tami. Schofield proudly represented his community as an accomplished  salesman and 20-year board member of the Springfield Metropolitan  Exposition Authority.   As a grandfather to eight and great-grandfather to five, Dick was a  true family man that cherished the time spent with all of them. I send  my deepest condolences to my friend Jayson and the entire Schofield  family.   Dick, may you rest in peace.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   I think it is important today to begin by taking a step back, provide  some important context about the bill we are considering today, and  reestablish some important facts.   Election administration and the way elections work is a complicated  process. For most of us, this experience typically consists of showing  up, casting a ballot, and then digesting news coverage of results. Very  few people realize everything that goes on behind the scenes.   But recently, as election administration has come into the forefront,  there are a lot of people who all of a sudden seem to think that they  are an expert on the subject. This includes many of the people in these  buildings and in the press.   Many of those folks have never been on the ground in election offices  across the country and couldn't tell the difference between an e- pollbook and a high-speed ballot scanner, yet they know they are right.   This has led to all sorts of rumors, narratives, and misinformation  across the political spectrum to percolate within our society, and that  has caused people to lose faith in our elections. This is a huge  problem.   I have spent the past few years traveling the country to learn about  different State election processes and have met with countless  Republican and Democrat election administrators.  [[Page H8037]]  I have learned about the checks and balances in place.   Free and fair elections are the bedrock of our democracy, and we must  ensure people can have faith in elections and election processes and  outcomes in order for our democracy to continue to thrive.   Unfortunately, one false narrative that has been pushed by my  colleagues on the other side is that Republican Members of Congress are  election subverters or deniers, trying to overthrow elections because  of an objection to a State's electoral slate on January 6. This has  been fueled by members of the media who don't understand the subject.   They are claiming that this particular action was unprecedented and  an affront to democracy. However, so many of them, including powerful  committee chairs that are in power today, have objected in the past. In  fact, Democrats have objected to every single Republican Presidential  win in the 21st century.   Another false narrative is that somehow the legal actions taken by  the Trump campaign, the rhetoric of former President Trump, Republican  Members of Congress voting to object to a State's electors, and the  illegal actions of many people who attacked the Capitol on January 6  were all connected in some kind of mass conspiracy by Republicans to  stage a coup.    These two narratives are now presented on a daily basis as though  they are fact, but that is quite simply not true. The fact of the  matter is, there are longstanding legal frameworks in place to  adjudicate disputes in election outcomes that have been utilized  regularly, regardless of party.   There is not enough time today to go through all of them, but the  point is these processes have existed for a long time, and they are  used frequently and often by candidates of all political stripes.   There are checks, balances, and safeguards woven in throughout the  system. The goal of every election framework is to ensure the person  who takes the oath of office is the one who actually won. That is true  in the States, in the courts, and here in Congress.   The best news of all is these systems have worked. At the end of the  day, the outcomes were exactly as they should have been. It is why  people can and should have faith in our election system.   This isn't to say that our system is perfect. There is always room  for improvement, but unfortunately, that is not what is happening here  today.   The Electoral Count Act has been in place for over a century and  directly implements constitutional provisions. Members of all political  parties have exercised their rights under the provisions of that law to  raise constitutional objections to State electoral slates if they  determine something may be improper. This is not an affront to  democracy. Frankly, it is democracy in action.   In fact, Democrats have quite an extensive history of objecting to  the electoral count. I include in the Record a list of over 80  Democrats denying election results, including many chairs, people like  Chairperson Maxine Waters, Chairman Bennie Thompson, Representative  Jamie Raskin, and many others here today.           Committee on Republicans House Administration,      Ranking Member, Rodney Davis,                       Democrat Objectors Since 2000                               2000 (Jan. 2001)         Rep.

Hillary Clinton denied the results of the 2000 and 2016       presidential elections, believed there were legitimate       questions regarding the integrity of the 2004 presidential       election, and said that Stacey Abrams would have won the 2018       Georgia gubernatorial election against Gov. Brian Kemp if it       had been fair.        2. President Joe Biden has previously claimed that Gore won       the 2000 presidential election and agreed that Trump was an       ``illegitimate president.''        3. Vice President Kamala Harris has previously agreed that       Trump was an ``illegitimate president'' and claimed that       without voter suppression, Abrams would have won the 2018       Georgia gubernatorial election and Andrew Gillum would have       won the 2018 Florida gubernatorial election.        4. Former President Bill Clinton claimed that Gore actually       won the 2000 presidential election.        5. Former President Jimmy Carter claimed that Gore was the       real winner of the 2000 presidential election and that Trump       lost the 2016 presidential election.        6. Former President Barack Obama, when he was an Illinois       senator, said that not every vote was counted in the 2000       presidential election.        7. John Kerry, President Biden's special presidential envoy       for climate, claimed voters were ``denied their right to       vote'' in the 2004 presidential election and reportedly told       New York University professor Mark Crispin Miller that he       believed the election was stolen.        8. Kerry's wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry, also said the 2004       presidential election could have been stolen.        9.

House Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-S.C.) questioned       the integrity of the 2000 presidential election when he was       chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, and objected to the       certification of Ohio's electoral votes in the 2004       presidential election.        14. Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), when he was a congressman,       voted to reject the electoral votes from the state of Ohio       for the 2004 presidential election.        15. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), when he was a congressman       during the certification of the 2004 presidential election,       said he was ``worried'' that there wasn't a paper trail for       electronic voting machines in case of recounts. After the       2016 presidential election, Sanders said he was ``concerned''       about ``the role Russian hacking played in getting [Trump]       elected.''        16. Then-Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) was the only senator       to join 31 House Democrats in rejecting the electoral votes       from the state of Ohio for the 2004 presidential election.        17. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), Financial Services       Committee chair, objected to the certification of Florida's       electoral votes in the 2000 presidential election and the       certification of Ohio's electoral votes in the 2004       presidential election. She also tried to get a senator to       join her in a letter of objection after the electoral votes       for Wyoming were announced during the certification of the       2016 presidential election.        18. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), who is a member of the       January 6th Committee and was a House impeachment manager       during Trump's second impeachment, said Bush was a ``court-      appointed president'' following 2000 election, and objected       to certifying the electoral votes for Florida in the 2016       presidential election.        19. Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), chairman of the Judiciary       Committee, claimed there were irregularities in the 2004       presidential election and called Trump ``an illegitimate       president.''        20.

Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Texas), when she was       chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, said there was       ``overwhelming evidence'' that Bush did not win the 2000       presidential election and objected to the certification of       Florida's electoral votes in the 2000 presidential election.       She also objected to the certification of Ohio's electoral       college votes in the 2004 presidential election.  [[Page H8038]]             24. Then-Rep.

He also objected to the certification of Ohio's       electoral college votes in the 2004 presidential election.        28. Rev.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) believed the 2016       presidential election outcome was altered by Russian       interference.        33. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), former DNC       chairwoman, said that Gore won the 2000 election and that the       2016 election outcome was affected by Russian interference       for Trump.        34. Then-Rep. Corrine Brown (D-Fla.) didn't believe Bush       was elected in the 2000 presidential election and objected to       the certification of Florida's electoral votes in the 2000       presidential election. She also objected to the certification       of Ohio's electoral votes in the 2004 presidential election.        35. Then-Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) approved of Democrats'       efforts to contest the 2004 presidential election.        36. Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., claimed the 2004 presidential       election was stolen.        37. Then-Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones (R-Ohio) objected to       the certification of Ohio's electoral college votes in the       2004 presidential election.        38. Then-DNC Chairman and former Vermont governor Howard       Dean claimed there was voter suppression by Republicans in       the 2004 presidential election, that the electronic voting       machines weren't reliable, and said there wouldn't ``be any       more election stealings.'' Following the 2018 Georgia       gubernatorial election, he said that Abrams shouldn't concede       and that it was ``almost certainly stolen.''        39. Then-Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) was       concerned about the integrity of electronic voting machines       in the 2004 presidential election.        40. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) praised Boxer for objecting       to the certification of Ohio's electoral college votes in the       2004 presidential election.        41. Then-Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) praised Tubbs Jones for       objecting to the certification of Ohio's electoral college       votes in the 2004 presidential election and raised concerns       about Republicans suppressing the vote and possible fraud       with electronic voting machines.        42.

Sherrod Brown, (D-Ohio) when he was a       congressman, said there were voters ``who lost their right to       vote'' in Ohio during the 2004 presidential election.

Then-Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.), who was the chair of       the Congressional Black Caucus and later served in the Biden       administration as director of the White House Office of       Public Engagement, said Lewis' remarks that Trump wasn't       legitimately elected were ``reasonable.''        51. Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) said there was ``a cloud of       illegitimacy'' over Trump's presidency.        52. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said he believed the 2018       Georgia gubernatorial election was stolen from Abrams.        53. Sen.

Andrew Gillum withdrew his concession in the 2018       Florida gubernatorial election, questioning how the vote was       handled in some counties.        56. Then-Rep. Anthony Brindisi (D-N.Y.) wanted authorities       to investigate voter irregularities and voter       disenfranchisement after he lost his House race in 2020.

Biden's Chief of Staff Ron Klain said that Gore won the       2000 presidential election.        59. Biden Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre tweeted that       the 2018 Georgia gubernatorial election was stolen by Kemp       from Abrams and implied that the 2016 presidential election       was stolen.        60.

Democratic election lawyer Marc Elias argued in court       that voting machines ``misread'' votes in Brindisi's election       challenge for his 2020 House race. He also got Al Franken's       apparent loss in a Minnesota Senate election overturned in       court.        81. Former state Sen. Hank Sanders (D-Ala.) said the 2016       presidential election was stolen from Clinton.        82. Sen. Patty Murray's (D-Wash.) supported fellow       Democrats for their ``questions about voting irregularities''       in the 2004 presidential election.     Again, the result in all of these cases  was that our system worked. The House and Senate did what they were  supposed to do, heard the objections, disposed of them properly, and  ultimately certified the election as originally presented.  [[Page H8039]]    Objecting does not make you an election subverter or denier. Each  Member of Congress has a constitutional duty to do what they think is  best for their constituents.   At the same time Democrats were accusing Republicans of undermining  democracy, they themselves were attempting to overturn the results of a  duly-certified election in Iowa's Second Congressional District. The  challenger, Democrat Rita Hart, even said that she brought the contest  to a partisan committee in D.C. instead of Iowa courts in order to  ``get the result we need.''   This was after the State of Iowa followed their normal and lawful  process throughout the election for Iowa-02. The votes were counted,  recounted by multiple bipartisan recount boards, and duly certified.   Yet, this majority orchestrated having their candidate bypass State  courts and instead attempted to utilize the House itself to steal a  congressional seat to boost their slim majority. This was the single  biggest act of election subversion that occurred in the 2020 election  cycle, and it was carried out by the same people here today claiming  that Republicans are a threat to democracy.   Fast forward to today. Democrats are once again attempting to move a  major piece of legislation that overhauls a key piece of our election  system in a partisan manner behind closed doors. They didn't hold a  hearing or a markup on this bill. They didn't release legislative text  until 24 hours before it was considered in the Rules Committee. They  didn't consult Republicans on the committee of jurisdiction, despite  repeated overtures to work together on discussions of this important  issue--all rebuffed.   Why rush such a significant piece of legislation when the next  Presidential certification won't happen for over 2 years? It is pretty  simple, Madam Speaker: The midterm elections are just weeks away, and  the Democrats are desperately trying to talk about their favorite  topic, former President Trump.   As someone who voted to certify Joe Biden as President and who  recently lost a primary race to a candidate endorsed by the former  President, I believe what House Democrats and the January 6th Committee  are doing is irresponsible and wrong.   They have allowed their dislike for one man, President Trump, to  cloud their judgment and guide their actions, no matter the  consequences to this institution or the Constitution that they claim  they want to uphold.                                time  1500    It is time that we started being honest with ourselves and with the  American people. The facts are:   The President and his campaign filing legal challenges in State and  Federal courts around the country was not improper nor unprecedented.  Everyone is entitled to their day in court. Those suits were considered  by judges and ultimately rejected. The process worked.   The rhetoric of former President Trump following the 2020 election  was highly inappropriate.   Republican Members of Congress objecting to a State's slate of  electors is not election subversion or unprecedented.   The actions of the individuals who attacked the Capitol on January 6  were wrong. Those individuals should be prosecuted to the fullest  extent of the law.   Democrats have just as long of a history as Republicans of  challenging and questioning elections, including attempting to overturn  a duly certified congressional election in Iowa. This is not a partisan  issue, and the processes in place have worked.   Madam Speaker, I would just reiterate that people's faith in our  elections is critical to the long-term success of our democracy. It is  time for House Democrats to quit playing partisan political games and  pushing false narratives just to preserve their own power.   It is incumbent upon all of us to be honest and work in good faith to  serve the American people, restore faith in our elections, and protect  our democracy.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30  seconds to the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much  time is remaining.    Madam Speaker, it is always good to  follow my good friend, Leader Hoyer. I appreciate his friendship, and I  appreciate his time here in this institution. He has seen a lot of  things happen in the governing of this country. I respect him and his  viewpoint.   It is frustrating when we also hear comments from my colleague,  Leader Hoyer. Back on January 25 of this year he was quoted in a  Politico story where he said that President Biden is correct that the  midterm elections will be illegitimate if Congress doesn't pass the  Democrats' election takeover bills.   This is part of the rhetoric that we have got to stop. We have got to  make sure that we remind everybody, as Leader Hoyer did, my good  friend, that this is an American issue. It is not a partisan issue. The  processes have worked.   I want to know, if it is an American issue and not a partisan issue,  Madam Speaker, why, then, were we not even consulted as the committee  of jurisdiction minority members?   I would have loved to have been able to sit down and come up with a  bipartisan solution. No Republican--no Republican--that I know or that  I respect thinks that the violence on January 6, which we all  witnessed, is okay.   I think it was a terrible day. I think, again, anyone who committed  those acts and those crimes should be held accountable to the fullest  extent of the law. Let's be clear: They broke the law. It doesn't  matter what you are protesting, Madam Speaker, if you break the law.   Madam Speaker, if you are rioting in the streets, looting stores and  businesses, and committing the crimes across this country that we have  seen exacerbated because of the Biden administration's lack of effort  in enforcing these activities to be adjudicated, then do you know what?  They should be held accountable. Arrest them, prosecute them, and put  them in jail.   Leader Hoyer also said this bill and this process should not be about  one man. I agree. I agree. But, unfortunately, this bill is nothing  short of being only about that one man. This is too important of an  issue to make this about an individual that you may or may not like or  that you may or may not want to run for President ever again. This bill  and this process is too important for the future of America.   Madam Speaker, my good friend, Mr. Hoyer, brought up Hillary Clinton.  She actually denied the results of the 2016 Presidential elections and  believes  [[Page H8042]]  there were legitimate questions regarding the integrity of the 2004  Presidential election. She said that Stacey Abrams would have won the  2018 gubernatorial election against Governor Brian Kemp if it had been  fair.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Steil).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1  minute to the gentleman from Wisconsin.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I thought the esteemed Member from California was  going to speak a little longer. It caught me a little off guard. I  apologize. I am not used to him being that succinct in anything he does  but thank you.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California  (Mr. McClintock), my good friend, another esteemed Member of this  institution.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to how  much time is remaining.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record  a tweet from Speaker Pelosi on May 16, 2017, that says: ``Our election  was hijacked. There is no question. Congress has a duty to  #ProtectOurDemocracy and #FollowTheFacts.''   I couldn't agree more. We need to follow the facts.   The Speaker asked: How can one vote against this bill? Well, I would  say: How can we vote for a bill that was completely done without any  consultation?   Here is what I hope, Madam Speaker. I was actually comforted somewhat  during the Rules testimony yesterday when my colleague, Chairperson  Lofgren, mentioned that the goal of the majority is to watch this bill  pass--I have many concerns with it; I laid those out yesterday, and I  will lay them out again--but hope the Senate passes the version that we  could have used as the basis and the starting point here in the House,  and then we could go to conference committee.    Okay, I hope it happens. I am not going to hold my breath, but I  certainly hope it happens. I reiterate my desire for that to be a  process where we can finally come together in a bipartisan way. Again,  I am cautiously optimistic.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I had the opportunity to testify yesterday before the  Committee on Rules about how this process has been highly partisan, and  that I would have welcomed an opportunity to work on the Electoral  Count Act reforms in a bipartisan way--just like the Senate did.   There is one quote from my friend, Ranking Member   Tom Cole, that I  want to share. As he said, ``Given all the majority's righteous and  high-minded talk over the last 2 years about how democracy itself is in  peril, don't you think it would be better served to have operated  through regular order with real Member buy-in on a topic that is as  important to the American people as this one?''   That is how the Senate handled this task--in a bipartisan matter  driven toward finding consensus. Why shouldn't the House operate in the  same way? Instead here in the House, every outreach made by Republicans  to work on this issue was rebuffed.   This bill tramples on State sovereignty. While the Constitution gives  States the authority to make and interpret their own State laws, this  bill would grant Congress unprecedented authority to determine what  State law is.   Second, there is a provision of this bill that gives candidates the  ability to broadly define catastrophic events--which could include  major natural disasters or acts of terrorism--and then use that event  to extend the balloting after the polls close for up to 5 days.   Think about it. A candidate could pull a Pelosi and request a change  in the rules supposedly because of the COVID-19 pandemic, despite the  fact that the majority of the country has moved on--including President  Biden who declared the pandemic is over, just to extend voting for 5  more days for their political benefit.   Or remember just last year, when President Biden's FBI labeled  concerned parents attending their children's school PTA meetings  domestic terrorists?   With many polling at schools, a candidate could try to claim that  parents meeting is a catastrophic event. We also can't forget that many  Democrats have claimed that Republican-led States with newly enacted  election integrity laws like Florida are suppressing voters.   Could a candidate then try to claim voter suppression because they  don't like their State's laws and then request the polls stay open once  they see election results that aren't going their way?   This bill would create a new private right of action for all  Presidential candidates or their electors and specifically expand the  scope of the right to tabulate.   This creates a big question as to how and if Congress has the  authority to require candidates to go to Federal court to force them to  follow State law.   I mean, I can just picture the field day election lawyers like  sanctioned Democrat Marc Elias would have with these provisions all  while creating mass confusion for voters who will question if their  vote was even counted. Voters don't need Congress to come in and  overcomplicate the ECA process that has worked for the last 135 years.   As a reminder, we came back the night of January 6, after the tragic  events that we all witnessed here in this Capitol, and we certified Joe  Biden as President and Kamala Harris as Vice President.   What voters want is to show up on election day, easily cast their  ballot, know that their ballot is counted in accordance with the law,  and for election results to come in later that night. But this bill  doesn't do that. Instead, it could very well do the opposite.   This bill does nothing to prevent another mob from attacking the  Capitol. Neither Mike Pence doing what every Vice President in history  has done nor lawful constitutional objections being filed caused a mob  to attack--and clarifying those responsibilities won't prevent another  mob.   That is why this bill won't even see the light of day over in the  Senate and why we should have used the bipartisan Senate version as a  starting point. Maybe then we could actually enact some necessary  updates to improve and clarify the certification process and focus on  the big unanswered problem--the security of the Capitol. Bad actors by  definition don't follow the law so any changes made to the Electoral  Count Act aren't a silver bullet.   As I have been saying this entire Congress, we need to be focused on  why the Capitol was left so unprotected on that day in January. Why was  a mob able to breach one of the most significant buildings on our  planet?   Again, I invite all of my Democrat colleagues to work with me to  improve the security of this Capitol and the people it holds. That is  how we prevent another attack.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill because it is  both bad process and bad policy. The American people deserve better.  They deserve to have full confidence in the election process and the  outcomes.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the  yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
