 Madam Speaker, I rise today to mourn and also to  celebrate a historic life, a man I was honored to know, privileged to  serve with, and to call my friend.   Congressman John Lewis has been called home to God. I met Mr. Lewis  right after I was elected to Congress, but over the years, I had the  pleasure of getting to know him, a civil rights icon, a true American  hero.   Too rarely are the most powerful also the most humble, the most  caring, and the most kind. But Mr. Lewis had that  [[Page H3684]]  rare combination and more. He was the best among us.   In one moment, he would fearlessly stand in harm's way to stand up  for what is right, and in the next, he wouldn't hesitate to take a  minute to share his insights, his lessons, his personal stories with  those lucky enough to cross his path or to walk into his office.   In 2015, so many of our colleagues and I joined him for the 50th  anniversary walk across the Edmond Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, to  honor the moment that young John Lewis forever changed our Nation.   As we all gathered to follow in his historic footsteps, the magic and  the power of John Lewis' action on that fateful day in 1965 could be  felt by all of us. Our country is better, our Congress is better, and I  am better for having known him.   I will miss you, Mr. Lewis, but I will forever celebrate and honor  the impact you made on our Nation and on me.
