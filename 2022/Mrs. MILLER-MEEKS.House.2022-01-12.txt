 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an  incredible veteran from my district for his service to our country and  eastern Iowa.   Henry Langrehr of Clinton served in Europe during World War II with  the 82nd Airborne Division. Because of his heroic and brave actions in  France, he received two Bronze Stars, two Purple Hearts, and the French  Legion of Honor.   Henry was a paratrooper who flew on a C-47 transport plane across the  English Channel before being dropped into Normandy on D-day during the  Allied invasion.   During the campaign, Henry was injured by shrapnel and taken as a  German prisoner of war. He successfully escaped a Nazi work camp and  made his way back to his countrymen.   Henry always makes sure to praise Arlene, his wife of nearly 80  years. While Henry was in Europe, Arlene worked 12 hours a day, 7 days  a week, making machine gun stands needed for the war effort, a real- life Rosie the Riveter.   I am incredibly grateful to have amazing Americans like Henry and  Arlene living in my district.   Thank you for your incredible service to and love for the United  States, Iowa, and Clinton.                            ____________________
