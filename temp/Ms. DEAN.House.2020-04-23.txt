 Madam Speaker, shame on those who would not tell the truth  during a pandemic. Though more help is needed, I rise in support of  this interim funding bill.   These dollars must actually make it to those who need it: small  family businesses, minority- and women-owned businesses, so many I have  talked to over these last few weeks. Their future and our economy  depends upon it.   For healthcare workers saving lives, we have the responsibility to do  all we can to help protect those who are saving our families' lives.   To reopen our country, we need testing, testing, testing. I look  forward to the next more robust and even more equitable bill of relief  for the people.
