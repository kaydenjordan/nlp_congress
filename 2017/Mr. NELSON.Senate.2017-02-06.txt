 Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my postcloture  debate time to Senator Schumer.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.   The Senator from Florida is recognized.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the nomination  of Senator Sessions to be the next Attorney General. I believe one of  the most important jobs of a U.S. Attorney General is to protect the  people's right to vote.   In the tumultuous days of the early 1960s, on a hot afternoon, I  watched on a grainy black and white TV as Dr. King delivered his  memorable ``I Have a Dream'' speech on the steps of the Lincoln  Memorial.   His soaring, spiritually laced speech challenged us to commit our  lives to ensuring that the promises of American democracy were  available, not just for the privileged few but for ``all of God's  children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and  Catholics.''   ``Now is the time,'' Dr. King urged, ``to make real the promises of  democracy.'' He stressed that a central promise made to the citizens in  a democracy is the right to vote and to have that vote counted. He  said: ``We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot  vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to  vote.''   Half a century has passed, and our country has changed with the  times, but one thing has not changed. The right to vote for ``all God's  children'' in America is still under assault. Unbelievably, we are not  so very far from the problems of 1963. Despite the passage of time and  landmark civil and voting rights legislation, five decades later there  is still considerable voter suppression in this country.   In fact, several States have recently enacted restrictive laws  cutting back voting hours on nights and on weekends, eliminating same- day registration, and basically making it harder for people to vote.  Standing in between a citizen and the voting booth is a direct  contradiction to the vision of equality put forth by our Founding  Fathers. In 1776, they declared that all men were created equal, but  many in our country had to wait another 94 years before the 15th  Amendment to the Constitution granted citizens the right to vote-- though not all citizens. Ratified in 1870, the amendment states: ``The  right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or  abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race,  color, or previous condition of servitude. The Congress shall have  power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.''   It still took another 50 years before women in America were allowed  to vote. After her arrest for casting a ballot in the Presidential  election of 1872, Susan B. Anthony delivered a number of speeches in  Upstate New York on women's suffrage. In those speeches, she noted that  the right of all citizens to vote in elections is key to a functioning  democracy.   Specifically, one line from her speech stands out. ``And it is a  downright mockery to talk to women of their enjoyment of the blessings  of liberty while they are denied the use of the only means of securing  them by providing the democratic-republican government--the ballot.''   After the passage of the 19th Amendment granting women the ballot, it  took another 45 years before our Nation belatedly enacted the Voting  Rights Act of 1965 intended to guarantee every U.S. citizen the right  to vote. Does this principle really hold true in practice?   The continued voter suppression of which I speak may not be as  blatant as it once was with Jim Crow laws and poll taxes and literacy  tests and the like, but it is still very much with us.   In recent years, it is obvious that hurdles have once again been  placed between the voting booth and the young and minority voters. A  devastating blow was dealt by the U.S. Supreme Court when it gutted the  Voting Rights Act in 2013. Our Nation's highest Court struck down a  central provision of the law that was used to guarantee fair elections  in this country since the mid-1960s, and that includes the guarantee of  elections in my State of Florida since that time.   Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to protect our right to  vote. It required States with a history of voter suppression to get  Federal approval before changing their voting laws. And for nearly five  decades, the States had to prove to the Department of Justice why a  change was necessary and demonstrate how that change would not harm  voters.   In a 5-to-4 decision, the Court declared that part of the law was  outdated. It essentially rendered a key part of the law void until a  bitterly partisan and gridlocked Congress can come up with a new  formula for determining which States and localities need advance  approval to amend their right-to-vote laws. The majority justified its  ruling in the Court by pointing out that we no longer had the blatant  voter suppression tactics once used to disenfranchise targeted voters  across the country. I vigorously disagree because removing much needed  voter protections also prevents the Federal Government from trying to  block discriminatory State laws before they go into effect. In essence,  States and local jurisdictions are now legally free to do as they  please.   In fact, just moments after the decision, the Texas attorney general  said his State would begin ``immediately'' honoring local legislation  that a fellow court had imposed ``strict and unforgiving burdens'' on  many Texans attempting to cast a ballot.   As has been noted, the right to vote was not always given to all  American adults, but our laws adjusted as we became a more mature and  tolerant democracy. But the reverse is what has been happening in  America today and especially in Florida.   Since the 2010 election, in addition to cutting back on early voting,  North Carolina, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Florida have approved voting  restrictions that according to some experts are targeted directly at  reducing turnout among young, low-income, and minority voters who  traditionally support Democrats.   One study by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University  School of Law reviewed the crop of similar disenfranchisement laws that  were enacted after the 2010 decision. All told, the center found that  as many as 5 million Americans could be adversely affected by these  voting laws, and there is a clear political impact as a result of these  disenfranchisement laws.   Two University of Massachusetts professors conducted a study that  found that there was a clear pattern associated with the voter  restrictions in the various States. According to Keith Bentele and Erin  E. O'Brien, States were more likely to pass limits on voting that  elected those Republican Governors, those States that increased their  share of Republican lawmakers, and those States that became more  electorally competitive under Republicans.   In 2011, the Florida legislature and State officials reduced a number  of early voting days. They reduced them from 2 weeks down to 8 days,  including very conveniently canceling the Sunday right before the  Tuesday election, a day that had historically seen heavy African- American and Hispanic voting.  [[Page S946]]    State officials countered that registered voters would still have the  same number of hours and that they could still vote early, only in 8  days instead of 2 weeks. Well, it didn't work out that way. Florida  also made voting harder for people who had been recently moved to  another county and had an address change, such as college students,  after it subjected voter registration groups to penalties and fines for  mistakes--voter registration, mind you, penalties, and fines if you  didn't turn it in within a certain number of hours.   They were so burdensome that the League of Women Voters challenged  the provision in Federal court and they won but not before Jill  Cicciarelli, a Florida teacher, had helped her students preregister to  vote and ended up facing legal troubles as the result of her well- intentioned public service. A schoolteacher, teaching a government  class, getting her kids preregistered, so when they became 18, they  could vote, and she got in trouble with the State of Florida. The New  Smyrna Beach High School civics teacher unwittingly ran afoul of the  State's new convoluted election law. Cicciarelli, it turned out, hadn't  registered with the State before beginning the drive and didn't submit  forms to the elections office within that short number of hours.  ``You're talking about a high-energy teacher who cares about her kids,  cares about her community and cares about her country,'' is how the New  Smyrna High School principal, Jim Tager, described the situation.   Thankfully, the Voting Rights Act allowed the Federal Government to  go before a panel of Washington, DC, judges who found that Florida's  2011 reduction of early voting--which I have just chronicled--here is  what the court said, ``would make it materially more difficult for some  minority voters to cast a ballot.'' As a result, Florida had to restore  96 hours of early voting.   Even with these added protections, the next election in 2012 was a  fiasco. Lines outside the polling places were prohibitively long, with  some people waiting up to 8 hours to cast their vote. I am not kidding  the Senate. There were lines in Dade County, Miami Dade County, 7 and 8  hours. By the way, some of those lines, there wasn't a nearby bathroom.  Faced with calls for extending poll hours, the Governor of Florida  failed to do what its two Republican gubernatorial predecessors had  done: extend voting hours in some of the most swamped polling places to  give folks enough time to exercise their right to vote.   In fact, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology analysis found that  in 2012, Florida had the Nation's longest waiting lines to vote at an  average statewide of 45 minutes. More than 200,000 voters in Florida  gave up in frustration because the lines were so long. They didn't vote  that year. According to another analysis by Ohio State University, in  the Orlando Sentinel, they are the ones who came up with that 200,000  figure, and they aren't done yet.   As if the 2011 restrictions weren't enough, an elections official in  Miami-Dade County, in 2012, said that restrooms would be closed to  voters at polling sites in private buildings over a handicap access  dispute, even though there were bathrooms in those private buildings  where the polling place was. The State's top election official in 2012  also told one of our 67 local election supervisors not to allow voters  to submit absentee ballots at remote dropoff sites. She, by the way, is  a Republican supervisor of elections. She told the State Department  Division of Elections to kiss off; that she was running the elections  and she was going to make sure there were enough places around that  county where, if they had an absentee ballot, it was going to be  convenient for them to go and drop off that absentee ballot than having  to take it miles and miles to one place, that the Division of Elections  at the State level was telling them to go to that Supervisor of  Elections. She knew what she had to do to make it easy for voters to  vote, and she stuck to her guns.   At the same time, that same Division of Elections in the Department  of State, denied a request from the city of Gainesville in a municipal  election. They denied the request to use the University of Florida  campus building for early voting. A move that was viewed by some--more  than some--as an assault on student voting by making it more difficult  for students to find a place to vote.   By then, I had asked the U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, for an  investigation into the changes in Florida's voting law. In response,  the Attorney General wrote to warn the Governor of Florida that the  Justice Department would be ``carefully monitoring'' Florida's  elections. ``During your tenure, your State has repeatedly added  barriers to voting and restricted access to the polls,'' the Attorney  General wrote. ``Whenever warranted by the facts and the law, we will  not hesitate to use all tools and legal authorities at our disposal to  fight against racial discrimination, to stand against  disenfranchisement, and to safeguard the right of every eligible  American to cast a ballot.''   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  the letter from the U.S. Attorney General to the Governor of Florida,  dated July 21, 2014.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                      Office of the                                                Attorney General,                                      Washington, DC, July 21, 2014.      Hon. Rick Scott,      Governor of Florida, The Capitol, Tallahassee, FL.        Dear Governor Scott: In recent years. I have heard from       public officials and citizens of Florida expressing their       deep concern that certain changes to Florida election law and       procedures have restricted voter participation and limited       access to the franchise. Because the right to vote is one of       our nation's most sacred rights, I strongly urge you to       reevaluate laws and procedures that make it harder for       citizens to register and to vote so that all eligible       Floridians can easily and without burden exercise their right       to vote.        Generations of Americans took extraordinary risks and       willingly confronted hatred and violence--including in your       home state--to ensure that all American citizens would have       the chance to participate in the work of their government.       The right to vote is not only the cornerstone or our system       of government--it is the lifeblood of our democracy. Whatever       the precise contours of federal law, we each have a civic and       moral duty to protect, and to expand access to, this right.        For this reason, I am deeply disturbed that during your       tenure your state has repeatedly added barriers to voting and       restricted access to the polls. For example, changes in 2011       significantly narrowed the early voting window that had       previously enabled thousands of Floridians to cast ballots.       As the three judge court in Florida v. United Stares, 885 F.       Supp. 2d 299 (D.D.C. 2012), observed, the law threatened ``a       dramatic reduction in the form of voting that is       disproportionately used by African-Americans'' that would       have made it ``materially more difficult for some minority       voters to cast a ballot than under the benchmark law,'' in       part because the decreased opportunity for early voting would       produce increased lines at the polls during the remaining       hours. Id. at 333. Accordingly, the court refused to approve       reduced early voting hours with respect to the five counties       in Florida covered by the Voting Rights Act's preclearance       provision.        Indeed, Florida's decision to reduce early voting       opportunities in the 2011 legislation was widely recognized       as a disaster. A report released by the Orlando Sentinel in       January 2013 found that at least 201,000 Florida voters did       not cast ballots on Election Day 2012 because they were       discouraged by long lines at polling places. I am pleased       that last year you signed legislation that restored early       voting days. However, I have grave concerns that there       remains a troubling pattern in your state of measures that       make it more difficult, not easier, for Floridians to vote.       For example, as part of the same 2011 law, the state imposed       rules on organizations that helped register individuals to       vote that were, in the words of a federal court, ``harsh,''       ``impractical,'' ``burdensome,'' and ``unworkable.'' League       of Women Voters of Fla. v. Browning, 863 F. Supp. 2d 1155       (N.D. Fl. 2012).        Most recently, the federal courts have concluded that in       2012, Florida violated the National Voter Registration Act of       1993 (NVRA) by conducting a systematic program to purge       voters from its voter registration rolls within the 90-day       quiet period before an election for federal office. In doing       so, Florida used inaccurate and unreliable voter verification       procedures that harmed and confused voters. Arcia v. Fla.       Sec'y, of State, 746 F.3d 1273 (11th Cir. 2014).        Florida is one of just eleven states that continue to       restrict voting rights even after a person has served his or       her sentence and is no longer on probation or parole; and in       2011, you made it more difficult for individuals who have       served their sentences to regain the right to vote by       eliminating automatic restoration of rights for non-violent       felons and requiring a five year waiting period before felons       convicted of non-violent crimes can apply to have their       rights restored. Approximately ten percent of the entire       population is disenfranchised as a result  [[Page S947]]       of Florida law. The justifications for denying citizens'       voting rights for life, especially after they have completed       their sentence and made amends, are unpersuasive. On the       contrary: there is evidence to suggest that offenders whose       voting rights are restored are significantly less likely to       return to the criminal justice system. For example. a study       recently conducted by a parole commission in Florida found       that, while the overall three-year recidivism rate stood at       roughly 33 percent, the rate among those who were re-      enfranchised after they'd served their time was just a third       of that.        And there are a number of other troubling examples       involving recent changes:        In 2013, Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner issued a       directive to county officials who supervise elections stating       that they should never solicit the return of absentee ballots       at any place other than supervisors' offices. Many have       expressed concern that this directive will significantly       reduce the number of places to return an absentee ballot and       will have a negative impact on citizens whose jobs, access to       transportation, or addresses make it difficult to return       ballots to supervisors' office which, especially in large       counties, may be miles away.        This year, Gainesville, in an attempt to avoid the long       lines that characterized the 2012 election, sought approval       to use the University of Florida's student union as an early       voting site. Secretary of State Detzner denied the request.       As a result, it is more difficult for University of Florida       students--who have to travel to alternative early voting       locations miles off campus--to participate in early voting.        In April, it was reported that the Miami-Dade County       Elections Department had a policy, according to an email from       an Assistant County Attorney, ``not to permit access to       restrooms at polling sites on election days.'' As you know,       in 2012, Miami-Dade County had some of the longest lines and       waiting times to vote in the United States. Some voters       reported waiting as much as six hours. Many of the people       stuck in lines need to use bathroom facilities in order to       remain in line and be allowed to vote.        Whether or not these changes would ultimately be found to       violate specific federal laws, they represent a troubling       series of efforts to limit citizens' ability to exercise the       franchise. And I write to you today to make clear that the       Department of Justice is carefully monitoring jurisdictions       around the country--including throughout Florida--for voting       changes that may hamper the voting rights we are charged with       protecting. Whenever warranted by the facts and the law, we       will not hesitate to use all tools and legal authorities at       our disposal to fight against racial discrimination, to stand       against disenfranchisement, and to safeguard the right of       every eligible American to cast a ballot.            Sincerely,                                               Eric H. Holder, Jr.,                                                  Attorney General.     The Attorney General cited problematic actions of the  Governor's chief elections official, including purging from the voter  rolls suspected noncitizens--a move that eventually was blocked after  outright opposition from county election supervisors.   So in light of this evidence and following a widespread public  outcry, what do we do now? As we say, it may not be as obvious as poll  tactics and all the other blockades to voting, as we have seen in the  past, particularly by all of the marches and so forth during the 1970s  civil rights era. It might not be as obvious, but there are all these  subtle attempts. So what do we do?   I submit that though the problem is complex, the answer is relatively  simple. As Americans who cherish the right to vote, we must turn to  those schemers and say: There is a promise of democracy that we will  not allow you to break. We have an obligation to keep this promise of  democracy for our children.   Congress may be dysfunctional, but we must continue to push lawmakers  for a fix to the Voting Rights Act that the Supreme Court struck down  on a 5-to-4 vote, a key provision. We ought to be making it easier to  vote, not harder. I believe no one should have to wait more than one- half hour to vote.   So I joined with others a few years ago to introduce a bill in  Congress aimed at making that standard 30-minute wait time based on the  January 2014 recommendation of a bipartisan Presidential Commission on  Election Administration. Keep in mind what President Johnson said a  half century ago: ``The vote is the most powerful instrument ever  devised by man for breaking down injustice and destroying the terrible  walls which imprison men because they are different from other men.''   Also remember what Dr. King said:         So long as I do not firmly and irrevocably possess the       right to vote, I do not possess myself. I cannot make up my       mind--it is made up for me. I cannot live as a democratic       citizen, observing the laws I have helped to enact--I can       only submit to the edict of others.    Don't we owe it to all our children the right to possess themselves  if this is to be a truly free and fair democracy? I believe that two of  the most fundamental rights in our democracy are the right to vote and  the right to know whom you are voting for and the right to have the  confidence that vote is going to be counted as you intended.   If that were not enough, just as concerning as the ongoing efforts to  suppress certain votes in this country is the amount of undisclosed and  unlimited money that is sloshing around in our campaigns.   The Supreme Court's 2010 decision in Citizens United has opened the  floodgates and allowed the wealthiest Americans to spend unlimited  amounts of money to influence our elections. Allowing such unlimited,  undisclosed money into our political system is corrupting our  democracy.   I have strongly supported several pieces of legislation, such as the  Disclose Act, to require groups who spend more than $10,000 on  campaign-related matters to identify themselves. Tell the people who is  giving the money by filing a disclosure report with the Federal  Elections Commission. But that is not what the Supreme Court decision  required.   The American people have a right to know whom they are voting for-- not just the name on the ballot but who is behind that name on the  ballot. The Supreme Court itself said that ``transparency enables the  electorate to make informed decisions and give proper weight to  different speakers and messages.''   I believe we as a Congress have a moral obligation--a moral  obligation--to correct what has happened to our system and to ensure  that our voters have the information they need to make an informed  decision on election day.   So this Senator has spoken on two subject areas--the right to vote  and the amount of undetectable, unannounced, undisclosed, and unlimited  money in our elections. For these and many other reasons I have stated  and have not stated and the reasons mentioned in these remarks, I will  vote no on the confirmation for Attorney General.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The Senator from Missouri.
