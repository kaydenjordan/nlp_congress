 Madam President, I was delayed in joining my  colleagues here to talk about this so-called anti-woke capitalism, or  anti-ESG scheme, that has been propagated.   I think the important thing to begin with is to understand what is  happening out there, why this has happened. The Republicans would like  us to believe that some bizarre, viral epidemic of wokeism has spread  into America's great financial companies, into the investment advisers,  into the banks, into all kinds of fiduciaries, and that that needs to  be somehow excised. That is not what has happened. That is  preposterous, magical thinking.  [[Page S554]]    What has happened is that the long forecasted dangers of climate  change that scientists have been telling us about for years have now  gotten so real and are so immediate that they have hit the due  diligence horizon for big banks, big investment companies, corporate  boards, and other fiduciaries. When you owe somebody else a fiduciary  duty, like your shareholders or your investors or your customers at a  bank, then you have to tell them the truth, and you have to tell them  the truth about risks. The risks associated with climate change--the  risks caused by the fossil fuel industry's relentless emissions--are  now so real and so immediate that they can't be denied by big  institutions that have no real interest in climate change but are  absolutely obliged to tell the truth as fiduciaries.   So that fiduciary threshold--that due diligence horizon--has been  crossed, and the fossil fuel industry, which is used to bullying to get  its way, is now pushing this completely fake, anti-ESG effort in order  to try to undo what the free market and what real life in facts and  fiduciary obligations are causing other industries to deal with.   The one telltale clue here is that, when they are done talking about  woke capitalism and when they are done talking about anti-ESG stuff,  when you actually look at what the objection is--what the specific  thing is that they are pushing back against--in the ESG, it is always  the ``E.'' It is never the ``S.'' It is never the ``G.'' It is not  social stuff. It is not governance stuff. It is environmental stuff.  Within that ``E,'' for environmental stuff, it is ``E'' for emissions.  That is always the gravamen of the complaint.    So that tells you a lot about who is behind this, and who is pitching  it tells you a lot about who is behind this because you have got fossil  fuel-funded organizations, like the Republican Attorneys General  Association that is cranking up and turning out Republican attorneys  general to push this theory. You have got the Republican State  treasurers, often funded by the fossil fuel industry, and a group  called the State Financial Officers Foundation, which has glommed the  State treasurers together to try to push on this. You have got State  boards, like the Texas Railroad Commission--again, heavily, heavily,  heavily involved with the fossil fuel industry--that are pushing all of  this.   When you look at what it is, you can see that its target is always  fossil fuel emissions, and you can see that its proponents are always  fossil fuel funded. That tells you why we are where we are.   The rule that the fossil fuel industry pushed through during the  Trump administration--an administration which did essentially  everything the fossil fuel industry wanted it to do--would have  restricted the ability of investment professionals to deliver the  products that customers actually wanted and prevented them from looking  at environmental risks, social issues, or governance. Again, this is  really about the environmental piece. The Biden rule just undoes that.   Nobody has to do ESG stuff, as that is dictated by customer demand,  but if you want to and if your customers are demanding that and if you  want to protect them from climate risk, well, there you go. You have to  do it.   Another clue about the mischief here is who some of the propagators  of this theory have been. One is the Heritage Foundation. The Heritage  Foundation is a notorious climate denial group. It has received  millions of dollars from the Koch brothers' political enterprise, from  Koch foundations, and has plenty of fossil fuel ties. There is the  Texas Public Policy Foundation, which is another group that is a front  group for the oil and gas industry. I have already mentioned RAGA,  which is heavily fossil fuel funded. It helped produce Scott Pruitt,  whom you may remember from EPA disgrace. They had such control over  RAGA that they were able to get him, as the attorney general, to write  a letter with the identical text from a fossil fuel company, send it in  to the EPA under his own letterhead, under his own signature as  attorney general, even though the entire text was written by a fossil  fuel company.   So that is the kind of relationship it has with RAGA, which, by the  way, also helped turn people out for the January 6 insurrection. It is  a really, really high-quality operation there.   The last group that I will mention is the Marble Freedom Trust. The  Marble Freedom Trust is the 501(c)(4) pop-up operation that magically  appeared in Utah to be the recipient of a $1.6 billion slush fund,  gifted to it by a far-right billionaire. That put it into the hands of  a guy named Leonard Leo, whom I have talked about here on the floor  before, who is the orchestrator of the scheme to capture the Supreme  Court and put it into special interests' hands. His reward for his  success in that project was this $1.6 billion slush fund that he now  controls, and he controls it through that Utah 501(c)(4) pop-up called  the Marble Freedom Trust.   The guy who delivered that money into the Marble Freedom Trust was  also famous for his support for the Heartland Institute, which is  really just an epic climate denial crowd, to the point where one of  their more notorious acts was to put up a billboard equating climate  scientists to the Unabomber. That is the quality of the debate about  climate change that the Heartland Institute brought, and the  billionaire who has teed up the Marble Freedom Trust was a prime backer  of all of that and, indeed, had his CFO go on the board of the  Heartland Institute to try to keep the thing afloat so that it could be  moderately well managed and continue to do its great work of billboards  that compared the climate scientists to the Unabomber.   So that is where we are. These guys are deep into this anti-ESG push.  The dark money operation that I talk about on the floor all the time is  behind this ESG thing just the way it is behind the capture of the  Court and just the way it is behind the whole climate denial operation  that has stymied progress on climate in this building.   A few billion dollars here and there in politics turns out to deliver  a lot, and the fossil fuel industry desperately wants to stop people  who have fiduciary obligations from telling the truth about climate  risks to their clients--to the people whom they have that fiduciary  risk to--and this is the pitch to do that so that there is a legal hook  to stop people from meeting their fiduciary obligations by disclosing  real-life, actual climate risk now that it is so clear and so immediate  that it is now obliged to be disclosed for due diligence.   Let us vote no on H.J. Res. 30, and let's do more than that. Let's  call this out as a phony op. This is a scheme, run by the fossil fuel  industry, to try to solve the problem it has--that its emissions  problems are now so real that fiduciaries have to address it. That is  the problem. A fake operation funded by billions of dollars of dark  money through all of these slimy corporations and entities that doesn't  disclose who their real donors are and through all of these political  operatives that get their funding from the fossil fuel industry--that  is not something we want to encourage in this country. We have had  enough of the public not being listened to. In this case, actual  customers, actual clients, are not being listened to because of this  pressure.   Let's call this out. Let's put an end to it. This is not healthy.  There is something rotten in Denmark.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, here I am again with my trusty,  battered chart by my side, this time here to talk about the looming  costs and economic risks of climate upheaval.   Almost exactly 5 years ago, I sent around a binder about this thick  to all  [[Page S559]]  of my Senate colleagues in which I compiled some of the most compelling  warnings about the looming climate economic crisis. I have just  recently updated it and shared it with all of the Budget Committee  members. It is now more like this thick, as the warnings just keep  piling up.   These warnings come from central bankers, economists, asset managers,  insurance companies, investment banks, credit rating agencies, and  leading management consultants--folks with a lot of credibility when it  comes to economics, finance, corporate risk, and their effects on  government spending and revenues--folks who often have a fiduciary  obligation to get this right.   The Budget Committee has started to dig into these warnings. We have  just held the first two of a series of hearings on climate impacts to  our Federal budget. Our second hearing, held earlier today, explored  warnings of crashes in coastal property values amid rising seas and  more powerful storms.   One of our witnesses was Kate Michaud, the town manager of Warren,  RI.   And next time we will spell ``Rhode Island'' correctly.   Warren is the smallest town in the smallest county of our smallest  State. There, like in many small coastal towns all around the country,  in Georgia and elsewhere, the problems are real and they are immediate.  She testified that some homes in Warren have seen their value drop by  one-third because of flood risk.   And sea level rise is projected to permanently flood some coastal  portions of Warren over the next decade. This is mapping that is done  by the State of Rhode Island that shows the projected flooding zone of  Warren, and all of these are existing buildings and homes that will be  inundated.   Warren is not alone. Zillow's real estate database has identified  over 4,800 homes in Rhode Island that would be under water with a  projected 6 feet of sea level rise, which is projected for Rhode  Island. That is nearly $3 billion in home values.   And Rhode Island is not alone. The United States has nearly 13,000  miles of coastline. Forty percent of our population lives along the  coast. More than a trillion dollars' worth of residential and  commercial real estate is coastal. And for most American households,  their greatest wealth is their home.   First Street Foundation, whose CEO testified at this morning's  hearing, examines flood risk. It is what they do. Their examination  shows significantly increasing risks to residential properties over the  next 30 years. And Rhode Island does its own flood projections, and  they show similar risks.   Just 2 weeks ago, a study found real estate exposed to flood risks  was overvalued--i.e., the flood risk had not yet been taken into  account--by up to a staggering $237 billion, with the worst property  overvaluations along coasts; and, of course, Florida, with all of its  coasts, is the prime liability. The study warns that, as a result,  coastal real estate values may plummet and that can cascade into  systemic risks for the mortgage market.   Freddie Mac, the mortgage giant, has made very similar warnings about  coastal property values. Their former chief economist, who also  testified at this morning's hearing, has said:         The economic losses and social disruption . . . are likely       to be greater in total than those experienced in the housing       crisis and Great Recession.    Anybody who was here through that 2008 housing crisis and the  recession that followed knows how sobering that warning is, and it  comes from that collapse in coastal property values triggered by  difficulty in getting mortgage and insurance, with its 30-year lead  time, collapsing values and then cascading out into the rest of the  economy.   Sea levels are rising, and the rate is accelerating. That is a  scientific fact. As homes and businesses in coastal communities face  more frequent sunny-day flooding and wetter and more violent ocean  storms, more homes will be under water, both literally and  figuratively. Insurance will become more expensive and harder to find.  Mortgages depend on insurance. So lending will suffer. Coastal  communities will become harder places to live and work, and real estate  values and local tax bases will decline.   Moody's is already looking at local municipal bonds in this light. In  emergencies, coastal communities will turn to the Federal Government  for financial assistance. Federal flood insurance costs will rise. For  home mortgages, banks and insurance companies will look ahead 30 years.  So, long before the ocean laps at physical doorsteps, those markets  will be hit, and the effect in real estate markets across the country  will bring harsh consequences for families and their financial  stability.   I used the term ``systemic risk'' earlier. Systemic risk is a bland  term used by economists. What it refers to is anything but bland. It  refers to the massively destabilizing events that can cascade out and  trigger general economic recession. Think of the mortgage crisis in  2008. Twenty percent of household wealth was wiped out in 2 years.  Unemployment soared, and government revenues were reduced for a decade.   There is broad concern here about deficits. Well, deficits tripled as  a result of that 2008 shock. According to CBO, revenues fell by $4.4  trillion, and projected spending rose by $800 billion to fund the  recovery, for a net debt increase total of over $5 trillion from that  event.   Well, we should see the writing on the wall when it comes to climate  risks. At our first hearing, Dr. Mark Carney, who has been Governor-- their phrase for CEO--of the Bank of England and of the Bank of Canada,  gave us the scale of the risk.   He testified that ``over the balance of this century, climate change  could reduce the level of global GDP per capita by 10 to 20 percent  without efforts to limit warming.'' That would be ``the equivalent of a  decade of no economic growth.''   Bob Litterman, an economist who spent more than two decades managing  risk for Goldman Sachs as its chief risk officer, now chair of the  Climate-Related Market Risk Subcommittee at the U.S. Commodity Futures  Trading Commission, testified:         We are on track for somewhere between 2.2 and 3.4 degrees       of warming by 2100, which would result in GDP losses of       somewhere between 2.6 and 4 percent. That's more than our       recent annual growth rate, implying the possibility of long-      term negative growth as climate change worsens.    This is not a future problem. Some of these warned-of risks are  already upon us. Already, climate-related natural disasters increase  Federal spending on disaster assistance, flood insurance, crop  insurance, and other programs. Already, extreme heat and drought force  western farmers to leave land unplanted and reduce livestock herds.  Droughts around the world already hit cotton production, raising costs  on production like medical gauze and cloth diapers. Insurance prices  are already through the roof--in Florida and Louisiana, hammered by  increasingly violent hurricanes, and out West, under siege from more  intense and frequent wildfires.   This will certainly get worse--much worse, particularly if warming  exceeds 1.5 degrees Celsius. We are on a bad trajectory. Think of  coastal cities flooded with water and Southwest cities that can't get  water. Think of a Salt Lake that is virtually gone and blowing dust  over Salt Lake City. Deloitte--the management consulting firm--predicts  that the differential between being responsible and reckless about  climate could sum to more than $220 trillion globally between now and  2070.   We use big numbers around here a lot. A $220-trillion swing in the  global economy is massive. And Deloitte is not exactly a green outfit.   There is some good news here. By acting now, we can minimize the  damage and costs to households, businesses, and our economy--and there  are huge economic opportunities from investing in climate action. The  Inflation Reduction Act invested $370 billion to create good-paying  jobs and new economic opportunities. It will lower energy costs for  families and small businesses and accelerate the transition to clean  energy.   Looking ahead, a well-designed carbon border adjustment--an idea  which has bipartisan support--would significantly curb greenhouse gas  emissions in the United States and overseas and boost American heavy  industry against our Chinese competitors and reshore American  manufacturing jobs lost in past decades.   Let me close on tipping points. Tipping points are thresholds that  change  [[Page S560]]  the trajectory of harm, potentially dramatically. One example is the  tipping point where warming will cause the Greenland ice sheet to  collapse and melt. We don't know exactly where that threshold lies.  That is one of the dangers of our climate experiment. But science  suggests it is between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius of warming.   Well, folks, we have already warmed 1.1 degrees. So the distance to  1.5 or 2 degrees is pretty short.   If we lose the Greenland ice sheet, it is 22 feet of sea level rise.  So we would do well to avoid these tipping points, to avoid the  systemic economic risks, to behave prudently and responsibly, and to  take advantage of a stronger and more stable clean energy economy that  beckons. It is long past time to wake up.   I yield the floor.
