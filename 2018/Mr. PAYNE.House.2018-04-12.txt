 Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to honor Bishop Cleveland  Blash, Jr., on the occasion of his 44th year of serving God and the  people of Newark.   Bishop Blash began his long service when he was ordained in the late  1970s. He faithfully served churches in Connecticut, Florida, and New  York, before being assigned to St. Paul Sounds of Praise PFM Church in  Newark, New Jersey.   Bishop Blash is truly a community leader. He is the founder of  Operation CLEANN, which stands for Citizens Looking to Empower a New  Neighborhood. He has given more than 10,000 hours of labor to the  community around West Side Park in Newark, New Jersey.   Bishop Blash also created a scholarship committee, founded the annual  U.S. Marines Toys for Tots Drive in his neighborhood, and created a  communitywide Thanksgiving dinner, among other great deeds.   Last weekend, Bishop Blash celebrated his 68th birthday and 44th year  in the ministry. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Bishop  Blash for his lifetime of service to his community.                            ____________________
