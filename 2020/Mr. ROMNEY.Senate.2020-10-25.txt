 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the  confirmation of Judge Amy Coney Barrett as an Associate Justice of the  Supreme Court. She is exceptionally intelligent, academically astute,  and impeccably credentialed. She has a record of sound opinions and  temperament as a judge on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Her  life experiences provide her with valuable perspective and evident  wisdom. Perhaps most important, she is a woman of unquestionable  character and integrity, the presence of which is essential to our  Nation, as the confidence of the Court itself is in the balance. I will  be honored to vote to confirm her nomination.   Mr. President, I also rise to address my concern regarding the  division and contempt for others that is growing among many of our  citizens. The causes of this malady are many and varied, but one to  which I draw attention is the declining trust held by the citizenry in  our many institutions. A democratic republic is highly dependent upon  the confidence of its people in the institutions that lie at its  foundation. These includes churches, schools, governments at all  levels, the press, corporations, markets, and most relevant today, the  justice system and the courts. Absent public confidence in these  institutions, a democratic republic will not thrive or perhaps endure.   Fortunately, the Supreme Court enjoys a great deal of respect from  the American people. Unfortunately, the third branch may be one of the  few institutions of our democratic republic that is not experiencing a  collapse in public trust.   Our churches have been diminished by scandal and by politicization.   Trust in local law enforcement has fallen as we have witnessed some  officers, who have sworn to protect our communities, endanger the lives  of citizens. While this is particularly true for citizens of color, the  demonstrations by millions of Americans are evidence that the distrust  is broadly shared.   Trust in the FBI and the intelligence community, long admired for  their integrity and professionalism, has withered with the attacks by  politicians from both parties, though admittedly my party has been the  more vocal. What a message it sends when the President accepts the word  of the Russian President rather than the conclusions of our  intelligence agencies.   Even the CDC and the FDA have fallen in credibility, due both to  inevitable human error and to blistering political attacks.   The free press is not only protected by the Constitution; it is  critical to the preservation of democracy. Here, too, charges of ``fake  news'' and claims that the press is the enemy of the people--worsened  by the media's constant amplification of divisiveness--have so  diminished the trust many Americans have in the media that they instead  believe bizarre, anonymous conspiracy theories on the internet.   Now, more than at any other time during my lifetime, it is essential  the Supreme Court retain the trust of the Nation. It may be one of the  very few, if not the only, of the institutions in which the great  majority of Americans have confidence. That is why Judge Barrett's  integrity, wisdom, and commitment to the rule of law is so important:  She will be critical to the preservation of the public's perception of  the legitimacy of the Court.   Judge Barrett wrote in a Texas Law Review:         If the Court's opinions change with its membership, public       confidence in the Court as an institution might decline. Its       members might be seen as partisan rather than impartial and       case law as fueled by power rather than reason.    Consideration of institutional legitimacy has long been a factor in  the Court's deliberations. But I would argue that this factor should be  given even greater weight today, as so many of our other institutions  are diminished and under attack. This would be particularly true were  the Court called upon to decide a matter that would determine the  outcome of a Presidential  [[Page S6549]]  election. In my view, it is of paramount importance that such a  decision follow the law and the Constitution where it leads, regardless  of the outcome, and thereby be beyond reproach, clearly nonpolitical,  and preferably unanimous.   The Senate will soon send Judge Barrett to the highest Court in the  land. I am confident that she is up to the measure of the times in  which we now live. May God bless her and her family as they begin this  chapter of service to our Nation.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
