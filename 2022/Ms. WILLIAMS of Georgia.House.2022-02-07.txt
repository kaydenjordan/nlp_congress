 Madam Speaker, I often say that I am  operating in an institution and system that was not designed by or for  people who look like me. Today, however, I celebrate a pioneer who  wanted to change the system so that it would work for all the people-- Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm.   I stand proudly on the shoulders of the first Black woman in  Congress. She entered Congress ``unbossed and unbought'' and brought  this energy to each of her seven terms. She paved the way for me to be  here as the first Black woman to represent the people of Georgia's  Fifth District in Congress.   We are the next generation of Black excellence because of Shirley  Chisholm. As we face trying times, we must remember that we stand on  the brink of progress. The courage of Shirley Chisholm paved the way  for Black women in Congress to fight for a future that our children can  believe in:   Voting rights regardless of our ZIP code.   Lasting investments in our HBCUs.   The Black Maternal Health Momnibus to end the Black maternal  mortality crisis.   The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act to end police brutality.   My Abolition Amendment legislation that will close a loophole in the  Thirteenth Amendment and truly end slavery in America.   As we reflect on how far we have come this Black History Month, I am  looking forward to the future we are building together because of the  path set by Congresswoman Chisholm.   However, we have a long way to go. The halls of Congress are full of  portraits and statues of mostly men, while depictions of women are  scattered here and there. Images of trailblazers like Shirley Chisholm  and Rosa Parks remind me of the imbalance of women lining the halls,  and I am determined to change that.   May we always remember Congresswoman Chisholm for her tenacity, her  boldness, and her guts. That is what we will need to ensure that our  story continues.   Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Madam Speaker, today I rise in honor of the  first African American woman to serve in the United States Congress and  the first woman to run for President of the United States, the  Honorable Shirley Chisholm. As we celebrate Black history month, we  must also commemorate our sheroes for their contribution to protecting  and preserving our precious democracy.   I, including many of my colleagues here in Congress, stand on the  shoulders of this courageous woman who was a champion for progressive  policy that sought to improve the lives of society's most vulnerable  both internationally and domestically. In particular, she fought  against the oppressive Apartheid Regime in South Africa and the Vietnam  War. In addition, she was instrumental in the movement for women's  rights and the poor.   The Honorable Shirley Chisholm understood the plight of the poor and  working-class in this country. The reality is that there is no American  Dream without economic equity. I am committed to continuing her  activism in addressing the wealth gap. The average Black household has  $24k in wealth, whereas the average White family has $188K in wealth.  Approximately 30 percent of my District's residents live on under $75K  a year, while 21% live under $30K.   To address these systemic challenges, it is vital to ensure that  Congress resembles the diversity that exists in this nation. However,  in states like mine, the Governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, is  committed to disfranchising voters through gerrymandering in violation  of the Voting Rights Act and the Constitution. Ron DeSantis took the  unprecedented and anti-democratic step of proposing his own  Congressional map for the state of Florida. Under DeSantis' proposed  plan, two Congressional seats currently held by African-American  representatives elected overwhelmingly by working Floridians would lose  their seats.   This is yet another attack on Floridians' sacred right to vote and a  blatantly undemocratic  [[Page H1006]]  power grab. We believe that voters should choose their representatives,  not the other way around. By injecting partisanship into the  redistricting process, DeSantis is attempting to dilute minority  representation and undermine the true will of Florida voters. He is a  threat to our democracy. My colleagues and I will continue to fight  against his racist and discriminatory proposal.   The Honorable Shirley Chisholm once said, ``I want to be remembered  as a woman . . . who dared to be a catalyst of change.'' I hope that  her legacy and commitment to service will inspire us all to continue  defending the United States Constitution and fight tirelessly to  improve the lives of our constituents through progressive policy.                            ____________________
