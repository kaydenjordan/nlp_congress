 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize some  incredible students from Iowa's Second Congressional District.   On Saturday, March 12, the Central DeWitt Special Olympics basketball  team earned a silver medal and the Sabers unified dance team earned a  gold medal at the Mid-Winter Tournament in Iowa City.   For the last few years, Special Olympics Iowa has put on the Mid- Winter Tournament as part of their ongoing series of events to showcase  the amazing skills and talents of our athletes.   The Mid-Winter Tournament sees competition in basketball, basketball  skills, cheerleading, gymnastics, and powerlifting. Healthy Athletes  screenings are also provided to athletes by healthcare professionals  for dental, hearing, overall health and fitness, and more.   Organizations like Special Olympics strive to create a better world  by fostering the acceptance and inclusion of all people. Through the  power of sports, these athletes discover new strengths, skills,  confidence, abilities, fulfillment, and success. They also learn the  values of hard work, sportsmanship, perseverance, teamwork, and, most  importantly, having fun.   Special Olympics has changed the lives of so many amazing athletes,  and I am proud to have them in Iowa. But I am even prouder of the  awesome athletes from Central DeWitt who are already making their mark  on the world. Go Sabers.                            ____________________
