 Madam President, I rise today to recognize the  city of Minot. It has been 60 years since the U.S. Air Force and Minot  began working together to establish the Minot Air Force Base in  northwestern North Dakota. This was in the late 1950s, when Minot  leaders stepped up to buy the land where the air base now stands.  Throughout the ensuing decades of growth and change in the Minot  community and the base itself, this cooperation has continued.   This year, the Air Force Global Strike Command has recognized this  solid partnership by awarding its Barksdale Trophy to the city of  Minot. This honor is given to the community providing the most  outstanding support to one of its bases. Minot Air Force Base's 5th  Bomb Wing and 91st Missile Wing support the Air Force Global Strike  Command. The trophy is awarded by Shreveport and Bossier, LA, which are  home to the command and the Barksdale Air Force Base.   The Minot Area Chamber of Commerce submitted the city's nomination  for this award and in it detailed many notable projects and  partnerships over the years. This includes a community auction, which  for 30 years has raised $800,000-plus for programs supporting the  morale of those at the base. Another 30-year event is a Military Ball,  bringing airmen and their spouses and area residents together for a  special evening. A favorite holiday tradition is the thousands of home- baked cookies delivered to airmen who are spending their first year in  Minot and are unable to be home for Christmas. Those stationed at the  base and their families reciprocate by volunteering to help with  Minot's many programs and annual events, including the North Dakota  State Fair and the Norsk Hostfest.   In North Dakota, we take pride in the two Air Force bases within our  borders that help to safeguard world peace. The support we give to  those who call North Dakota home while stationed at these bases is not  done for recognition nor awards. Yet, receiving the Barksdale Trophy is  a well-deserved nod to North Dakota's legendary hospitality and its  steadfast support of the Minot Air Force Base.   Mr. President, I congratulate the residents of the Minot area for  being awarded this prestigious Barksdale Trophy. On behalf of all North  Dakotans, I thank them for their support of our Nation's military and  for welcoming those who are called to serve in this noble  mission.                            ____________________
