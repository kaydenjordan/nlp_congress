 Mr. President, today I am reintroducing, along with Senator  Grassley, the Government Settlement Transparency and Reform Act. This  bill closes a loophole in the Tax Code that allows corporations to  claim tax writeoffs for payments made at the direction of the  government to settle investigations into illegal and abusive corporate  behavior.   Corporations accused of illegal activity routinely settle out of  court with government agencies because it allows all parties to avoid  the time, expense, and uncertainty of going to trial. While there is  nothing wrong with settlements that correct wrongful corporate  practices and compensate for the resulting harm caused by a  corporation, the Tax Code often permits offending companies to claim a  business tax deduction for any portion of a settlement that is not paid  directly to the government as a penalty or fine for a violation of the  law. The Tax Code on this point is vague, and big businesses exploit  this by characterizing settlement penalties as tax-deductible business  expenses.   Illegal corporate behavior is not an ordinary business activity, and  it shouldn't be subsidized by taxpayers. Yet, according to a 2015 study  by U.S. Public Interest Research Group, PIRG, corporate settlements  over a single 3-year period totaled nearly $80 billion, and  corporations could claim business deductions for at least $48 billion  of that amount. Moreover, there is no consistent, transparent way to  track how these settlements can and will be treated by businesses for  tax purposes.   The Reed-Grassley bill addresses these problems by amending the Tax  [[Page S2177]]  Code to require the government and the settling party to reach clear  agreements on how settlement payments should be treated for tax  purposes. It also clarifies which settlement payments are punitive and  therefore nondeductible. It increases transparency by requiring the  government to file a return at the time of settlement that accurately  states the tax treatment of amounts to be paid by offending businesses.  Last Congress, it was estimated that this legislation would raise $218  million in revenue over a ten-year budget window.   When a major corporate scandal breaks national news, Rhode Islanders  and all Americans deserve to know that Federal regulators are  protecting their interests by handing down punishments that deter  future illegal and abusive business practices. That deterrent effect is  undermined if corporations can claim a deduction for any penalty and  build the cost of breaking the law into their business models.   I want to thank Senator Grassley for working with me again on this  legislation and for being a champion for reform in this area. I urge  our colleagues to join us by cosponsoring this legislation and seeking  its passage.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am reintroducing, along with Senator  Grassley, the Government Settlement Transparency and Reform Act.
