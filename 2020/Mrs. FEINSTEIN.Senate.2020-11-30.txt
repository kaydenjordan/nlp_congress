 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and  pay tribute to the honorable service of Dr. Timothy P. White, who will  be retiring as chancellor of the California State University, CSU.   Chancellor Timothy P. White has served as the California State  University's seventh chancellor since December 2012. His leadership of  the Nation's largest and most diverse university system--23 campuses,  482,000 students, 53,000 faculty and staff, and 3.8 million alumni--has  been characterized by his heartfelt and unwavering dedication to the  students.   In fact, it was that commitment to student success that led  Chancellor White in 2015 to launch the ``Graduation Initiative 2025,''  an ambitious systemwide effort to increase graduation rates and to  eliminate equity and opportunity gaps between underserved students and  their peers. The initiative has already resulted in record numbers of  baccalaureate degrees earned.   Further, Chancellor White has been a strong advocate for diversity  and gender equity, ensuring campus leaders, faculty, and staff reflect  the communities they serve. In July 2018, CSU achieved national  recognition for having 12 female campus presidents--representing more  than half of the CSU's campuses--quadrupling the number of female  presidents from the time Chancellor White assumed office and far  surpassing the national average of 30 percent female leadership at  higher education institutions.   A caring and forward-thinking leader, he has been committed to  compassionate action on behalf of Dreamers and has spearheaded efforts  to support title IX rights and to prevent sexual assault on campus.  Chancellor White commissioned the first-ever study of homelessness and  hunger among university students and has instituted innovative programs  to help students meet their basic needs. He has also worked to ensure  that the CSU shines as a leader on environmental sustainability and  climate change education and policy.   The COVID-19 pandemic has proven to be a difficult challenge for  higher education, but Chancellor White has displayed bold leadership,  delaying his  [[Page S7108]]  planned retirement to ensure steady decision making that has not only  allowed the CSU to sustain its high-quality instruction and operations  but also helped the university to thrive, with record-setting numbers  of degrees awarded in spring 2020 and the university's largest ever  student body enrolled in the fall.   A clarity of vision, a heartfelt and relentless focus on student  success, and an emphasis on collaborative leadership, combined with a  ready sense of humor and a warmth and generosity of spirit, have  defined Chancellor White's tenure.   I applaud Dr. White's lifetime of service to the betterment of our  State and its students, and I wish him the best as he begins this next  chapter of his life.                            ____________________
