 Madam President, I ask to have printed in the  Record some of the finalist essays written by Vermont High School  students as part of the 10th annual ``State of the Union'' essay  contest conducted by my office.   The material follows:            Madelyn Trimpi, Woodstock Union High School, Junior         Plastic is destroying the earth and a federal law to       restrict single-use plastics must be developed. Plastic is a       huge contributor to climate change and greenhouse gas       emissions that are warming the atmosphere. An article called       ``How Plastics Contribute to Climate Change'' by Brooke       Bauman from Yale Climate Connections states ``plastic       originates as fossil fuels and emits greenhouse gasses from       cradle to grave.'' At the beginning of its life cycle, gas       and oil are fracked from the ground, then made into plastic       releasing harmful pollutants like CO2 and nitrogen oxide that       get stuck in the atmosphere and warm the earth. Along with       greenhouse gas emissions, plastic pollutes the ecosystems by       simply entering and never leaving. In the same article by       Yale, scientists state ``plastics can break down into smaller       pieces called microplastics through biodegradation or       exposure to the sun, heat or water. These microplastics       scatter to all comers of the globe and even to the depths of       the oceans. Toxic chemicals can bind microplastics and create       poison pills that marine animals eat'' When a foreign       substance enters the ecosystem, it threatens all aspects of       the life cycle; Including humans.        Biodiversity is the root of life on earth and when exposed       to something like plastic, everything feels an effect. For       example, research shows that plastic has entered into the       human body most likely through food like fish and other       meats. Animals eat the microplastics thinking they are       nutrients; we eat the fish, therefore consuming the plastic       in them. This can lead to many  [[Page S4345]]       health issues. Studies show that an average of 20 particles       of microplastic has been found in 10 grams of human stool.       ``If our findings are remotely representative, annual       microplastic consumption could exceed several hundred       thousand [particles],'' authors of the Environmental Science       and Technology concludes. Even in cases when physical       plastics pose little to no risk to human health, potentially       harmful chemicals are added to plastics to modify appearance       or functionality. Some of these chemicals include BPA and       phthalates which have each been found to disrupt hormones in       humans. BPA has been linked to increasing the risk of birth       defects, metabolic diseases, and other health problems. Among       other health risks, phthalate exposure has been found to       reduce testosterone levels in male fetuses.        Already, states including California, Connecticut,       Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, New York, Oregon and Vermont--have       successfully banned single-use plastic bags. In addition to       banning plastic bags, Vermont's SB 113 will place       restrictions on single-use straws and polystyrene containers.       These few states are leading the initiative in a fight       against an indestructible material. When it comes to plastic,       there are plenty of realistic alternatives that we should be       enforcing instead of fighting against it. Developing and       making these alternative products affordable and more readily       available is a necessary focus in working toward a more       healthy environment. Plastic is a major contributor to       climate change. A national ban on single-use plastic is a       simple start and necessary step toward saving the future of       our planet.          Griffin Waryas, Bellows Falls Union High School, Senior         Ninety-Seven years ago, Frederick Banting discovered       insulin. However, he decided not to put his name on the       patent; he believed it was against the Hippocratic Oath to       profit at the expense of patients. So, his team sold the       patent to the University of Toronto for a dollar, in hopes       that anyone who needed the medicine could afford it. Yet,       today, ninety-seven years since the patent was sold for one       dollar, people are dying because they cannot afford the       insulin they need to survive.        Nicole Smith-Holt's son Alec died because of this. When his       26th birthday hit, he was no longer covered by his parent's       insurance, and his monthly insulin costs skyrocketed to a       staggering $1,300 a month. Alec could no longer afford his       medicine and passed away shortly after.        Unfortunately, this isn't an incredibly rare case. The       costs of the most popular types of insulin have tripled over       the past decade, the average cost per month has risen to $450       a month, and 1 in 4 diabetes patients now either is forced to       take partial doses or skip over their life-saving medicine.       Unfortunately, Insulin is not the only drug being used as a       profit machine by corporate monsters.        In 2007, Mylan bought the rights to the EpiPen device. At       that time, the cost of a set of two injectors was $94. A       little over a decade later, the cost is over $700. And with       3.6 million prescriptions being written last year, and the       net price to make a set being $60, Mylan made about 2.3       BILLION dollars in profit. They know people will buy it       regardless of price because they have to. This leaves the       life of uninsured, poor individuals in the balance.        To fix this, these large pharmaceutical companies need to       be trust busted. They are buying off competition and abusing       the broken American health care system to pad their pockets       at the expense of the working class. Not to mention, they       have teamed up with the insurance companies to ensure profit       at every comer. While these companies are businesses and       should be allowed to operate as such, there comes a time when       the government must protect us from them. As the great Teddy       Roosevelt once said, ``We draw the line against misconduct,       not against wealth.''        We need to employ the trust-busting laws set up in this       nation to prevent these monopolies from preying on our       citizens. To do this, we need to take the corruption out of       Washington. In the time between January 1st, 2017 and October       16th, 2018, 34 lawmakers received at least $100,000 including       the House Republican majority leader. Drug companies should       be banned from funding campaigns to prevent the purchasing of       their economic safety. Another law that should be employed is       a Sensible Drug Pricing Act. This would allow the companies       to continue to make money but also allow poor Americans       access to drugs that are relatively cheap to make, with a       control on the pricing.          Kyle Wilkin, Missisquoi Valley Union High School, Junior         Every day people experience struggle of some sort; they       struggle in a class or have to work harder than anticipated       to complete a goal, but some people struggle more than       others. Working hard, people may find it impossible to       improve; there may be something blocking their way or       restricting their ability to complete a task. In situations       like that people search for help; they turn to the people       around them hoping to find support, so oftentimes people       either find support, or they find indifference. When people's       basic needs aren't met, they are left to fend for themselves.       In the United States there are a total of 552,830 people were       experiencing homelessness on a single night in 2018. People       who are homeless are in need of people to support them.        The first potential solution could be to allocate more       money to fund social workers to help homeless people. Working       with people who are homeless, social workers will be able to       help them find housing. According to the Congressional Budget       Office, in 2018 $623 billion were spent on defense; if some       amount of that money was given to the comparatively low       amount of $93 billion spent on education, training,       employment, and social services combined, more people could       work with those who are homeless to find housing. By making       more social workers available, people who are homeless will       be able to more easily access support.        The second solution would be to support Housing First.       Housing First is centered on the belief that everyone can       achieve stability in permanent housing directly from       homelessness and that stable housing is the foundation for       pursuing other health and social services goals. Housing       First is a way to find people, who are in need of it,       permanent housing while giving them the support they need. By       helping people find permanent housing, they are able to       continue their lives and pursue goals that will not be       available if they did not have housing.        The third potential solution is making mental health       facilities more available for homeless people. According to a       survey done in 2015 by The Department of Housing and Urban       Development, 25 percent of the American homeless--140,000       individuals--were seriously mentally ill at any given point       in time. Forty-five percent of the homeless--250,000       individuals--had any mental illness. A serious mental illness       is defined as a disruption in normal thinking, feeling, mood,       behavior, interpersonal interactions, or daily functioning by       Merriam-Webster. By making mental health facilities more       available and destigmatized for homeless people, they will be       better equipped to live and be successful on their own.       Homeless people need thy help and support of those around       them; by giving people who are homeless options and the       support they need they will be able to start to support       themselves and find permanent.                            ____________________
