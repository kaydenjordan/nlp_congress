 Mr. President, this weekend, families all across America  will sit down in their dining rooms for a holiday meal, and they are  going to have to pay more for that meal than they ever have before.  They are going to have to pay more for bread and more for butter,  potatoes, eggs, vegetables. Literally, almost everything that is going  to be on America's tables this holiday season is going to be more  expensive than it has ever been.   Although there are several reasons for that phenomenon, somewhere at  the very top is the profound labor shortage that exists in American  agriculture. Today, America's farmers and ranchers are short more than  100,000 workers all across this country to plant seeds, to pick  berries, to raise cattle, and to do the hard, essential work of feeding  this country.   It is why growers all across America are banging down the doors of  this Capitol, pleading with us to fix the broken H-2A system for  farmers.   It is obvious to everybody who has had anything to do with this  system that it is completely broken. There is no argument that can be  made that it is not. To start, the H-2A program is not even open to  year-round jobs. That is just the beginning of the trouble. That is  every dairy in America who has to milk their cows two or three times a  day, including the holidays. It is  [[Page S7284]]  every mushroom grower, livestock producer, horse breeder that needs  those year-round visas.   The H-2A program is also hopelessly and embarrassingly outdated. To  qualify for a visa, this ancient program requires farmers to put a  physical advertisement in a local newspaper, if there is a local  newspaper, if they can find one. They can't advertise online. That is  prohibited in the year 2022.   And you have to reapply for the H-2A visa every single year, which is  an incredible burden on farmers and on farm workers. It is the last  thing they need.   And, finally, the existing program does nothing to protect farmers  from dramatic spikes in labor costs from year to year. They can't plan  for the future. They have no idea what kind of uncertainty they are  going to have to deal with when it comes to wages.   I am thinking of farmers like Bruce Talbott, who grows peaches in  Palisade, CO. The labor shortage hurts Bruce in two ways: One, he  doesn't have enough people to pick everything he grows, so he is forced  to leave money on the table every single year; and, second, this labor  shortage is driving up labor costs, which are now 80 percent of the  total costs of his operation. And we are seeing this all over the  country.   You see it right here: H-2A wages up almost 50 percent in the last 10  years. By the way, this is all wages down here. And this is what has  happened to wages in farming and ranching in this country. It has grown  so much faster than the rest of the workforce, and it is pushing family  farms and ranches to the edge of a cliff, and, sadly, a lot of them are  going over that cliff or considering moving their operations from the  United States to Mexico.   Since 2007, America has lost 190,000 farms, almost all of them small  family farms. That is nearly 10 percent of the farms in this country,  and some industries, like dairy, have been hit even harder. Between  2003 and 2020, the number of dairy farms in America fell by over half,  by 55 percent.   That is not just bad for dairy farms. It is bad for the communities  that they are in and that they support, and it is bad for this country.  If we don't deal with this, this country is on track, believe it or  not, to become dependent on foreign food imports.   You can see it here. This is the export line, and here is the  projected import line. We are right at the point where we could be a  net importer of food for the first time in my lifetime, maybe the first  time in forever. I don't know.   I don't want us to rely on other nations to feed America. We have the  most productive agriculture sector in the world. And yet, because of  this labor problem, we are going to accept the idea that we should be a  net importer of food from other countries? That is terrible for our  economic security, for our food security, and, I would argue, for our  national security as well.   Just on the economic point, Colorado's agriculture generates over $40  billion a year for our State's economy. Nationwide, there are nearly 20  million jobs in food and agriculture-related industries. That is 1 in  every 10 jobs in this country. And over $1 trillion of our GDP is  agriculture.   And I think people--especially people who don't work in agriculture,  don't think about agriculture, don't live in maybe a rural area--they  tend to forget that literally every single sector of our economy  depends on agriculture. You can't have an economy without food. There  has never been one.   So when we talk about the crisis in American agriculture that I am  here on this floor to address today, we have to understand that the  stakes could not be higher. At the same time we have that issue, there  are hundreds of thousands of undocumented farm workers living in the  shadows in this country. These men and women are breaking their backs  every single day to feed America--women like Lulu Guerrero, who lives  in Weld County, CO.   She gets up at 3 o'clock in the morning every single morning to plant  crops like watermelons and tomatoes and pumpkins. She has been doing  that for 20 years. I have met people in my State who have been doing it  for 30 years, who have been doing it for 40 years--with no status, with  no protections, with no legal recourse if somebody tries to take  advantage of them--many of them with U.S. citizens who are their  children, people who can't go back and forth to see their relatives  south of the border when somebody dies.   This has been going on for decades, and we have ignored this problem  in part because the food keeps showing up somehow, miraculously, in our  grocery stores, as if somebody waved a wand to put it there.   These workers have broken their backs to support their families, to  support the United States of America, to make sure that we are fed. The  least we can do for our own country is to bring them out of the shadows  of the law.   The status quo is terrible for workers, it is terrible for businesses  and farms, and it is terrible for American families who have seen their  grocery bills go through the roof.   Look at this. I am not saying all of that is the labor shortage, but  a huge amount of that is the labor shortage. In the last year alone,  grocery prices have shot up about 12 percent--faster than at any time  in 40 years, as you can see from this slide.   And it is everything. I won't read all of these, but it is  everything. The price of apples is up 7 percent. The price of milk is  up 15 percent. And I guarantee you that is as a result of people unable  to find people to do that work. And eggs are up almost 50 percent.   These aren't nice to have. None of these are nice to have for the  American people. These are essential to a well-balanced meal to a  family being able to feed itself in America. That is why Congress has  to finally fix this H-2A program, and we have the opportunity to do it.   There is good news. We have a plan to fix it, the Affordable and  Secure Food Act. Our proposal builds on legislation. This is an  important point. You know, sometimes people over here blame the House  of Representatives for not getting done what needs to get done for this  country. In this case, they have passed this bill twice--or a version  of this bill twice--in a bipartisan fashion. There were Republican  Members of Congress over here last week imploring Republican Members of  the Senate to please pass this bill, which from the grower's  perspective, by the way, is an improvement over the bill that passed in  the House.   The Farm Workers Union and many of the growers in this country have  come together to support this legislation, and there is a good reason  why it had bipartisan support in the House. And now, from the  perspective of the other side of the aisle, in many ways, it is  actually a better bill. Our bill opens the H-2A program to year-round  jobs for the first time ever, and that is going to mean dairy farmers  and mushroom growers can finally access the labor that they need, that  they can't access today.   It creates wage certainty for farmers, saving them $23 billion over  the next 12 years. I want to say that again: $23 billion over the next  12 years, because now people are going to know what the wage increases  are going to look like. They are going to be predictable. They have  been agreed to. And that results in the savings of $23 billion. That is  $2 billion more over that period of time than the savings that were  achieved in the House bill for growers.    It requires E-Verify for farm workers nationwide. That is going to  help with the chaos at the border because people are now going to know  that they are not going to be able to come here and work illegally or  in an undocumented fashion in agriculture. So they will be less likely  to want to come.   And, finally, the bill establishes a pathway for undocumented farm  workers to apply for a green card after they have worked in agriculture  for at least a decade, passed a background check, and paid a penalty.   That is not amnesty. It is a recognition that anybody who has spent a  decade breaking their back to feed America should have the opportunity  to apply for lawful status.   Are we really going to accept as a definitional matter for this  country that we want fields filled with indentured servants in the  United States of America? Is that really where we are as a nation?   I don't think so. That is not what people in Colorado believe. No  matter what party they are in, they don't believe that. They think we  should fix this problem. They know how hard-  [[Page S7285]]  working the people are who are working in our fields and on our ranches  and at our dairies.   And that is why this bill is broadly supported not just in Colorado  but all across the country--by farmers and labor, by immigration  advocates, by businesses, by the American people. The vast majority of  the American people know we need to fix this.   And this morning--this isn't meant for anybody to read; I will get to  that in a moment--but over 240 groups from all across America,  including from New Mexico and from Colorado, sent a letter supporting  this bill. And I am not going to read all--I am tempted to read all  240, and there isn't anybody here tonight. But let me just give you a  sense of the breadth and the depth of the support of this bill.   The signers of this bill include the International Fresh Produce  Association, the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, the National  Milk Producers Federation, the National Farmers Union, the National  Thoroughbred Racing Association, the American Honey Producers  Association, the American Mushroom Institute, the American Sugarbeet  Growers Association, the California Apple Commission, the California  Association of Winegrape Growers, the Colorado Potato Legislative  Association.   Let me just tell you how hard it is for our potato producers in  Colorado to deliver that incredible crop when we finally have created a  situation where Mexico has to import our potatoes and can't just keep  them out, which is what they have been doing for years and years and  years, but they can't find folks to do the work. With the rise in input  costs that farmers and ranchers have to deal with, with the drought  that the Colorado potato growers are dealing with in the San Luis  Valley that I know the Presiding Officer knows so well--you know, you  would think that the least we could do is solve a problem that could be  solved. That is a major headache for them and for their colleagues all  across the country--like the Food Producers of Idaho, the Georgia  Blueberry Commission, the Idaho Hay and Forage Association, Land  O'Lakes, the Lone Star Milk Producers, the Maine Potato Board, the  Michigan Nursery & Landscape Association, the National Association of  State Departments of Agriculture.   As I read this list, do you know the one thing these people don't  have in common? They are not Democrats or Republicans. They are just  trying to deliver agricultural products to the American people. That is  all they are trying to do. And they live in red States, and they live  in blue States. They live all over the United States of America.   The National Pecan Federation, the New York Apple Association, the  North Carolina Potato Association, the Ohio Dairy Producers  Association, the Pennsylvania Vegetable Growers Association, Premium  Peanut, the Society of American Florists, the National Asparagus  Council, the United Dairy Farmers of Florida, the Utah Tart Cherry  Marketing Board, the Virginia Apple Growers Association, the Washington  State Tree Fruit Association, the Western Growers--and let me say  something about the Western Growers.   In 2013, I had the privilege of being part of the Gang of 8 that  negotiated the comprehensive immigration reform bill that passed this  floor with 68 votes. It was led on the Republican side by John McCain  and by Jeff Flake and Marco Rubio and Lindsey Graham. We had four  Democrats on our side. And, I have to say, in the 14 years I have been  in this place, that was the best work we have done as a body. We dealt  with this tough issue of immigration, and we dealt with all aspects of  it--11 million people who were undocumented had the chance to earn a  tough but fair pathway to citizenship in this country and come out of  the shadows.   We dealt with all the visa issues that have been driving the country  crazy all this year--business visas and agriculture visas.   I negotiated the agriculture provisions of this bill with Senator  Rubio and Senator Feinstein and Senator Hatch.   And we had the most progressive Dream Act that had ever been  conceived, much less voted on, as part of that bill.   It also had $40 billion border security in it. People forget that  part. Every single Democrat voted for a bill that had $40 billion of  border security. That is a heck of a lot more money than Donald Trump  ever spent to build his wall--that medieval device.   That $40 billion, which was a bipartisan effort, again, was meant to  spend--was meant to spend the money on 21st-century technology so we  could see every inch of the border so border crossings could actually  be much better policed than they are today.   I will come back to this later in the speech, but I am not somebody  who believes we should have a border that is not secure. I believe we  should have a secure border. I think we should. I think the American  people expect that we will. And I came to this floor--I think it was in  May--to say that I thought it was wrong for the Biden administration to  lift title 42 without a plan to address the border, and we are seeing  the effects of that, I think, today.   That shouldn't be an excuse for making lives more miserable for  people working in American agriculture. It shouldn't be an excuse for  driving food prices up for families. It shouldn't be an excuse for  compromising our economic independence, our food security, and our  national security.   We have in front of us a negotiated agreement that passed the House  of Representatives with a bipartisan vote. We have an agreement that  has been negotiated over here that is more generous to producers than  the one that passed the House of Representatives, and it has all this  support from all these people all over the country. I am not going to  read every single one of these names, but you get the idea. These are  people who probably, I would guess--many of them probably agree on  nothing politically, but they agree on this. They agree on this. Part  of that is because the situation they are confronting is so dire, and  part of it is because they have helped produce a good piece of  legislation that should get its chance.   (Mr. SCHATZ assumed the Chair.)   (Mr. HEINRICH assumed the Chair.)   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter with all these  names be printed in the Record so I can spare you listening to all the  names.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:       December 16, 2022.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Majority Leader.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Minority Leader.        Dear Majority Leader Schumer and Minority Leader McConnell:       The undersigned agricultural organizations urge the Senate to       support and pass Sen. Bennet's legislation, the Affordable       and Secure Food Act by the end of the year to address the       workforce crisis threatening farms across the United States.       The ongoing farm workforce crisis is hindering agricultural       production and contributing to food price inflation. We must       address this now, so our producers can continue to grow,       feed, clothe, and fuel our nation.        Sen. Bennets legislation provides stability for our       existing workers and makes key reforms to the H-2A program,       the visa program producers use to hire legal temporary       workers to supplement the available U.S. workforce. While the       bill is not perfect, it provides a significant step forward       by providing access to guest workers for many sectors in the       industry and will account for real cost savings for farmers       and consumers across the country. The House has passed       legislation on this issue, and it is now time for the Senate       to act before the end of the year. Without immediate action       by the Senate, the federal government's outdated policies,       insufficient domestic workforce, and a challenging guest       worker program are forcing many farmers to consider whether       they can continue in labor-intensive agriculture.        The country cannot afford for the Senate to miss this       opportunity to provide stability to both farmers and       farmworkers. We implore the Senate to pass legislation to       address our agricultural workforce challenges and ease       inflationary pressure on food costs for all Americans.

I will end with this. There is a vegetable farmer in  Brighton, CO, whom I have known for many, many years. His name is  Robert Sakata. His dad started Sakata Farms in 1944 after he was  released from a Japanese-American internment camp, where he was  interned during World War II. For almost 80 years, Sakata Farms has  been a critical ingredient of our Colorado economy--a staple of  Colorado, to put it in food terms, but when Robert visited my office in  the last couple of years, he handed me fliers advertising his equipment  for sale.   I said: Robert, why are you selling your implements? Why are you  doing that?   He loves what he does. He is so passionate about what he does. He is  so passionate about the people who work side by side with him to  produce incredible fruits and vegetables in Colorado. But he told me  that he was selling because he didn't have enough labor to harvest his  vegetable crop. Today, they no longer grow vegetables at Sakata Farms;  they only grow row crops. Is that the future we want for American  agriculture? It is not what we want in Colorado.   I have heard stories like that, like Robert Sakata's story, all over  my State and all over this country for the last decade. We don't have  to accept the loss of the next 10 percent of America's family farms. We  don't have to accept hundreds of thousands of people living in the  shadows when they work every single day. They are breaking their  backs--I don't use that term lightly--working in some of the worst  conditions that there are to work in to feed the American people, to  give us economic security and food security and provide for our  national security.   We shouldn't accept crushing food prices for families just because  this Congress can't reform an antiquated H-2A program. We can do  something about it this week before we go home, with this proposal.   Sometimes the politics of an issue like this seems so hard that you  are defeated on it before you even get started. That has not been the  case with this coalition of people from all over America. They have all  they can contend with every single day.   As I said, with rising input costs, with the trade issues that we  have been dealing with, they have every reason in the world not to  spend a moment trying to actually pass this piece of legislation, but  it is so important because this labor issue is so critical to the  future of American agriculture, and they know it, and they have a sense  of urgency about it. They want us to overcome our fears and our  political concerns, to come together and do what the House of  Representatives did, which is pass a bipartisan bill. I guarantee you,  if we do that, if we do that here in this Chamber, when people go home,  what they are going to hear is this: Thank you. Thank you for listening  to us. Thank you for respecting our work in American agriculture. And  thank you for standing up for our country during a difficult economic  moment in world history.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
