 Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to offer a hearty  congratulations to the Shasta High School Wolves of Redding,  California, for their football championship this year. They won the  north section. They won the Northern California Championship and made  their first ever visit to the California State Championship, where they  played down in southern California over the weekend.   Though they came up a little bit short, they did have an early lead  in that game after all that travel. So, indeed, congratulations to that  program at Shasta High School and to the Wolves of Redding, California.   It is teamwork that really makes this happen, and that is exemplified  by the north State's leading rusher, Vince Smith, when he was quoted:  ``The thing that was different about this season was that we actually  really cared about each other and we were family. Every play, we'd use  our hearts and fight for each other.''   That is teamwork. That is the spirit. Congratulations, Shasta High  School Wolves.                            ____________________
