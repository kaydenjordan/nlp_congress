 Mr. Speaker, FOX News and Iran  International report that the Special Envoy for Iran for Biden, Robert  Malley, has met with the Iranian Ambassador to the United States three  times recently. During this period, the Iranian regime was murdering  its own people in the streets. The Biden administration must explain to  the American people what was discussed.   General Jack Keane has correctly warned that Iran can develop a  nuclear capability in just 4 more months. Biden refuses to close the  door and stop the talks over reentering the Iran nuclear deal. An  absurd Iran nuclear agreement will give the regime billions of dollars,  threatening Israel and underwriting drones to Putin against Ukraine.   I have appreciated the bipartisan opposition to the deal by Senator  Joe Lieberman and Chairman Eliot Engel.   The House Republican majority is committed to providing oversight of  the weak foreign policy of Biden.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues, moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America.                            ____________________
