 Mr. Speaker, I have the honor of representing the First  Congressional District of New York, located on the East End of Long  Island, a district almost completely surrounded by water. We were hit  really hard by Superstorm Sandy, and the widespread devastation  emphasized the dire need to ensure our communities were better prepared  for the future.   Working hard with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, Colonel  Thomas Asbery of the Army Corps, and their entire hardworking team,  this bill prioritizes local projects that are vital to my congressional  district.   That includes the Fire Island to Montauk Point project, which  includes essential dredging and shoreline projects over 83 miles of  coastline.   Coastal storm risk management for Hashamomuck Cove in Southold is  included, where right now local residents, businesses, and first  responders are paralyzed even during a severe thunderstorm.   Equally as important, this legislation continues to build on these  victories, jump-starting movement on projects at Reel Point Reserve and  Shelter Island, Goldsmith's Inlet in Southold, and Wading River Creek  in Riverhead through authorizing feasibility studies.   The Water Resources Development Act is great news for our shorelines  on Long Island and across the country, and I urge my colleagues to  support this legislation.
