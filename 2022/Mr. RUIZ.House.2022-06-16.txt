 Mr. Speaker, as chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus,  I rise today to call for immediate action to protect our Nation's  Dreamers.   Yesterday, we marked the 10th anniversary of the DACA program with a  relentless focus on our goal to provide a pathway to citizenship for  our Nation's Dreamers.   Over the last 5 years, we have seen persistent attacks on DACA, and  the need to act could not be more urgent.   You see, DACA has been a rocket booster for our economy. In my  district alone, Dreamers contribute nearly $300 million in GDP. They  are doctors, lawyers, essential workers, engineers, businessowners, and  job creators. They make America stronger, and they shouldn't have to  live in fear of deportation.   I call on 10 Republican Senators to do what is right: Support the  House-passed bipartisan Dream and Promise Act, pass it in the Senate,  and bring humanity back to our immigration system and restore American  values.    To all the Dreamers who are watching, know that I celebrate you. I  stand with you, and fight for you.   Estan en casa. You are home. Home is here.
