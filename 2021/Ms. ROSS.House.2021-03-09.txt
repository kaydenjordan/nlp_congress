 Madam Speaker, the American Rescue Plan will finally  deliver needed aid to individuals, families, workers, businesses, and  healthcare systems. I am proud that this Congress has taken such swift  action to get this important work done.   I want to highlight one part of the bill that would be life-changing  for hundreds of thousands of people in my State.   Sadly, North Carolina is one of only 12 States that has not expanded  Medicaid under the ACA. This failure has left over 600,000 low-income  North Carolinians without healthcare.   The American Rescue Plan provides an added incentive for States like  mine to expand Medicaid. The bill offers a 5-point increase in the  Federal funding match for Medicaid for 2 years to States that choose to  expand the program during this pandemic. This would bring North  Carolina more than $2 billion in Federal healthcare coverage for our  most vulnerable people and help our hardest-hit hospitals.   Madam Speaker, our State desperately needs the relief provided in  this bill.
