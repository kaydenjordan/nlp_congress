 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the America  COMPETES Act. And I am particularly proud of the House science  legislation in this bill designed to ensure that the Department of  Energy Office of Science, the National Science Foundation, and NIST are  well-equipped to succeed in the 21st century.   It also invests in a STEM workforce for the future to ensure we have  the talents to bring all these semiconductor, climate and manufacturing  jobs back home where they belong.   And if I could just share a personal story. About 13 years ago, I was  building a tree house in my backyard, and as I was starting, this 6- year-old neighborhood kid shows up behind me with a cute little hard  hat and a tool belt and said, ``I'm here to help.'' And my 2009 summer  intern, as it were, is now a sophomore at the University of Illinois  studying nuclear engineering.   His opportunity was made possible, in part, by investments that were  made decades ago in nuclear technology in a test reactor on that  University of Illinois campus. That reactor has now hit the end of its  life. It has been shut down, and there are few other States that have  those kinds of opportunities.   That is why I look forward to the consideration of my National  Nuclear University Research Infrastructure Reinvestment Act, in America  COMPETES, with Congressman Foster, Congressman Gonzalez, and  Congressman Meijer, that will enhance the research capabilities of  nuclear science and engineering programs, meet the workforce needs of  the U.S. nuclear industry, and accelerate the deployment of advanced  nuclear technologies in Illinois and across the country.   I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill as we  develop new generations of advanced nuclear energy at our Nation's  universities.
