 Mr. Speaker, there is a force of nature that all Texans  know: Texans from Sweden. I am one. But the most powerful one is a 17- year-old Cinco Ranch Cougar. Her name is Jennifer Lindgren.   As you can see, Jennifer was born without a left hand. Not a problem.  Jennifer says: ``Most of the time, I forget that I have one hand. I  have always just done pretty much what everybody else has done.''   Jennifer, you are wrong. You have done more than anyone else ever  could do.   Jennifer is the president of the Cinco Ranch FFA. Her sheep, Lou, won  third place at the recent FFA livestock show.   Jennifer, you are awesome. As you go off to the great Aggie school,  Texas A&M University, you must change a little bit. You have to say  ``howdy,'' ``gig em,'' and ``whoop'' a lot.                            ____________________
