 Madam Speaker, yesterday, I hosted  press conferences for a 2019 agenda in the Midlands, Aiken, and  Barnwell with my wife, Roxanne.   I am grateful for the 2018 successes of serving as Armed Services  Readiness Subcommittee chairman to rebuild the military, leading the  House delegation to open the Embassy in Jerusalem, and tax cuts  creating jobs with record-high middle-class income.   In 2019, I will work to create jobs and economic growth, support  conservative alternatives, achieve foreign affairs opportunities, and  promote our military and veterans. Building on bipartisan successes, I  am confident this year we can be productive for American families.   Congratulations to the Clemson Tigers for their victory for the  national championship. Coach Dabo Swinney and Quarterback Trevor  Lawrence are an inspiration for the youth of America.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
