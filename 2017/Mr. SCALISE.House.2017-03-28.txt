 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for  bringing forward this legislation.   The FTC's light touch in case-by-case enforcement had fostered an  internet economy that has become the envy of the world, much to the  benefit of all American families and consumers across this country.   But rather than following the FTC's proven framework of privacy  protection, the FCC came in and overreached and missed the mark with  these rules, injecting more regulation into the internet ecosystem.  With all due respect, the internet was not broken and did not need the  Federal Government to come in and try to fix it.   The bottom line is that families expect and deserve to be protected  online with a set of robust and uniform privacy protections. These  rules simply do not live up to that standard.   Rather than regulating based on the sensitivity of our data, these  rules are applied unevenly, based on what type of company you are or  what kind of technology you use.   Consumers should feel assured online that there is a cop on the beat  with a track record of success, not an agency with a history of  regulatory overreach. These midnight rules are harmful, inconsistent,  and should be repealed.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to adopt this important resolution.   Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how  much time is remaining on both sides?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 10\3/4\  minutes remaining. The gentleman from Texas has 5 minutes remaining.   Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I remind the  gentleman that these heavy-handed regulations that he speaks of are  simply: ask permission, protect people's data, and tell them if it gets  stolen.   That doesn't sound too heavy-handed to me.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Tonko).
