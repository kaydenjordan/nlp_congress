 Mr. Speaker, as a native Hawaiian, I am excited to  highlight how the Build Back Better Act will benefit the native  Hawaiian community and all of the original indigenous peoples, the  first peoples of these nations, across the United States.   The Build Back Better Act will strengthen our collective indigenous  communities through investments in culturally relevant healthcare,  housing and community development, professional development for  indigenous languages and early childhood educators, accelerator  programs for small businesses, and funding for native Hawaiian  healthcare systems.   These programs further the trust responsibility from the United  States Government to indigenous communities.   The Build Back Better Act also creates opportunities for Federal  consultation on land use planning, development, and infrastructure  projects--something our indigenous communities have requested for  years.   That is why we must pass the Build Back Better Act and add its  investments to the initiatives we just passed in the Infrastructure  Investment and Jobs Act. The Build Back Better Act supports our  indigenous communities and creates opportunity for indigenous peoples  while ensuring that America's richest citizens pay their fair share.   Mahalo, Mr. Speaker.                            ____________________
