 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk for  counsel to the President.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator Burr asks:         We have seen the House managers repeatedly play video clips       of Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney's press conference, in       which they claim he said there was a quid pro quo. How do you       respond to the House managers' allegation that Mr. Mulvaney       supported their claims in his press conference?    Mr. Counsel PURPURA. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate,  Senator, thanks for the question.   We respond as Mr. Philbin did earlier today with that, which is Mr.  Mulvaney has issued two statements--one after his press conference and  then one Monday after the New York Times article concerning Mr.  Bolton's alleged manuscript--alleged statements in his manuscript.   So I think the easiest thing is just to read them to understand what  he said and to put it into context for everyone in the Chamber.   This is from--this is the day of the press conference.         Once again, the media has decided to misconstrue my       comments to advance a biased and political witch hunt against       President Trump. Let me be clear, there was absolutely no       quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any       investigation into the 2016 election. The president never       told me to withhold any money until the Ukrainians did       anything related to the server. The only reasons we were       holding the money was because of concern about lack of       support from other nations and concerns over corruption.       Multiple times during the more-than 30 minute briefing where       I took over 25 questions, I referred to President Trump's       interest in rooting out corruption in Ukraine, and ensuring       taxpayer dollars were spent responsibly and appropriately.       There was never any connection between the funds and the       Ukrainians doing anything with the server--this was made       explicitly obvious by the fact that the aid money was       delivered without any action on the part of the Ukrainians       regarding the server.        There was never any condition on the flow of the aid       related to the matter of the DNC server.    Then, on January 27, which was Monday, there was a statement from Bob  Driscoll, who is Mr. Mulvaney's attorney. Now I will read it in its  full.         The latest story from the New York Times, coordinated with       a book launch, has more to do with publicity than the truth.       John Bolton never informed Mick Mulvaney of any concerns       surrounding Bolton's purported August conversation with the       President. Nor did Mr. Mulvaney ever have a conversation with       the President or anyone else indicating that Ukrainian       military aid was withheld in exchange for a Ukrainian       investigation of Burisma, the Bidens, or the 2016 election.       Furthermore, Mr. Mulvaney has no recollection of any       conversation with Mr. Giuliani resembling that reportedly       described in Mr. Bolton's manuscript, as it was Mr.       Mulvaney's practice to excuse himself from conversations       between the President and his personal counsel to preserve       any attorney-client privilege.    So I wanted to read those statements in full so that everyone had the  full context.   Even after Mr. Philbin referenced the statement after the press  conference, the House managers again came back and said Mr. Mulvaney  indicated or admitted there was a quid pro quo. That is not true.   If Mr. Mulvaney misspoke or if the words were garbled, he corrected  it that day and has been very clear.   Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Maryland.
