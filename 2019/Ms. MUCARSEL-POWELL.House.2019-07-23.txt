 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 549) to designate Venezuela under section 244 of  the Immigration and Nationality Act to permit nationals of Venezuela to  be eligible for temporary protected status under such section, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 549         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Venezuela TPS Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. DESIGNATION FOR PURPOSES OF GRANTING TEMPORARY                     PROTECTED STATUS.

The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  [[Page H7212]]  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 549, the Venezuela  TPS Act of 2019. This vitally important bill will provide help and  support to those who cannot return to their home country of Venezuela.   Years-long political and economic turmoil in Venezuela has resulted  in the world's fastest growing migration, staggering poverty, and  chronic shortages of medicine. Millions of Venezuelans are  malnourished, and the United Nations estimates that 7 million people  are in need of humanitarian assistance. Four million Venezuelans have  been forced from their home. Most have remained in the region in  neighboring countries, but tens of thousands are here in the United  States seeking refuge. It is long past time to grant temporary  protected status for Venezuelans currently living in the United States.   My district has one of the largest Venezuelan populations in the  Nation, and I understand very well the crisis in Venezuela.   I came to this country from Ecuador when I was 14 years old, having  seen firsthand the damage that authoritarian and corrupt leaders in  South America have caused their countries. I have good friends and  family who are still there suffering in Maracaibo and in Caracas. They  are desperate. I can hear it in their voices every time they update me  on the crisis.   In Miami I have met with reporters who have had to flee their home  because a free press does not exist in Venezuela. Just yesterday, more  rolling blackouts hit the country jeopardizing the lives of hospital  patients and sending the country into pure darkness.   Even if Nicolas Maduro, the leader of this brutal narco-regime, were  to leave today and the legitimate President, Juan Guaido, were to be  sworn in, extraordinary and temporary conditions exist that would  prevent Venezuelans from returning safely. Maduro's regime has plunged  Venezuela into catastrophe.   The poverty rate in Venezuela is soaring, and the nation's health  system is near collapse. Just imagine, nearly one-third of Venezuelan  physicians have fled the country, and an astounding 79 percent of  hospitals are experiencing shortages in supplies to assist the  country's mounting medical needs. This dire situation is only  exacerbated by massive food and water shortages. Malnutrition is  widespread, especially among children and pregnant women. Frequent  nationwide blackouts contribute to the deterioration of already  impoverished communities. This is one of the worst humanitarian crises  that we have seen in the Western Hemisphere.   One thing is clear: we have to help our Venezuelan brothers and  sisters in the United States. These conditions in Venezuela warrant a  designation of TPS, and through H.R. 549, Congress will take this  necessary action.   I commend my colleagues, Representatives Darren Soto and Mario Diaz- Balart for introducing this bill. I thank Representatives Donna Shalala  and Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and Chairwoman Lofgren of the  Subcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship and Chairman Nadler of the  Judiciary Committee for their support and hard work in helping move  this bill forward.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the Venezuela TPS Act  of 2019, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the concerns Mr.  [[Page H7213]]  Cline has brought up, but I would like to remind him that the  Immigration and Nationality Act and this bill provide the authority to  terminate TPS for Venezuelans, and Venezuelans, right now, are clearly  eligible.   TPS was created specifically for the situations that we are seeing.  TPS was created to address situations where extraordinary and temporary  conditions in a country prevent its nationals from returning safely.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Soto), my colleague.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), my colleague.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Shalala), my colleague.    Madam Speaker, just a couple of quick responses  to my colleague, Mr. Brooks.   The only thing that I do agree with is, yes, we do have to put our  own house in order. We have an executive in disarray at this moment.   I think that maybe the gentleman is ill-informed. The people of  Venezuela did not elect the narco-regime, the authoritarian,  dictatorial leader who is Nicolas Maduro. They had fraudulent elections  in May 2018.   Please do not insult the people in Venezuela, who are suffering, who  have no food, who have no access to medicine. We have seen the worst  humanitarian crisis in this hemisphere, and it was not because  Venezuelans elected him. Actually, he held fraudulent elections. The  interim, legitimate President is Juan Guaido.   But we are not going to see a tsunami of Venezuelans coming to this  country. This bill applies only and specifically to the Venezuelans who  are already residing in the United States.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Deutch), my colleague.  [[Page H7215]]         Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time is  remaining.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Murphy), my colleague.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   In response to Mr. Cline's concern, once again, TPS is the law of the  land. It is under section 244 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.  All we are asking is to place Venezuela as a country that is designated  under TPS in this bill.   We are talking about people who are suffering. We cannot send them  back to a humanitarian emergency.   We wrote a letter to the Trump administration, asking them to grant  TPS for Venezuelans. They have the ability to do so at the  administrative level right now, but they have refused. They say they  are supportive of Venezuelans, but I seriously question that when they  disagree with the importance of granting TPS for the thousands of  Venezuelans living in this country today. We cannot send them back to a  brutal regime, to a regime that is actually killing its own citizens.   I would like to express my support for H.R. 549. There is, as I  mentioned, widespread poverty and shortages of food and water. The  government is in disarray, and we can't wait any longer. We have to  help our Venezuelan brothers and sisters in the United States, and this  bill accomplishes just that.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support H.R. 549. We must do it, ``lo tenemos que hacer.'' This is the  moment.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
