 Mr. Speaker, the question I get asked is: What the heck  were they thinking about?   Let me tell you what they are thinking about. Medicaid is the source  of 25 percent of all projected public and private spending for drug  abuse treatment. It is about $8 billion.   Let's consider James Suber from my hometown of Paterson, New Jersey.  Mr. Suber began seeking treatment when New Jersey expanded its Medicare  program and provided more comprehensive access to treatment.   At least New Jersey got it half right.   Each morning Mr. Suber receives treatment at Paterson Counseling  Center, which allows him to go to work as a cleaner at Well of Hope,  another treatment center in Paterson serving the homeless.   Without the treatment he receives through Medicaid, he wouldn't be  working. He would be using the emergency department at St. Joseph's  hospital, the most expensive part of the hospital. Or maybe he wouldn't  have survived.   So, Mr. Speaker, for the life of me, I don't understand why we would  jeopardize treatment for James and the millions of other Americans  facing similar challenges. What were they thinking?   Will this bill improve Medicaid? Nope.   Will this bill increase the number of Americans with health coverage?  Nope.   Will it lower costs on the exchanges? Nope.   Will this bill bolster employer coverage? No.   Will coverage now provide more access to care, a promise time and  time again by Mr. Trump, himself? No.   Will it strengthen Medicare? No.                                time  1445    Mr. Speaker, it is obvious. We know we are trying to change things  and make them better.   We changed Medicare. We did it together.   We changed Medicaid. We did it together.   We changed a lot of things together, but you chose the only lonely  path.
