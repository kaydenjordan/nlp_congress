 Mr. Chair, I understand that we are living in  uncertain times. We are witnessing an unjustifiable war of aggression  in Ukraine and a global democratic backslide. Congress can respond to  national security needs as they arise. We don't have to spend billions  of dollars on what-ifs.   These risks are already built into the Pentagon's budget request. If  military leaders want more funding for their wish lists, there is  nothing in this amendment that will prevent the DOD from supplying an  unfunded priorities list to Congress, but this process should be  optional just as it was 7 years ago.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment.
