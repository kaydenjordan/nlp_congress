 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of  American families and small businesses in North Carolina who are having  to confront not only the pandemic but President Biden's truly  disastrous and shortsighted economic policies.   Inflation is at a 30-year high. Gas prices are up 42 percent. Hell,  even the cost of bacon has gone through the roof.   We are hurtling backwards under liberal control, and the fact that  Democrats are trying to sell a free $5.5 trillion package as the  solution is an embarrassment and a snake oil lie to the American  people.   Let's be clear. Most liberal elites and progressives in Washington  have never run a business. They have never signed both sides of a  paycheck, and they have never had to make the heartbreaking decision  between feeding their families and keeping their businesses open.   At a small business roundtable, one local bakery owner said that  crippling inflation, the self-induced labor shortage, and supply chain  disruptions have created such a fragile environment that he is one  worker away from bankruptcy.   This bakery owner even raised his own employee pay by $4 an hour and  took a second job to make ends meet, and he still cannot fill job  vacancies.                            ____________________
