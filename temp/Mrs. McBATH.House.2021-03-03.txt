 Mr. Speaker, I am so proud of our many officers in  Georgia's Sixth Congressional District, here in the Capitol, and those  nationwide who do all that they can to keep our families safe.   They have the trust of their communities and, as a result, are better  at ensuring everyone's safety. These officers know the people that they  serve. They see them as brothers, sisters, and neighbors. They serve  with honor and respect the dignity of every citizen.   This bill is about making sure that every officer and every  department is held to the same standard as has been set by the officers  in my own district.   Mr. Speaker, by passing the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, we  invest in our departments, end harmful profiling, and provide grants to  communities finding new and innovative ways to improve safety.   This bill ensures all of our police officers have the resources to  become our very best police officers, and that they are all working to  make sure that every single one of us is safer.
