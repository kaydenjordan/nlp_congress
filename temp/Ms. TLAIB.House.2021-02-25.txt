 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the resilience of  the residents in my district who have seen the traumatic impacts of the  pandemic but they continue to show up for each other.   The sisterhood among the women of the Zeta Phi Beta's Highland Park  Michigan chapter, Kappa Rho Zeta, in my district are a true testament  to our community's strength. This sorority was founded with the purpose  of upholding the tenets of sisterhood and service. Over the past 40  years, the sisters have given countless hours of community service to  the people of Highland Park.   Their service and charity work has extended to so many organizations  across my district. Even during some  [[Page H623]]  of our district's most challenging times, they continue to show up for  our neighborhoods and community members who are most vulnerable. They  have spearheaded annual holiday celebrations for our seniors, provided  workshops and assistance for pregnant mothers, and uplifted the  graduating high school students of Highland Park by awarding  scholarships to support them in their academic pursuits.   This is our district's strength. I am honored to uplift the 40 years  of sisterhood, service, and strength of the women of Zeta Phi Beta's  Kappa Rho Zeta Chapter and their many outstanding contributions to the  residents of Highland Park and 13th District Strong.                                time  1015               Honoring Wayne County Residents Lost to COVID-19     The people define my district and its history, so it is  essential that I give reverence to the residents who are among the  500,000 people in the United States who lost their lives as a result of  the coronavirus.   I would like to honor a valuable member of the community who has  passed, Ms. Abena Hogan.   Ms. Hogan was born and raised in Detroit and was a proud daughter of  our community.   She began her first career in public service working for southeast  Michigan's regional public transit system. After 20 years of service,  Ms. Hogan briefly retired before she was called back into service to  work for our Wayne County Clerk.   Ms. Hogan took immense pride in serving the people of Wayne County,  and Ms. Hogan believed deeply in the power of the people and grassroots  action. She will be dearly, dearly missed.   I also want to give tribute to a very highly respected public  servant. This is Wayne County Sheriff Benny Napoleon. He left a  tremendous mark on our community and the community that he truly loved  to serve.   Benny Napoleon served as our Wayne County Sheriff from 2009 until the  time of his death. His love for Detroit and its people was unwavering.  His tenure as Wayne County Sheriff was marked by his work to reduce  inmate populations by utilizing alternatives to incarceration and  employing electronic tethering.   Napoleon was well-known for his personality and his big heart, and he  had a smile that would just light up a room.   Shortly after his death, we lost yet another public servant in our  district, Mayor Dan Paletko.   Mayor Paletko served the Dearborn Heights community from 2004 until  his death late last year. He prioritized making Dearborn Heights a  welcoming place for all of its residents to call home and was  especially proud of his city's rich cultural diversity and recreational  resources. His pride in Dearborn Heights was evident in his dedication.   We will continue to honor the memories of not only the mayor, the  sheriff, and Abena, but also the countless other residents of 13th  District Strong who have lost their lives to this deadly disease.   Wayne County Sheriff Benny Napoleon, Dearborn Heights Mayor Dan  Paletko, and Abena Hogan are three of more than 16,000 Michigan  residents who have lost their lives to COVID.   It is essential that our families who have suffered such a great loss  this past year get the resources and support they need from our  government so that they do not face financial struggles and hardship  because of the pandemic.   We must act now. Our families and our communities can't wait any  longer. Our families deserve recurring payments. Our local communities  deserve direct aid. Our residents deserve to be vaccinated, and our  students deserve to be educated in a safe environment where they can  not only learn but thrive.   So today, I rise in remembrance of those we have lost due to COVID  but lean on the strength and the resiliency of my district who deserves  more.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, today is a great day. Today, we send a clear  message to every LGBTQ person that you belong here, that you are loved  for who you are, and that we won't stop fighting until you experience  true equity and equality.   We are experiencing a crisis of violence against our LGBTQ neighbors,  especially people of color, and our transgender communities. Today's  passage is for Treasure Hilliard, for Paris Cameron, and for every  LGBTQ person taken too soon by hate.   When one in five transgender people has experienced homelessness,  when transgender people have half the homeownership rate of cisgender  people, we have a structural problem. By outlawing discrimination in  housing, employment, education, and public accommodations, we send a  powerful message to the bigots, including those here in Congress, that  their time is over.   Listen very closely, and remember these words: We are winning. We  will continue winning. Our will is unbreakable. Our love is so much  stronger than your sad, pathetic hate.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my good colleague from New Mexico. It  is truly an honor to be able to serve with her.   Yesterday, she shared with me a young student in her district sent  her a beautiful letter. It was her first letter from a young child in  her district, and I lovingly called the child Teresa's truth-teller. I  hope it starts a trend in her community.   Mr. Speaker, to many of my colleagues here, I ask them all to please  come and tour my district. I lovingly call them 13th District Strong  because they never stop fighting for justice even when many here across  the country are always being asked to wait: wait for this, wait for  change, wait for us to be able to tackle poverty wages. Those that can  afford it, they wait, but our folks can't afford it anymore.   Raising the Federal minimum wage to $15 per hour has never been more  urgent for my residents, and it is long overdue. You see, I represent  the third poorest congressional district in the country. I want you to  think about that for one moment.   I have an elderly couple who has to melt snow in a bucket so that  they have the ability to flush their toilet because they can't afford  water. Water has been increased by 400 percent in rates. I have a  mother in my district who is pleading for me to find a place where her  daughter can eat twice a day. More than half of my residents pay a  third or more of their income for housing.   Our economy is structured in a way to benefit the few over the many.  It is no surprise that the many it is not working for are the working  people in our communities.   If we want to truly look and peek at the economy, measure the amount  of debt our families have compared to their incomes. Look at the  productivity numbers that are up compared to the wages that remain  stagnant.   At the same time that our people are suffering, large corporations  are seeing record-breaking profits, and CEOs are being paid record-high  salaries. It is simply unfair and immoral.  [[Page H713]]    Raising the minimum wage is also a matter of racial justice. Workers  of color are far more likely to be paid poverty wages than their White  counterparts, and Black and Brown workers are far more likely to be  victims of wage theft. I know because I used to represent them and  fight for their fair access to their wages that they have earned.    A $15 Federal minimum wage would increase the earnings of 38 percent  of Black workers across our Nation, a raise that will be life-changing.   It is time for all of us right here in Congress to earn our own pay  and deliver this overdue minimum wage increase without delay. I hope  folks understand, $15 is already the compromise. It is. If the minimum  wage had kept up with worker productivity, it would already be at $24  per hour.   Workers aren't asking for anything they aren't already earning for  their bosses. Without workers, there is no profit. It is high time for  us to end the pattern of exploiting workers, our neighbors, family  members.   Raise the wage. It is the right thing to do for our Nation. It is so  incredibly supported outside these Halls of Congress. Listen to the  people who sent us here. They are urging us to please stop waiting.   We have been given the power to change their lives for the better.  Mr. Speaker, I thank, again, my colleague from New Mexico.
