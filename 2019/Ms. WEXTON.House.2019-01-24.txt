 Madam Speaker, my district in Northern Virginia is home  to tens of thousands of Federal workers, and even more contractors who  work alongside them.   I have heard from hundreds of constituents about how the shutdown has  turned their lives upside down, like Teresa, who is a furloughed  Federal worker.   She and her husband recently sold their home and signed a contract to  purchase another one in my district. The mortgage financing for their  purchase was all set and approved before the shutdown. Their closing  date is set for next Monday, the 28th, 4 days from now.   But just a couple days ago, they learned that the mortgage company is  now denying their mortgage application because she is furloughed. She  was told by the lender that they consider her unemployed and too much  of a risk to finance.   This is a Federal employee who will receive backpay when this  shutdown eventually ends, but that isn't enough for the mortgage  company. It isn't enough for any of their other creditors, and now she  and her family, instead of celebrating moving into their new home, are  essentially homeless, all because of the reckless Trump-McConnell  shutdown.                            ____________________
