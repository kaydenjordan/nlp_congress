 Mr. President, as the author of this bill, I totally  disagree with characterizing it as having had a bitter partisan  beginning, but my colleague is exercising his free speech right, so  there you go.   After 2 weeks of hard work and bipartisan collaboration, the U.S.  Senate is poised to take real action to confront the wave of anti-Asian  hate sweeping our country. Although we still have some damaging  amendments to defeat, I am confident that, in a few hours, the Senate  will pass the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, as amended, with the substitute  Hirono-Collins amendment. By doing so, we will send a powerful message  of solidarity to the AAPI community that the Senate will not be a  bystander as anti-Asian violence surges in our country.   Over the past years, hate crimes targeting the AAPI have risen 150  percent, as noted. More than 3,800 incidents have been reported across  all 50 States and the District of Columbia. These statistics paint a  disturbing picture of what is happening in our country, but they only  quantify part of the problem. Why? Because hate crimes and other  incidents are notoriously underrepresented.   These attacks have not ceased in the 2 weeks since the Senate began  debating this bill. Last Sunday, an 80-year-old woman and her 79-year- old husband, both of Korean descent, were taking an evening walk in a  local park near their home in Southern California. Suddenly, without  warning, an assailant approached the couple and punched them in their  faces. That same assailant is also suspected of threatening Sakura  Kokumai, a Japanese-American Olympic karate athlete, who, incidentally,  was born in Hawaii.   These unprovoked, random attacks and incidents are happening in  supermarkets, on our streets, in takeout restaurants--basically,  wherever we are. These disturbing and horrifying attacks are in many  ways a predictable and foreseeable consequence of the use of racist and  inflammatory language like ``Chinese virus'' or ``Kung flu'' to  describe the pandemic.   I have been heartened by the steps President Biden has taken to  denounce this language and confront this epidemic of hate. Under his  leadership, the executive branch is doing its part, and in a few short  hours, Congress will do ours by passing the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act.   This is not a controversial bill. It focuses Federal leadership to  investigate and report hate crimes and other incidents, and it provides  resources for our communities to come together to take a stand against  intolerance and hate.   Over the past 2 weeks, I have worked with Senators in both parties to  make changes that broaden support for this bill while retaining its  original purpose. In particular, I want to acknowledge and thank  Senator Collins for her good-faith efforts to amend this bill and build  support for it in the Republican caucus.   I also want to thank Senator Duckworth for her leadership on this  issue; Senators Blumenthal and Moran, whose NO HATE Act is now included  in our legislation; and Senators Warnock and Grassley, who contributed  important findings to this bill.   This moment would not have been possible without the determined  efforts of Leader Schumer and Chairman Durbin and the excellent work of  my friend and colleague in the House, Congresswoman Grace Meng.   I am grateful that the Senate will soon be taking action to confront  anti-Asian hate in our country, but ours is not the only community  suffering right now. Earlier this week, a jury in Minneapolis delivered  justice and accountability for the murder of George Floyd, but make no  mistake: One conviction cannot and will not erase the enduring legacy  of systemic racism and disparate policing in our country. It is my  sincere hope that we can channel and sustain the bipartisan work done  on this important piece of legislation into debating and passing the  George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, and I understand that bipartisan  talks are underway. We are in this together. We are in this together.  [[Page S2146]]    Senator Collins, I really appreciate your work on this bill. We would  not be here without your support.   I yield the floor.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1456     Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment. Discrimination against Asian-American students or any  students on the basis of race is already prohibited by Federal law.   This amendment is a transparent and cynical attack on longstanding  admission policies that serve to increase diversity and provide  opportunity to students of color in our institutions of higher  learning. This amendment also threatens colleges and universities with  the loss of all Federal funding for pursuing or using policies that our  courts have upheld repeatedly.   I urge everyone to reject this amendment.   I yield back.    Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.    Mr. President, in just a few moments, the Senate will  take a strong stand against anti-Asian hate in our country.   Passing the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act sends a clear and unmistakable  message of solidarity to the AAPI community, and this moment would not  be possible without the collective efforts of so many people,  including, of course, my Republican colleagues--one person in  particular who just spoke before me.   But I want to especially thank Majority Leader Schumer for making  this bill a priority for the Senate and working closely with us to  shepherd its passage.   I also want to thank my colleagues in the House, especially  Congresswoman Grace Meng for being the dogged advocate for our  community during this process, as well as Members of the Congressional  Asian Pacific American Caucus, led by Congresswoman Judy Chu.   I urge all of my colleagues to vote for this legislation.
