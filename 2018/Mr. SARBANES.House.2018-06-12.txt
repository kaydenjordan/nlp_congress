 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Pallone for yielding.   I rise in support of H.R. 5102, the Substance Use Disorder Workforce  Loan Repayment Act of 2018.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the authors of the bill, my colleagues Katherine  Clark and Hal Rogers, for putting this together. It is a very carefully  crafted bill to address the problem which it discovered, really, which  is there is this serious shortage of substance use disorder  professionals across the country.   We are experiencing shortages in a lot of areas of the healthcare  workforce, that is true, but if we are going to address the opioid  crisis that we face, this epidemic across the country, we have to bring  particular attention to the workforce shortages with respect to  substance use disorder professionals.   According to SAMHSA, which is the agency which deals with these  issues, in 2012, the turnover rates in the addiction services workforce  ranged from 18.5 to over 50 percent. So there is a huge turnover there  that has to be addressed.   In a recent survey, nearly half of clinical directors in agencies  that specialize in substance use disorder treatment acknowledged that  they have real difficulty filling these open positions.   In my district, I have heard from many of the community health  centers--Baltimore Medical System, Health Care for the Homeless, and  others--that said they can't hire enough of these folks and they can't  keep enough of these folks to address the opioid crisis.   We need this workforce to address the millions of people who require  this important treatment, and this bill does that. It is a very, very  important step forward. It will create this loan repayment program for  professionals who are in this area of substance use disorder treatment.  They can receive up to $250,000 if they agree to work as a treatment  professional in this area and in a geographical area of high need.   Again, carefully crafted, this treatment can take place in a number  of different facilities, community health centers, hospitals, recovery  programs, correctional facilities, et cetera.   So the idea was to figure out where those shortages are and direct  the bill's support to those areas: a broad range of direct care  providers, physicians, registered nurses, social workers, and other  behavioral health providers.   This is going to help address the problem of recruitment, attracting  new people to the field, as well as help with retention of those  people. It is a very, very important bill.   Mr. Speaker, I was proud to join my colleagues, Katherine Clark, Hal  Rogers on our committee, Brett Guthrie, and others, in supporting this.  I hope all of my colleagues here today will support this important  bill.                                time  1600
