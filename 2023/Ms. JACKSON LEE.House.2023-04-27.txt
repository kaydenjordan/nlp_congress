 Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentleman for his  distinguished leadership as the manager on this floor and, certainly,  the proponent of this resolution. I know it came with good intentions.   Let me indicate the wisdom of a young college student some many years  ago when I offered to my college for my winning traveling fellowship  that I would go to the continent of Africa. Everyone else would go to  places well defined and well recognized. I told them that I wanted to  take the fellowship that I had received to travel to West Africa, and I  did, from then-Togo-and-Dahomey--obviously, changed names to Cote  d'Ivoire--to Ghana and Nigeria, and I studied, seeing the potential  even then.   I am gratified to be in this Congress to be able to have the  leadership of our chairman and our ranking member on the Foreign  Affairs Committee to recognize the cruciality of our purpose on the  continent.   It was members of the Congressional Black Caucus who organized to say  how important it was under the George W. Bush administration that the  Africa Command be set up. It was crucial in the bloody fight in Liberia  for that command to be set up, and only without shooting one gun were  they able to begin to bring peace.   So, I rise with great concern and opposition to H. Con. Res. 30  because I have realized the importance of the Africa Command because it  has elements of diplomacy.   I am glad that President Biden reversed Trump's get-out-of-town and  get-out-of-Dodge-quick resolution to, in fact, leave a footprint of  500, who are helping us bring down Al-Shabaab, bring down al-Qaida, and  boost up the Somalian partners of which our soldiers are working  through and working to degrade Al-Shabaab's ability to plot external  operations while building the capacities of our partner.   The rest of Africa is watching. If they try to be peaceful and to  stand up a democratic entity, do they have a powerful force like the  United States?   I, too, want a full debate on the Authorization for Use of Military  Force. I have been here for 9/11 and afterward, and I, too, believe  that it is our duty.   What I will say at this time is that we should not remove those  troops from Somalia.   I ask my colleague to join with his committee and engage in debate on  the AUMF, but I want to protect the Somalian people, Africa, and I want  to protect the interests of democracy and the United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.Con. Res. 30--Directing  the President, pursuant to section 5(c) of the War Powers Resolution,  to remove all United States Armed Forces, other than United States  Armed Forces assigned to protect the United States Embassy, from  Somalia.   This concurrent resolution directs the President to remove all U.S.  Armed Forces from Somalia, other than those assigned to protect the  U.S. embassy in Somalia, within 365 days of the adoption of this  concurrent resolution.   Premature withdrawal would risk reversal of critical counterterrorism  and governance gain.   Al-Shabaab is al-Qaida's largest and best--financed affiliate in the  world and has repeatedly demonstrated its intent and capability to  launch lethal and complex attacks against U.S. citizens in east Africa  and beyond.   Al-Shabaab has killed more than a dozen U.S. citizens since 2014-- more than all of al-Qaida's other affiliates combined during the same  period.   U.S. forces, 500-900 working through Somali partners, seek to degrade  Al-Shabaab's ability to plot external operations while building the  capacities of our partners.   The small but effective U.S. military presence supports a critical  counterterrorism mission by working with partners forces.   There is no legal basis for this legislation.   The resolution is based on section 5(c) of the War Powers Resolution.  But section 5(c) of the War Powers Resolution applies only when our  forces are engaged in hostilities without statutory basis.   In this case, there a statutory basis for U.S. actions in Somalia, as  U.S. forces are supporting hostilities against Al-Shabaab and al-Qaida  in Somalia--both of which are covered by the 2001 Authorization to Use  Military Force.   Since July 2022, the Federal Government of Somalia has retaken more  territory than the previous five years combined.   U.S. military presence is a vital component of efforts to improve  local partners capacity and local conditions to the point that our  presence is no longer needed.   The persistent presence of a modest number of U.S. forces increases  the effectiveness of the DoD's training efforts and bolsters its  credibility as a consistent and durable partner for Somali forces.   The DoD's presence in Somalia forms the backbone of a whole--of-- government approach that layer's diplomacy, security assistance,  stabilization programing, and intelligence operations to counter Al- Shabaab and address the conditions that have allowed it to thrive.   I urge all my colleagues to oppose H.Con. Res. 30.    Mr. Speaker, for as long as I have been here in the  United States Congress, which is more than two decades, we have been  fighting to add to the Constitution a perfectly sensible amendment, one  that does not offend the American people.   It simply says that the equal rights amendment declares that women  are equal in this Nation from the early suffragette days to the days of  Sojourner Truth, Harriet Tubman, and Susan B. Anthony. That is only a  fair statement, that the rights of women should be considered part of  the Constitution.   Unfortunately, today, the United States Senate voted it down when 51  of our Senators, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, whom I met outside  the Senate Chambers, wanted to make sure that the Constitution stood on  its four points of equality, justice, opportunity, and democracy.   We will continue to fight until the equal rights amendment is passed  fairly in this Nation and for the world to see, as they have admired us  for our principles of freedom, that we believe in freedom for all the  people of this Nation, men and women and families. That is extremely  important. It is sad that it was voted down today by our friends on the  other side of the aisle.                            ____________________
