 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate and congratulate  the Andale High School Indians on their 2022 Class 3A football State  championship, their fourth in a row.   Since 2019, Coach Dylan Schmidt and the class of 2022 have shown the  State and country that the hard work and dedication they put into the  game are unmatched on the field.   With their win last Saturday, Andale continued its 4-year undefeated  streak of 51 games, the second-longest active win streak in the entire  country. To put this in perspective, the seniors at Andale High School  have never lost a high school football game.   During this impressive run, Andale has outscored their opponents by  an average of more than 45 points per game. Coach Schmidt and his team  now hold the record for the fourth-longest winning streak in Kansas  State history.   In a testament to their talent and Coach Schmidt's commitment to  excellence, the team has only lost twice since 2017.   I hope the entire House will join me in congratulating Andale High  School and Coach Schmidt on their monumental achievements on the field  and off the field.   I wish them continued success in their upcoming season. Go Indians.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I was not present for the following Roll  Call votes.
