 Thank you, Madam President, for the recognition. It is  great to be joined on the floor by Senator Collins, who is going to  speak after me to stand up for the Constitution, and I very much  appreciate Senator Lamar Alexander's comments also. He is a real  student of the Constitution, and I respect very much the conclusion he  has come up with here today.   When each Senator is sworn into office, we take a fundamental pledge  to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. That vow  that we support the Constitution dates back to the very first Congress  in 1789. Defending the Constitution is our first and foremost sacred  duty.   The Founders built a system of checks and balances into our  Constitution. They made sure that the three branches of government  exercised their own separate powers, and they made sure that no one  branch, no one person, could exercise too much power, especially over  the use of taxpayer money. The Founders gave to Congress the power of  the purse, one of our most fundamental powers. Article I, section 9 of  the Constitution could not be more clear: ``No money shall be drawn  from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.''   Congress holds the power to spend taxpayer money, not the President.  It is our job to make sure that spending decisions have widespread  public support and are not the product of an extreme minority, much  less one man or one woman.   We all know that the President wants a wall. We just had a major  debate about border security funding. The President shut down the  government for 35 days because Congress refused his wall request.   Eventually he relented, but now he has declared an ``emergency'' to  simply try and take the money that he couldn't get from the  appropriations process. He said: ``I didn't need to do this.'' He  flaunted the fact that this is not a real emergency.   The President is testing the limits of Executive power. The questions  before the Senate today are these: Are we going to let this happen or  are we going to open Pandora's box? What about article I of the  Constitution? What about the 35-day government shutdown? What about  Presidential budget requests? What about the Appropriations Committee?  Are we really going to let a President raid taxpayer money after  Congress denies the request?   The opposition to this power grab is bipartisan, as it should be.  Among the American people the numbers are overwhelming. Almost 70  percent of the American people oppose the President's emergency  declaration to raid taxpayer money for the wall. That is almost 70  percent.   My fellow Senators, it is time for the Senate to do its job. It is  time for us to assert our authority over the purse. It is time for us  to honor our oath of office. Every Senator should vote yes on the  resolution to terminate the President's emergency declaration.   I want to thank my cosponsors in this effort. Earlier I mentioned  Senator Collins, who is on the floor with me and will speak after me-- Senator Murkowski, Senator Shaheen. Again, I know that Senator Collins  is on the floor to urge us to do the right thing, to stand up for  Congress's authority.   This vote is historic. The Constitution's principle of separation of  powers is at stake. If the Senate enables the President to hijack our  power to appropriate, history will not remember us fondly.  [[Page S1860]]    This vote is not about the wisdom of building a wall along the  border. This vote is not about party. This vote is about whether we  will let any President trample on the Constitution, whether we will sit  by and let the President take away our constitutional authority to  appropriate.   I rise today, hopeful that my Republican colleagues will speak up. In  addition to Senator Collins and Senator Murkowski, Senator Tillis  stated firmly in a recent opinion piece:         I support Trump's vision on border security. But I would       vote against the emergency.    Why does he say he would vote against the emergency declaration?  Because, he said, ``[a]s a U.S. Senator, I cannot justify providing the  executive with more ways to bypass Congress.''   Former Governor Kasich authored an opinion piece recently titled  ``It's time for Republicans in Congress to put country over party.'' He  states:         Let's be clear. This vote is not about the situation at the       border; it's about an executive power grab and, above all,       congressional respect for the democratic process.    I couldn't agree more with Governor Kasich.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the  Record the full pieces by Senator Tillis and Governor Kasich.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                 [From the Washington Post, Feb. 25, 2019]   I Support Trump's Vision on Border Security. But I Would Vote Against                               the Emergency                              (By Thom Tillis)         Thom Tillis, a Republican, is a U.S. senator from North       Carolina.        President Trump has few bigger allies than me when it comes       to supporting his vision of 21st-century border security,       encompassing a major investment in technology, personnel and       infrastructure, including new physical barriers where they       will be effective. It is a vision that will take many years       and tens of billions of dollars to fully realize, and the       president can count on me to help.        The president is rightfully frustrated with Congress's       inaction regarding the humanitarian and security crisis at       the nation's southern border. Even though Republicans and       Democrats spent the past several decades in the halls of       Congress and on the campaign trail promising the American       people that they would work to secure U.S. borders, some of       my colleagues seemingly made a politically calculated       decision to block the president's good-faith efforts to       finally get it done. They have regressed to the point where a       Democratic presidential contender such as Sen. Kirsten       Gillibrand (N.Y.) and a possible candidate, former       congressman Beto O'Rourke of Texas, are even entertaining the       possibility of tearing down existing physical barriers.       Although Trump certainly has legitimate grievances over       congressional Democrats' obstruction of border-security       funding, his national emergency declaration on Feb. 15 was       not the right answer.        From the perspective of the chief executive, I can       understand why the president would assert his powers with the       emergency declaration to implement his policy agenda. After       all, nearly every president in the modern era has similarly       pushed the boundaries of presidential power, many with the       helping hand of Congress.        In fact, if I were the leader of the Constitution's Article       II branch, I would probably declare an emergency and use all       the tools at my disposal as well. But I am not. I am a member       of the Senate, and I have grave concerns when our institution       looks the other way at the expense of weakening Congress's       power.        It is my responsibility to be a steward of the Article I       branch, to preserve the separation of powers and to curb the       kind of executive overreach that Congress has allowed to       fester for the better part of the past century. I stood by       that principle during the Obama administration, and I stand       by it now.        Conservatives rightfully cried foul when President Barack       Obama used executive action to completely bypass Congress and       unilaterally provide deferred action to undocumented adults       who had knowingly violated the nation's immigration laws.       Some prominent Republicans went so far as to proclaim that       Obama was acting more like an ``emperor'' or ``king'' than a       president.        There is no intellectual honesty in now turning around and       arguing that there's an imaginary asterisk attached to       executive overreach--that it's acceptable for my party but       not thy party.        Republicans need to realize that this will lead inevitably       to regret when a Democrat once again controls the White       House, cites the precedent set by Trump, and declares his or       her own national emergency to advance a policy that couldn't       gain congressional approval.        This isn't just conjecture. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-      Calif.) and other prominent Democratic elected officials have       already hinted that emergency declarations will be part of       the playbook for the left, with Pelosi musing, ``just think       about what a president with different values can present to       the American people.''        Conservatives should take these warnings seriously. They       should be thinking about whether they would accept the       prospect of a President Bernie Sanders declaring a national       emergency to implement parts of the radical Green New Deal; a       President Elizabeth Warren declaring a national emergency to       shut down banks and take over the nation's financial       institutions; or a President Cory Booker declaring a national       emergency to restrict Second Amendment rights.        Those on the left and the right who are making Trump's       emergency declaration a simple political litmus test of       whether one supports or opposes the president and his       policies are missing the mark. This is about the separation       of powers and whether Congress will support or oppose a new       precedent of executive power that will have major       consequences.        As a U.S. senator, I cannot justify providing the executive       with more ways to bypass Congress. As a conservative, I       cannot endorse a precedent that I know future left-wing       presidents will exploit to advance radical policies that will       erode economic and individual freedoms.        These are the reasons I would vote in favor of the       resolution disapproving of the president's national-emergency       declaration, if and when it comes before the Senate.                                   ____                          [From CNN, Mar. 12, 2019]  John Kasich: It's Time for Republicans in Congress To Put Country Over                                   Party                            (By John R. Kasich)         John R. Kasich is the former governor of Ohio, serving from       2011 to 2019. A Republican, he was previously a member of the       House of Representatives. He is the author of ``Two Paths:       America Divided or United.'' The opinions expressed in this       commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN.        During my 18 years as a member of Congress--not so long       ago--my colleagues and I didn't robotically toe the line with       the President. Republicans didn't vote in lockstep with       Republican presidents, not even Ronald Reagan. And Democrats       departed from their party's president when they thought it       was the right thing to do. We took party loyalty seriously,       but we gave even greater weight to principle.        In recent decades, of course, partisanship in the House and       Senate has become far more intense, and the nation is worse       as a result. But even now, in this hyper-partisan era, there       comes a time when our elected leaders must put country over       party.        One such moment: the ongoing debate over President Donald       Trump's national emergency declaration to fund construction       of a wall on the US-Mexico border. Sometime soon, Republican       senators will have the opportunity to demonstrate--as 13       Republicans did in the House--their love of country and their       commitment to constitutional values by voting for the       resolution to disapprove the President's emergency       declaration. Instead of acting like they're afraid of their       own shadows, Senate Republicans must use this vote to--at       long last--stand up and defend the Constitution.               the real national emergency is not at the border         Let's be clear. This vote is not about the situation at the       border; it's about an executive power grab and, above all,       congressional respect for the democratic process. Whatever       their views on the border situation--which I agree is       serious--Republicans should oppose the President's       declaration. Standing against the President on this issue is       important not just for today, but for our future.        For years, Republicans decried executive overreach by       President Barack Obama. If we are serious about our       constitutional values, we can't complain only about actions       by the other party. We have to apply consistent principles       whenever we have a president from our own party as well.        We should be especially concerned about President Trump's       effort to circumvent Congress simply by invoking the magic       word ``emergency.'' If presidents can do end runs around       Congress merely by claiming ``emergency,'' then there's       almost no limit to executive authority. This would create a       gravely dangerous situation, not only for this president but       for all future presidents as well.        Legal scholars are debating what the word ``emergency''       means as it's used in the National Emergencies Act, and the       courts will resolve that question if Congress fails to       override an expected presidential veto of their resolution of       disapproval. But there's no real doubt about what the word is       supposed to mean. A president's emergency powers are intended       to be used for addressing sudden or unexpected events, not       just serious problems. Indeed, the National Emergencies Act,       passed in 1976, aimed to curtail--not expand--presidential       discretion to declare emergencies.        What's also clear is how emergency declarations should be       used: To address problems in ways for which there is not only       a general consensus, but also where the pressing nature of       the challenge requires speedy action without the formal and       oftentimes slow process of congressional action. Nothing       about the current situation matches up to that standard.        President Trump's emergency declaration for border wall       funding is almost the antithesis of that model. The problems       at our border may indeed be severe, but they are chronic.       Even more significantly, there is  [[Page S1861]]       not a consensus to pursue the President's approach. To the       contrary, Republicans and Democrats in Congress did negotiate       a compromise--and the President signed it into law. But then       he proceeded to turn his back on the negotiation, the process       and the agreement by declaring a national emergency.        That kind of unilateralism not only conflicts with our       Constitution, it amplifies the worst of our present-day       politics. President Trump is playing to his base, focused on       politics not policy. The result of his approach is more       bitterness and alienation, less trust between parties and a       continued loss of public confidence in our government. It       leaves both parties--our government--far less able to do the       things the American people need and desire. I am proud to       have joined with three dozen former Republican members of       Congress to urge those Republicans currently serving there to       stand for our values and by standing up to the President       against his emergency declaration. President Trump remains       popular within our party, but so is a deeply ingrained       commitment to constitutional conservativism. Opposing your       party's president is never easy, but I am hopeful that       Republicans will vote to uphold the constitutional principles       I know they hold dear.     Madam President, to get this wall money, the President  caused the longest government shutdown in our Nation. The shutdown  caused hardship for millions of Federal employees and lasting pain for  thousands of Federal contractors, not to mention the millions of  Americans who were denied services for 35 days--services they paid for  with their tax dollars.   I visited with New Mexicans hurt by the shutdown and it was very,  very painful to hear their stories.   In the end, Congress decided on a bipartisan basis not to spend the  $5.7 billion the President demanded for his wall. He got $1.3 billion.  I didn't want to see that much, and I wanted to see more restrictions  as to specifically what it was going to be spent for, but it was a  hard-fought compromise, and a deal is a deal.   Congress's determination should have ended the debate for this fiscal  year, the year that we are in.   Now the President is asking Congress for $8.6 billion for the border  wall next year. That is his prerogative, but make no mistake, it is not  only Congress's prerogative, it is Congress's constitutional  responsibility to decide if he gets that money. As the old saying goes,  the President proposes and Congress disposes. President Trump is being  treated no differently than all previous Presidents. That is how our  constitutional system works--or at least how it is supposed to work.   The President's emergency declaration is an end run around Congress,  plain and simple. If any Democratic President issued an emergency  declaration like this, say for climate change or gun safety funding,  Republicans in this body would scream bloody murder and vote to  disapprove.   I am on record that climate change is one of the most pressing issues  on our planet, and I am on record that gun violence is a national  crisis. I have voted for and proposed actual legislation on these  topics, as our system is supposed to work. No previous President has  used the National Emergency Act to bypass the appropriations process  like this. Our Constitution, the rule of law, separation of powers--all  of these rise far above the day-to-day controversies like the  President's border wall.   On a practical note, the President wants to take real money away from  real military construction projects, which will have a real impact on  national security. These military construction projects have been  vetted through years of scrutiny, through the military, through  numerous congressional committees in Congress, and they are projects  deemed essential to national security--projects all across the Nation,  in our States, that are now at risk.   We have a long list of military construction projects by the  President. Yet he has not bothered to tell us which projects would be  cut to build his wall. Will he raid $793 million to rebuild Camp  Lejeune, NC, after the devastation from Hurricane Florence?   Will he steal up to $800 million for Navy ship maintenance to make  sure that accidents like what happened to the USS McCain and USS  Fitzgerald never happen again?   Will he raid $125 million from my State of New Mexico for Holloman  Air Force Base to develop unmanned aerial vehicles to track terrorists  and for White Sands Missile Range to build a badly needed information  systems facility?   The answer is that we don't know, but these critical projects in all  of our States are at risk.   We each need to think about our States and the people we were sent  here to represent. I am from one of the four States that border Mexico,  one of the four States that would be the most directly impacted by any  border wall, and I am here to state there is no national security  emergency along my State's border with Mexico. What is happening at our  border does not justify the use of this authority.   New Mexico's border communities are flourishing with economic,  cultural, and educational activity. Border communities are as safe as  or safer than others in the interior.   This is not a partisan view along the border. Republican William Hurd  represents more than 500 miles of the Texas border with Mexico. He not  only believes the President's emergency declaration is  unconstitutional, but he also thinks the President's wall is ``the most  expensive and least effective way to do border security.''   Again, whether you support or oppose the border wall is not an issue.  What is at issue is our oath to support and defend the Constitution,  whether any President can toss Congress aside and raid critical funds  at will.   We have an opportunity to stand up to an unconstitutional power grab.  I urge everyone in this Chamber to seize that opportunity.   With this, I yield to Senator Collins, who, from the beginning, has  worked with me as we have our resolution in, and we are working hard to  make sure that we stand up for the Constitution.   I yield the floor.
