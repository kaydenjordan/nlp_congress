 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my concerns  with the ongoing censorship of conservative voices.   We are all aware of the leftist bias and discrimination on social  media. The recent Twitter files tell a sinister tale of censorship and  discrimination against conservatives and Republicans across the  country. But the campaign of censorship and discrimination by the left  also extends to satellite and cable TV.   The Nation's largest satellite TV provider, DIRECTV, has threatened  another conservative-leaning cable news network. First, it was OAN a  year ago, and now DIRECTV has threatened to deplatform Newsmax, the  fourth largest cable news network.   Competition is the heart of the American economy, but the mainstream  media is an anti-American institution that has no regard for the First  Amendment rights of conservatives or protecting a platform for all  viewpoints.   DIRECTV'S actions are a clear effort to discriminate against  conservative voices.   DIRECTV pays leftist outlets to carry their content on their  satellite network, but conservative outlets are not treated the same.   Many liberal channels, with a fraction of Newsmax's audience, receive  payment from DIRECTV. This bias is blatant and egregious, and Congress  should look into this censorship and address the discrimination against  conservative voices.                            ____________________
