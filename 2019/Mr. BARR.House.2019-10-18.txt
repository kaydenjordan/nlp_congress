 Madam Speaker, we know the Democrats' hyperpartisan closed- door impeachment process lacks any semblance of fundamental fairness.  We know from the transcript between President Trump and President  Zelensky that there was no quid pro quo.   But what many people don't know is this: In 2014, this House  unanimously passed the Ukraine Freedom Support Act, which tasks the  executive branch to use U.S. assistance to bolster democratic  institutions of Ukraine and counter corruption and improve transparency  and accountability of the Ukrainian Government. Every Democrat voted  for this measure.   In 2017, this House overwhelmingly passed the National Defense  Authorization Act, which required the administration to certify as a  condition of providing assistance that the Government of Ukraine has  taken substantial actions to counter corruption and increase  accountability. 145 Democrats voted for that.   In 2019, the NDAA that passed this House required that certification  requirement again, and 139 Democrats voted for that.   So here is the bottom line: Given recent elections, President Trump  not only had the authority to address the issue of corruption in the  call with President Zelensky, he had a legal duty to speak and secure  assurances from the new Ukrainian Government that those anticorruption  measures would be carried forward. The Democrats are trying to impeach  the President for following a law that they voted for.                            ____________________
