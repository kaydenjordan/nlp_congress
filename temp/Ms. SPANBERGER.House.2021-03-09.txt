 Madam Speaker, I stand here to honor the life and  memory of William Edward Quarles, Jr.   Mr. Quarles was a pillar of the Goochland County, Virginia,  community, and he constantly worked to make Goochland stronger. He  encouraged his neighbors to get involved in local decisionmaking, and  he cared about improving public safety and protecting the families that  called Goochland home.   William was a dedicated leader with a heart for public service. He  served on the Goochland County Board of Supervisors for 8 years,  serving as chairman three times. He served for 6 years on the Goochland  Planning Commission, including two times as chairman. He also served on  the State EMS Advisory Board and as a representative for the  [[Page H1129]]  Virginia Association of Counties. In these roles, he was skilled at  finding consensus and preventing divisiveness.   William was also a fierce champion of public education. Throughout  his life, he fought to make sure that every child in the Goochland area  could access quality education and new opportunities. He was a  cofounder of the Goochland Education Foundation, and he was serving on  the Goochland County School Board at the time of his death.   William took on each day's new challenges with an unforgettable  vigor, a bright smile, and a contagious laugh and enthusiasm. He always  remained positive. His enthusiasm was contagious.   People talked about how you couldn't talk to William without him  pulling you into some sort of volunteerism, some level of civic  engagement, some plan that he was working on. He helped people become  their better selves, their more engaged selves, their more community- focused selves.   Madam Speaker, last month, William passed away at the age of 68. He  left a community mourning. A bright spot, a bright man, and a man who  would bring such kindness to every endeavor, William liked to use a  simple acronym, one that his father-in-law had also used. The acronym  is SMILE:   S--Seek to understand before being understood;   M--Make the other person feel important;   I--It is not about me;   L--Listen twice as much as you speak;   E--Enthusiastically and quickly admit it when you are wrong.   Madam Speaker, when I began running for Congress, William gave me  these lessons, this acronym SMILE. He said: ``Remember this. This is  how you best serve people.''   As our Commonwealth and our Nation face new challenges, we would do  well to follow William's advice as we seek solutions and work to come  together.   Madam Speaker, today, my thoughts are with his wife, Ruth; his sons,  William and Christopher; his friends and family; and the greater  Goochland community. William was a friend to everyone, and he  considered everyone a friend.                            ____________________
