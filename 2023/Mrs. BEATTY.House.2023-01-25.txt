 Madam Speaker, I rise today early to kick off Black  History Month. Cassady Davis, a third grader from Evening Street  Elementary School, we salute her.   She is the daughter of McKenzie and Shawna Davis. She enjoys soccer,  swimming, reading, and spending time with her sister, Collins.   Students have the opportunity to select past and present-day leaders  for their Black history showcase. I am honored that Cassady chose me as  her modern-day leader.   I commend the work of America's educators who are instilling in our  students the importance of Black history, which is American history,  and empowering young girls like Cassady to become the Nation's next  generation of leaders.   So to all listening today, we salute a 9-year-old, Cassady Davis.                            ____________________
