 Thank you, Mr. President.   We have many important responsibilities as U.S. Senators. We often  have to make very difficult decisions. Deciding to vote against cloture  and confirmation for Judge Gorsuch has been a tough decision.   Since coming to the Senate, I have been a strong advocate for  reforming the rules, to curb abuses to ensure the body can function,  and to make sure that the President's nominees are treated fairly. I  believe our constitutional duty to provide advice and consent is one of  the most important of all of our responsibilities as Senators,  especially for nominees to our Nation's highest Court, and I believe  that withholding consent should be rare--rare but not unheard of.  Sometimes circumstances will be so extraordinary that filibustering a  Supreme Court nominee is necessary. The gang of 14 knew this. That was  the group of 14 Senators who forged a compromise in 2005. Three of them  are still in the Senate. Their agreement allowed some controversial  judicial nominees to be confirmed to appellate courts, but it also  allowed the Senate to avoid triggering the nuclear option, and it  addressed how they would weigh future nominations.   The gang of 14 agreed to the following: ``Nominees should be  filibustered only under extraordinary circumstances and each signatory  must use his or her own discretion and judgment in determining whether  such circumstances exist.''   I think that is a good standard, to only filibuster a nominee under  extraordinary circumstances. Unfortunately, in my evaluation of Judge  Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court, I can't think of more  extraordinary circumstances.   First, this wasn't President Trump's seat to fill. Justice Scalia  died on February 13, 2016. President Obama still had nearly 1 year at  that point to serve in his term. So President Obama fulfilled his  constitutional duty. He nominated one of the most qualified nominees in  the history of the Court, Judge Merrick Garland. Shortly before Judge  Garland was nominated, Senator Hatch, one of our most respected  Republican colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, said Judge Garland  would be a great pick. Senator Hatch went on to say that President  Obama ``probably won't do that because this appointment is about the  election.'' But President Obama did do it. Judge Garland is not just a  fine jurist, he is an exceptional human being. Judge Garland's lifelong  commitment to public service is well known. He deserved far better  treatment by the Senate majority.    Judge Garland was denied a hearing. Many of my Republican colleagues  wouldn't even give him the courtesy of a meeting, and he never got a  vote, which was a disgrace. It is an injustice that needs to be  remedied before I could ever consider voting for Judge Gorsuch.   President Trump could fix this. He could make a commitment to  nominate Judge Garland to the next vacant seat on the Court. It would  be the right thing to do. I have been very open that I believe the  Senate has become dysfunctional, but what the majority did last year  was unprecedented. Things went from bad to rock bottom.   Being senatorial used to mean something. The Republican majority has  shattered that tradition for purely partisan reasons. In fact, the  majority leader has publicly stated: ``One of my proudest moments was  when I told Obama `you will not fill this Supreme Court vacancy.'''  That is a violation of the U.S. Constitution's requirement that the  Senate provide advice and consent.   Now, in 2017, Senator McConnell has guaranteed Judge Gorsuch's  confirmation, even before he had his hearing. For him the outcome has  been a foregone conclusion. So we see there is no advice and consent  now, either, just the exercise of power to block a nominee from another  party. But President Trump could help heal that deeply partisan wound  inflicted by his party. There is still time for both sides to come  together and work out an agreement with bipartisanship and fairness  first, and put aside the bitter partisan fighting that has divided the  Congress and our Nation.   There is also a pragmatic reason for President Trump to appoint Judge  Garland to the next seat. President Trump needs to ask himself if he  wants to be subject to the McConnell precedent. Is he willing to accept  that he only gets to appoint Justices for 3 years? If a Supreme Court  vacancy occurs in 2020, does President Trump understand that it is not  his vacancy to fill? That is the absurd standard that Leader McConnell  has established. If the Republican majority is dead-set on changing the  rules to jam this nominee through after all that has happened, then we  need to talk about this.   Perhaps the best thing to do in order to ensure the President  understands the gravity of the Republicans' obstruction of his  predecessor is to go ahead and put the McConnell rule in place for  President Trump. Let's establish in our rule that President Trump only  gets 3 years to appoint Justices. We can do this with a simple standing  order. The majority leader believed President Obama should only have 3  [[Page S2334]]  years to appoint Justices, certainly the same standard must apply to  President Trump. If the Republican majority thought that their policy  in 2016 was good for President Obama, it should be good for President  Trump. What is fair is fair.   I have a standing order drafted that would do that, and I hope an  agreement can be reached to rectify the injustice that was done to  Judge Garland, and I hope that Republicans will decide against using  the nuclear option. But if that doesn't happen, I will call on the  Senate to adopt this standing order so that President Trump was bound  by the same restrictions as President Obama.   If we are going to change the rules tomorrow, then let's get the  Republican majority on record. Are they prepared to hold President  Trump to the same unjust standard as President Obama? We can find out.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  the text of my standing order at the end of my remarks.   Unfortunately, Judge Garland's unacceptable treatment isn't the only  concern that guides my decision to vote against Judge Gorsuch. Like  many things in the Trump administration, there is no shortage of  extraordinary circumstances. Perhaps the most serious is the cloud of  suspicion over his Presidency.   U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that the Russian government  interfered in the U.S. Presidential election and that it interfered to  help Candidate Trump. There are unexplained ties between the President,  his campaign staff, his associates, and Russian officials. People close  to the President had meetings and telephone calls with Russian  officials during the campaign and transition, and, most critically, the  FBI and the Department of Justice are investigating whether the  President and his associates coordinated or conspired with the Russian  Government to interfere with the Presidential election. It is an  investigation that began last July and is likely to continue for  months.   If the President or his close advisers worked with Russia to help him  win the U.S. election, do we really want to let him appoint a Justice  to the Supreme Court, someone who could be on the Court for 30 years or  more? There is no reason to rush this nomination.   Remember, Republicans had no problem letting Judge Garland's  appointment languish for 293 days, and President Obama wasn't under  investigation. Judge Gorsuch was nominated just 64 days ago. If  Republicans had treated Judge Garland's nomination with the same  expediency, he would have been confirmed last May when President Obama  still had 8 months in office. The unacceptable treatment of Judge  Garland and the investigation into Russia's influence in the election  are reasons enough to vote against Judge Gorsuch.   But there is one more critical issue: the nominee himself. I have met  with Judge Gorsuch and followed the hearing in the Senate Judiciary  Committee. I carefully studied his record, and based on all of this  information, I can't support his confirmation. The Supreme Court  changes people's lives. Its decisions stand for generations. It is  essential that Justices understand not only how these issues impact our  democracy but how they affect people's lives, and that they consider  them free of ideology.   Our meeting and the Senate hearings were Judge Gorsuch's opportunity  to convince me that he will be an independent mind on the Court. He  failed to answer questions that were critical for me--his position on  the rights of working mothers, whether women can choose their own  health care decisions, LGBTQ rights, and dark money in our elections,  just to name a few. But what I found most troubling is that he failed  to convince me that he would be an independent voice on the Court.   In just the last couple of months, the President has taken  constitutionally questionable actions affecting Muslim immigrants,  freedom of speech, and religion. The FBI is investigating his campaign,  and he faces scrutiny about whether his company is benefitting from his  office. All of these issues could well come in front of and before the  Supreme Court. It is more important now than ever before that we have a  neutral, clearminded Justice sitting on the bench. After carefully  considering all these issues, I cannot support Judge Gorsuch's  confirmation. It is not an easy decision, but I believe it is the right  one for our country.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                 RESOLUTION   Title: Prohibiting consideration of a nomination to the Supreme Court  of the United States during the final year of the term of office of the                                 President.         Resolved,       SECTION I. PROHIBITION ON CONSIDERING NOMINATIONS TO THE                     SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES DURING THE                     FINAL YEAR OF THE TERM OF OFFICE OF THE                     PRESIDENT.         During the period beginning on January 20, 2020 and ending       at noon on January 20, 2021, it shall not be in order in the       Senate to consider the nomination of an individual to the       position of Chief Justice of the United States or a position       as a justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.     With that I yield the floor.
