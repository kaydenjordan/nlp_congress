 Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Carter for yielding and  for his efforts here this evening to shine a light on an issue that we  all know is affecting far too many Americans.   It is a shame to keep doing things when they don't work. Something  has to be done.   Madam Speaker, the rising cost of prescription drugs is causing  significant financial burdens for millions of Americans, patients,  seniors, and our businesses. Too often, Americans have to choose  between much-needed prescriptions and household expenses.   However, President Trump made it clear to the American people during  his State of the Union Address that lowering the cost of prescription  drugs was one of his top priorities. As we have seen throughout his  Presidency, promises made are promises kept.   Earlier this year, the Trump administration issued a proposal that  would create incentives to lower list prices and reduce out-of-pocket  spending on prescription drugs, potentially becoming the most sweeping  change to how American drugs are priced, a much-needed change.   By delivering discounts directly to patients at the pharmacy counter  and bringing long-overdue transparency to a broken system, we are  putting patients and seniors first. That is how it should be.   It is high time to end these kickbacks to pharmacy middlemen,  referred to as PBMs, in this process of dealing with these DIRs, which  are putting many of those in the pharmaceutical business in my district  out of business.   I thank the administration, Congressman Carter, and my fellow  colleagues this evening for their commitment to righting this ship and  reducing drug prices for all Americans.
