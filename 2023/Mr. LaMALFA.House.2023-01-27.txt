 Mr. Speaker, I rise in sadness to acknowledge the loss  of a local icon and hero, Ernie Reynolds, Sr., of Oroville, California.   Ernie was born in a very small cabin in the woods in 1930. He was one  of ten children. Indeed, he knew the value of hard work and faith.   He left home at the age of 12, and at only 16 he wanted to join the  military. So he embellished his age and signed up for the Coast Guard.  He went on and eventually served in the Merchant Marines during the  Korean war and sailed around the world seven times.   After his service, Ernie and his wife, Sally, settled down in  Oroville. He founded A-1 Masonry which went on to build many local  projects, including brickwork on banks, the historic Eagles Hall, a  sporting goods store, the Chinese Temple, and McDonald's, among many  others.   He knew the value of service, having served on several local boards  in districts that make his community better.   He was a local hero. One day in 1972, he was testifying at a trial in  the downtown courthouse. A gunman came in, shot the judge, and killed  an attorney. Ernie managed to wrestle this guy down and disarm him. For  his courage, Ernie was awarded the Certificate of Valor from the State  Attorney General.   Ernie raised a strong family who also knew the value of hard work,  serving their community, and their Christian faith.   Ernie was preceded in death by his wife, Sally. After 72 years, he  still has a beautiful, strong family who are going strong in Oroville,  California.   Ernie was the man to come see and visit whether it was about politics  or to just spend time in his living room or out on his front porch. We  are going to miss him. He was a true hero and icon in our community.                            ____________________
