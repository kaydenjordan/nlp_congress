 Mr. Speaker, I take great pleasure in sharing this  story of Rabbi Avrohom Hoffman, a truly remarkable man whose presence  has illuminated our community for decades.   Rabbi Hoffman has called Washington Heights his home for more than 35  years, fathering nine children with his wonderful wife, Miriam. He has  served our community by teaching precollege students at a yeshiva and  by providing spiritual guidance to those in great need.   I am honored to have such an exceptional individual in my district. I  was recently informed that Rabbi Hoffman has donated his kidney to a  62-year-old woman diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease. His  boundless acts of philanthropy serve as a testament to his tremendous  character and remind us of the power of human kindness.   He serves as a role model to all of us, and I am proud to have  recognized a man of such compassion and virtue on this floor.  [[Page H6562]]                                ____________________
