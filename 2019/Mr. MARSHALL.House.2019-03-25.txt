 Mr. Speaker, this past week, President Trump and  Secretary Pompeo took a bold step to affirm Israel's sovereignty over  the Golan Heights. I support this administration and our long-time  friend and ally, Israel, in this fight to protect their homeland.   I have stood on the mountains of the Golan where Abraham and his  nephew Lot parted ways some 4,000 years ago. I could hear the cannons  and the missiles and the tanks just miles away in war-stricken Syria.  We learned how, in a matter of hours during the Yom Kippur war of 1974,  Syrian forces overran the Golan, jeopardizing both Israeli and American  security.   This small range of mountains, less than 125 miles from Jerusalem,  serves as a buffer from Israel and its many foes who desire nothing  more than to wipe them off of the face of the Earth.   From the 3rd millennium B.C., the occupants of the Golan Heights have  included the Amorites, Arameans, Israelites, Assyrians, Babylonians,  Persians, the Israelites again, Alexander the Great, and the Roman  Empire. In later centuries, Christians crusaded, Mongols ruled, and the  Ottomans conquered the land.    Starting in 1885, Jewish families bought and lived on the land in the  Golan Heights, and stayed there until 1920, when riots drove them out.  For the next 40 years, the boundaries of this area were debated and  defined by the French and the British.   We all know the State of Israel was born in 1948, and the Golan was  mutually shared with neighboring countries. This, however, led to  constant raids and civil unrest in the region and debate over a scarce  item in the area, water.   Finally, in the 1960s, Syria ignored previous water agreements and  attempted to divert water from Israel. This led to the armed War over  Water, which was won by Israel in 1967, and pushed the Syrians out of  the Golan, leaving Israel in control once again.   This is where most leftist naysayers will begin their history, as if  Israel had no claim to the land in the first place or as if it never  had been contested.   This matters for America for a variety of reasons. Set aside the fact  that Israel is our most loyal and strategically vital ally in the  Middle East. Let's look at Russia. Americans are rightly concerned  about the cyber and geopolitical moves of that adversarial nation. The  Golan, however, is an example of where those on the left are turning a  blind eye.   Since the time of Peter the Great and Catherine the Great, Russia has  sought a warm-water port in the Mediterranean and to stake their claim  to land south of the Black Sea. Not only does Syria provide them both,  it also presents an opportunity for Russia and their ally Iran, as the  leaders have said, to wipe Israel off the map.   We cannot let this happen. We mustn't let this happen. We must  continue to stand up to thugs like Putin and Assad, and with our  friends in Israel.                            There Was No Collusion     Mr. Speaker, no collusion, no collusion, no collusion.   That is right. After 2 years, Mr. Speaker, let me say that again:  there is no collusion.   After 2 years and a cost of more than $25 million, that is $50,000 a  day spent on this witch hunt of taxpayer money, there was no collusion.   And indeed, there was no pot of gold at the end of the media's  rainbow; nothing besides fool's gold yet again.   Mr. Speaker, how can you spend $50,000 a day on an investigation?   As I think back, I may have been the first person in the Chamber to  call this investigation for what it was: a witch hunt.   Now, I am not a lawyer, but Kansas common sense would suggest if  there was no collusion, no corrupt intent by the President, and no  crime committed, there would be absolutely no case for an obstruction  of justice charge. But I am sure Kansas common sense is the last thing  on the minds of some Members of Congress.   So now, during every waking hour for 675 straight days, Democrats and  the media have had a field day smearing the President, his friends, and  his family.  [[Page H2767]]    They have hired 19 lawyers, 40 FBI agents, and issued nearly 3,000  subpoenas, all of which have further confirmed what we already knew  before the investigation started: there was no collusion.                                time  1215    Importantly, Mueller confirmed that no one with the Trump campaign  conspired or coordinated with the Russian Government. Additionally, we  found out through this investigation the Russians made many attempts to  offer to help the Trump campaign, and time and time again, the Trump  team stood up and rejected Russia.   I want the media, which spent thousands of hours painting a picture  of collusion and conspiracy, to cover these Mueller findings that show  the President stood firm against the Russian's multiple attempts. And I  ask the Democrats, who misled the public for months, to come forward  and speak the truth.   Instead, what does the biased media and Democrats say in response to  Mueller's verdict? Absolutely nothing. You could almost hear a pin drop  as I walked through the Capitol today. It is so quiet. No Democrats are  here today for morning-hour debate. What does that say?   As I stand on the House floor today, I have one question for this  Chamber and for this Nation: Can we please move on and work with our  President, rather than against him, and focus on policy rather than  fantasy?                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I had a young family in my office this morning, a  wonderful, nice-looking 11-year-old boy who was in my office today with  his dad, his mom, and several other people from southwest Kansas. He  looked at me and he said: Congressman Marshall, will I be able to run  cattle when I get older? My great-grandfather ran cattle; my  grandfather ran cattle; my daddy ran cattle; and I would like to run  cattle someday, but this Green New Deal scares me.   He said: Will the Green New Deal keep me from running cattle?   I had to say: Unfortunately, yes, it would.   The Green New Deal would be the end of agriculture as we know it in  Kansas. Agriculture makes up 40 percent of the economy of Kansas. For  all practical purposes, it would be the end of the Kansas economy.   Another large part of our economy is oil and gas, and the Green New  Deal would be the end of that.   I always try to think about the impact of something like the Green  New Deal. First of all, it would triple your taxes. I think that would  be well proven. But I always am especially concerned for that young  family, maybe that family that I delivered 5 or 10 or 15 years ago, and  they have two or three kids at home. How would the new Green New Deal  impact them? First of all, their grocery bill is going to double or  triple, I suppose. They would have to replace all the appliances in  their home. Their utility bill is going to go up.    Then I think about the price of gas. I always noticed in my  obstetrical practice that whenever the price of gasoline got about $3 a  gallon, women would suddenly ask: Do we have to come back this often?  Quite a few of my patients live 60 or 90 miles from me, and it was  quite a challenge to come visit us. When the price of gasoline got  about $3 a gallon, they didn't want to come quite as often.   I can't help but think what the Green New Deal would do to the cost  of gasoline, if there is such a thing. I suppose we would all be  driving electric cars.   Where I am from, I only wish that we could hop on a train and take  public transportation, but there are just not enough trains to go  around in Kansas. We are lucky to have roads in most places where we  live, so public transportation just isn't an option.   All that being said, Mr. Speaker, I think, like the gentleman from  Arizona, I want to leave this country and I want to leave the State of  Kansas cleaner than I found it. I am so proud that Kansas waters and  Kansas air are cleaner today than when I was growing up. I am very  proud of that. I want to keep going in that direction.   I am very proud that the carbon imprint from the United States is  less today than it was in 2004, and I want to keep going in that  direction. But it is my belief that innovation is what is going to  drive this and keep us going in that direction.   I am so proud of what the American entrepreneurs have done in Kansas  and across this country, our ability to get more natural gas and to  make all of our refineries cleaner. Where we produce electricity, so  many of them are 97 percent cleaner.   The issue of ecology is a worldwide problem. It is a problem that the  United States cannot cure by itself. We need to be a leader and keep  going in the direction we are going.   I look forward to working with folks across the aisle to come up with  real solutions that will really work for this country. I think that the  American innovator will do great things and that better days are ahead  for America.                                time  2000
