 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the young  men of Warwick School District's baseball team.   The Warwick Warriors baseball beat Liberty High to close out a  successful 23-2 season by winning the district's first PIAA 6A State  Championship.   The game, held last month, was impacted by a prolonged weather delay,  but the warriors held firm to the early lead to capture the  championship.   Throughout their dominating season, the Warriors also clinched the  District Three title, as well.   Madam Speaker, it is no surprise that the community is very proud of  these students for their achievement on the baseball diamond. It was  great to see the local law enforcement and volunteer firefighters join  with the community by participating in a parade to honor their  achievement.   Congratulations to the members and coaches of the Warwick Warrior  State championship baseball team. The whole community is wishing them  continued success. May they carry the lessons they learned playing as  part of a successful team toward their future goals.                            ____________________
