 Madam Speaker, some of my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle have spent this debate lecturing us about foundational  principles in this country. The foundational document of this great  Republic is the Declaration of Independence, with the words: ``We hold  these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.''   Those words were eloquent in their articulation and complete in their  application. It did not apply to African Americans; it did not apply to  women; it did not apply to Native Americans; and it certainly did not  apply to members of the LGBTQ community.   Now, we have come a long way in America, but we still have a long way  to go. The progress has been made, as the great Barbara Jordan once  indicated, through a process of amendment and ratification and court  decision and legislation. That is what we are doing today.   If you believe in liberty and justice for all, support the Equality  Act. If you believe in equal protection under the law, support the  Equality Act. If you believe truly, as my religion teaches me, that we  are all God's children, support the Equality Act.   Love does not discriminate; neither should the law.
