 Mr. President, I know that the Democratic leader is  scheduled to speak next, but if there is a minute that I could take in  between, I just wanted to comment on my colleague who spoke yesterday,  Senator Collins. I had wanted to come to the floor to speak on her  behalf, but too many other people had been speaking at that time.  People had remarked on her comments and reflected on the fact that she  had done her homework, and she, indeed, had. I, simply, wanted to relay  this anecdote.   When I helped to introduce Judge Kavanaugh to my fellow former  Senators, former colleagues, I think of all of the meetings that we  had, and many of them were lawyers who are Senators. Probably the most  thorough meeting of all was that held with Senator Collins. She had  clearly done her homework, and the interview with Judge Kavanaugh  consumed more than 2 hours without a break. It was a grilling that  could have been done by any fine lawyer because she had clearly done  her homework and was very well prepared, and I know she did further  followup after that.   I do want to commend her for the depth and the breadth of her  comments. As the Wall Street Journal said this morning, she not only  debated like it used to be done in this body--with evidence and sound  reasoning--but also with a reference to our founding principles and the  higher things that should motivate our public service and our  discussions here on the Senate floor.   So I wanted to take this opportunity to commend her for her remarks  and to tell those who don't know her that this was par for the course.  Her performance was magnificent, but it was not out of the ordinary for  Senator Collins. I just wanted my colleagues to know that.   I thank the Presiding Officer.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
