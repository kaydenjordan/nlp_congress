 Madam Speaker, I thank Representative  Luetkemeyer for his leadership in the House Small Business Committee. I  would also like to extend my special thanks to Chairwoman Velazquez for  putting forward these very important bills.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1490, the 504  Modernization and Small Manufacturer Enhancement Act of 2021.   I was proud to join my colleagues, Representatives Craig, Davids, and  Chabot, to introduce this bipartisan bill to modernize the SBA's 504  loan program. The program was established with the mission to  incentivize economic growth and job creation by providing small  businesses with affordable long-term financing.   Our bill will provide the SBA with the tools to assist small  businesses as they recover during COVID-19. H.R. 1490 would expand  eligibility of 504 loans for small businesses that have focused on  workforce development, revitalized areas hit hard by the pandemic or  disaster areas, and implemented energy-efficient products, or have 10  or fewer employees. These additions will strengthen the 504 loan  program for the long run and help small businesses in my community  access much-needed capital.   The bill will also streamline the closing process of 504 loans.  Specifically, H.R. 1490 allows Certified Development Companies to  rectify documentation without the implicit approval of the SBA. These  corrections will allow small businesses to make investments in their  community or hire more workers without delay.   Lastly, the bill would support our small manufacturers to ensure that  our community's manufacturing base remains strong and competitive  during these difficult times.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support H.R. 1490.  [[Page H1772]]         Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member  Luetkemeyer for yielding.   I rise in strong support of H.R. 1482, the 504 Credit Risk Management  Improvement Act of 2021.   I am proud to have joined my colleagues, Representatives Angie Craig,   Dan Bishop, and Sharice Davids, to introduce this important bipartisan  bill.   The Small Business Administration's 504 loan program provides small  businesses with affordable long-term financing to purchase major fixed  assets, such as machinery and real estate. This bill would ensure that  our taxpayers' hard-earned dollars are spent effectively by enhancing  oversight responsibilities of the SBA Office of Credit Risk Management.   Our bill will provide the SBA with the tools to enforce penalties for  any violation of rules and regulations. By providing the SBA with these  tools, we look to strengthen the 504 loan program for many years to  come.   Additionally, this bill provides consistent and clear guidance when  requiring certain environmental certifications. This change will  provide small businesses with certainty about requirements and uniform  regulations across the country.   For any Federal program to be successful, Congress and the executive  branch must work together to ensure that we have a regulatory framework  that is efficient and able to prevent fraud and abuse of taxpayer  dollars. I commend my colleagues from both sides of the aisle for their  leadership on this important issue.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support H.R. 1482.
