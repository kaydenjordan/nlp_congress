 Mr. Chair, I just want to associate myself with the  underlying intent of my friend from North Carolina. He is right. At our  hearings, we did discover flaws in OIRA's process. And I think that his  amendment is designed to try to address that and to inject some very  needed transparency.   Unfortunately, because of the underlying bill, I am not going to  oppose my friend's amendment, but I do share the concern of my friend,  the Delegate from the Virgin Islands, and will be opposing the  underlying bill.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 26, after line 16, insert the following new       subsection:        (e) Exemption for Independent Regulatory Agencies.--The       provisions of sections 3522, 3523, and 3524 of title 44,       United States Code, as added by subsection (a), do not apply       to an independent establishment as defined in section 104 of       title 5, United States Code.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 156, the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Connolly) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.    Mr. Chairman, first, I would like to note I do oppose  the underlying bill. This bill would require independent agencies, for  the first time, to submit their rules to OIRA for review.   The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would increase  direct spending by $3 million and reduce revenues by $2 million. CBO  also estimates that the bill would cost Federal agencies an additional  $20 million in administrative costs for compliance.   The reason the bill costs money is because it does not simply codify  an executive order as its proponents suggest. The bill would require  independent agencies, for the first time, to submit  [[Page H1443]]  their rules to OIRA for review. Independent agencies such as the FCC,  SEC, and CFPB do not currently have to get the approval of the White  House for regulations they issue.   Congress designed independent agencies to be just that--independent.  This bill would enshrine in law the ability for the White House to  engage in political interference with those agencies.   The Consumer Federation of America sent a letter to House Members  today opposing this bill. The letter said, inter alia:         H.R. 1009 will jeopardize independence of agencies like the       Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Securities and       Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading       Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, as well as       other independent agencies because it will give the Office of       Information and Regulatory Affairs the ability to review       significant rules. Authorizing OIRA to conduct its own       analysis would not only add pressure from the executive       branch and add time and expense to that process, but would       also give special interests seeking to quash a safety       measure, for example, yet another avenue to prevent a rule       from ever being promulgated.    Indeed, one suspects that is the intent of the bill.   A 2013 editorial in The New York Times warned of the dangers of  subjecting independent agencies to OIRA review. The editorial foresaw  what we are now dealing with 4 years later: ``Subjecting independent  agencies to executive regulatory review would not improve the rule- making process, but it would ensure that ostensibly regulated  industries are as unregulated and deregulated as possible.''   It also said: ``There is no question that making independent agencies  less independent is a bad idea.''   My amendment would take care of that by repealing that portion of  this bill. I urge all Members to support the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time is remaining?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia has 2 minutes  remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend from Utah.   I also enjoy working with him in finding common ground; however, I  find it amusing to have myself quoted on the floor by the distinguished  chairman because, just a few minutes ago, he was talking about how  difficult it was to get compliance from OIRA to provide documents  requested on a bipartisan basis by the committee. Just a little bit  before that, my friend from North Carolina and I agreed on some real  problems in terms of the process OIRA uses in the process of its  mission. So it is hardly like our committee found or I found that OIRA  is without problem.   I believe the bottom line here, however, is independent means  independent. We created these agencies for a reason and to be  independent of White House political interference for a reason. I would  submit, respectfully, now, more than ever, we want to preserve the  independence of those organizations.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia  will be postponed.                       Announcement by the Acting Chair    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, proceedings  will now resume on those amendments printed in part B of House Report  115-21 on which further proceedings were postponed, in the following  order:   Amendment No. 3 by Mr. Young of Iowa.   Amendment No. 6 by Mr. Connolly of Virginia.   The Chair will reduce to 2 minutes the minimum time for any  electronic vote after the first vote in this series.                 Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Young of Iowa    The Acting CHAIR. The unfinished business is the demand for a  recorded vote on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Iowa (Mr.  Young) on which further proceedings were postponed and on which the  ayes prevailed by voice vote.   The Clerk will redesignate the amendment.   The Clerk redesignated the amendment.                                Recorded Vote    The Acting CHAIR. A recorded vote has been demanded.
