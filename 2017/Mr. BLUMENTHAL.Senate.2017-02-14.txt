 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                        Calling for a Special Counsel     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                        Calling for a Special Counsel     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                        Calling for a Special Counsel     Mr. President, I am here principally to speak about  the NICS Social Security Act, Congressional Review Act resolution that  is before our Chamber, but events of the last 24 hours really raise  before us the urgent and unavoidable issue of needing an investigation  into the recent activities of Michael Flynn. He resigned as the  National Security Advisor last night after revelations that he misled  Vice President Mike Pence and other top White House officials. He may  have misled the President and others in the White House, but there are  also very serious questions about who knew what when. These classic  what did they know and when did they know it questions must be answered  by an independent counsel or commission, and the reason it must be  independent is the same very profoundly important reason that I gave to  then-Nominee Jeff Sessions, now Attorney General.   The Attorney General must appoint a special counsel in cases where  there is reason to question his complete impartiality and objectivity;  the reality as well as the appearance mandate here that there be an  independent investigation by a special counsel.   Only a special counsel, independent of the Attorney General and of  the White House, can ask with penetrating, aggressive, unflinching  analysis whether the President knew before Michael Flynn made those  phone calls to the Russian Ambassador and other phone calls to other  foreign powers what the subjects of the conversations were, even  whether they were going to be made, and only an independent counsel can  know, with complete credibility and being regarded that way by the  public, as to what happened and who knew what happened and when they  knew.   This issue is about more than just a phone call to the Russian  Ambassador. It is about the integrity and honesty of public officials,  about the protections we give to our intelligence, and about the  independence of our justice system.   I certainly have respect for the Office of Attorney General, but Jeff  Sessions was deeply involved in President Trump's campaign and in the  Presidential transition. I expressed to him in the hearing on his  nomination that he would have to distance himself from an investigation  of exactly these issues to maintain impartiality and objectivity in  that investigation. So I will write to him today, and the letter will  be made public shortly, asking for an independent counsel, a special  investigator who can produce the information that is necessary for the  public to be assured that there has been an inquiry that is impartial,  objective, comprehensive, and thorough. It has to be unflinching and  unstinting, and it should be done as soon as possible.   Mr. President, I want to address the issue that is before us on the  floor relating to the Congressional Review Act resolution that we will  vote on shortly and in my view that will undermine existing law if it  is passed. Too many times in recent years we have had the terrible  responsibility of bearing witness to the trauma and grief that follow  gun violence. We see it in our streets every day, not just in Sandy  Hook, which every day weighs on our minds and thoughts and hearts in  Connecticut but the more than 30,000 deaths every year and countless  injures all across the country in big and small towns, the streets of  Hartford as well as rural and suburban communities.   I am far from the only one in this Chamber who has borne witness to  that trauma and grief. Gun violence has claimed too many lives in too  many places, through mass shootings in movie theaters as well as the  constant drumbeat of shootings that never make the headlines. Our  constituents count on us to make them safe. That is one of the  fundamental responsibilities of our government. And by overwhelming  majorities, including majorities of Republicans and of gun owners, they  support commonsense steps to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous  people. In failing to move forward with legislation that would advance  those goals, Congress has been complicit in this ongoing epidemic. It  is truly a public health crisis. If more than 30,000 people died every  year from disease or other kinds of communicable illnesses, there would  be a call for drastic action.    This kind of public health crisis must be met with strong steps. When  many of us in this body who believe that Congress must now take action  to stem the scourge of gun violence hear one refrain from our  colleagues--``enforce the law; enforce the law that already exists''-- we must heed that cry.   Enforcing the law that already exists is exactly what this regulation  entails. So we must be ready to move forward. Yet, as my friend and  colleague Senator Murphy noted earlier, the Congressional Review Act  resolution we are about to vote on will not only fail to enforce  existing law, it will undermine existing law. Federal law prohibits  those who have severe mental health issues--that is to say, issues that  would prevent them from safely handling a gun, from possessing a gun.   Federal law also requires agencies that have information indicating  that people are disqualified from gun possession to share that  information with the NICS background check system. Under this  regulation, the Social Security Administration has proposed to do  [[Page S1151]]  exactly that. Pursuant to the 2007 NICS Improvement Amendments Act--a  law passed in the wake of the horrific Virginia Tech shooting to  address significant loopholes in the background check system--the  Social Security Administration will submit records to NICS for Social  Security recipients who meet a specific set of carefully defined  criteria. The regulation will apply only to a subset of Social Security  disability recipients. It does not apply to those who are receiving  Social Security retirement benefits. It applies only to those  disability recipients who have been found, based on the Social Security  Administration's established criteria, to be severely impaired due to a  mental disability and who are therefore unable to perform substantial  work or manage their own disability benefits.   Repealing this regulation could lead to great harm, exacerbating  loopholes and failings in the background check system that erode public  safety.   I have a letter from the United States Conference of Mayors, which  represents city leaders from across our country. It says that ``due to  loopholes in current law, too many mass murderers are still able to too  easily obtain guns. This includes the individual responsible for  killing 32 people and injuring 17 others at Virginia Tech in 2007 that  led to the enactment of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act. These  killings must stop and this rule, as implemented last year, will help  to do that.''   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from  the United States Conference of Mayors, as well as a letter from the  National League of Cities.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                        The United States Conference                                                       of Mayors,                                                   February 9, 2017.        Dear Senator: I write on behalf of the nation's Mayors to       urge you to strongly oppose Senate Joint Resolution 14 (S.J.       Res. 14), a bill to revoke a rule finalized last year by the       Social Security Administration (SSA), which strengthens our       nation's background check system for gun purchases by adding       the names of people who are severely incapacitated by their       condition and unable to manage their own finances.        The rule implements existing law, which required the SSA to       send the names of those identified as prohibited people to       the National Instant Background Check System (NICS). This       rule finally brings SSA in compliance with the NICS       Improvement Amendments Act (NIAA), a law that Congress passed       on a bipartisan basis and President Bush signed into law in       2007. It also is consistent with ATF's direction for       complying with the law.        The rule has a limited scope but is critically important to       the fabric of our nation's background check system. Under the       rule, people who receive benefits from the Social Security       Administration due to a severe ``mental impairment'' and       require a fiduciary representative to manage their benefits       would be notified and reported to the FBI's NICS. The rule       affects anyone 18 and older who qualifies for disability       because of a primary designation of ``mental impairment''       that prevents the person from working and who must have a       ``representative payee'' for handling his or her finances.       This includes people who have been certified to be afflicted       with severe mental health disorders, such as schizophrenia       and other psychotic disorders, personality disorders,       intellectual disabilities, anxiety-related disorders,       substance addiction disorders and autistic disorders. These       individuals have the right to appeal and a clear process for       doing so.        We all know that it is due to loopholes in current law that       too many mass murderers are still able to too easily obtain       guns. This includes the individual responsible for killing 32       people and injuring 17 others at Virginia Tech in 2007 that       led to enactment of the NIAA. These killings must stop and       this rule, as implemented last year, will help to do that.        We urge you to help stop the killing and oppose S.J. Res.       14 or any other efforts to undermine or otherwise compromise       the national Brady background check system that has stopped       over 3 million prohibited purchasers from acquiring guns       since its enactment.        Thank you for anticipated time and consideration of this       critical matter.            Sincerely,                                                       Tom Cochran,      CEO and Executive Director.                                   ____                                        National League of Cities,                                                  February 14, 2017.        Dear Senator: On behalf of the 19,000 cities and towns       represented by the National League of Cities, I write to       express strong opposition to Senate Joint Resolution 14 (S.J.       Res. 14) that will revoke a commonsense rule finalized last       year by the Social Security Administration (SSA). The rule       finally brings the SSA in compliance with the NICS       Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 (NIAA), a law that       Congress passed on a bipartisan basis and President Bush       signed into law in 2007. The law requires SSA to send the       names of mentally ill people, who have been determined to be       a danger to themselves or others by a physician, to the gun       purchase background check system. It is troubling that Senate       is now considering S.J. Res. 14, which threatens to undermine       this reasonable, bipartisan legislation that is making       cities, and police officers, more safe.        The rule is limited in scope and critically important to       the fabric of our nation's background check system. Under the       rule, people who receive benefits from the Social Security       Administration due to a severe ``mental impairment'' and       require a fiduciary representative to manage their benefits       would be notified and reported to the FBI's NICS. The rule       affects anyone 18 and older who qualifies for disability       because of a primary designation of ``mental impairment''       that prevents the person from working and who must have a       ``representative payee'' for handling his or her finances.       This includes people who have been certified to be afflicted       with severe mental health disorders, such as schizophrenia       and other psychotic disorders, personality disorders,       intellectual disabilities, anxiety-related disorders,       substance addiction disorders and autistic disorders.        Loopholes in the NICS law have allowed people who are       clearly a danger to themselves or others to obtain guns. This       includes the individuals responsible for killing 32 people       and injuring 17 others at Virginia Tech in 2007; killing six       people and injuring 13 others, including Congresswoman       Gabrielle Giffords in Tucson in 2011; killing 12 people and       injuring 70 others in Aurora in 2012; and killing 26 people,       including 20 children in Newtown in 2012. These killings must       stop and this rule, as implemented last year, will help to do       that.        We urge you to oppose S.J. Res. 14 or any other efforts to       undermine or otherwise compromise the national Brady       background check system that has stopped over 3 million       prohibited purchasers from acquiring guns since its       enactment.            Sincerely,                                               Clarence E. Anthony,                                          CEO and Executive Direct.     It is critical to note that neither I nor any  proponents of the Social Security Administration's rule believe that  all or most or even a significant percentage of those suffering from  mental health issues are dangerous--far from it. The overwhelming  majority of people who confront mental health issues are peaceful and  law-abiding citizens who seek only the treatment that should be  everybody's right. In fact, I have been a strong advocate over many  years of mental health parity, beginning when I was attorney general in  the State of Connecticut. The very first Federal law on this issue that  was passed was modeled in many ways after the State law that I  championed. I was proud to support the passage of a bill last year to  provide more resources to those seeking treatment, and I hope that it  moves this country toward providing everyone with the care they need.   Mental health issues should be no cause for fear, no reason for  stigma, no excuse for shame. Those who have come forward and been open  about the treatment they have sought, in fact, have done themselves and  their communities and country a great service. If I thought SSA  regulations unfairly targeted people with mental illness or that it  advanced the perception that they are inherently dangerous, I would  oppose it with every fiber of my being, but that is not the regulation  we have here.   As Senator Durbin said this morning and my colleague Senator Murphy  reiterated, this rule is not one loosely applied to anyone who has some  trouble balancing a checkbook; it applies only to those disability  recipients with a serious and debilitating mental health issue. That is  estimated to be about 75,000 people nationwide out of approximately 10  million Americans who suffer from a serious mental illness. Everyone  who suffers from mental illness should have a right to treatment, but  not all should have a gun. It is very unlikely that people who meet  these criteria will be able to safely handle a gun or to safely store  it in their home and prevent its misuse by themselves or by others.   It is possible that SSA's initial determination will be wrong. That  is why crucially--please understand--crucially the regulation also  provides due process. In fact, these due process protections are  necessary when a constitutional right is at stake. This right, the  Second Amendment right, must be respected as the law of the land. The  regulation entitles those who are affected  [[Page S1152]]  by it to advanced notice. When going through the process to appoint  someone else to handle their benefits, they are told that they will  forfeit their firearms right. They are given that notice, and they are  given due process. If they believe this is inappropriate or  unnecessary, the regulation gives them that process to appeal. It is  one that allows SSA to grant relief upon a determination that the  beneficiary will not be ``dangerous to public safety,'' a term that has  meaning.   SSA is also required to notify the NICS background check system if  the name should be removed, whether it was submitted in error or  because a beneficiary has recovered from the condition or because they  were granted relief through the appeals process. Those are rights with  real remedies, with due process, with fairness.   If I thought this regulation failed to provide adequate process that  every individual is due, regardless of how much I support its goal, I  would oppose it with, again, every fiber of my being because it should  be and it is the law of the land.   Of course there may be ways that this regulation, like any  regulation, could be improved if the criteria could be better targeted  or if the due process protections could be made stronger or if the  administration could be made more efficient. We should not hesitate to  make those improvements. I would welcome suggestions for enhancements,  but the methods chosen by my colleagues to attack this regulation--the  Congressional Review Act--prevent any and all of those improvements.   Severely limiting the time for debate denies us adequate  consideration. Much worse, it is a blunt-force instrument that will  prevent the Social Security Administration from issuing any  ``substantially similar'' regulation in the future. So the passage of  this resolution will prevent the SSA from complying with the legal  requirement for submitting legal records for a background check in the  future. It will hamstring this agency and prevent it from fulfilling  its obligation to public safety--that is regardless of whether new  information comes to light or whether it would be possible to devise a  better method of submitting these records.   In the words of the well-known and respected group Americans for  Responsible Solutions, using the CRA to undo this rule would ``not only  allow guns to be placed into the hands of individuals determined to be  legally incapable of using them safely, but it also creates an  irresponsible, irreversible precedent.''   As I have always said, I will work with my colleagues on any good- faith steps to stem the tide of gun violence in this country, and I  would be more than happy--in fact, I am eager--to work with them to fix  flaws they see in this regulation. We need to come together to improve  the integrity and efficiency of the national background check system  and keep guns out of the hands of people who cannot safely handle them.  People who are dangerous to themselves or others--it may be a very  small number, but they can do great tragic damage. The resolution we  will vote on shortly accomplishes neither of these goals. It does  nothing to answer my constituents who ask me time and time again why  Congress does nothing to confront the epidemic of gun violence in this  country. It would create an irresponsible, irreversible precedent. More  important than the precedent is the consequence in real lives of the  death and injury that could result. Those deaths and injuries are truly  irreversible and irresponsible, and we can help to stop them by taking  the right stand on this resolution.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
