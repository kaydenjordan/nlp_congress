 Mr. Speaker, for far too long, the Chinese  Communist Party has taken advantage of innocent people in its own  country and around the world.   Now, America is engaged in an economic and intellectual competition  with China that existed long before the coronavirus crossed our  borders. The current pandemic merely has exposed the Chinese Communist  Party's sinister lies, and the depths to which it will reach.   There is no question that we must hold this regime accountable for  all of its actions. As a member of the China Task Force, I am committed  to combating the Chinese Government's threats to our great Nation. We  must be focused on strengthening and protecting our supply chains to  ensure that we are never beholden to this regime for critical medicines  and critical supplies.   Americans must once again lead in innovation. We must, and we will.                            ____________________
