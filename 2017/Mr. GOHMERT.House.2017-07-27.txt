 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Mr. Newhouse's efforts here.   Hearing a concern about the $1.6 billion for the wall, let me just  say, living in Texas, spending a lot of time on the border, spending  time in Mexico--it is where my wife and I went on our honeymoon--there  is only one reason Mexico is not one of the top 10 economies in the  world, and it is because the drug cartels make tens of billions of  dollars they use for corruption to keep it from being that.   The best thing we could do as a good neighbor to Mexico is to build a  wall where it is needed, just like President Trump has talked about,  stop that flow of tens of billions of dollars to Mexico used for  corruption to keep down the Mexican people--hardworking, God-fearing  people--and bring that country up by being a good neighbor; because, in  this case, a good fence or wall will make a good neighbor, and Mexico  will have its rightful place in the economic hierarchy of the world.
