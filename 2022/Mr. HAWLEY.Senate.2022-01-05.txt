 Madam President, had there been a recorded vote, I would  have voted no on the confirmations of Executive Calendar No. 489,  Armando O. Bonilla, of the District of Columbia, to be a Judge of the  United States Court of Federal Claims for a term of fifteen years and  No. 490, Carolyn N. Lerner, of Maryland, to be a Judge of the United  States Court of Federal Claims for a term of fifteen years.                            ____________________
