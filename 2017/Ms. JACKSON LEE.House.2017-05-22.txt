 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1188, the Adam Walsh  Reauthorization Act of 2017.   For those of us who have met John Walsh and know of his family, it is  both unspeakable and unimaginable the feeling that families have faced  when a beautiful young child has gone missing and ultimately brutalized  and killed. That is what happened to John, his wife, and his family's  beautiful child in 1981.   So out of that came a lifelong commitment to ending this kind of  violence against children, but, more importantly, finding the Nation's  worst criminals who would brutalize families and fail to be  apprehended.  [[Page H4398]]    The Adam Walsh Act, in particular, established the Sex Offender  Registration and Notification Act--often referred to as SORNA--as a  national system for the registration of sex offenders.   This bill is an important bill, and I want to thank the gentleman  from Wisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner) again for his energized and  effective effort reauthorizing this legislation and his commitment to  fighting for the needs of protecting children. We join him in that. I  am reminded of the great work of the National Center for Missing &  Exploited Children and how they have continued their work for years. As  they came into fruition, it seemed that children were missing every  day. Violence was perpetrated, but laws were brought about to make a  difference.   So I support this bill and I raise some reflective thoughts. I am  glad that this bill reflects changes to SORNA that were agreed to by  the Judiciary Committee when it last reauthorized the Adam Walsh Act in  2012 to improve the requirements for States to register sex offenders,  for that was a very difficult system, and some States were complying  and others were not.   Whatever one's belief may be about the wisdom of sex offender  registries, prior to SORNA, many States had already developed sex  offender registries on their own and devoted substantial resources to  identify the most effective methods to manage sex offenders.    In the legislation, there was a certain way that SORNA wanted to  handle that, therefore, States were made to disregard those efforts in  favor of a one-size-fits-all. One of the principal concerns with SORNA  is that it deprives States of flexibility in dealing with juvenile sex  offender registration. I am glad that there is at least a recognition  that States have put in good programs, so I am delighted that that  flexibility can be addressed.   I also think that it is important to note that the bill has to  address longstanding implementation issues. As we noted in 2012,  although the legislation made some useful reforms, it failed to address  fundamental concerns with SORNA, and we are still working to achieve  that accomplishment.   Commendably, H.R. 1188, however, would allow States discretion in  determining whether juvenile sex offender information would be  accessible to the public via the internet. Of course, it continues to  be a steadfast legal prohibition and structure to diminishing--or  hopefully diminishing--the sex violence against children.   It will reduce the time that certain, but not all, juvenile sex  offenders adjudicated as a delinquent are required to register from 25  to 15 years.   The bill has many merits, and I think the changes that have been made  are extremely positive, one, in dealing with flexibility, and, two,  with recognizing some flexibility as it relates to juvenile offenders.   This is legislation that many have poured their heart into because  they believe that there should be a day when this kind of violence  ends, and I hope my colleagues will support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss H.R. 1188, the ``Adam Walsh  Reauthorization Act of 2017.'' While it is an improvement over current  law dealing with a very important subject, it should do more.   This bill is a step forward in our effort to address concerns about  the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, commonly known as  SORNA.   There is no doubt that child sexual exploitation is a plague on our  country.   The mistreatment of children should not be tolerated in any form.   Congress has a duty to carefully craft solutions to this problem  without creating confusion or new problems.   The creation of a uniform, nationwide standard for sex offender  registries in the Adam Walsh Act of 2006 was motivated by laudable  goals--prevention and protection.   Congress soon found, however, that state implementation of SORNA  would not occur quickly or easily.   Many states were unable to comply, and some would not comply because  of disagreements about who should be subject to mandatory registration.   Problems with SORNA were still evident in 2012 when we last  considered, but did not complete, reauthorization of the Adam Walsh  Act.   Now, ten years after enactment, problems with SORNA remain.   According to the Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs  (OJP), only 17 states, 3 territories, and 103 Indian tribes, have  substantially implemented SORNA.   States continue to incur penalties imposed on Byrne Justice  Assistance Grants funding for noncompliance, monies that fund essential  state and local programs.   Juvenile registration is still the most significant barrier to state  implementation of SORNA.   Research has shown that treatment of juvenile sex offenders can and  does work through therapy that involves community-based intervention,  adapted to the needs of juveniles, working within multiple systems-- individual, family, and school--to address the various causes of  childhood delinquency.   Researchers have also found that adolescents who completed sexual  offender treatment had significantly lower recidivism rates than  untreated adolescents, whereas registration serves only to marginalize  and label youth, causing more harm than good.   In order to implement the approaches to the treatment of juvenile  offenders that have proven successful, states must have flexibility in  the manner in which they handle juvenile sex offenders--flexibility  that is all but denied to states by SORNA.   Although I believe juveniles should be completely removed from  registration requirements, I am glad that this bill includes a  provision that allows states to exempt juveniles adjudicated delinquent  for sex offenses from the public website and reduces the time some  juveniles will be potentially required to register from 25 to 15 years.   Under this bill, the Attorney General's annual report to Congress on  sex offender registration will now include an analysis of common  reasons for state noncompliance, including more detailed information on  offenders, particularly juveniles, including a breakdown of the number  of registered offenders who are juveniles and adults who are required  to register because of statutory rape convictions or other conduct  committed as juveniles.   Hopefully, this information will inform future efforts to amend  SORNA.   While this bill includes provisions that address some of the concerns  raised when the Adam Walsh Act was considered by this Committee in  2012, it is clear that work remains to be done if the Act is to ever  achieve its purpose.   I thank Mr. Sensenbrenner for his dedication to this issue.   I support this bill--as far as it goes--and hope my colleagues will  support efforts to improve it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume to close.   First of all, we will be doing a series of bills that are extremely  important, and I will make note of my interest in protecting children,  but as well to broaden our work as we work in the Committee on the  Judiciary on matters dealing with criminal justice reform and  specifically dealing with the issue of solitary confinement,  alternative sentencing for young people, and Ban the Box. I also hope  that we will work on issues dealing with criminal justice reform  sentencing reduction that are crucial and prison reform. There is a lot  of work for us to do as we do the work on the floor today. People are  waiting, and in some instances languishing, in the Nation's juvenile  detention centers and various juvenile justice courts for a statement  to be made by the Federal Government on seeking a second chance for  those who are in the juvenile justice system.   As relates to the Adam Walsh legislation, I thank the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner) and the other cosponsors of H.R. 1188 for  their steadfast work on these issues. Nevertheless, as I indicated,  let's do more with respect to dealing with the registration of juvenile  offenders in terms of attempting to ensure that they will have an  opportunity for rehabilitation.   While I hope we may still work to make additional improvements to  this legislation, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and  I urge my colleagues to again consider the importance of our duty to  protect children from sexual predators in as efficient and broad-based  manner as we possibly can.   I want to thank the continued service of John Walsh and offer again,  as we all do, our deepest expression of remorse for the loss that he  and so many families tragically have experienced at the hands of  horrific sexual predators and those who would attack our children.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I agree with my good friend from  Virginia, the chairman of the committee, that the acts are heinous. It  appears that there is no addition to the underlying aspect of section  3559(e) of title 18 that says, a defendant who has been previously  convicted of a felony Federal or State sex offense committed against a  child and who is guilty of a predicate Federal sex offense against a  child must be sentenced to life imprisonment.   But, again, the bill is not written that way. I agree with everything  my good friend, the gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. Roby) said. I want to  congratulate her for her commitment, as so many of us, as women who  have come to the United States Congress who are mothers, have a special  interest in children, and, in particular, to avoid the horrific abuse  of children, and sexual abuse. That is an important cause, and the  underlying bill is important and crucial.    But I maintain that there is a lack of clarity into whether or not,  in fact, there are additional mandatory minimums because it is broken  down in these elements. The imposition of a life sentence, namely,  sexual contact with a minor under the age of 12, aggravated sexual  contact with a minor between the ages of 12 and 15, and illicit sexual  conduct with a minor abroad by a U.S. citizen.   The question is: Is the discretion of the court and the prosecutor  there?   I am not in the court. I don't know what the facts are, except for  the heinousness of tainting and violating a child. I want that criminal  brought to justice, but I want that prosecutor and that judge and the  defense under this existing statute to be able to address that question  and to be able to address the vileness or the mitigating factors in  that instance.   I don't want repeat offenders. Some have alleged that there should be  a variety of responses to sex offenders. I am aware of international  sex trafficking and men that travel to international places to have sex  with a child. I can't imagine that that would not fall on deaf ears in  a courtroom under the existing statute of 3559(e). And that is the  imposition of life imprisonment.   But there is merit to the question of discretion and the assessment  of the court. Now, I might say, with a little aside, that there are  some populations that don't get fair treatment, no matter what the case  is, yet I am yielding to the court because I do think there is merit to  this idea of one mandatory sentence after another, and that that is the  only response that one must get the mandatory minimum.   In the backdrop of this Attorney General, who has expressed no  interest in rehabilitation, in treatment, or in real criminal justice  reform, I am frightened. I am frightened about what will happen in the  Nation's U.S. attorneys and Federal courts across America.   Will we again reinstitute the wave of incarcerated persons marching  in under mandatory minimums?  [[Page H4402]]                                     time  1645    Will the epidemic begin again?   It is a difficult posture to stand on the floor of the House when you  are discussing a baby, a child, a 12-year-old. There is no divide  between my belief and Congresswoman Roby's belief. It is heinous. They  should be punished.   We may have a disagreement of what may be a process that reenacts and  restores our pathway on mass incarceration. It is not clear in the  bill, plain and simple.   I heard the response of the chairman: There is nothing new. Then it  should have been tied to 3559(c) and just say, ``must be sentenced to  life in prison, as it is.'' But it seems that there is a refinement, so  more and more opportunities for mandatory minimums and no discretion  for the judge.   In a courtroom, the judge, at sentencing, has all the information he  or she needs to impose a sentence commensurate with the crime committed  and the culpability of the offender. At that time, lock them up, throw  the key away.   I am not sure what the Department of Justice is speaking about in  terms of loopholes. There are some very fine men and women who have  headed up U.S. Attorneys Offices over the years and decades, and they  have gotten their man or woman.   So the question is: With an Attorney General that we have, who stood  in the way of criminal justice reform in the last Congress as we were  on the precipice of doing great things, now I am supposed to be  convinced that he is in any way sympathetic to the mass incarceration  which disproportionately impacts African Americans.   No, this is not a case that is a bill that points or focuses on  African Americans. I am very clear about that. I don't suggest that at  all. But I know the ultimate result of mandatory minimums has a  disproportionate impact on African Americans, as evidenced by the  census population in the Federal Prison Bureau, in the Federal criminal  justice system, and in State prisons across America.   I want to work with my colleagues. I want to save children. All of us  are brought to tears when some heinous, vile human being wants to taint  a child. But if a judge can't understand that, shame on them. If a  prosecutor doesn't understand that, shame on them.   And they have got 3559(e) that expresses that, which would include  the illicit sexual conduct with a minor abroad by a U.S. citizen and,  if not, that could be stated in there, and the language ``must be  sentenced to life in prison.''   I am not sure where we are going, but I would hope that we could  clarify that 3559(e) answers all the questions and that we don't find  added mandatory minimums which impact communities disproportionately as  the only solution to getting a dastardly person off the streets.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman  from Michigan for his leadership and, as well, the gentleman who is a  proponent of this legislation which, on its face, provides for an  enhanced penalty for sex offenders who commit a crime of violence while  in noncompliance of sex offender registration and reporting  requirements. That offense can apply to that in the Military Code of  Justice, Tribal law, State law, and Federal law.   It also adds State crimes of violence as a predicate offense that, in  turn, would require the imposition of a mandatory or an enhanced  sentencing to be served consecutively to any sentence imposed for  failing to register or comply with the sex offender registration  reporting requirements.   I believe, as my colleagues have said, that the underlying premise of  this bill will join us together in linking arms, there is no doubt. It  should be the rule of this Congress and the rule of elected  [[Page H4405]]  officials from State to local government, the U.S. Military Code of  Justice, and Tribal law to protect our children; and certainly, the  idea of noncompliance with sex registration should be addressed in any  court proceeding dealing with these offenders.   The issue, I believe, is the question, again, of: What do we gain by  the implementing of a mandatory minimum? In this instance, it is an  enhanced 5-year sentence. But there may be a number of reasons in terms  of an individual moving from State to State where the person is not  registered.   Again, I have to turn my attention to where we are and where we stand  on this day, May 22, 2017. It makes a difference. It makes a difference  if we have an Attorney General that does not seem to have any interest  in rehabilitation, any interest in ensuring that the mass incarceration  ends, the disparate treatment of different races and ethnic groups in  the criminal justice system ends.   As has been noted already, the previous policies of Attorney General  Holder that were fair and did not add to the enhancement of crime,  which allowed discretion by prosecutors of not adding up on the  particular defendant any number of offenses that would create 200- and  300-year sentencing and, therefore, having people languish in prisons  across this country, building up the record of private prisons, and  seeing teeming numbers in our Federal prison system, that is what we  are facing now.                                time  1715    There is no doubt that the present law, I believe, does, in fact,  cover the efforts of the proponent of this legislation. Obviously,  there will be a difference of opinion, but I believe that there is  sufficient coverage in the underlying legislation without adding this  particular enhancement.   I would hope that our colleagues who are in support of this bill,  just as I respect their commitment to fighting against sexual violence,  sexual contact, and sexual criminal acts against children, would  recognize that a discussion about mandatory minimums does not, in any  way, diminish one's commitment to the underlying premise of this  legislation.   There are too many unknown variables with the leadership of the  Attorney General and his indication as to what kind of treatment there  should be for underlying crimes and his wish to have newly appointed  U.S. Attorneys, many of whom are not appointed, not confirmed, so that  we can, again, overcriminalize America, overcriminalize the acts of  individuals, and create another siege of mass incarceration.   We will have a number of other bills that will be on the floor with  the same concerns that will be expressed. Again, let me say that I  support the idea of fighting against child sex trafficking and violent  sexual crimes perpetrated against children. I support the opposition to  such and the incarceration of those and bringing those individuals to  justice. I do believe, however, that there are many ways of dealing  with this, including incarceration without a continuous either  enhancement or continued increase of the number of mandatory minimums  that are continuing to be added to individuals who are recidivists and  who are convicted of Federal, State, or military crimes, in this  instance.    I yield to the gentleman from Michigan.    I thank the gentleman for that very thoughtful  addition and his kind words.   I think what I want to say to Mr. Conyers, in concluding, is that  mass incarceration is real. We have lived with this for decades. We  finally have gotten to the point that judges recognize that there are  many different ways to deal with individuals who are recidivists at  sentencing, regardless of whether or not the previous conviction, as I  said earlier, was Federal, State, or military court, and now Tribal.  That is the only point that we are making here.   Next week, we will have 10 more bills with mandatory minimums. We  will all agree with the underlying premise, which is to lock the bad  guys up, but we do believe that there is some value to the discretion  of judges and courts. I don't believe anyone on this floor--none of us,  Republicans or Democrats--would have any argument--none--on the  underlying premise of our absolute responsibility, without question, of  defending and protecting children from these vile individuals. But I  don't have the facts inside the courtroom, and there is not a one-size- fits-all answer. That is what mandatory minimums are. All it does is  load our prison systems with bodies, one after another.   I conclude with this. The courts have asked for discretion. I would  hope that in the Federal system those who are appointed have, in fact,  both the wherewithal, the knowledge, the sense of justice, and the  right to make the decision based upon the laws and based upon the  vileness of what has been engaged in.   This is not an opposition. This is a plea for collaboration.   If I may say one thing personally. There are neighbors that I know in  my community who have been accused of certain things. They are  dignified citizens--not with regard to this particular underlying act-- but dignified citizens, former military persons, and they are  languishing under a mandatory minimum. It is disgraceful. Let me be  very clear: It is not a sex offense, not an offense of violence. It is  minimal, at best. But they are operating under a mandatory. It  literally is disgraceful how this has destroyed their lives.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member very much,  and I thank him for his work.   I think the work that we are doing in Judiciary certainly has far- reaching impact. It is important to try to make more efficient the way  that we address these very heinous acts against our children.    As a strong advocate for children throughout my career, I agree that  we in Congress must do everything within our power and authority to  prevent child sexual exploitation and abuse. The Targeting Child  Predators Act of 2017 is intended to assist investigators in their  pursuit of online predators.  [[Page H4408]]    I fully support efforts to locate and prosecute individuals who  commit such heinous crimes. However, I believe we should discuss the  proposal before us with more information from all who would be impacted  prior to approving the changes to the law this bill proposes.   This has a lot of moving parts and participants, particularly in  relation to online internet and the variety of providers that are  stakeholders in all of this.   This bill would modify a powerful yet historically controversial  investigatory tool: the administrative subpoena. Administrative  subpoenas allow certain investigators investigating specified crimes to  obtain private records without judicial approval. I can account for the  fact, Mr. Speaker, that there are many instances where this may be a  vital approach.   We know that we live in a very difficult time, and a number of  incidents dealing with national security and others may certainly be  impacted by such; but, obviously, there are other subpoenas that are  attendant to those particular acts. But the administrative subpoenas,  as indicated, allow Federal investigators investigating specified  crimes to obtain private records, as indicated, without judicial  approval.   Although investigators do not need sign-off from a judge before  issuing such a subpoena, there is one layer of judicial review that  prevents them from abusing their subpoena power. That is the judicial  consideration of nondisclosure orders prior to the issuance of  subpoenas.   At present, a district court judge must determine if circumstances  exist to justify issuance of a 90-day nondisclosure order in connection  with administrative subpoenas. Under the terms that I understand are in  this proposed bill, investigators could require nondisclosure by  subpoena recipients for a longer period--180 days--and without first  receiving the approval of a district judge, effectively eliminating  judicial consideration of nondisclosure orders prior to the issuance of  subpoenas. Subpoena recipients would have the ability to seek judicial  review of the nondisclosure requirement only after receiving the  subpoena. I believe that this provision raises concerns that remove the  wisdom of district judges from this process at the time the gag orders  are imposed.   Congress authorized the use of these subpoenas to allow investigators  to obtain information quickly and expeditiously, and I think they work  that way. The intervention of judicial review has not proven to be an  obstruction so much so that you might remove it and the wisdom of the  court. Congress also expressly required that investigators seek the  approval of a district judge for nondisclosure orders connected to  these subpoenas.   I share my colleagues' desire to locate and prosecute those who  commit child exploitation and abuse crimes, and, in essence, let's get  them, but I do think that the willingness to remove judicial review is  one of question.   Those individuals who hide behind computer screens committing  abhorrent acts against children on the internet must be apprehended and  made to answer for their crimes. I would think that the judge would be  well aware of how sensitive this is and use their best impression to  get moving and to allow the process to proceed.   I think this Nation is a land of laws. We abide by the rule of law,  and Congress has a right to draft laws. But I do think, in this  instance, the rule of law, abiding by the rule of law, allowing for the  active participation of the court and the wisdom of the court is not  too much to ask in a nation that believes in democracy, believes in the  rights of the offenders and, as well, the victims.   So I am very concerned about this bill, and I would hope that we  would have the opportunity to have this addressed or the issues  addressed, or addressed in the Senate; and I look forward to those  issues being addressed in the Senate so that we can, together, handle  the concerns that are being expressed and have a bill that does not  remove judicial oversight and the wisdom of the court.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss H.R. 883, the ``Targeting Child  Predators Act of 2017.'' As a strong advocate for children throughout  my career, I agree that we in Congress must do everything within our  power and authority to prevent child sexual exploitation and abuse.   The ``Targeting Child Predators Act of 2017'' is intended to assist  investigators in their pursuit of online child predators.   I fully support efforts to locate and prosecute individuals who  commit such heinous crimes. However, I believe we should discuss the  proposal before us--with more information from all who would be  impacted--prior to approving the changes to the law this bill proposes.   This bill would modify a powerful, yet historically controversial,  investigatory tool--the administrative subpoena.   Administrative subpoenas allow certain Federal investigators,  investigating specified crimes, to obtain private records without  judicial approval.   Although investigators do not need sign-off from a judge before  issuing such a subpoena, there is one layer of judicial review that  prevents them from abusing their subpoena power.   That is the judicial consideration of nondisclosure orders prior to  the issuance of subpoenas.   At present, a district court judge must determine if circumstances  exist to justify issuance of a 90-day nondisclosure order in connection  with administrative subpoenas.   Under the terms proposed in this bill, investigators could require  nondisclosure by subpoena recipients for a longer period--180 days--and  without first receiving the approval of a district judge, effectively  eliminating judicial consideration of nondisclosure orders prior to the  issuance of subpoenas.   Subpoena recipients would have the ability to seek judicial review of  the nondisclosure requirement only after receiving the subpoena.   I am deeply concerned with the provision that would remove the wisdom  of district judges from this process at the time the gag orders are  imposed.   Congress authorized the use of these subpoenas to allow investigators  to obtain information quickly and expeditiously.   But, Congress also expressly required that investigators seek the  approval of a district judge for nondisclosure orders connected to  these subpoenas.   I share my colleagues' desire to locate and prosecute those who  commit child exploitation and abuse crimes.   Those individuals, who hide behind computer screens, committing  abhorrent acts against children on the internet, must be apprehended  and made to answer for their crimes.   I am not convinced that this bill is the best way to go about doing  so.   I hope we can find a way to address this issue, with more information  from all concerned.    Mr. Speaker, let me also congratulate Mr. Schiff and  Mr. Bishop. And as was indicated on the floor, thank you very much, Mr.  Conyers.   This is the kind of bill that is corrective and effective. This bill  would allow a more effective and comprehensive criminal background  check, which will help identify the integrity and accountability of the  organizations that sponsor these programs.   Many of us have worked with the Boys and Girls Clubs, Boys and Girls  Scouts, and many other organizations that really work to help children.  These nationwide criminal background checks are more reliable than  background checks that only search criminal histories in a few States.   Many States currently limit the ability of organizations to access  their database and, thus, force organizations to depend on private  companies to perform background checks of employees and volunteers. If  anybody has been on the board of a nonprofit dealing with children, you  realize that you want to put most of your resources investing in the  programs to help these children. H.R. 695, however, would alleviate  this burden of expense and allow organizations to access the FBI's more  robust system.   In the Child Safety Pilot Program, which we implemented over 10 years  ago, it demonstrates the effectiveness of nationwide background checks  for youth-serving organizations. The program has effectively exposed  applicants who use aliases, incorrect dates of birth, and other  identifiers, some of whom have serious criminal backgrounds. That is  the preventative way to protect our children, by ensuring a very  healthy, robust vetting of individuals who want to engage with our  children.   H.R. 695 would allow organizations to access the FBI's comprehensive  background check system and to create a more accurate determination of  individuals who want to work with children. Volunteers we welcome, but  we want to ensure that those volunteers are there to take care of our  children, to help our children, and improve the lives of our children.  H.R. 695 is a very important contributor to that effort.
