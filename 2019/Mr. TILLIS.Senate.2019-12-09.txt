 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  postcloture time on the Bumatay nomination expire at 12:15 p.m. on  Tuesday, December 10, and that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table and the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.   I further ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule XXII,  following the cloture vote on the VanDyke nomination, the Senate  proceed to legislative session and to the immediate consideration of  Calendar No. 290, S. 2740. I further ask unanimous consent that there  be 2 minutes of debate, equally divided between the leaders and their  designees, and that upon the use or yielding back of that time, the  bill be considered read a third time and the Senate vote on the passage  of the bill with no intervening action or debate and that the Senate  then resume executive session.   Finally, I ask unanimous consent that at 12 noon, on Wednesday,  December 11, the Senate proceed to legislative session and to the  immediate consideration of H.R. 2333, which was received from the  House, and that the bill be considered read a third time and the Senate  vote on its passage with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, today I rise to honor and praise a great  man, Mayo Boddie, who has lived a long and admirable life as a  successful businessman and dedicated servant to the people of North  Carolina and his country.   Mr. Boddie was born on December 6, 1929, on a farm in Nash County,  NC. The son of Nick and Lucy Boddie, Mr. Boddie learned the value of  hard work and perseverance at an early age. In 1962, along with his  brother Nick and his uncle, Carleton Noell, Mayo Boddie opened his  first Hardee's restaurant in Fayetteville, NC. Fast food was a  relatively new concept back then, but the new company, Boddie-Noell,  knew the recipe for success.   Today, he is chairman of Boddie-Noell Enterprise, headquartered in  Rocky Mount in the great State of North Carolina. Under Mr. Boddie's  leadership, Boddie-Noell Enterprises operates more than 350 Hardee's  restaurants and is the popular brand's largest franchisee. Despite  their rapid growth and expansion throughout the Carolinas, Virginia,  and Kentucky, Boddie-Noell has maintained a close-knit family culture  in which every individual is treated with dignity and respect. To Mayo  Boddie, the secret of his success is ``our people.''   His devoted leadership never went unnoticed. In 1987, he received the  North Carolina Jaycees Outstanding Boss of the Year Award. In 1991, he  was named Master Entrepreneur of the Year for North Carolina by Inc.  Magazine. In 2000, Mayo and his brother, Nick, were named NC Restaurant  Association's Restaurateurs of the Year.   At the age of 90 years old, celebrating a recent birthday, Mayo  Boddie continues to be very active in his community of Rocky Mount and  Eastern North Carolina. He still serves as an advisory board member for  the NC Wesleyan College Entrepreneurial Center and continues to serve  on the East Carolina Council BSA executive board. He remains an active  member of First Presbyterian Church in Rocky Mount and has been active  in the Boy Scouts since 1941. His support for scouting is legendary. In  honor of this support, one of the Scout reservations in Beaufort  County--Camp Bonner--was renamed Camp Boddie.   Mr. President, it is obvious Mr. Boddie is well respected and loved  among many who know him, and I am proud to honor him and his life-long  and innovative service to the great State of North Carolina, along with  his many accomplishments throughout his lifetime.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Military  Missions in Action, MMIA, an organization with locations in Fuquay- Varina and Southern Pines, NC, that is doing tremendous work throughout  the State of North Carolina for Active-Duty servicemembers, veterans,  and military families.   Mr. Mike Dorman founded MMIA in 2008 after a 20-year career in the  U.S. Coast Guard. Since then, MMIA has worked tirelessly to accomplish  a wide array of support for servicemembers, veterans, and their  families. MMIA conducts a number of operations each year such as:  Operation Building Hope, which gathers volunteers to make modifications  and repairs necessary for safe and independent living for veterans with  disabilities; Homes for Healing, through which volunteers provide new  and gently used furniture and household goods to formerly homeless  veterans; Operation Rescue Christmas, which provides holiday assistance  to low-income veteran and military families through gift cards, new  toys, and monetary support; and Fill the Footlocker whereby comforts  from home, health, and hygiene items are packaged and shipped to  deployed servicemembers.   MMIA completes the operations mentioned above in addition to many  other projects in community engagement and support with the help of  volunteers and other collaborators. To date, MMIA has completed 710  building projects, assisted over 30,500 homeless veterans, provided  furniture and household goods to 463 families, shipped over 58,000 care  [[Page S6902]]  packages to deployed servicemembers, and assisted 1,620 children  through Operation Rescue Christmas.   I would like to thank and recognize the men and women of MMIA and all  of the volunteers for their continued dedication and support for the  large servicemember and veteran populations of the State of North  Carolina and their families.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 448, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to,  the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  December 10; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, morning business be closed, and the Senate proceed to executive  session and resume consideration of the Bumatay nomination under the  previous order; finally, that the Senate recess from 12:30 p.m. until  2:15 p.m. to allow for the conference meetings.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:34 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, December 10, 2019, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
