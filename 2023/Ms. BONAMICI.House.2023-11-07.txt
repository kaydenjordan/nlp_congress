 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to House  Resolution 847 and to reiterate our commitment to equal justice under  the law.   As Members of this distinguished body, we all take an oath to support  and defend the Constitution. Unfortunately, the Financial Services and  General Government bill we will consider this week will undermine the  constitutional rights of Americans.   In this legislation, Federal public defenders face a steep cut--an  underfunding of nearly $100 million. This is unacceptable and will  disrupt equal access to justice.   Nearly 90 percent of defendants in Federal criminal cases cannot  afford an attorney, which is their constitutional right to have. If  there are not enough Federal defenders, cases could be delayed, and the  cost will be more in the long run.                                time  1300    Defendants will be referred to private panel attorneys, who typically  have less experience and cost more. That makes no sense.   This is not a partisan issue, Mr. Speaker. This is an issue of  constitutional rights, and it is smart fiscal policy.   For several years, I have led bipartisan efforts to adequately fund  Federal public defenders, and this year, I have led several bipartisan  calls to fully fund our Federal defenders.   We must defeat this rule and return the bill to committee so we can  follow through on our constitutional responsibility to adequately fund  Federal public defenders. It is their right to have counsel. If it is  not afforded, they will be referred to panel attorneys, who cost more.  That makes no sense, Mr. Speaker.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record a  letter from the Defender Services Advisory Group, emphasizing that  failing to adequately fund Federal public defense will inflict a  cascade of dangerous and damaging consequences on their program, on  clients, and on our criminal justice system.
