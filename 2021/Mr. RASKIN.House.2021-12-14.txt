 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 848 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 848         Resolved, That if House Report 117-216 is called up by       direction of the Select Committee to Investigate the January       6th Attack on the United States Capitol: (a) all points of       order against the report are waived and the report shall be       considered as read; and (b)(1) an accompanying resolution       offered by direction of the Select Committee to Investigate       the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol shall be       considered as read and shall not be subject to a point of       order; and (2) the previous question shall be considered as       ordered on such resolution to adoption without intervening       motion or demand for division of the question except one hour       of debate equally divided among and controlled by       Representative Thompson of Mississippi, Representative Cheney       of Wyoming, and an opponent, or their respective designees.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Mrs.  Fischbach), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                general leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Mr. Speaker, today the Rules Committee met and reported a  rule, House Resolution 848. The rule provides for consideration of the  resolution accompanying House Report 117-216, under a closed rule if  the report is called up by direction of the Select Committee to  Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol.   It provides 1 hour of debate equally divided among and controlled by  Chair Thompson, Vice Chair Cheney, and an opponent.   Mr. Speaker, after producing 9,000 pages of documents that he  conceded to be nonprivileged in any way; after saying he would comply  with the subpoena to appear before the January 6th committee on  December 8; after negotiating and rendering preliminary cooperation  with the January 6th committee, Mark Meadows' book came out with tons  of startling and eye-popping revelations about January 6th and the role  that then-President Donald Trump played.   Ex-President Trump exploded and called Mr. Meadows' book fake news.  Amazingly, Mr. Meadows agreed that his book was fake news, and then he  suddenly pulled the plug on his agreement to testify in formal  deposition before our committee on December 8.   Instead, he went to court and alleged that our committee has no valid  legislative purpose.  [[Page H7646]]    Mr. Speaker, Mr. Meadows' sudden vanishing act is plainly a delay  tactic designed to run out the clock on one of the most important  investigations in the history of the United States of America. If we  don't have a legislative purpose in investigating the most sweeping,  violent attack on the U.S. Capitol since the War of 1812, and the most  serious and most dangerous threat to American constitutional democracy  since the Civil War, then we really don't have a legislative purpose  for anything we do here.   If this investigation into a dangerous assault on the American  Government is not necessary and proper under our Constitution, then  nothing is. Article I, Section 8, Clause 15 of the Constitution gives  Congress of the United States the power to provide for: calling forth  the militia to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections,  and repel invasions.   Obviously, we have a legislative purpose in what we are doing to  investigate an attack on this building, on this Chamber where more than  140 of our officers were wounded and injured, hospitalized, people came  back with broken necks, broken jaws, broken vertebrae, broken arms,  broken legs, traumatic brain injuries, and to this day, continue to  suffer from post-traumatic stress syndrome.   The counting of electoral college votes was interrupted for the very  first time in American history for several hours. This was the most  serious, destabilizing, domestic threat to American constitutional  democracy that any of us have seen in our lifetimes.   Now, the committee has bent over backwards to accommodate Mr.  Meadows' multiple requests. It is now clear he has no intention of  complying with the subpoena, even when his testimony could have no  theoretical connection to an executive privilege claim. This is the key  point.   He is categorically refusing to show up to testify about 9,000 pages  of documents that he has already turned over to the committee and for  which he has thus nullified any hypothetical assertions of executive  privilege by President Biden, or a former President. He is refusing to  testify about statements that he made in his book that are now all over  the country, published last week, and that he has repeated in the media  about what took place on January 6.   He is willing to talk about it in his book. He is willing to talk  about it in public, but he is unwilling to undergo the questioning of  our committee despite having been subpoenaed to do so in deposition.   This is another category of statements which has nothing to do with  executive privilege because it has already been completely waived,  completely obviated, and completely nullified by his own actions.   This witness, Mr. Speaker, must testify. He must come and render  truthful, honest, and complete testimony like 300 other witnesses  before him have done, either voluntarily and patriotically, as the vast  majority have done, or at least under compulsion of a legal subpoena.   The Supreme Court has been perfectly clear about that. We have the  same authority to ask for people's testimony that a court does in  pursuit of our official constitutional duties. And if anyone we have  called as a witness knows in his bones that he must testify before this  committee, it is Mr. Meadows himself, a former member of this body who  repeatedly through his career in Congress insisted that high-ranking  executive branch officials must comply with congressional demands for  information and congressional subpoenas for their testimony.   By the way, you don't get to choose and say: Well, I will send you my  documents, but I am not going to testify. That is not how going before  Congress works or going before a court works.   In the last administration, multiple times, Mr. Meadows found high- ranking officials hiding information from Congress, withholding  relevant documents, or ``even outright ignoring congressional  subpoenas.''   And here is what he had to say about that: ``This level of conduct,  paired with the failure to even feign an interest in transparency, is  reprehensible. And whether you're a Republican or a Democrat, this kind  of obstruction is wrong, period.    ``For 9 months we've warned them consequences were coming, and for 9  months we've heard the same excuses backed up by the same unacceptable  conduct. Time is up and the consequences are here.''   We have multiple statements by Mr. Meadows like that, who was a  distinguished member of the Oversight and Reform Committee. He, of all  Members, continually insisted that people and high-ranking government  officials respect the authority of Congress to do its job.   Our investigative powers are implicit in, and intertwined with our  powers to legislate as the Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized.   The Meadows' lawsuit against individual members of this committee is  extremely dubious in light of the Speech or Debate Clause and multiple  other constitutional roadblocks, and its substantive allegations are  frivolous, such as the central absurd claim that Congress has no  legitimate purpose in investigating and reporting to the American  people on a violent attack on our Capitol, our Presidential election,  and on the peaceful transfer of power.   We must hold him in contempt for his refusal to participate in these  proceedings, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   First of all, on the matter of the phone records, what has been  subpoenaed is simply the metadata establishing where the phone calls  were going amongst different parties that were involved in the January  6 insurrection and the attempted political coup against Vice President  Pence, but not the actual communications themselves. There has not been  a single word that has been subpoenaed from the telephone companies of  the actual conversations that took place.   All of that, in any event, is an irrelevant distraction. Let's be  very clear about what is going on here, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Meadows began  to cooperate. He turned over 9,000 documents of extraordinary relevance  to this investigation. We were getting exactly what we wanted, up until  the point at which he pulled the plug on his participation.   Look at some of the texts which we released over the last 24 hours  that came in as part of his discovery with the committee. This is from  some Republican lawmakers and others:   ``We are under siege up here at the Capitol,'' was one text he  received.   ``They have breached the Capitol.''   ``Mark, protesters are literally storming the Capitol. Breaking  windows on doors. Rushing in. Is Trump going to say something?''   ``There's an armed standoff at the House Chamber door.''   ``We are all helpless.''   Here is what came in from some members of the media that Mr. Meadows  turned over to the committee.   Laura Ingraham: ``Mark, the President needs to tell people in the  Capitol to go home. This is hurting all of us. He is destroying his  legacy.''   Brian Kilmeade sent this to Mark Meadows: ``Please get him on TV.  Destroying everything you have accomplished.''   Here is Sean Hannity: ``Can he make a statement? Ask people to leave  the Capitol.''   Trump family members also were texting, according to the materials  turned over by Mark Meadows. Donald Trump, Jr.: ``He's got to condemn  this'' excrement ``ASAP. The Capitol Police tweet is not enough.''  Meadows responding: ``I'm pushing it hard. I agree.'' Donald Trump,  Jr.: We need an Oval Office address. He has to lead now. It has gone  too far and gotten out of hand.''   Mr. Speaker, all of these texts and hundreds more like them lead to  hundreds of questions that we have about the sequence of events on  January 6: Who did what in response to different pleas from lawmakers,  Democrat and Republican alike? Who did what in response to these pleas  coming in from members of the media and from members of the Trump  family? What was the sequence of events? How was the National Guard  involved? How did this interact with other parts of the Federal  Government?   Then Mr. Meadows, though, did a U-turn when Donald Trump called his  book ``fake news.'' Meadows decided to agree with him and hurriedly  said it was fake news and then said he would not appear on December 8,  a date, by the way, which had been postponed from two other dates to  testify because we wanted to accommodate his schedule and the schedule  of his lawyer. But now he decides to go completely cold.   They are left in a completely untenable posture legally because he is  refusing to testify about things that he has already conceded there is  no privilege covering. He has said: None of this is privileged. I am  turning it over to you.    We want to ask him questions about it, and now, suddenly, he runs  back to the idea that there is some privilege, although one can see his  eroding faith in that argument as the D.C. Circuit rejected the claims  of executive privilege unanimously in Trump v. Thompson.   So now that is why he is saying we have no legitimate legislative  purpose, which is perfectly absurd. If we don't have a legislative  purpose in defending our own institution, our own Constitution, our own  government, then we have no legislative purposes here at all if we  can't even have an investigation into an attack that goes to the very  survival of our form of government.   Mr. Speaker, Mark Meadows has to testify. He has to come in like 300  American citizens have patriotically and lawfully done. What makes him  special? The fact that he knows a former President of the United  States? I am afraid not.   In Jones v. Clinton, a case that my colleagues applauded on the other  side of the aisle, the Supreme Court held that even a sitting President  of the United States is not immune to civil actions, even a sitting  President.   We don't have an office of former President. When you are no longer  President of the United States, under our Constitution, you are a  citizen like everybody else. You can't wave a magic wand over your  friends and say that they don't have to comply with lawful subpoenas.   So this witness is in contempt of our committee and the United States  Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I appreciate, of course, the temptation to just change the subject  and talk about something completely different because there are no  arguments left on their side.   The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in the Trump v. Bennie Thompson  case, in an opinion of more than 50 pages, reviewed all the arguments  on both sides about executive privilege and said executive privilege is  a claim which, of course, belongs primarily and principally to the  existing President of the United States, not to a former President of  the United States. To the extent that a former President of the United  States can raise it, the presumption is that the people in our  constitutional democracy have a right to all the information they seek  in order to govern themselves.   That is what the investigative power of Congress is about. We have a  right to obtain the information we need in order to legislate. So the  presumption is that we get it. That can only be overcome if a sitting  President--or in perhaps some exceptional cases, a former President-- demonstrates there is some compelling need that would override the  fundamental right of the people to get the information we want.    The D.C. Circuit panel found unanimously that not only had they not  shown there was a compelling need on Donald Trump's team, they didn't  even identify a potentially compelling need. Of course, there isn't  one. Why? The Supreme Court has already found that executive privilege  does not cover criminal activity; much less could executive privilege  cover insurrectionary activity or activity designed to promote an  insurrection or a coup against the United States of America.   So I welcome my colleagues talking about anything else because it  simply demonstrates their abandonment of the executive privilege  argument, an argument also that has been abandoned by Mr. Meadows  himself, who voluntarily turned over 9,000 pages worth of documents to  our committee, thereby saying there was no privilege at all.   But now he is refusing to testify about it, apparently because of  Donald Trump's explosive reaction to the publication of Mark Meadows'  book. I am sorry, that is not a constitutional defense to being called  to testify before Congress. You can't say a former President is mad at  me and wants to wave a magic wand so I don't have to testify. That  doesn't work in our system of government.   Mr. Meadows must come and testify, like hundreds of people have come  to testify before our committee about this brutal attack on our system  of government.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank the gentlewoman for her very insightful remarks. The  committee has referred often to the passage that the gentlewoman  identifies by the Supreme Court saying that a subpoena to come and  testify is not an invitation to a game of hare and hounds. That is a  little old-fashioned. Basically, the court is saying it is not a game  of hide-and-seek or cat-and-mouse.   You are told to come and testify, and you must. That is what the vast  majority of people have been doing in our investigation and the vast  majority of Americans do all across the land when they are subpoenaed  to come to court. It seems like a tiny handful of people who think that  somehow they are above the law because they know a former President of  the United States.   I am sorry, that is just not how our legal system works. We have no  kings here, as Judge Chutkan emphasized at the district court in  rejecting Donald Trump's claims against our committee. We have no kings  here. Everyone is subject to the law. We have no nobles. We have no  lords. Congress cannot award titles of nobility here. We are all  equals, and we are all subject to the law. It is a crime in the  District of Columbia not to comply with a subpoena, punishable by up to  1 year in jail and a $100,000 fine. Very serious business. Now, if you  think you have got some kind of legal privilege against testifying,  like the marital privilege or the priest-penitent privilege or the  doctor-patient privilege or the executive privilege, you come, you show  up, you testify, and you invoke it as to a specific question.   Mr. Speaker, the reason why this case is overwhelmingly easy, we  would argue 100 percent easy, is because we are talking about testimony  by Mr. Meadows that he has been subpoenaed to give relating to 9,000  documents that he has already admitted are not privileged by the  executive privilege or the Fifth Amendment or anything else. He has  said, here, take them. This is evidence about what happened. And  rightfully so did he do that.   I will express my personal disappointment that Donald Trump's  explosive rage about the publication of Mr. Meadows' book occasioned  some kind of change in his attitude about it, but regardless of his  subjective attitude, he has a legal obligation to show up and to answer  the questions of this committee.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I  just want to emphasize that in his distinguished service in this  Chamber, Mr. Meadows would never tolerate an executive official simply  deciding to blow off a subpoena of the U.S. Congress. He said,  ``Whether you are a Republican or a Democrat, this kind of obstruction  is wrong, period.''   He repeatedly complained about intransigence and delays by the  executive branch. So I think he understands exactly why this is a  matter of such gravity to our body.   Now, as I was saying, as a member, not just of the Rules Committee  but also of the January 6th Select Committee, we have seen overwhelming  participation and cooperation by the people we have called. Most people  are doing their legal duty and their civic and patriotic duty by coming  forward and voluntarily saying, here is what I know, and here is the  information I have got to help you put together a report for the  American people.   It just seems as we have gotten closer and closer to Donald Trump,  that is where we are running into the obstructionism, as from Steve  Bannon, as from Jeffrey Clark. And now we have got this problem we are  in with Mark  [[Page H7651]]  Meadows, who had been on the path of cooperation, had turned over these  thousands of documents, and now he is in the very awkward position of  saying he is not going to testify about thousands of documents that he  already turned over to us, which demonstrate how radically dangerous  that day, in fact, was.   Let me just read a few more of the texts that Mr. Meadows disclosed  to our committee: One text said, ``We are under siege here at the  Capitol.'' That came to him on January 6.   Another, ``They have breached the Capitol.''   ``Mark, protesters are literally storming the Capitol. Breaking  windows on doors. Rushing in. Is Trump going to say something?''   ``We are all helpless.''   Dozens of texts, including from Trump administration officials, urged  immediate action by the President, ``POTUS has to come out firmly and  tell the protesters to dissipate. Someone is going to get killed.''    And, of course, several people died on that day and within days of  the attack on January 6.   In another, ``Mark, he needs to stop this now.''   A third in all caps, ``TELL THEM TO GO HOME.''   A fourth, and I quote, ``POTUS needs to calm this''--expletive  deleted, excrement--``down.''   Multiple FOX News hosts themselves knew the President needed to act  immediately. They texted Mr. Meadows. He turned over those texts to us.  ``Mark, President needs to tell people in the Capitol to go home. This  is hurting all of us. He is destroying his legacy,'' wrote Laura  Ingraham.   Brian Kilmeade texted, ``Please get him on TV. Destroying everything  you have accomplished.''   Sean Hannity urged by text, ``Can he make a statement? Ask people to  leave the Capitol.'' And so on.   We need to find out what actions were taken in response to all of  those entreaties from Members of Congress, from members of the media,  from members of Trump's own family, what sequence of events took place  afterwards.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The gentlewoman invokes the oath of office. Former President Trump  swore an oath to uphold and defend our Constitution, and we have all of  these tweets which clearly indicate he wasn't doing that.   H. Res. 503 authorizes and obligates our committee to get to the  particulars and details of what took place on January 6, what were the  causes behind it, and what do we need to do to defend ourselves in the  future against these kinds of attacks on our election process, on the  peaceful transfer of power, and on the workings of Congress.   That is what we are doing.   And with their January 6 case collapsing all around them, my  colleagues now head for the border in their rhetoric, and I don't blame  them for doing that. But they are not going to fool the American  people. People understand exactly what is happening here.   The prior speaker said that it is a crime not to show up for a  subpoena, and he said you know who does that, undocumented aliens.  Well, then it is undocumented aliens, Steve Bannon, and Mark Meadows  who are violating the law.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1300     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, hundreds of people have come forward to testify about  the violent and dangerous events of January 6, and there are just a  handful of people, like Mr. Bannon and Mr. Meadows, who somehow think  they are above the law.   We are not a banana republic because we hold everybody to equality  under the law. And we are not communists, as the gentlewoman from  Georgia suggested. Those are just the friends of the former President,  who you lionize, like the dictator of North Korea, who he loves, and  Vladimir Putin, who said that the greatest tragedy of the 20th century  was the collapse of the Soviet Union. So, those are your friends. Don't  put them on our side.   They are saying that the Select Committee on the January 6th Attack  is out to persecute and bankrupt their opponents. On the contrary, we  are out to write a report, under H. Res. 503, to the American people  about the most violent, sweeping, and dangerous attack on the Republic  since the Civil War or the War of 1812.   Mr. Bannon is raising money on it. Far from bankrupting Mr. Bannon,  he is trying to get rich on it. And Mark Meadows has written a book  where he tells all the stories he wants about January 6. It is just  that he doesn't want to face the rule of law and the questions of this  bipartisan committee, which is making tremendous progress in terms of  getting the truth of what happened on that day.   Mr. Speaker, I recommend to all of my colleagues who invoked the rule  of law today that they read the D.C. Circuit Court opinion, which  obliterates every single argument that they have made about executive  privilege. It is basically gone now because the way the law works is  the people have a right to get the information we want unless there is  a compelling interest on the other side. They haven't even pretended to  invoke a compelling interest.   What is the compelling interest in being able to prepare an  insurrection, a coup against the government? Is that what we want to  establish a precedent for, that outgoing Presidents can try to organize  an insurrection against the Vice President and encourage people who go  out and stage a riot against the Vice President of the United States  and the Congress? I don't think so.   Mr. Speaker, a couple of the speakers said it was absence of  legislative purpose. This is the central purpose of our government, to  make the government survive and to go out and serve the people. That is  what this committee is doing.   Mr. Speaker, he is in contempt. I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and  the previous question.   The material previously referred to by Mrs. Fischbach is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 848    At the end of the resolution, add the following:         Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 2729) to immediately resume construction of the       border wall system along the international border between the       United States and Mexico to secure the border, enforce the       rule of law, and expend appropriated funds as mandated by       Congress, and for other purposes. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. The bill shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and on any amendment       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Homeland Security; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 2729.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, like 300 other witnesses called to meet  with the January 6 committee and our staff, Mark Meadows was, indeed,  cooperating with our committee and voluntarily released thousands of  pages of admittedly unprivileged documents, and then something changed.  His book came out and apparently embarrassed Donald Trump.   After ex-President Trump exploded and called the book fake news,  Meadows performed a U-turn and suddenly refused to appear at the  December 8 deposition that he had previously agreed to. He called his  own book fake news, which is a pretty devastating review to render on  your own book, and he brought a lawsuit against the committee  alleging--check this out--that we have no legislative purpose.   Meadows' sudden vanishing act cannot vaporize the Article I  legislative power of our committee to investigate the massive assault  on American democracy that took place on January 6. If the January 6  committee has no legislative purpose, then none of our committees do,  for the first rule of democratic government is self-preservation.   Article I, Section 8, Clause 15 gives us the power to suppress  insurrections and repel invasions against the Union, and this we will  do by investigating and reporting on the most dangerous political  violence ever unleashed against the Capitol by a domestic enemy.   We have hundreds of questions. Yes, we do. The fact that Donald  Trump, who gave Mr. Meadows a positive blurb for his book, apparently  changed his mind about the book doesn't mean that Mr. Meadows can now  violate a congressional subpoena, something that Meadows frequently  insisted upon himself as a leading member of the House Oversight  Committee, and he knows it. And we have pages and pages of his  insisting upon the central importance of honoring the subpoenas of  Congress.   We have hundreds of questions for Mr. Meadows about information he  has already admitted is not privileged in any way at all by the  executive privilege, the Fifth Amendment, or anything else.   Here is one of them: How did the following text from a House lawmaker  influence Trump's plans to overthrow Joe Biden's electoral college  majority of 306 to 232 after Joe Biden beat Donald Trump?   Here is what that lawmaker wrote him. On November 4, a Member of this  body wrote to Meadows: Here is an aggressive strategy--one day after  the election--why can't the States of Georgia, North  Carolina, Pennsylvania, and other Republican-controlled State houses  declare this is BS where conflicts in election not called that night  and just send their own electors to vote and have it go to the SCOTUS,  the Supreme Court of the United States.    How did this text influence the planning of Mark Meadows and Donald  Trump to try to destroy the lawful electoral college majority that had  been established by the people of the United States and the States for  Joe Biden?   Those are the kind of questions that we have a right to ask Mark  Meadows. He does not have any special privilege above any other citizen  to get out of his civic responsibility.
