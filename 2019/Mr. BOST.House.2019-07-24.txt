 Mr. Speaker, southern Illinois is home to one of America's  great civilizations in history, many years before this was the United  States of America. Its center was at Cahokia, and it was once the  largest civilization in today's United States. By 1200 A.D., the  community numbered 10,000 to 20,000 strong.   What remains today are the Cahokia Mounds, a 2,200-acre site with  more than 70 earth mounds, upon which many of their buildings once  stood. This treasure is visited by schools, families, and history  buffs, everyone who wants to see this wonderful part of history. It is  a critical part of history.   That is why I introduced a bill to make Cahokia Mounds a national  park. My bill would help preserve this amazing piece of history for  generations to come.   I thank Congressmen Clay, Shimkus, and Davis for cosponsoring this  bill. This legislation preserves the mounds in their districts, as  well.   I also thank the State and local leaders who support our efforts in  Illinois, and I thank the HeartLands Conservancy for its hard work and  for being guardians of our history.   I thank my staff for working so hard with other issues that are going  on but understanding how important this issue is to future generations,  to the opportunity for our children and grandchildren to understand the  history of this area in the world. I am proud to be part of these  efforts to preserve our past well into the future.                            ____________________
