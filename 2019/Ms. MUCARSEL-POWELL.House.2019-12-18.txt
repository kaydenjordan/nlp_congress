 Madam Speaker, I did not have the privilege of  being born into this country. My mother brought me from Ecuador,  looking for freedom and opportunity.   But that is not my story alone. This is a story that I share with so  many people who live in Florida's 26th District and all over the  country. We have experienced corruption in our countries of birth,  where brutal dictatorships have choked their potential to benefit those  in power.   This President elected by the American people has violated his oath  of office and violated the rule of law. The evidence is overwhelming  that he withheld military aid approved by Congress and leveraged a  White House meeting to extract a political favor from a foreign  government.   The President actively sought foreign election interference to  benefit himself. It is undeniable that he has abused his power and  obstructed Congress. He presents a clear and present danger to our  democracy.   As an immigrant, I still get chills because I feel so fortunate to  live in this extraordinary country. The genius of American democracy  lies in our Constitution and the dedication to the rule of law. I want  my children, and all of our children, to feel the same way when they  grow up.   However, if we sit idly by as cracks begin to appear in our  democratic institutions, our children will be in the same situation so  many of us experienced when we left countries whose leaders destroyed  democracy.   We in Congress must abide by our oath to defend our Constitution.  That is my duty as a Member of this body. That is my duty as a mother.
