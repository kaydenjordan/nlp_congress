 Madam Chair, I rise in support of the FAIR Act, a  bipartisan bill introduced by my friend and fellow Georgian,  Congressman Johnson.   I am proud to cosponsor this bill which will help small businesses by  ending the use of forced arbitration. These tiny clauses hidden in the  fine print are used to trick rising entrepreneurs in their dealings  with sophisticated conglomerates.   Small businesses need to sign contracts for phone plans, credit  cards, and rental cars, but too often, lurking in the fine print, a few  words can cost them their constitutional right to their day in court.  With this bill, our entrepreneurs can focus on growing their businesses  and investing in our communities.   Madam Chair, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.
