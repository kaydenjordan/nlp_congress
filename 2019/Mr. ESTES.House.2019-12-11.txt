 Mr. Speaker, I was not present for rollcall vote No. 671  on the motion to table the motion to reconsider, adoption on H. Res.  758. Had I been present, I would have voted ``nay.''                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3, a bill that  should be called the fewer cures and more government price controls  act.   My colleagues know this partisan bill is another that is dead on  arrival in the Senate, but it didn't have to be this way. I truly wish  that my colleagues across the aisle had not abandoned the good faith,  bipartisan negotiations on a realistic, workable solution to fix  soaring drug prices.   Instead, H.R. 3 was changed after it was passed out of committee to  please extreme voices on the left and become a giveaway for radical  policies.   Even the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said H.R. 3 will  result in fewer cures and fewer drugs coming to market, and current  drugs being pulled from the market.   That means that, while H.R. 3 may lower drug prices today, it comes  at the expense of fewer cures being developed in the future and more  government controls.   We should not be forced to choose between lower prices or less  innovation, just like no one should have to choose between paying for  groceries or paying for their medication.   We must address this issue. But instead of H.R. 3, I encourage my  colleagues to join me in supporting an amendment before us based on  H.R. 19, the Lower Costs, More Cures Act.   This amendment, and the H.R. 19 bill, will use bipartisan reforms to  lower prices, protect access to new medications, strengthen  transparency with drug companies and PBMs, and allow competition to  thrive.   I know this will help people across our country, like a community  pharmacist I heard from in a rural area in my district. Unfortunately,  retroactive and unpredictable fees to PBMs totaling $45,000, just in  2018 alone, have left it hard for this business to stay afloat and to  serve patients in this rural community.   Unlike H.R. 3, our bipartisan solution will help give him and other  community pharmacists, particularly in rural areas, the needed  stability and predictability.   This is just one way today's amendment and H.R. 19 will help patients  lower their out-of-pocket-costs and help keep more cures coming to  market.   And furthermore, unlike H.R. 3, this measure could be passed and  delivered to the President's desk this year and provide real relief to  our seniors.
