 Mr. Speaker, before I was elected to  serve in the House of Representatives, I spent nearly 30 years in the  nonprofit healthcare field assisting those individuals who were facing  life-changing diseases and disability. Additionally, as a member of my  home community, I have volunteered for decades as an emergency medical  technician, serving my neighbors in their time of trauma or medical  emergency needs.   I am acutely aware of the challenges many face when it comes to  obtaining reasonably priced health care. It is especially critical for  rural America, like much of the Fifth Congressional District of  Pennsylvania.   We are facing a healthcare crisis in our Nation's rural areas. These  often disadvantaged populations are still struggling to access  affordable, quality care. Many remain uninsured. Many find themselves  newly uninsured as a result of the pressures and the demands and the  mandates of the Affordable Care Act. Most are underinsured; however,  access to quality care really does remain the largest challenge.   Even when people gain access to health insurance or coverage, it does  not equal access to care. Rural hospitals across the country are  closing, leaving patients without access to their emergency rooms and  long-term care facilities. When you close a hospital in a rural area,  the result is a commute that means the difference, frequently, between  life and death.   Eighty rural hospitals have closed since 2010. One in three rural  hospitals are financially vulnerable. At the current closure rate, more  than 25 percent of rural hospitals will close in less than a decade.   As this Congress examines ways to improve our Nation's healthcare  system, we must not forget that rural health care is unique and  requires different programs to succeed.   In addition to hospital closures, a workforce shortage plagues rural  America; 77 percent of more than 2,000 rural counties in the United  States are designated as having a shortage of healthcare professionals.  Recruitment and retention of experienced professionals, including  primary care physicians, is an ongoing challenge.                                time  1015    Mr. Speaker, no matter how you pay for health care, if there are not  qualified and trained professionals in those communities, healthcare  access does not exist. Congress must act to stop cuts to rural  hospitals and strengthen the healthcare workforce in underserved areas.   Furthermore, the opioid epidemic that is sweeping the Nation has  ravaged our rural communities, leaving  [[Page H395]]  even more of the population in need of crucial health services.  Adolescents and young adults living in rural areas are more vulnerable  to opioid abuse than their urban counterparts. The prevalence of fatal  drug overdoses has skyrocketed in rural areas. High unemployment and a  greater rate of the types of injuries that result in prescriptions for  opioid medications have contributed to this.   For these reasons, I again look forward to cosponsoring the Save  Rural Hospitals Act in the 115th Congress. We must ensure access to  health care for Americans living in rural areas.   On average, trauma victims in rural areas must travel twice as far as  victims in urban areas to the closest hospital. As a result, 60 percent  of trauma deaths occur in rural areas, even though only 20 percent of  Americans live in rural areas.   The Affordable Care Act was supposed to help cut costs for health  care, but that did not happen for everyone. American families have  found out the hard way, with increased taxes, looming regulations, and  a slew of broken promises, from untrue cost controls to limitations on  consumer choice. We were told that, ``if you like your coverage, you  can keep it.'' Well, that was not even close to being true.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to fix our flawed  healthcare system. Currently, healthcare costs have gone up, premiums  have increased by double digits, but choices have decreased.  Deductibles are so high that many Americans, despite having  ``coverage,'' cannot afford to seek care under that coverage. Well,  that is not right. It is not fair, and it is not feasible. There must  be a better way, and I know together we can work to find a stable  transition to a 21st century healthcare system that works for everyone  in America, particularly for those in rural regions where the need is  great and the services are scarce.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, as the mercury dropped to  record lows this week in Pennsylvania, I rise to highlight an upcoming  cold-weather event in State College, Pennsylvania.   The Light Up State College will attempt to break a Guinness World  Record next month by lighting more than 3,000 ice luminaries on Allen  Street between College Avenue and Beaver Avenue at 6 p.m. the first  Saturday in February.   Now, you may ask: What is an ice luminary? According to Guinness, ice  luminaries are cup-shaped structures made purely out of ice that hold a  light inside. Those interested in helping break this record can pick up  a do-it-yourself ice luminary kit in downtown State College.   The current world record contains 2,561 separate lanterns and was set  in 2013 by the residents of a small town in Sweden. They have been  making ice luminary lanterns to coincide with a nearby winter market  for the past 10 years.   Light Up State College is a partnership of three groups: Centre  Foundation, Make Space, and the Knight Foundation. Organizers have  asked individuals in State College to commit to making ice luminaries,  as more than 2,000 are still needed to help put State College over the  line and on the map in the Guinness Book of World Records. This record- breaking event will take place in State College on Saturday, February  4.   I wish them the best of luck.                            ____________________
