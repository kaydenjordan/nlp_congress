 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is indeed historic, the largest disaster  relief package in American history. I am disappointed, as many of my  constituents are, that much of this bill is not directly targeted at  emergency relief, but that is the cost of doing business in a divided  government in such divided times.   Indeed, much that was on the last-minute ideological wish list has  been removed and focus returned to the virus and its economic effect. A  colleague said earlier, this is much like a 9/11 moment. It is up to us  today.   Highlights include: help for our revered veterans, nearly $20 billion  for their medical care, homeless vets, and modernizing VA telehealth;  expansion of telehealth into rural America, like my own district, to  bridge that gap in rural services technology; $350 billion in  guaranteed SBA loans, cushioning the blow and providing much stability  for small businesses so that their employees will have jobs waiting  when the all clear signal finally sounds.   Mr. Speaker, it is my hope and prayer that this act hits the targets  and brings the certainty that I hope most of us in this room desire  and, importantly, meets the needs of the very concerned American  people.    Mr. Speaker, I thank President Trump and his team for leading our  country back to stability.
