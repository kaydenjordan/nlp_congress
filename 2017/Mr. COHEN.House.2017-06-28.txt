 Mr. Chairman, I thank Ranking Member Conyers for yielding  me time. Mr. Chair, I share your grief over last night's loss. Sorry  about that.   Mr. Chairman, this bill is a loss, too. It is a loss to people who  have been injured by defective drugs, defective medical devices, been  harmed in nursing homes, or been harmed by medical malpractice because  it sets a cap on noneconomic damages of $250,000, no matter whom the  person is, whatever their position was, no matter what damages they  suffered.   Trial lawyers aren't the most liked people in America. They are a  little bit above Congress people, I think, but it is right in there  with used car salesmen. None of the three of us are doing real good. So  it is easy to kind of beat us up.   But people like their doctors. I see Dr. Roe over there. People like  doctors. Doctors provide healthcare, if they are allowed to by Federal  law and given the opportunity to get reimbursed and have a system.  People don't generally like trial lawyers. But the fact is, trial  lawyers do a public service because they represent people. When they do  it on contingency fees, they do it for people who wouldn't have the  money to hire a lawyer, necessarily, but have been harmed. And they go  in on the idea that sometimes they will get nothing, but if they win,  they get a contingency fee, and they give representation to people who  otherwise couldn't afford it.   When they win, they win because a jury--which is like a little focus  group of America--says there was a duty that the doctor breached and a  harm done to the patient and the patient should be compensated.   My chairman says this is just like California, and there he goes  again with that Reagan stuff. Reagan was 40 years ago, I think, 35  years ago. Whatever. Californians thought this isn't California's law.  This goes further than California on joint liability. The fact is, when  you eliminate joint and several liability in certain places, a certain  part of it is California, a certain part of it isn't, it is less likely  that the injured party is going to be able to collect.   It goes further in terms of setting a statute of limitations, but the  big picture is States' rights. Normally, the folks on the other side of  the aisle are all for States' rights. They are for States' rights when  it comes to voting rights. They are for States' rights when it comes to  civil rights. They are for States' rights on all kinds of things that  generally tend to tamp down the lower economic folk in our country,  particularly in the South.   But here on medical malpractice, which has always been a province of  the States, they want to usurp it and make a Federal standard that  applies to everybody.   If a State hasn't set a cap on damages, then the Federal cap of  $250,000 would go into place. So if you have a State that says it is  unconstitutional to have a cap because you have got a right to a jury  trial, then you might not be able to have that cap, and you will have  this $250,000 cap set.    There are all kinds of problems with Federalism, all kinds of  problems with people who have been injured getting compensated, and  other problems.   Go Tigers.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, the amendment does even more damage than the  bill does because it makes it possible that there will be even less  time for a plaintiff, once they are aware of their injury, to bring  action.   This is something that lessens the statute of limitations. That is  what the bill is trying to do, is to see that less people get their  opportunity to get to court, which is what statute of limitations are  intended to do. That is the purpose.   When somebody has been injured from a medical malpractice case or  negligence from a nursing home, we should encourage people to get  relief and let a jury decide.   These bills--and I suspect these amendments because they are aimed at  the same thing--are opposed by the AFL-CIO; the American Federation of  State, County, and Municipal Employees; the American Bar Association-- not exactly a liberal lion--the Center for Justice and Democracy; and  the National Conference of State Legislatures. Also, because this is a  foray into federalism--unheard of before, making this a Federal issue,  not a State issue--the Consumer Federation of America, the Consumers  Unions, Public Citizen, and Vietnam Veterans of America. There are many  other groups as well.   This amendment does more to see that folks don't get access to a  jury. And the irony of it is that the national Republican effort seems  to be to talk badly about Washington and Congress and drain the swamp  and believe in the individuals back home and folks at home.   Well, the most pure form of justice comes from a jury where you have  a jury of your peers in your own community who are chosen to determine  what happened, to determine the facts, and to determine the damages.  Instead, they are proposing that the Republicans in Congress know  better what to do to put limits on what a jury can award their fellow  citizens.   And they are also putting limitations on the statute of limitations  and lessening that, and on joint and several liability, which go toward  helping people who have gotten judgments be able to collect on  judgments, which is so important. A judgment is no good unless you can  collect on it. It is just counter to what the Republican Party  philosophy generally is and has been, that I have kind of perceived  recently, about being against Washington and laws coming on down high  from Washington, D.C.                                time  1530    Much of what we heard at our discussion from a gentleman from West  Virginia was about a West Virginia law. That is what you are supposed  to have is a West Virginia law. Then somebody else talked about a Texas  law, and they are holding up a California law.   Each State is supposed to make its own laws. We have got 50 States.  They  [[Page H5276]]  talk a lot about the 50 States and the electoral college, and the  States have an important function in our system of government. They are  supposed to be areas where they have provinces and act. Juries, jury  trials, and trial courts, that is all State law, and that should be  determined by West Virginia, Texas, California, and Florida, not up  here.   This bill, when it went through committee, passed by one vote because  a couple of folks--I think it was Judge Poe and Judge Gohmert; I am  pretty sure it was the two of them--two judges from the State of Texas  felt it went too far in encroaching on the States' province dealing  with tort law. This amendment just goes the same direction.   This is just unfortunate that what we are trying to do is help,  really, insurance companies; it is not so much doctors. Doctors might  benefit some, but it is the insurance companies that would benefit the  most, and that is who this is about.   So we oppose the amendment and we oppose the bill. We support the  American people and the right of the people and the juries to dispense  justice that the facts dictate and that justice demands.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, this is an amendment--a bad amendment--that  makes a bad bill worse. All those folks from Texas ought to be going to  Austin. Where this belongs is in Austin, not in Washington. These are  State issues.   We had an amendment that said that these defensive measures that you  say that they are taking that waste all this money and time, we had an  amendment that said these caps wouldn't apply if you cut off the wrong  arm, and you all wouldn't take it. So I don't know how many defensive  measures they have got.   This is the right arm; this is the left arm. When you go in to do  surgery and you have to amputate an arm, take off the right arm or the  left arm, but not the wrong arm. If you take off the wrong arm--damages  big time. You all didn't accept that amendment.   This is shutting the courthouse door, closing down juries, and not  having faith in the American people to be able to ascertain facts and  damages as they have throughout time immemorial. It is a power grab  from Washington. It is the swamp draining over to flood the State  houses of all 50 of our States.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.  [[Page H5277]]     Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, this is called the Protecting Access to Care Act, but  that is really a misnomer because the purpose of these amendments in  the bill takes as a given that there are going to be allegations that  doctors, medical device companies--not exactly limited financial  resources or in potential for harm--and nursing homes are going to be  alleged to have committed torts against individuals and that when that  happens, if this becomes law, there will be less opportunity for  individuals to get their day in court.   Because most people in the United States are not wealthy, most of the  people that get injured not being wealthy are going to bear the brunt  of this when they don't get to court within the statute of limitations  or they don't collect because of the joint and several liability  changes in the law or they get less with noneconomic damages because of  the $250,000 cap.   Who is going to benefit from this? Who is going to benefit? It is  going to be the person who a jury has found to have been negligent and  violated their duty of care: a nursing home, a medical device company,  or a physician. They are going to have less damages, less judgments  against them, and less costs. Insurance companies can then make more  money, and doctors will have lesser premiums.   Who loses? People who have been injured by medical device defective  merchandise, nursing home negligence, or medical malpractice.   We are not talking about limiting damages and the ability to recover  by having a lesser joint and several liability law. We are not talking  about people who have not gotten a judgment. We are talking about  people who have gotten a judgment for negligence.   Just like the Republican healthcare bill, this gives billions of  dollars to the richest people in America with tax cuts at the expense  of poor people who get Medicaid, people with disabilities, pregnant  women, poor people, and seniors in nursing homes. They suffer.   This is a microcosm of the healthcare proposals that the Senate can't  get 50 votes for--and they didn't even try for 60, which they normally  do, because they knew it was not going to be that sufficient, but now  they can't even get 50 under reconciliation--and it is a microcosm of  hurting the poor and enriching the rich.   These are cases where there will be judgments--juries finding  negligence, harm, and damages--if you get to the courthouse on time,  and then you won't be able to collect as much.   So who wins? The rich, the medical device companies, the nursing  homes, and the physicians. Who loses? Those who have suffered, those  whom juries have found to be victims, and victims who should be able to  collect but we are limiting how much they can collect and we are making  it more difficult for them to collect.   That is not what this Congress should be doing is enriching the  wealthy and hurting those who have been harmed by negligence. If it is  going to happen, it ought to happen in the States. So it is an attack  on the 10th Amendment.   Mr. Duncan from Tennessee came here and gave beautiful testimony  about a consistent life protecting the 10th Amendment, and that is what  Mr. Gohmert and Judge Poe also did about what is left to the States.  That is why this amendment and the bill are both bad.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Iowa  (Mr. King), because I think it helps my case.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, this is the Tennessee law. I remember it. It is  probably not such a wonderful law, even in Tennessee, even though some  of us didn't care because Tennessee is an unusual State.   You see it when you go to Rock City. From Rock City, you see seven,  eight, or nine States. That is pretty good, even without the help of  the Southern College of Optometry.   If you are in Memphis, the bill would say that you could have an  expert from Arlington, Virginia, come to Memphis. That is a long way,  yet we are so much closer to Springfield, Illinois, or even to Dallas,  Texas, or we are much closer to Baton Rouge, where they have got a lot  of great doctors. Those doctors from Baton Rouge could come to Memphis.  They would be closer to Memphis than somebody from Arlington, Virginia.   The fact is, the State should decide this. Tennessee made this  contiguous State or your own State law. For Alaska, that means you have  got Alaska. For Hawaii, it means you have got Hawaii. The States should  decide who is an expert and who isn't.   It also says you have got to be in practice for the previous year. If  somebody is not in practice and they are a professor at a medical  school and maybe the outstanding expert on cardiovascular diseases, and  they happen to be someplace like Harvard, they wouldn't be able to go  to a State that is not contiguous to Massachusetts. If they weren't  practicing, they wouldn't be able to be an expert at all.   These arbitrary time limits, arbitrary requirements, and arbitrary  demographic limitations are not aimed at justice or saving costs. They  are aimed at reducing the number of experts who might be available.   In a State, it is more difficult to get an expert to come testify  because you may get ostracized by your fellow professionals. It might  be easier for a plaintiff to find an expert from a State that is a  little bit of a distance.   I am not that familiar with Maine. Does it touch maybe Vermont and  New Hampshire? It kind of limits itself, too. In Tennessee, you would  have 9 or 10 States; in Alaska, none; Hawaii, none; Maine, two.  Minnesota has got to be limited because we wouldn't go to Canada  because that is not part of our system.    Of course, this isn't really part of our system either because our  system is a Federal system, where we give States the right to make  these decisions and not make them up in Washington with a one-size- fits-all way to stop people who have been damaged by medical  malpractice, medical device defects, or nursing home negligence from  getting whole compensation.   We put a limit from Washington on the old person who is being taken  advantage of by some individual in a nursing home or some individual  who has been given a defective valve in their heart because of a  medical device problem.  [[Page H5279]]    We in Washington, under this bill, think we know more than what a  jury should know about the effects and the damages when that person  testifies in that courtroom in front of that jury and before that judge  and have their damages proven. You can see that individual and know the  harm they have been caused, but their damages are going to be limited  because of something that goes on here in Washington, D.C.   That is something the other side argues against constantly. They say  things should be decided back home in the States--things like voting  rights and trying to limit the opportunity for people in the Justice  Department to see to it that people get a chance to vote. They say that  States' rights are primary when it suits their purposes.   In Tennessee, the doctors own the medical malpractice insurance  company. I think it has the word ``Volunteer'' in it. It is the doctors  who own it. So they will be direct beneficiaries.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I was going to try to find that language.   Years ago, a trial lawyer named J.D. Lee told me when I was just a  28-year-old constitutional convention delegate: Don't go down rabbit  trails. The gentleman from Iowa is throwing rabbit trails out there,  and I am not going to go down one.   The fact is, this is a State issue that should be determined by the  States and should be determined by judges and jurors in their  jurisdiction who see the defendant and see the plaintiff with their own  eyes and determine the facts as the facts dictate and justice demands,  is what we hear and what we live by in jury cases. That is what we  should live by in Washington in determining what damages are, and not  making the decisions up here in Washington, D.C.   This is a bad amendment. It is a bad bill. It is contrary to the  mantra that you normally hear from the other side.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to my friend's  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment prohibits the introduction of  apologies as evidence of liability, imposes on States the  qualifications for expert witnesses in a healthcare lawsuit, requires  plaintiffs to obtain a certificate of merit from a healthcare  professional in order to pursue a healthcare lawsuit, and has a 90-day  pre-suit notification requirement.   This amendment is very, very difficult in that it says that, if you  apologize, a doctor apologizes, the hope is that the doctor can  apologize and the patient may think: Oh, he apologized. That is nice. I  won't sue him. But then if you decide to sue him or her, you can't put  that apology in evidence against him. So it is kind of maybe crocodile  tears, a crocodile apology.   But it also requires a plaintiff to get a certificate of merit from a  healthcare professional to pursue a healthcare lawsuit--not from a  lawyer, but from a healthcare professional. You have got to go to the  fraternity to sue a fellow fraternity brother. That is a strange one.   This amendment would add numerous problematic provisions that  significantly expand this bill beyond what was even discussed in the  Judiciary Committee and in Rules, and it violates State sovereignty,  all without any proper legislative vetting before coming to the floor.  This is the first I have seen it or I think anybody has seen this  proposal--not necessarily regular order.   Its apology provision is overly broad and undermines the legal right  of patients. This provision states any apology by a healthcare provider  given to a patient or their family is inadmissible for any purpose as  evidence of liability or an admission against interest. If it is a true  apology, it should be admitted, but it won't be.   The purpose of so-called apology laws that occur sometimes at the  State level, which is where they should be, is to encourage a doctor to  apologize to the patient for any harm while preserving that patient's  ability to offer evidence of wrongdoing. Yet this amendment upends this  balance by prohibiting the admission of all expressions of empathy or  apology for any purpose of evidence or admission of liability.   This overbroad language undermines the patient's ability to offer  evidence that he or she was harmed by wrongdoing. By making  inadmissible admissions of fault by the provider, the amendment goes  further than many State laws that do not prohibit admissions of fault  and would still allow apology evidence to be used for purposes other  than proving liability, such as impeaching a witness.  [[Page H5281]]    Second, the amendment imposes highly restrictive expert witness  qualifications on State courts, which we just discussed with Mr. Roe's  amendment. This amendment requires the expert witness to be an exact  carbon copy of the defendant. The expert must teach or practice in the  same specialty and must have been doing so at the time of the  occurrence that forms the basis of the lawsuit and for 1 year preceding  the occurrence.   Under this provision, someone with 30 years of professional  experience may not qualify; whereas, a person with 1 year of experience  could qualify as an expert. Indeed, this rule excludes retired  professionals, many academics, and researchers from testifying as  experts. It should be up to a judge in the courtroom or to a State that  has province over this jurisdiction, not the Federal Government.    Third, this amendment imposes further burdens on injured plaintiffs  beyond the already onerous requirements of the underlying bill before  they can even file a lawsuit. The amendment requires an injured patient  to obtain a certificate from a healthcare professional attesting to the  legal merit of the case. This requires injured plaintiffs to find a  healthcare professional, not a lawyer, to evaluate the legal merits of  the case at the time of filing--closed frat house.   Certificates of merit are a costly, unnecessary obstacle and only  serve to block injured plaintiffs access to the courts. There is little  proof that such requirements reduce frivolous litigation or costs to  medical providers, and certainly they don't help people who have been  harmed by negligent treatment.   This requirement overrides State supreme court decisions in Arizona,  Arkansas, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Washington, which held that similar  lawsuit certification laws violated their State constitutions.   The amendment also requires an injured plaintiff to provide a  healthcare provider 90 days' written notice before commencing the  lawsuit. This notice requirement is another unnecessary hurdle intended  to increase the cost of litigation for injured plaintiffs and dissuade  them from filing suit. There is scant evidence that such notice reduces  frivolous litigation or facilitates the compensation of the injured  party.   Finally, the amendment represents the extreme intrusion on States'  rights, which this whole bill does, and is such a flip from the normal  Republican thought processes.   Each previously described provision includes the so-called State  flexibility provisions in an attempt to brush off federalism concerns  that these provisions are mostly one-way preemptive. They only preserve  State laws that mirror the amendments' requirements and State laws  which include requirements in addition to those imposed by the  amendment. While it preserves State notice requirements, it overrides  State laws that do not have such.   The States, not Congress, should determine the qualifications for  appearing as an expert witness in State court proceedings, determine  the appropriate uses of apology evidence, and decide whether  certificates are proper or not.   For these reasons, I, unfortunately, have to oppose the amendment by  my good friend Mr. Hudson, who is a great Tar Heel.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to my  friend's misguided amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this is incongruous with the rest of the  discussion we have had. It is consistent in that it is an attempt to  say that people who have been harmed won't be able to recover, and it  makes it harder to recover; and it protects the physicians--and the  people--who basically are determined to have been negligent.   But, it says that, it is an affirmative defense to any healthcare  liability claim--that is not just to a doctor. A healthcare liability  claim could be to a nursing home or a medical device company--where the  defendant complied with a clinical practice guideline developed by a  national or State medical society or medical specialty society that is  applicable.   They have just argued that for the plaintiff to have an expert  witness, that expert witness has to come from the State where the  action is brought, or a contiguous State. But, for the defendant, you  can have a national practice guideline as an affirmative defense. So  when you are in Memphis, you can't get an expert witness from Harvard  or the University of Michigan or the University of Southern California  because those States aren't contiguous, but the physician could get a  medical society's or a national society's perspective and have it be an  affirmative offense.   It is inconsistent. The whole purpose of this law is inconsistency,  to give an advantage to those who have much and who do harm at the  expense of those who have been harmed and have less. We see this  continual attack on the poor and the injured.   In the healthcare bill, we talk about less opportunity because of  diminution in Medicaid for the poor, disabled, seniors, and pregnant  women to get healthcare. Here, we are talking about people who have  been injured--actually, in fact, injured. And we are saying that a  medical society's rule should be an affirmative defense, no matter  where they are. We limit the experts you can have, and we limit the  damages you can collect.   And this isn't to some specious group. This is to people who have  actually been injured, and the juries in their home districts have  found them to be plaintiffs who proved by a preponderance of the  evidence that the defendant tort fees, or doctor, nursing home, or  medical device company, breached the standard of care to which they  were held to. It is giving them protections of the law given by  Washington, almighty Washington.   Once again, I submit to you that the swamp is not being drained but  is overflowing to flood the courthouses and not allow justice to come  to those who have been harmed by negligence. For time and memorial, it  has been the province of the States, the Tenth Amendment. Tort  liability and court systems should be determined by legislators and bar  associations, maybe medical societies, but back home, not national  medical specialty societies or national medical societies as defenses,  which is what this particular amendment brings forth.   I heard my friend from Tennessee say that in Tennessee, 60 percent of  the verdicts go to lawyers. That is not true. He first talked about a  law passed in 2008, that limits attorneys' fees. So since then, it  certainly has not been 60 percent, and even before then it wasn't 60  percent. The typical contingency fee is a third, and nothing if you  don't win, and there are great expenses incurred.   This is closing the courthouse door to injured parties who juries  have found to be injured and limiting their access to recovery. This  allows a national medical society to be a part of a fraternity to give  an affirmative defense to another frat brother.   I oppose the amendment, I oppose the bill, and I am in favor of an  open and free court system that punishes malfeasance and rewards those  who have been injured by people who do not practice up to the standard  of care that is dictated for them in their own State.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Goodlatte for his honest  testimony and submitting it. For that reason, among others, I will be  voting ``no'' on this amendment, and I hope that it will be found to be  ``no'' by the Chair. Because when the chairman of the Judiciary  Committee, a fine Republican lawyer, says that the amendment is beyond  what they intended, it shouldn't really be part of the bill.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
