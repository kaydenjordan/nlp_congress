 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2201 would create an unnecessary and potentially  dangerous loophole in Federal and State securities laws by allowing  companies to sell unregistered securities without important safeguards  that normally apply to such transactions. Specifically, the bill would  allow a company to raise up to $500,000 from 35 or fewer investors,  subject only to the requirement that each of these investors has a  substantive preexisting relationship with the company.   Currently, before a company can offer or sell its securities, it must  either register the offering with the Securities and Exchange  Commission--that is the SEC--or qualify for at least one of several  existing exemptions from registration. These exemptions provide reduced  regulatory requirements for businesses conducting the offerings, but  are limited to investors who have the financial sophistication to  understand the risks, or enough assets to bear losses without the full  protections of the securities laws.    Additionally, unlike H.R. 2201, these existing exemptions include  several critical investor protections, such as notice to regulators,  limitations on advertising, and restrictions on resale. For example,  securities offered pursuant to rule 506 of regulation D are restricted,  meaning they cannot be resold for at least a year without registering  them; that is, re-registering them.   Additionally, the re-registration exemptions available under the  crowdfunding rules and regulation A impose limitations on the amounts  an individual can invest in a year, thereby placing a cap on potential  losses.   H.R. 2201's lack of basic safeguards would leave investors vulnerable  to an array of investment scams. For example, a purchaser of securities  offered pursuant to H.R. 2201 would be able to immediately resell the  securities in secondary transactions. In the past, the failure to  restrict the resale of unregistered securities has exposed secondary  investors to ``pump and dump'' schemes, a form of fraud that involves  hyping up cheap junk stock in order to resell it at a higher price to  unwitting investors.   Additionally, investor and consumer advocates, like Americans for  Financial Reform, Center for American Progress, and Public Citizen,  oppose H.R. 2201 because it would enable a particularly deceptive scam  known as ``affinity fraud.'' Bad actors perpetrating affinity fraud  could use H.R. 2201 to prey upon religious communities, ethnic groups,  and the elderly.   Just a few years ago, the SEC shut down a scheme targeting the  Hispanic community in southern California. The perpetrators raised more  than $800,000 by representing to close friends and family members that  their investment would be used to develop a financial services firm  serving the Hispanic community.   The SEC found that, instead of developing the purported business, the  scammers ``used a large part of the investors' money to engage  unsuccessfully in high risk `day-trading' of stocks; pay personal  living, travel, and entertainment expenses; or make other unexplained  expenditures with no connection to the purported startup business  activities.''   H.R. 2201 would provide a roadmap for bad actors to similarly rip off  investors. The bill's $500,000 cap on offerings does not eliminate the  need for robust safeguards against fraud and abuse. In fact, these  protections are even more important for offerings of this size, given  the proliferation of investment schemes in the smaller offering space.   The SEC has found that ``fraud in the micro cap stock markets is of  increasing concern to regulators, as such markets have proven to be  fertile grounds for fraud and abuse.''   While $500,000 may not seem like a lot on Wall Street, for Main  Street Americans, losing even a fraction of that amount would destroy  the hope of one day retiring with dignity. Existing exemptions such as  those available under the SEC's regulation D, regulation A, and  crowdfunding rules provide ample opportunities for companies to raise  capital while also protecting investors.   H.R. 2201 would only expose hardworking Americans to a new and wholly  unnecessary risk. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote  ``no'' on H.R. 2201, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he  may consume to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how  much time I have remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we have laid out this morning exactly how vulnerable  groups and individuals can be taken advantage of with legislation like  this. I don't know exactly where this legislation originated, but I can  almost guarantee you that we are creating opportunities for individuals  who don't have the best interest of our constituents at heart to  literally get small groups together, 35, I guess, or less, and sell  them on ideas where they are raising funds that probably will not  result in profits as expected by those who are investing in these  schemes.                                time  0945    No, there are no protections. There is no notice. The SEC will not  know when and where these schemes are arising. So I would say to my  colleagues on the opposite side of the aisle: When are we going to act  as if we have the best interests of our constituents at heart? When are  we going to be about protecting consumers rather than opening up  opportunities for them to be the victims of fraud?   We have fraudulent schemes that are directed at the most vulnerable  people. I know where those people who are organizing these schemes will  go. They will go to our churches where well-meaning ministers and  parishioners will be taken advantage of.   In these vulnerable communities that are always taken advantage of,  we have people who are the victims of payday loans where they are  paying 400 percent for moneys that they are borrowing when they are  desperate in between paychecks. We have rent-to-own schemes. We have  all kinds of schemes where these convenience stores, in places where we  have food deserts, are charging extremely high prices for food that is  basically being sold for regular, ordinary, good prices in other  communities.   In some communities, even in California, the gas taxes are rising. We  have the rental market that is going off the scale all over this  country with people not being able to afford a decent lease or a decent  rental space, and so here we are just opening up another opportunity  for folks to be ripped off.   It is going to happen; I can guarantee you that. When you have  something like this that is passed by the Congress of the United  States, it is going to be taken advantage of, and the way that this is  constructed, it almost begs to be taken advantage of.   So do you know what happens when this kind of thing takes place and  Members of Congress put their reputations on passing this kind of  legislation? When the rip-offs start and people are harmed a few years  later, then they are going to come back with legislation talking about  how they are correcting the fraud and the rip-offs that we caused in  the first place.   When is this going to stop? We have a Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau that is struggling every day to protect our consumers. Prior to  Dodd-Frank, we had our oversight agencies with the responsibility of  protecting consumers, but they didn't have any real protection. So  Dodd-Frank reforms helped to create opportunities for Members of  Congress to be able to protect their consumers and not to be involved  in these kinds of schemes.   But the opposite side of the aisle has spent an inordinate amount of  time trying to kill off the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and  they have done it in so many ways. Not only do they come up with  amendments time and time again to try and shut down the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau, they treat the Director of the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau so badly that they almost deny him the  opportunity to come before our committee and to be heard.   So I don't know whose side legislators are on who create this kind of  crap. I don't understand why it is deemed to be important to open up  the opportunity for schemes and to not give the SEC the ability to know  when they are getting started, to have the  [[Page H8673]]  kind of disclosures, and to have the kind of oversight that would  protect the most vulnerable people in our society.   Mr. Speaker, yes, this legislation will probably pass today. The  Republicans have the majority votes in this Congress, and I suppose  they are going to get all of their people to vote for this bill that is  going to rip off some of their constituents, and, again, we won't be  able to stop it because, again, they have the majority votes.   But I want the people of this country to know and understand what is  happening, who is doing it to them, and why they are having a difficult  time. At a time when the rental market is going off the scale and they  can't afford to pay the first and the last month's rent to get into a  place, I want them to know who is creating the difficulties in their  lives when their jobs have not increased their pay, they are still  trying to have a decent quality of life for their families, despite the  fact that the pay does not match the job that they are doing, and they  haven't had the pay increases.   When are we going to show that we stand up for the least of these?  When your churches get ripped off--and we are working on some of those  schemes now where, even with the responsibilities that the SEC has, we  have people who are getting ripped off, and here we come with another  piece of legislation. Then what we do is we shade it in terms of this  is for small business development. Then we hear from the opposite side  about all the other companies who started as little-bitty companies in  their garage. Well, they all started without this bill. They didn't  need this bill to start.   So why are you doing this? Yeah, you are right; there are a lot of  companies, and you have named them, particularly in the high tech  industries that started, and they had some of their own money to get  started with, and maybe the family helped them, I don't know, but they  didn't have this legislation. They didn't need this legislation. Nobody  needs this legislation.   This legislation is harmful, and I would ask my colleagues to vote  against the bill. If there are any Members on the opposite side of the  aisle who really are concerned about their constituents, I would ask  them to defy their leadership and vote against this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, by allowing entities to sell unregistered securities  based solely on a preexisting relationship with the investor, H.R. 2201  would create a road map for affinity fraud.   Affinity fraud is a type of investment scam where swindlers prey upon  members of identifiable groups such as ethnic or religious communities  or the elderly. Often, affinity fraudsters take advantage of  preexisting relationships to engender trust and convince victims that a  dubious investment is legitimate.   The Securities and Exchange Commission has found that such frauds  pose heightened risks to investors because they can be difficult for  regulators or law enforcement officials to detect, particularly where  the fraudsters have used respected community or religious leaders to  convince others to join the investment.   The following cases represent a sampling of recent affinity fraud  actions from around the United States.   In August, 2013, the SEC halted an offering fraud scheme where Steven  Bruce Heinz, a Utah resident purporting to be an investment adviser,  sold phony investment contracts to more than 15 of his former clients,  family members, and friends. According to the SEC's complaint, Heinz  raised $4 million in investor funds he used to engage in high-risk  trading of future contracts and to pay his own personal expenses such  as family vacations to Mexico and a $600,000 loan.   Among the investors taken in by Heinz scam was ``the recent widow of  a church associate of Heinz who invested with Heinz after he  volunteered to assist her with her finances and investments after her  spouse died.''   In 2012, the SEC stopped a $7.5 million fraud operation targeting the  Persian-Jewish community in Los Angeles. The SEC's assistant regional  director stated that Shervin Neman ``deceived members of his own  community to raise money in this fraudulent Ponzi scheme. By exploiting  investors' trust in him, Neman was continually able to raise more money  to pay back existing investors and finance an extravagant lifestyle.''   According to the SEC's complaint, among other things, Neman spent  investor funds to pay for his wedding and honeymoon, his wife's  engagement ring, luxury cars, and VIP tickets to entertainment venues.   In 2015, the SEC permanently barred John Allan Russell from the  securities industry after Russell pled guilty to securities fraud in  Colorado State court. The SEC's administrative law judge found that  Russell obtained almost $300,000 by selling debt securities to an  elderly victim who suffered from dementia and Alzheimer's disease. The  ALJ also determined that ``Russell's scheme may have involved affinity  fraud because the misconduct began a few years after the victim acted  as Russell's godfather at his baptism.''   These cases demonstrate that H.R. 2201's preexisting relationship  requirement would not provide any meaningful deterrent against abuse.  On the contrary, it would encourage opportunistic conduct targeting  communities.  [[Page H8674]]    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting ``no'' for  this bill.   Given all that the SEC is able to do, they can't keep up with these  schemes, and now you are going to open up the door for them to have to  wrestle with trying to help people who are victims of these kinds of  schemes.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the North American Securities Administrators Association  sent this letter of concern. They said that H.R. 2201 would result in  an overly broad Federal exemption that would allow public solicitation  and sales to any investor, regardless of sophistication or financial  wherewithal, subject only to the requirement that there be a previously  existing relationship, a standard that is not difficult to establish.   In practical terms, this means that Main Street investors could be  solicited and sold up to $500,000 in private security by bad actors,  including persons having been convicted of crimes or subject to one or  more previous State enforcement actions, without any disclosure to the  investor and without any notice to State or Federal regulators.   There is no valid basis for Congress to prevent State officials  charged with protecting their constituents from making decisions about  purely local or regional issues that would rely on the exemption  established by H.R. 2201.   Further, preemption of State review or even notification for the type  of small, localized offerings contemplated by H.R. 2201 would  effectively handcuff the regulators best positioned to oversee such  offerings.   Public Citizen said this bill ``would permit small offerings with no  investor protections, such as notice of the offerings. It will enable a  type of affinity fraud, where the seller can unload dubious securities,  provided there is some relationship between seller and purchaser. This  bill assumes that a preexisting relationship will deter abuse, which is  a tenuous foundation, at best. Further, the relationship can begin with  the offer.''   They don't have to have a previous relationship. It would start when  the offer takes place.   Public Citizen further stated that ``the bill says the relationship  must only exist before the purchase.''   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters from these groups, as  well as a letter from Americans for Financial Reform.                                           North American Securities                                Administrators Association, Inc.,                                   Washington, DC, November 7, 2017.      Re H.R. 2201--The Micro-Offering Safe Harbor Act.       Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Democratic Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: On behalf of the North       American Securities Administrators Association (``NASAA''), I       write to express concern and raise specific objections to       certain provisions of H.R. 2201, The Micro-Offering Safe       Harbor Act, which is scheduled to be considered by the House       of Representatives this week. The legislation would amend       securities laws in ways that could be profoundly detrimental       to investors, and detract from the viability of the       marketplace for offerings from new or smaller issuers that       are compliant with securities law.        The Micro-Offering Safe Harbor Act amends Section 4 of the       Securities Act of 1933 to create a new exemption from       registration. To qualify for the exemption, an offering would       have to meet certain criteria regarding the number of       purchasers, their relationship to the issuer, and the amount       of capital raised. However, as more fully discussed below,       the legislation fails to include critical investor protection       measures and would preempt state regulatory authority.        State securities regulators understand the need of small       businesses to efficiently raise capital and the role strong       investor protection plays in facilitating this goal.       Unfortunately, the changes embodied in H.R. 2201, while well       intended, are ill-advised and potentially quite dangerous.       For example, unregistered securities purchased under the       exemption established by H.R. 2201 would not be       ``restricted,'' and could thus be sold immediately, exposing       investors to classic ``pump and dump'' schemes. Furthermore,       NASAA is aware of no evidence to support the proposition that       Congress should create a ``safe harbor'' to permit       unregistered securities offerings to be offered and sold,       including through general solicitation, regardless of       investor sophistication or financial wherewithal. Even as the       bill stands to introduce new and totally unnecessary risk       into securities markets--failing to even disqualify ``bad       actors'' from these markets--the goal of the legislation       remains unclear and its necessity is, at best, not well-      established. It is clear, however, from the terms of the       exemption, and its failure to impose even the modicum of       regulatory oversight that exists for similar ``private''       offerings under SEC Regulation D Rule 506, that offerings       made under the new exemption are likely to be       disproportionately risky and illiquid. This fact alone should       be cause for concern by Congress.        Beyond stark new risks to investors, this legislation       threatens to jeopardize the continued viability of       established markets geared to smaller issuers, many of which       operate lawfully within existing federal and state securities       laws. Such markets include securities sold pursuant to SEC       Rule 506, new federal exemptions established by the JOBS Act,       and exemptions adopted in many states to permit intrastate       crowdfunding. Without effective investor protection measures       a potential effect of H.R. 2201 could be to cause investors       to abandon the markets for smaller issues.        In closing, NASAA reiterates strong opposition to the       preemption of state registration and notice filing authority       in H.R. 2201. There is no valid basis for Congress to prevent       states from making decisions about the local or regional       issues that H.R. 2201 seeks to encourage. Failure to register       or at the very least, to notice file with state regulators       results in unknown sales, by unknown actors of unknown       enterprises and result in no gatekeeper function to protect       retail investors whose only source of recourse for fraudulent       sales are the state securities regulators. At a minimum H.R.       2201 should:        1) Include bad actor disqualifications;        2) Establish a holding period to reduce the likelihood of       ``pump and dump'' schemes;        3) Provide at least a notice filing with state regulators       so that in the event of a fraudulent offering, state       regulators can begin an investigation to try and protect       retail investors;        4) Limit the sale amount to retail investors so that       investors are not ``encouraged'' to place all their eggs in       one basket; and        5) Prohibit or restrict general solicitation of what are       clearly high risk securities.        Thank you for your consideration of NASAA's views.            Sincerely,                                                    Joseph P. Borg,                                        NASAA President and Alabama                                               Securities Director.  [[Page H8675]]                                          ____                                                Public Citizen,                                                   November 7, 2017.      Hon. Member,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Honorable Member: On behalf of more than 400,000       members and supporters of Public Citizen, we urge you to vote       ``NO'' on three bills coming to the floor this week that       would weaken financial protections that were put in place to       protect American consumers. HR 3911 and HR 2148 will be       considered under suspension. HR 2201 will be considered under       regular order.              H.R. 2148, Clarifying Commercial Real Estate Loans         This bill would reduce the capital requirements for High       Volatility Commercial Real Estate (HVCRE). During the recent       financial crisis, this sector caused major losses, especially       at smaller banks. The U.S. Government Accountability Office       (GAO) found that failures of small banks ``were largely       driven by credit losses on commercial real estate (CRE)       loans, particularly loans secured by real estate to finance       land development and construction.'' Further, this sector has       grown rapidly in recent years, raising further concerns about       prudential lending standards. We must assure that this type       of lending remains properly capitalized to prevent against       failures that could become economic contagions.                  H.R. 2201, Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act         This bill removes basic protections from offering       securities provided that the purchasers have a preexisting       relationship with an officer, director, or shareholder with       10 percent or more of the shares of the issuer, and the       aggregate amount of all securities sold by the issuer does       not exceed $500,000 during a 12-month period. This would       permit small offerings with no investor protections, such as       a notice of the offering. It will enable a type of affinity       fraud, where the seller can unload dubious securities       provided there is some relationship between seller and       purchaser. The bill assumes that a pre-existing relationship       will deter abuse, which is a tenuous foundation, at best.       Further, the relationship can begin with the offer. The bill       says the relationship must only exist before the purchase.       Finally, the bill pre-empts state regulatory oversight.       Removing supervisors closest to potential problems is unwise       and leaves small investors exposed to exploitation.            H.R. 3911, Risk-Based Credit Examinations Act of 2017         This bill would allow the Securities and Exchange       Commission (SEC's) Office of Credit Ratings (OCR) to reduce       its oversight of nationally recognized statistical rating       organizations (NRSROs), also known as credit rating agencies.       Credit rating agencies essentially sold their high marks to       large banks that were securitizing loans, a major factor       leading to the financial crash of 2008. In response to the       inflated credit ratings for otherwise toxic securitizations,       Congress mandated creation of the OCR and directed it to       conduct annual examinations of each NRSRO and make its       reports public. It must examine eight areas: (i) whether the       NRSRO conducts business in accordance with its policies,       procedures, and rating methodologies; (ii) the management of       conflicts of interest by the NRSRO; (iii) the implementation       of ethics policies by the NRSRO; (iv) the internal       supervisory controls of the NRSRO; (v) the governance of the       NRSRO; (vi) the activities of the Designated Compliance       Officer (DCO) of the NRSRO; (vii) the processing of       complaints by the NRSRO; and (viii) the policies of the NRSRO       governing the post-employment activities of its former       personnel. This bill would allow the SEC to reduce these       categories of inspection to save staff resources. The answer       is not to reduce inspections, but to increase the funding for       the SEC.        These bills fail to advance investor interests or the       safety of the market. Instead, they move in the opposite       direction, ignoring the financial trauma from which Main       Street is still recovering.            Sincerely,      Public Citizen.                                   ____                                   Americans for Financial Reform,                                   Washington, DC, November 8, 2017.        Dear Representative: On behalf of Americans for Financial       Reform (AFR), we are writing to urge you to vote against H.R.       2201, which is being considered on the House floor today.       This legislation would remove crucial investor protections       and open the door to affinity fraud in private securities       offerings.        The registration requirement under the Securities Act of       1933 has two basic objectives: to allow investors access to       information they need to evaluate the securities being       offered and ``to prohibit deceit, misrepresentations, and       other frauds in the sale of securities.''        H.R. 2201 would create needless exemptions from those key       protections for so-called ``micro-cap offerings''--i.e.,       offerings valued at $500,000 or less in a single year. This       legislation would allow micro offerings to be sold to       financially unsophisticated and lower income investors,       provided only that the investors have a ``pre-existing       relationship'' with an officer, director, or major       shareholder of the issuer. These conditions alone do not       represent any protection for investors, nor do they guarantee       access to minimum essential information to evaluate a private       offering and make an informed decision about it.        H.R. 2201 would dismantle the protections afforded to       small-dollar-amount investors by the Securities Act of 1933.       Those protections include some minimal disclosures,       transparency standards, and access to the information       necessary to evaluate potentially risky and illiquid private       offerings. The legislation would also eliminate restrictions       on rapid sale of the securities, exposing investors in the       small offerings market to potential ``pump and dump''       schemes.        As the state securities administrators (NASAA) point out in       their opposition letter to this bill, H.R. 2201 also       obstructs primary regulators by preempting state regulatory       authorities. This legislation does not include any: limits on       purchaser sophistication (e.g. the securities could be sold       to non-accredited investors), measures to prevent offerings       by bad actors, restrictions on secondary sales, or       prohibition on general solicitation. This disturbing lack of       protections would permit bad faith actors to direct shady       private securities to investors.        Affinity frauds and Ponzi schemes are typically carried out       by individuals who are members of the group or community they       are trying to defraud--i.e., those with a ``pre-existing       relationship'' with others in their group. Similarly, the       SEC's red flags for Ponzi schemes include secretive       investments and ``investments that are not registered with       the SEC or with state regulators.'' By permitting the sale of       unregistered securities not subject to state regulation       within groups of investors with a ``pre-existing       relationship'', H.R. 2201 would facilitate affinity fraud and       Ponzi schemes.        Congress should not support statutory exemptions that       loosen restraints on fraudsters. We urge you to reject this       bill.            Sincerely,                                    Americans for Financial Reform.     Mr. Speaker, I don't understand why  Members of Congress would disregard what the State regulators are  saying. State regulators are saying: Don't do this. Don't preempt us.  Don't pass legislation that would undermine our ability to protect your  constituents.   Yet they are ignoring this altogether. I know that they received this  information. I know that they know that the association had cautioned  against this legislation. Let me just make sure that everybody knows.  It is the North American Securities Administrators Association. They  represent all of the States in cautioning against this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   For my colleagues on the opposite side of the aisle who are bemoaning  the fact that small businesses don't have access to capital, they have  these relationships with all of these big banks.   Why don't they get to the big banks and tell them they ought to be  making loans to small businesses?                                time  1015    I don't hear them, as a part of, you know, their rhetoric, talking  about how many of the big banks are not being responsible. And so my  colleague on the opposite side of the aisle and my friend talk about  what is common sense. I tell you what is common sense. Common sense is  not to place vulnerable people in a position where they are going to  get ripped off.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2201 is a harmful bill that would simply serve as  an invitation for investment scams. The bill fails to take into account  the numerous other exemptions we have for small-dollar offerings,  including under regulation D, regulation A, and crowdfunding rules.  These exemptions already permit small businesses to raise capital while  also protecting against fraud.   In light of these exemptions, there seems to be no reasonable  explanation for the amount of legislative effort that has been wasted  on this bill. Instead of H.R. 2201, which is unwarranted and may  actually harm investors and the integrity of our markets, the House  should be focused on passing legislation that can actually improve the  lives of the Americans whom we serve.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 2201. Don't  be a part of enacting one more scheme that is going to rip off our  constituents, and then, you know, a few years later, come back here and  talk about what a terrible thing it is that people are being ripped off  by these investors, some of them who are criminals, but nobody knows  it. The disclosure does not have to take place. They don't know that  they have people who have already been involved in crimes who are  coming to them talking about: let me help you earn some profits on this  investment.  [[Page H8677]]    We know better. Common sense tells us better. If, in fact, we are  committed to the proposition that we have a responsibility to protect  our constituents from rip-offs, from fraud, from being taken advantage  of, we will not support this bill. And I would hope that my friends on  the opposite side of the aisle, despite how far they have gone in  trying to represent that this bill is something that it is not, would  at least change their minds today and support their constituents and  vote ``no'' on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in  opposition to the amendment, even though I am not opposed.    Mr. Speaker, under the current  language of H.R. 2201, investors could be sold private securities by  persons who have committed fraud or have violated security laws.  Representative Emmer's amendment purports to add a layer of investor  protections by adding a provision to so-called disqualify certain bad  actors from utilizing the exemption.   While I applaud Mr. Emmer's attempt to add this most basic guardrail  to a bill that otherwise creates an unmitigated safe harbor for  fraudsters, I wonder why this provision was dropped from a similar bill  that Mr. Emmer introduced last Congress.   Unfortunately, this amendment is woefully inadequate to address the  otherwise dangerous new exemption created by H.R. 2201. Because the  underlying bill requires no disclosure to investors and imposes no  obligation to notify regulators of the offering, even if amended, H.R.  2201 would lead convicted fraudsters and lawbreakers to police  themselves.   Moreover, the bill ties the hands of State securities regulators, who  are the primary watchdogs over small, local securities offerings. If  enacted, H.R. 2201 would leave a gaping hole in oversight of the very  offerings it permits.   H.R. 2201 is a misguided attempt to support small businesses that is  not meaningfully improved by the meager protections of this amendment.  For these reasons, I continue to oppose this bill, and I urge all of my  colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 2201.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to warn  the Members of this House not to take the compliments seriously that  are being given by the gentleman who would have you believe that  somehow I have totally embraced this amendment because I think it is  going to change the fact that there is no disclosure to those who would  be investing and no notice to the SEC.   So don't take him seriously when he talks about thanking me for  encouraging and embracing. I have not done that. I am going to tolerate  this amendment. It is late. It doesn't do what he says it is going to  do. The bill is still a bad bill. It is a bill that is going to harm  people. It is a bill that targets the most vulnerable people in our  society. It is a bill where fraudsters are going to go into churches  and convince ministers and parishioners that they are out to help them.   Members of Congress, do the right thing. Today, stand up against  another attempt by misguided folks who would have you believe that they  are helping people when, in fact, they are opening up opportunities for  them to be ripped off one more time, ripped off in ways that could have  been avoided.   Mr. Speaker, I oppose this bill. I ask everybody to vote against this  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the  yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
