 Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H. Res. 326, the  Lowenthal resolution, to support a two-state solution to the Israeli- Palestinian conflict.   I thank my good friend, Alan Lowenthal, for the hard work he has done  to support the State of Israel and to bring this resolution to the  floor today.   This resolution strongly reaffirms longstanding, bipartisan U.S.  policy regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This includes  support for a two-state solution and expresses opposition to efforts  that undermine the prospects for a lasting peace.   I, like so many in this Congress, have been a longtime and passionate  supporter of Israel and the U.S.-Israeli relationship. We know that a  strong Israel is good for America.   But I have been increasingly concerned that this administration's  decision to unilaterally change American policies towards Israel  outside of any negotiation are detrimental to the long-term prospects  for peace. This resolution makes clear that the best and only real  solution to achieving peace is the two-state solution.   And, again, I thank Mr. Lowenthal and Chairman Engel for bringing  this resolution to the floor, and I urge my colleagues to support it.
