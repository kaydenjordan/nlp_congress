 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, tonight, Members of Congress who are Eagle  Scouts are taking to the floor of the House of Representatives to say  thank you not only to the Boy Scouts of America but to recognize and to  highlight our opportunity while in Boy Scouts, and now, as Members of  Congress, to talk about how important the Boy Scouts of America is to  the youth, the young men and young women of this country, and, also, to  highlight the leadership that takes place every single day in this  country: men and women who volunteer their time to make sure that the  Boy Scouts of America are prepared and ready to meet not only the times  that we live in but the advances of young people and the challenges  that they have.   Tonight, as an Eagle Scout of the Eagle class of 1970, it is my  opportunity to introduce Members of Congress and then to follow up at  the end as we talk about how important Scouting is.   Today, there are 1,262,311 boys in Scouting from ages 6 to 10 in Cub  Scouts. There are 822,999 boys aged 11 to 17 in Boy Scouts of America  and Varsity Scouts. There are 119,268 young men and young women between  the ages of 10 to 20 who are engaged in exploring based upon programs  that may be STEM or other Scouting programs.   As you see, Mr. Speaker, the Boy Scouts of America is important to  the youth of this country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Collins),  who is the head of our Scouting Caucus, and the Eagle class of 1963.   Mr. COLLINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank Eagle Scout Pete  Sessions for yielding. I am very honored to be standing with him today  as the co-chair of the Scouting Caucus, along with Eagle Scout Jim  Cooper from Tennessee.   There are, in fact, 33 Eagle Scouts--23 from the House of  Representatives and 10 from the Senate--currently serving in the United  States Congress. But just as importantly, there are 150 Members of  Congress who experienced Scouting, whether as a youth, and, perhaps, in  the case of 33 progressing to the rank of Eagle Scout, or, currently as  myself does, serving as an adult Scout leader.   Scouting was important to many of us growing up. I think when a lot  of us look back on our lives and say what was one of the larger impacts  we had, I can tell you, in my case, it was Scouting.   And the same is true for my 24-year-old Eagle Scout son. I can't tell  you how many different camping trips my son and I enjoyed together-- what a great bonding experience for a father and a son coming right up  through Cub Scouts.   So for all of those Scouts today, as Eagle Scout Pete Sessions  indicated, who are currently involved in Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts and  Explorers, Scouting is changing their lives, and it is changing their  lives for the better.   We have all heard the 12 points of the Scout law. That is a compass  for the youth of America today, when they are faced with tough  decisions, to look at those 12 points and remind themselves that a  Scout is trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind,  obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent. Those 12  points of the Scout law are a compass for them to live their life and  make the right decisions.                                time  1800    Many cases I referred to the first three words of the Scout Oath, and  we can't talk about them enough, those first three words, ``on my  honor.'' That is so important today for our youth to have a compass, to  understand what honor is, and Scouting introduces them to that.   But I will also tell you what Scouting is. It is young men, young  boys having fun outdoors. Some say today the problem with youth in  America is they have and they suffer from nature deficit disorder: They  don't get outside enough; they don't know how to play outdoors; they  are stuck with their electronic devices.   Well, Scouting gets the youth of America outside. It is healthy. They  get to enjoy themselves, learn all kinds of skills, but just the  friendships that they get within Scouting that, over a lifetime, will  help them as they become the future leaders of America.   There are a disproportionate number of leaders in America today who  were Scouts and, in fact, Eagle Scouts. Today, in President Trump's  Cabinet, we are honored as a country to have four Eagle Scouts: Eagle  Scout Rex Tillerson, Secretary of State; Eagle Scout Rick Perry,  Secretary of Energy; Eagle Scout Jeff Sessions, our current Attorney  General; and Eagle Scout, Ryan Zinke, our Secretary of the Interior.   I will tell you, in most of their cases, they would identify Scouting  as a major part of them growing up and, maybe they didn't know it at  the time, but giving them the life skills that have served them to the  point today they are serving our Nation.   We have 27 Members in the bipartisan Scouting Caucus; many, but not  all, are Eagle Scouts. I think all of us are proud to talk about our  past as an Eagle Scout, but we also remind people, to this day, we are  Eagle Scouts.   Once a year, our Chief Scout Executive, Mike Surbaugh, comes to  Washington, D.C., to present a report on the status of Scouting in the  Nation today. We have a great reception for our Chief Scout Executive  once a year to welcome him and Scouts from around the country as they  present to us the status of Scouting in America today.   I would be remiss if I didn't recognize the last four presidents of  the Boy Scouts of America. Our current president, Randall Stephenson,  is the current CEO of AT&T. He followed Bob Gates, who was our  Secretary of Defense; Wayne Perry, the vice chairman of AT&T and our  own Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, when he was CEO of Exxon, was  the president of the Boy Scouts of America.   So I think all of us today understand the importance of Scouting in  our lives and, in many cases, just reflect back on the fun that we had  as young kids and young adults.   Once every 4 years, all the Scouts in America gather, with some from  around the world as well, at our national Scout jamboree. We currently  have a permanent Scout High Adventure site in West Virginia at the  Summit.   Eagle Scout Pete Sessions and I, as well as others, 4 years ago, went  to the Summit. And you know what? We just had fun. We went down the zip  line. We went on some of the other obstacle courses. Even as adults, it  was reliving our youth. And we intend to go back later in July for,  every 4 years, as I said, they have the national Scout jamboree.  Somewhere in the neighborhood of 40,000 Scouts from around the United  States will gather for approximately 1 week and just have a lot of fun,  get to meet others from around the country.   So that is what Scouting is. I can't think of a more healthy activity  for young men to be involved in, and, I think, in many cases,  certainly, the moms of this world understand the important values that  their sons are getting, as well as the dads.   I can just tell you, I am happy to stay involved in Scouting. As the  co-chair of the Eagle Scout Caucus, I am proud to remind people I am  today an Eagle Scout. And we also have fun shaking hands with our left  hand. That's how Scouts do it, the hand closest to our heart.   I was with our Secretary of State in Alaska a week ago and went to  introduce myself. He put out his right hand to shake hands, as adults  do, and I said: ``No, sir, Mr. Secretary. As one Eagle Scout to  another, we are going to shake hands the right way, with our left  hands.'' He got a big smile on his face because he knew exactly what I  was talking about.   So Eagle Scout Pete Sessions, I want to thank you for giving me the  [[Page H4491]]  opportunity to talk a little bit about Scouting today in our Congress.  Thank you for your leadership in our Special Order tonight, and I look  forward to hearing from our other Members of Congress, fellow Eagle  Scouts. I know it impacted their life.   Thank you again for your leadership tonight.    Eagle Scout Chris Collins, thank you very much.   By the way, one of those presidents of the Boy Scouts of America was  Ed Whitacre. When I was at AT&T, Mr. Whitacre led the Boy Scouts of  America, understanding how important it is.   Ladies and gentlemen, the gentleman from Texas, the chairman of the  House Financial Services Committee, the gentleman from Dallas, Texas,  is also an Eagle Scout. Jeb Hensarling not only is a bright, young,  thoughtful, articulate leader in the United States Congress, he is  Eagle Class of 1971.   Chairman Hensarling, as an Eagle Scout, not only distinguished  himself to Scouting, but also, that led him to Texas A&M University and  then, further, to the University of Texas Law School. He is a young man  who not only deeply believes in his country and his God, but he  believes in the things that have brought him forward to become a leader  in Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas, Eagle Scout Jeb  Hensarling.    Chairman Hensarling, Eagle Scout, class of 1971, thank  you very much.   Mr. Speaker, I hold a Scoutbook, something I call the second good  book. Of course, we know in Scouting, the  [[Page H4492]]  good book is the Bible; but to Scouters, also the second good book is  the Boy Scout Handbook. This was given to me in 2010 by Bob Mazzuca,  who is our chief Scout executive, and he gave it to me with really a  guide to my life to continue down that pathway of talking about  Scouting in great ways. And that is what we are doing tonight.   I acknowledge that we not only have John Garamendi, who is an Eagle  Scout, class of 1960, who will be speaking in a bit, but on a  bipartisan basis, this body has young people, young men who understood  why they got into Scouting. They understood about their life. They  certainly understand it now.   At this time I would like to bring forth Eagle Scout French Hill,  1972, from Arkansas, a relatively new Member of Congress, not only a  mature man, but a man who comes with the proxy of knowledge of what Boy  Scouting has helped provide him.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill), an  Eagle Scout.    Mr. Speaker, Eagle Scout Congressman French Hill, Eagle  class of `72, thank you very much.   It is with great distinction now that I recognize Congressman Eagle  Scout Jim Bridenstine, 1991. It was about a week ago that Eagle Scout  Bridenstine came up to me and said: Pete, I want you to know that my  son is involved in Scouting, and I deeply believe in it, but I think we  ought to get together here.   So it actually is Eagle Scout Jim Bridenstine who said: Let's get  together our Eagle Scouts and talk about it.   And I hope that the gentleman will have a chance to come on July 24  or so, as Eagle Scout Members of Congress, along with Senator Mike  Enzi, and perhaps others--my Down syndrome son, Eagle Scout Alexander  Gregory Sessions, Troop 890, Lake Highlands, Texas, will join me--that  you, too, with your son, may be able to go with us to the reserve and  do that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr.  Bridenstine), a distinguished Eagle Scout.                                time  1830     Eagle Scout Jim Bridenstine, Member of Congress from  Oklahoma, Eagle Class 1991, thank you very much.   The Scouting stories of leadership, of character, and of opportunity  began in my life with my father, who was an Eagle Scout. His father,  Dr. Will A. Sessions, in 1947 wrote the original God and Country Award  Handbook. I wanted to be an Eagle Scout because of my dad. I have two  young sons: William Steele Sessions II, who is an Eagle Scout, age 27;  and Alexander Gregory Sessions, a Down syndrome young man, an Eagle  Scout, who is 23. Scouting is in our blood, we believe it, but it is  also in family blood. Jim Bridenstine spoke about it, and Chris Collins  spoke about the Eagle Class of `63.   This other next young man who is here will talk about Scouting and  what a difference it makes. I wish we had hours, Mr. Speaker, but the  rules allow 1 hour. He is a young man from Pennsylvania, Eagle Scout  Glenn ``GT'' Thompson. I had an opportunity to go to Pennsylvania with  the Chief Scout Executive and give GT Thompson his National and  Distinguished Eagle Scout Award and pin him.   Glenn's wife is a Scouting widow. She is proud of her Eagle Scout  sons, but she knows that the weekends are made for Scouting.   GT Thompson is a man who will be with me again at the Summit Bechtel  Reserve this year for the Scouting Jamboree.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Thompson).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Eagle Scout Glenn Thompson, Eagle  Scout 1977. On behalf of Chief Scout Executive Mike Surbaugh and  Members of Congress who gathered together this evening to tell another  story, I intend to do it again next month. I intend to get John  Garamendi, who is one of our dear friends from California, Eagle Class  of 1960.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Eagle Scouts of Congress who had time  to come tonight, myself, Chris Collins, Jeb Hensarling, French Hill,  Jim Bridenstine, GT Thompson, I am thankful for the hour you have  allowed us to tell the story about the Boy Scouts of America, about  exceptionalism, about the Order of the Arrow, and about the opportunity  for character to lead a great nation.   Mr. Speaker, we are thankful for the time. We will be back. We hope  that we leave our campsite better than the way we found it. That is  what we try to do every day.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
