 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Thank you, Mr. President.   I rise to speak on the nomination of Representative Mulvaney to be  Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the matter currently  pending before us.   I will vote against the nomination because of Representative  Mulvaney's opposition to bipartisan budget accords, targeting of  Federal employees, and his willingness to use the full faith and credit  of the United States as negotiating leverage.   Background. This is a really important position and I am on the  Budget Committee that oversees OMB and its opportunities. The OMB  Director is a primary adviser to the President on budgetary matters.  The OMB Director is in charge of preparing the annual budget submission  to Congress, and the management function of the OMB is a very important  one in terms of management of the Federal workforce and the work of the  executives.   We have seen OMB Directors in the past deeply involved in fiscal  negotiations of national importance, most notably in the time I have  been here on deals to address the across-the-board sequester cuts and  even the shutdown of government in October of 2013. So it is very  important that in this position the Director have a proven record of  public service. One side or the other is fine, but there has to be a  recognition of the value of bipartisan compromise, putting the country  first, putting pragmatism ahead of ideology, and a commitment that is  rock solid to maintaining the fiscal credibility and integrity of the  country. I worry about Representative Mulvaney in each of these areas.    With respect to bipartisan compromise on budget matters, I was a  budget conferee in 2013 after the government shutdown. The Senate and  House each had a budget. There was a refusal to sit down to do a budget  conference. That led to the absence of a budget and the shutdown of the  government for 16 days--the greatest government on Earth.   As we came out of that, there was a recognition and an agreement that  we would sit down and try to hammer out a budget compromise. People  didn't give us a lot of odds that we would do it, but because of the  leadership of then-Budget chairs, now the current Speaker of the House,  Paul Ryan, and Patty Murray, the Budget chairs enabled us to reach a  compromise that was for the good of the country by the end of calendar  year 2013.   At that point, the nominee was a Member of Congress and played a very  active role in opposing the budget compromise. He voted against the  deal we needed to get following the shutdown of the government, and his  quote was:         It seems, yet again, that Washington cannot wean itself       from its spending addiction. Indeed, what we saw today is       another example of how we got $17 trillion in debt: we can       have lots of bipartisanship, as long as we spend more money.    The unwillingness to embrace a bipartisan compromise, even after the  Government of the United States shut down, troubles me significantly.   I worry about his pragmatism on these matters. He has supported using  government shutdown and the threat of government shutdown as a lever-- as a lever to defund Planned Parenthood, as a lever on other matters  that he thinks are important, and that is fine, but to use those as a  lever--to use the shutdown of the Federal Government--that government  that Abraham Lincoln said was a government by, of, and for the people  and it should not perish from the face of the Earth--I view that as we  shouldn't shut the Federal Government of the United States down--but he  has used debt ceiling and shutdown as a leverage to gain his way on  points of lesser importance than whether the government stays open.   He has continued to support the sequester, which I believe is bad  policy for the United States: ``We want to keep the sequester in place  and then take the cuts we can get.''   There is also a significant issue that matters to me in my State. I  asked him about it during the hearing that demonstrates an ideology  over pragmatism, which is, Does he accept the science behind climate  change? Why does that matter for an OMB Director?   Well, we are investing money in storm relief. We are investing money  in  [[Page S1173]]  emergency relief. We are investing money when we rewrite the flood  insurance program.   In Hampton Roads, Virginia, in the State where I live, 1.6 million  people--the biggest center of naval power in the country--deeply  affected by sea level rise. If you are a Budget Director, some of what  you do is make recommendations for how to spend money on things like  resilience to sea level rise, but if you do not believe that humans are  affecting climate change, then your budgets are not going to show that  you think that is a priority. In questions before the committee,  Representative Mulvaney challenged the notion that humans are affecting  climate change.   Finally, I worry about his effect on the Federal workforce. There are  more than 170,000 Federal employees in Virginia, a large part of my  constituency. They do a great job. There is going to be some  challenging employees in any entity, whether it is in the Senate or  whether it is in a private entity. On balance, our Federal employees  are people who deserve our thanks for the job they do.   The House took an action at the beginning of January--the Senate did  not take this action, but the House took an action that reinstated  something called the Holman rule. The Holman rule is a longstanding,  but for a long while unused, doctrine that allows the House, in an  appropriations bill, to target an individual employee and reduce their  salary to as low as $1 a year. They couldn't fire someone without  violating civil service rules, but the House voted to be able to target  individual employees and reduce their salaries to $1 a year. This,  together with a Federal hiring freeze and other actions, is causing a  great deal of angst among the Federal workforce. Congressman Mulvaney  supported the notion of bringing back the Holman rule so individual  employees could be targeted. I asked him about that when we visited in  the office, and he did not have an answer that I found convincing or  credible.   Finally, the debt ceiling. We are going to confront within a few  months the debt ceiling of the United States--our willingness to honor  the obligations of the debt that has previously been incurred. The full  faith and credit of the United States shall not be questioned is  something that is very important. I think it is in the 14th amendment  to the Constitution. Certainly, that has been our example that we have  set around the world; that we have strong credit and no one can ever  question whether the United States will stand behind its debts.   Congressman Mulvaney has often taken the position that the United  States could default on debt and then prioritize which debts it would  pay. That happens in the commercial space sometimes. Sometimes it is an  intentional tool and sometimes it is an accidental tool and we have  bankruptcy laws to allow the prioritization of debt. The United States  does not repudiate its debts, and we should not flirt with something  like a debt ceiling and suggest that we are going to repudiate our  debts.   In closing, I am troubled by the nominee's opposition of bipartisan  budget efforts. I am troubled by an ideological position that says we  could potentially default on our debts or flirt with shutting down the  government to achieve my way on this or that issue. For those reasons,  I would oppose him.   His public service in Congress is something I respect, and I respect  the fact that he has been returned to the body multiple times by his  voters. That should be worthy of respect as well, but in terms of being  the chief budget official for the United States, I do not think he has  demonstrated the ability to do that and to keep America's fiscal policy  and reputation sound.   For those reasons, I will oppose him.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the 400 Years of  African American History Commission Act.   We are 2 years away from a key anniversary in American history.  August 2019 will mark 400 years since the first documented arrival of  Africans who came to English America by way of Point Comfort, VA. This  historic and tragic moment, when ``20 and odd'' Africans, as it was  recorded were the first recorded group of Africans to arrive  involuntarily and were sold as involuntary laborers or indentured  servants in the colonies. This indelible mark in American history  should not pass without recognition.   During my tenure as Governor of Virginia, I presided over the 400th  anniversary of the founding of Jamestown, VA, by the English colonists  in 1604. Two years ago I attended the 450th anniversary of the founding  of St. Augustine, FL, which celebrated Hispanic heritage. Both  commemorations included activities sponsored by Federal commissions,  which were voted on and passed by Congress.   Having commemorated the English and Spanish heritage of our founding,  there is no reason it should be any different for the arrival and  continuous presence of Africans and African Americans in the English  settlements in 1619. There is no dispute that the beginning of African  and African-American presence in what is now the United States was both  heartbreaking and regrettable. Although in 1619 slavery was not yet an  institution, the involuntary status of those first Africans was the  impetus to slavery. Slavery as an institution broke up families,  resulted in the deaths of thousands, and caused irreparable damage to  our American psyche. And though we should never forget that period of  stain on our history, slavery is not the only part of African-American  history. I have had an opportunity to visit the National Museum of  African American History and Culture. The museum makes a tremendous  effort to tell the complete story of African Americans and it is  important that we remember the whole story. African Americans have  contributed to the economic, academic, social, cultural and moral well- being of this Nation. Their impact and influence has shaped this nation  to what it is today.   So today, with my cosponsor Senator Mark Warner, I reintroduce the  400 Years of African American History Commission Act, which would  establish a commission that would plan programs and activities across  the country to recognize the arrival and influence of African Americans  since 1619. It is my hope the establishment of a ``400th'' commission  would create an opportunity to bring continued national education about  the significance the arrival of African Americans has made to the  United States and the contributions that have been made since 1619.  Additionally, the commission would create space to discuss race  relations in America and focus on dismantling the institutional systems  that have adversely hindered African American progress.                                  ______                                         By Mr. WYDEN:   S. 395. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to specify the  circumstances in which a person may acquire geolocation information and  for  [[Page S1220]]  other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.    Mr. President, the National Capital Region relies on DC  Metrorail. Hundreds of thousands of commuters take it every day,  including the Federal workforce. Visitors use it when they come to our  Nation's Capital on vacations, school trips, or events of national  significance. Yet for too long, critical safety maintenance has been  neglected, at the cost of countless lost hours and frustration for  riders, and tragically, several fatalities.   That is why I and my colleagues from Virginia and Maryland--Senators  Mark Warner, Ben Cardin, and Chris Van Hollen--and our bipartisan House  colleagues are today introducing this compact creating the new Metro  Safety Commission. This measure is introduced in concert with the  Virginia and Maryland General Assemblies and the Council of the  District of Columbia, to build momentum to encourage all three  jurisdictions to enact this compact as quickly as possible, to get  Metro back to safe reliable operation.   After fatal incidents on Metrorail in 2009 and 2015, the Federal  Transit Administration took the unprecedented step of assuming direct  safety oversight over the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit  Authority WMATA, stating that it would not return control until it  certified that a robust safety oversight body was in place. The safety  commission envisioned by this compact is that body.   There are many WMATA matters on which different stakeholders have  different opinions, but everyone agrees that safety must be our top  priority. Upon enactment of this compact by the three jurisdictions, I  urge my colleagues to take swift action to approve this measure so that  daily commuters and visitors to Washington, DC, can regain confidence  that Metro will take them safely to their destinations.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the 400 Years of  African American History Commission Act.
