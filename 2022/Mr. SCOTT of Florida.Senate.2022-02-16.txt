 Mr. President, reserving the right to object.   Throughout his administration, President Biden has shown a shocking  disregard for congressional authority and oversight.   Following his botched and deadly withdrawal from Afghanistan, the  Biden administration has refused to take accountability or provide  answers to Congress or the American people. The President repeatedly  shifts blame and hides from the truth. His administration demands to  have closed, so-called classified hearings, even though none of the  material being discussed is classified information.   We still don't even know how many Americans are trapped in  Afghanistan. We don't know how many Americans are trapped in  Afghanistan. Biden abandoned them behind enemy lines.   It is wrong. It left many Americans with no faith in President  Biden's ability to lead or appoint qualified individuals to serve in  these important roles.   That is why I cannot and will not consent to allowing this nominee to  move forward in an expedited manner. We should take a vote so every  Senator can get on the record with their support or opposition to this  nominee.   Therefore, I object.
