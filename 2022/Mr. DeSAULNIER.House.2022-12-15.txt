 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the service of  Amy Worth, a wonderful constituent and friend.   It has been my pleasure to have worked alongside Amy through her many  contributions to the bay area and her community. From library  commissioner to city council member to mayor to chair of the Bay Area  Metropolitan Transportation Commission, Amy has selflessly served the  city of Orinda and the bay area for the last 24 years and has served as  mayor of Orinda for 5 years.   As a member of the Contra Costa Transportation Authority, her  leadership was critical in a major transportation improvement, the  expansion of the Caldecott Tunnel in the east bay, which improved  traffic congestion throughout the bay area. She also helped pass  Measure J, a transportation sales tax.   Her passion and commitment to her family and community are  extraordinary. Amy has always been a dear friend and a tenacious force  for good in our community and in my life.   Please join me in congratulating Amy on her well-deserved retirement  and honoring her for her many years of dedicated public service to her  community.                            ____________________
