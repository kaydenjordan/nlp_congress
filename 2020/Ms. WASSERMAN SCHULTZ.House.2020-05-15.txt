 Mr. Speaker, I rise to support our best hope  to prevent long-term economic damage and preserve a strong recovery.   The Great Depression taught us long ago: do too little now and  millions of temporary job losses will not vanish for years.   With nearly 90,000 dead and 36 million out of work, any half-hearted  coronavirus response is a cowardly retreat.   The HEROES Act is a bold response. It lays out a safe, scientific  path to reopen America through vital testing, tracing, and treatment.  It supports State and local governments, provides hazard pay, and puts  more money in workers' and families' pockets.   I am proud this bill prevents veterans from being burdened with co- pays or cost-sharing for COVID-19 preventative treatment or services  and includes critical protections for VA healthcare professionals.  These heroes need help just like the ones we count on now: first  responders; healthcare and postal workers; teachers; sanitation,  transit, and food service workers.   We need bold action now to keep America standing. If we don't act, it  will cost a whole lot more to pick this Nation up off the ground later.   By the way, I find it rich that the previous gentleman actually had  the nerve and the audacity to quote Maya Angelou. She is rolling over  in her grave and certainly would support this bill.                                time  1615
