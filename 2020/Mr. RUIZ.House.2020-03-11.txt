 Mr. Speaker, this week, members of the Hemet and Palm  Springs Fire Departments gathered in Washington, D.C., for the  International Association of Firefighters' annual legislative  conference.   I met with several of them in my office and want to express my  personal appreciation for their unrelenting service that so often goes  above and beyond their call of duty.   Last December, tragedy struck in my district when three children and  their father died in an apartment complex fire in Hemet, California.   Despite the dangerous and grim circumstances, Hemet first responders  worked heroically and helped save lives.   Days later, the Hemet Fire Department, in a demonstration of  kindness, joined with community members to give financial support for  the victims' family and everyone affected by the fire.   They simply said they were closing the loop. From fire to getting  them back on their feet, they saw it as their responsibility to help  those who were afflicted.   This act of compassion shown by the first responders is just one  example of the selflessness in which they live their lives every day.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the firefighters from Hemet and Palm Springs,  and I thank first responders everywhere. Their heroism is as inspiring  as it is impactful.                            ____________________
