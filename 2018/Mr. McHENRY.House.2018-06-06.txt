 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to draw attention to the  ongoing plight of Pastor Andrew Brunson, a Christian missionary from my  district in western North Carolina who has been held as a prisoner of  the Turkish Government for the last 20 months.   Prior to being arrested by the Turkish Government in October of 2016,  Pastor Brunson had lived peacefully in Turkey for decades. He had  opened a church, raised his family, and made a life in the country.   That all changed in 2016, when the Turkish Government arrested Pastor  Brunson on a series of bogus charges. He has been detained ever since.   Last month, I sent a letter to the Turkish President, signed by a  bipartisan group of 154 lawmakers, calling on their government to  release Pastor Brunson. It is a long time in coming, but I hope and I  pray that Pastor Brunson will be released so that he can be reunited  with his family here in the United States.                            ____________________
