 Mr. Speaker, I stand to honor our policemen and -women  on National Police Week. Few things in this job are more illuminating  than doing a ride-along with local law enforcement, and I strongly  suggest to those people out there who think we have to change the laws  to harm the police, contact their local police or sheriff's department,  do a ride-along, and find out what their job is really like.   The week should be uncontroversial except for recently ambitious  politicians have decided to get reelected by tearing down the police.  Black Lives Matter, an organization founded by a Marxist, attacks the  police for racism. I ran across a local schoolteacher educating his  students that police are racists. The Democratic Party passed a bill  out of this House making it easier to sue a police officer.   This is one of the strange situations in which the crisis politicians  talking about is actually going in the opposite direction. I picked  some statistics I could find at random. In 1971, 50 years ago, New York  had 93 people killed by the police. Up until 1996, it was rarely under  20 people a year. Now it is rarely over 10 people a year who are killed  by the police. There are reports on a study of people who died in the  30 largest cities in the United States. There has been a 37 percent  reduction in police shootings leading to deaths.   Harvard economist Roland Fryer reports police are 47 percent less  likely to discharge a weapon when attacked by a Black man, and Heather  Mac Donald in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences  reports that if there is a bias in police shootings after crime rates  are taken into account, it is against White civilians.   The wholesale antipolice hysteria has dramatically increased  homicides in Milwaukee and other big cities as the police become more  passive. Wake up, America. Familiarize yourself with the statistics,  and stand up to the politicians who are riding antipolice hatred to  reelection.
