 Madam Speaker, Saturday kicked off Read  Across America Day and officially began National Reading Month.   The National Education Association celebrates readers, authors, and  stories annually during March. For the past 20 years, NEA's Read Across  America Day is a nationwide reading celebration that takes place  annually on March 2, which is Dr. Seuss' birthday.   Across the country, thousands of schools, libraries, and community  centers participate by bringing together kids, teens, and books to  celebrate reading with young people. The message is clear: Through the  magic and wonder of books, you can be anything and go anywhere. This  month helps make students excited and engaged in reading.   Children across the country have celebrated Read Across America Day,  and I hope they keep it going for 365 more days because, as the beloved  Dr. Seuss said: ``The more that you read, the more things that you will  know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go.''                            ____________________
