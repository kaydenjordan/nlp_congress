 Mr. Speaker, you would think after years of supply  chain disruptions and skyrocketing consumer prices, this administration  would make every effort to lower costs and streamline our  transportation networks.   The heavy-duty engine and vehicle standard does exactly the opposite.  This rule would force owner/operators to leave the market or keep older  trucks on the road.   This rule is unrealistic, given the heavy-duty vehicle technology  space, and this rule would add at least $8,000 to the cost of each new  semitruck. The cost doesn't go to producers, the people who grow the  grain or produce the oil or get the natural gas out of the ground. It  goes to the consumers.   Instead of expanding the equipment market and recognizing the  significant  [[Page H2529]]  reduction of nitrous oxide, this rule is another assault on liquid  fuels that will further complicate the supply chain.    North Dakota is a producer State, but we have to get our products to  market. We need heavy-duty vehicles to get our goods there. The rule  jeopardizes our ability to feed and fuel the country.   The CRA has bipartisan support and for good reason. The underlying  rule is unworkable, and I urge my colleagues to support the CRA.
