 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the Fiscal  Responsibility Act of 2023.   Last week, we passed that bill to raise America's debt ceiling and to  avoid an economic catastrophe. The failure to pay our bills would have  led to millions of lost jobs and possibly another Great Depression.   The bill protects the healthcare of millions of Americans, including  veterans. It invests in education and childcare for American families.  It protects student debt relief and supports our country's move to a  clean energy economy.   I praise President Biden for his work to raise the debt ceiling, and  I thank the Members of Congress from both parties who voted for this  bill.   We have a responsibility to protect Americans, and we succeeded in  doing so with this bill.                            ____________________
