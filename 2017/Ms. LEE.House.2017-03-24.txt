 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 1628, which  is a bill to take away health care from 24 million Americans.   Whether you believe it or not, health care is a basic right. This  shameful bill steals from those who can least afford it, including  seniors, veterans, people living with HIV, children, and the disabled.  It would, yes, rip away health care from 24 million people. It would  reduce benefits, make families pay more for less, and transfer $600  billion in tax cuts to the very wealthy. This is outrageous.   Access to women's health is denied by defunding Planned Parenthood.  Medicaid, as we know it, will end. Healthcare costs for working  families and seniors will skyrocket. And now it eliminates essential  health benefits like maternity, mental health, and emergency care.   This is not a health bill. It is a tax giveaway to the wealthy.   Let me tell you, as a woman of faith, I am appalled and I am saddened  by the hypocrisy displayed in this bill by people who say they are  religious. I want to remind you--in the Scriptures, the Book of Mark,  chapter 12:31, we are reminded to love your neighbor as yourself.   This bill shows disdain for the most vulnerable and would lead to  death and destruction and disease for millions of Americans.   I hope Republicans remember to love their neighbor as themselves  today and vote ``no'' on this mean-spirited bill. Let's defeat this  harmful and morally bankrupt bill. This is a matter of life and death,  and the American people deserve better.
