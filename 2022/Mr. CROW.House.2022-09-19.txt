 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 3157, a bill to  help eliminate barriers to employment facing immigrants and refugees  across the country.   I represent one of the most diverse districts in Colorado, and we  know in Colorado and in my community that diversity is our strength.   Many of our immigrant refugee neighbors have skills and professional  credentials they can't use because of regulatory hurdles. These  hurdles, whether language barriers, difficulty in recognizing  credentials, or a lack of professional networks, prevent many from  making a good living for their families or contributing fully to our  economy in reaching their full potential.   The unemployment and underemployment of these folks is a missed  opportunity for our businesses, for our community, and for our country.   In 2016, across the U.S., nearly 2 million immigrants with college  degrees were unable to find work or were employed in low-wage jobs.  This includes more than one-third of the 11,000 immigrants in the State  of Colorado with health-related undergraduate degrees in 2020.   Identifying these barriers to full employment for these immigrants  and refugees is an essential first step to overcoming them. This bill  would direct the Department of Labor to conduct a collaborative  interagency study of the barriers that hold back refugees and  immigrants from their full potential.   I thank Senator Klobuchar and Congressman Katko for their diligence  in this effort, and I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting  passage of this bill today.
