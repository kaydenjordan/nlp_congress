 Mr. Speaker, last night, the Rules Committee came out  with a procedural resolution for the farm bill that violates both the  Constitution and the War Powers Act of 1973. Just when you thought  Congress couldn't get any swampier, we continue to exceed even the  lowest expectations.   Section 2 of House Resolution 1176, the rule for the farm bill, says  that the provisions of section 7 of the War Powers Resolution shall not  apply during the remainder of the 115th Congress to any concurrent  resolution introduced pursuant to the War Powers Resolution.   What this means is that our leadership has decided that the House  just doesn't need to vote on whether U.S. soldiers, personnel, weapons,  and taxpayer dollars should go toward assisting Saudi Arabia with its  brutal war on civilians in Yemen, a war that has caused the world's  worst famine in over 100 years.   This isn't the first time that our leadership, using the Rules  Committee, has swept under the rug the War Powers Act. They did it last  month. What they did is they hid the vote inside of another resolution,  a procedural resolution for a bill called Manage our Wolves Act. So,  many Members of Congress swept under the rug the War Powers Act without  even knowing it, because it was in a procedural resolution.   But think about what they are doing this time. Instead of specifying  a certain resolution that they are going to suspend the War Powers Act  for, they are saying any resolution for all of Congress.   In my opinion, this violates both the U.S. Constitution and statutory  law. But, apparently, this doesn't matter to our leadership and the  majority of the Rules Committee.   Just as a remainder, Article I, Section 8 of the United States  Constitution says that Congress and Congress alone, not the executive  branch, possesses the power to declare war. Although the Constitution's  language unequivocally gives this power solely to Congress, Presidents,  nevertheless, continued to launch military action abroad prior to  receiving Congressional approval. This is why Congress passed the War  Powers Act of 1973.   Section 5(c) of the War Powers Act requires the President to remove  United States forces at any time, if Congress so directs by concurrent  resolution, and Section 7 establishes priority procedures for  consideration of such a removal resolution. It requires the Committee  on Foreign Affairs to report out that resolution within 15 days. You  can't let this thing die in committee. It has to come back to the floor  within 15 days, according to the law since 1973.   Then it directs that the House must vote on the resolution within 3  calendar days. It can't die on the floor. There has to be a vote within  3 days.   But, instead of following the law, instead of following the  Constitution, the Rules Committee last night snuck language into the  rule for the farm bill, and this should upset farmers who are depending  on the farm bill. They snuck into the rule for the farm bill a  resolution that deprives the entire House of Representatives of its  constitutional right to decide when and where our soldiers should be  sent into harm's way.   So let me sum this up. Even if you think we should be involved in  Yemen, even if you think soldiers should go there, even if you think we  should give the bombs to Saudi Arabia to drop on civilians, you  shouldn't want to sneak that into an unrelated bill. You shouldn't want  to hide that in a farm bill. What good could you be up to by hiding  that in another bill?   But let's say you are okay with hiding it in another bill because you  don't want your constituents to find out where you stand on this issue:  I had to vote for the farm bill. Sorry.   Well, even if you are okay with hiding it in another bill, this is  the wrong way to do it. Last time, when they snuck it--when they swept  it under the rug last month, they specified that the resolution  wouldn't have the powers of the War Powers Act, wouldn't have the  privileges of the War Powers Act.   This time, not only are they sweeping it under the rug, they are  preemptively sweeping all of the power of Congress under the War Powers  Act under the rug for the entire remainder of this congressional  session. It sets a horrible precedent. It is a dangerous precedent.   The Speaker is grabbing more powers using the Speaker's committee,  the Rules Committee. He is doing so and jeopardizing the power of the  House of Representatives, because for him to grab more power requires  us to give more power to the executive branch, to abdicate our  constitutional responsibility to decide when and where our military  should go.   So I urge my colleagues to oppose this illegal and unconstitutional  action today by voting ``no'' on the rule for the farm bill. That is  House Resolution 1176                            ____________________
