 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, now on Readler, later this afternoon, the  Senate will vote on the confirmation of Chad Readler to the Sixth  Circuit. As this Chamber by now is no doubt aware, Mr. Readler was the  chief cook and bottle washer of the Trump administration's decision not  to defend the healthcare law in court. In a brief submitted to the  court on behalf of the Department of Justice, Mr. Readler said that  protections for the 130 million Americans with preexisting conditions  are unconstitutional.   I say to my Republican friends: Do you want to vote for a judge who  says that protecting preexisting conditions, which affect 130 million  Americans, is unconstitutional?   Well, that is what you are going to do if you vote for Readler.   Even my Republican colleague Senator Alexander, who oversees the  committee that created these protections, calls his arguments ``as  farfetched as I have ever heard.''   Can you imagine the lack of compassion it takes to argue that 130  million Americans with cancers, respiratory ailments, and all the way  down to asthma don't deserve the guarantee of affordable healthcare?  Can you imagine voting for a man who is so cold-hearted that he doesn't  protect a mother who has a daughter or a son with cancer and the  insurance company cuts them off, and they have to watch their child  suffer?   Can our Republican colleagues actually vote for a nominee who feels  that way not just in his words but in his action? This vote is going to  be remembered for a long time--a long, long time.   Can you imagine sitting at your desk on an average workday and  arguing for a policy with such catastrophic consequences for a third of  our country? I, for one, cannot. That is what Readler did.   The very next day, after he wrote that brief, he was nominated for  this lifetime appointment on the bench. Go figure. Only in the Trump  administration could a person be rewarded for efforts to take  healthcare away from average Americans. That is exactly what happened.   Yesterday, regrettably, the Senate proceeded to Readler's nomination  over the objections of one of his home State Senators, Senator Sherrod  Brown. Republican leaders are so eager to confirm judges that they are  willing to break the blue-slip tradition even when the nominee is the  literal encapsulation of their party's most heartless policy, I might  add--a policy that helped them lose the House and could help them lose  future elections, if they only care about that.   Republican Senators still have a chance to reject the cynicism behind  Mr. Readler's nomination. They have a chance to stand up for  healthcare. I would ask my colleagues, is the confirmation of one  circuit judge really worth endorsing the position that our healthcare  law should be repealed and Americans with preexisting conditions should  not be protected? The answer to that question ought to be obvious.   I urge my Republican colleagues to vote no on Mr. Readler's  nomination this afternoon.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?    Will my colleague from Texas yield for a question  instead of just filibustering what he says?    I simply want to ask the Senator--   --if he believes climate change is real--   --or caused by humans.    We know what he is not for. What is he for?    Will the Senator yield for a question and say what he is  for?    Will he yield for a question stating what he is for, not  what he's against but what he is for?    Will the Senator yield?    Mr. President, my colleague said he would yield to a  question after he finished debating. I would like to ask him a  question.    Mr. President, I would like to ask my colleague a  question. I appreciate that.   Just three: No. 1, does he believe that climate change is real? Does  he believe it is caused by humans? And does he believe this body ought  to do something about it?   I would appreciate an answer.    Will the Senator--Mr. President, will he yield? He  didn't really answer my question.   What will he do about climate change? I ask my colleague to please  answer not what he is against but what he is for. We have not heard  from the other side of the aisle anything they are for about climate  change or whether they believe it is real and caused by humans.   I would ask my colleague, once again, not what he is against. We know  what he is against. What is he for?    Will the Senator yield?    Mr. President, we thank our friends on the other side of  the aisle for helping to make our case.    Yes, I am asking a question.   If the Senator from Massachusetts has the floor, I ask a question of  the Senator from Massachusetts.    Mr. President, we have been making the case for the last  several weeks that our Republican colleagues love to get up and rant  about what they are against even though they exaggerate and tell  mistruths about the bill Senator Markey has sponsored. Yet we have been  asking repeatedly, haven't we, three questions: Do you believe climate  change is real? Do you believe it is caused by human activity? Most  importantly, what would you do about it?   Here we have had an hour of debate, haven't we, with our Republican  colleagues, and there have been a lot of mistruths and a lot of ``here  is what we are against'' but not one single thing they are for.   So isn't it true, my friend from Massachusetts, that they have helped  to make our case? We are glad they are finally talking about climate  change, but we have to do something about it. Isn't it true we haven't  heard a single positive response about what they would do?    Mr. President, I pose a second question.   Isn't it true that our Republican colleagues have been in the  majority for 5 years and that during that time, more and more Americans  believe global warming is a serious problem? I think it is above two- thirds. It is at 70 percent. It is a significant percentage of  Republicans and a majority of Democrats and Independents. Isn't it true  that in those 5 years, the Republican leader, our friend, hasn't  brought a single piece of legislation to the floor that would deal with  climate change in any way? Is that correct?    Finally, we have not heard a single answer from any of  the Senators on the floor or any who spoke about what their plan is.   So I would ask you to repeat and ask them three questions that they  still haven't answered--simple questions with no predisposed answers.   A, do any of our Republican colleagues--this is a question--believe  climate change is real?    Second, do any of our Republican colleagues over there  believe it is caused by human activity?    And C, do they have any plan, proposal, suggestion as to  how we deal with the issue?    And I would ask my colleague to ask our Republican  friends--if they have an answer to any of those questions, to yield the  floor to them.    Can you ask them to not repeat the same talking points  about what they are against and finally say something about what they  are for?    Mr. President, maybe Leader McConnell doesn't realize  this, but because of the political stunt vote he is planning on his  version of the Green New Deal, for the first time in a long time, the  Senate is finally debating the issue of climate change, and if you ask  me, it is about time.   Climate change is an urgent crisis and an existential threat to our  country and to our planet. The last 4 years have been the warmest 4  years on record. Sea levels are rising. Marine life and fishing  communities are being destroyed. Wildfires have roared against the  West. More powerful hurricanes have buffeted our coastlines.   Over the next few decades, climate change will affect every part of  American life--our health, our economy, our national security, and even  our geography. So if there were ever an issue that demanded particular  focus from this Chamber, it is climate change. That is why today I am  introducing a resolution to create a select committee on climate change  to correspond with the House committee that was created this year for  the same purpose.   For the same reason that we dedicate groups of Senators to focus on  health, national security, judiciary, agriculture, and banking, we  should have a bipartisan group of Senators who meet to focus on climate  change, to hold hearings, to debate the issue, and to craft, refine,  and enact legislation to address this problem.   I understand that my friends on the other side of the aisle don't  like the Green New Deal. OK, that is fine. What is your plan?   Maybe a lot of Members think they can get away without having to  answer the question. They will not. They will not. That is why we need  a committee focused on this to bring Democrats and Republicans together  on an issue that demands progress. So I will introduce a resolution to  create a new committee on climate.   Democrats believe this is an issue of surpassing importance. What do  our Republican colleagues believe? We sincerely hope that our  Republican friends will come around and view it the same way. Yet we  are still trying to get the Republican leadership, and Republicans in  the Senate in general, to answer three key questions. I ask once again.  I have asked them every day.   One, Leader McConnell, do you believe climate change is real?   Two, Leader McConnell, does human activity contribute to it?   And, three, should Congress take immediate action to address it?   Our Republican friends are silent--silent. Some have argued that it  is because they get so much money from the oil industry. Some have  argued that it is because they don't believe in science. It is amazing  that they can't even answer a simple question that is one of the  leading questions of our time when two-thirds of all Americans believe  that climate change is real and urgent.   We are not trying to lock our Republican friends into any one or two  solutions. We are not saying: Let's do it our way or the highway.   As a first step, we want Republicans, particularly their leader, to  agree with us that climate change is a problem that must be addressed.  And what do we get from our Republican friends? Either silence or a  stunt--putting on the floor a bill they will not vote for. That doesn't  say anything. That doesn't address the problem. It is a stunt. That is  all they can do. They can't come forward with a single positive thing  to say or do. So they put a bill on the floor that they will not vote  for--what a ruse. What a mocking of the way the Founding Fathers wanted  democracy to work--it is a disgrace.   That is why we need a committee. At least let them go forward with a  committee, where Democrats and Republicans can discuss the issue,  debate the issue, and perhaps come up with some bipartisan solutions.  That is what we hope to achieve when we come to the floor and ask our  friends, sincerely, if they agree with those three items, because  climate change will not wait for the partisanship, which so often  defines this Chamber, to ebb. It will not pause while one party is in  power. Its impacts will not discriminate between red States and blue  States.   It is time to put our party affiliations aside and agree that we face  a major crisis that is caused by humans and that we have an immediate  and glaring need to address it.
