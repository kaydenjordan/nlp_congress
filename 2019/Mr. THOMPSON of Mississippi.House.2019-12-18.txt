 Madam Speaker, the question that will be  answered today is: Will Members honor their oath to uphold the  Constitution?   Democrats are not supporting impeachment based on a policy  disagreement or the election results of 2016. No one is above the law.  The President must be held accountable.   A constitutional process is not a hoax or a witch hunt. President  Trump just opposes it. No one is above the law, not even President  Donald J. Trump.   The President abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to help his  reelection campaign. Impeachment is a constitutional remedy for these  actions.   Trump betrayed his oath, betrayed the Constitution, and undermined  the integrity of our elections. Those who are against the impeachment  inquiry are willing to turn a blind eye to constitutional violations by  the President.   As a nation, we have no other alternative. We must protect our  Constitution and the United States of America.   In his own words: ``No intelligent person believes what he is  saying.''
