 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Wisconsin for holding  the floor down here with--I am quite confident--riveting expositions on  any number of great things because my friend from Wisconsin is a great  American, and I do appreciate the gentleman.   It is important that we recognize the situation that this country  currently faces with respect to our border crisis.   It is so beyond understanding that the so-called greatest country in  the history of the world could allow an environment in which, as we  speak here on the floor, a little girl is getting sold into the sex  trafficking trade in Houston or San Antonio in a stash house; or as  happened last summer, 53 migrants died in a tractor trailer, cooked in  the Texas summer heat; or 40 migrants who burned up just this past  week. All, almost a direct consequence of the chosen policies of this  administration. That is the simple truth.   We have free will as the greatest country in the history of the  world, the strongest country in the history of the world. We have to  use that free will and make choices. Are we going to be a sovereign  Nation that secures its borders and ensures safe passage and avenues  for people around the world to come to this country, or are we going to  allow cartels to maintain operational control of our border?   Are we going to allow cartels to use human beings as profit centers,  no matter what it means for them and their well-being? Are we going  allow China to exploit our borders and run fentanyl into our  communities and kill Americans, or are we going to do our job and  secure the border of the United States?   Those are the questions before us as Members of the House of  Representatives. My message to my colleagues on  [[Page H1689]]  this side of the aisle is: When you campaign on securing the border and  you are given control of the House of Representatives, you have an  obligation to actually secure the border.   To my colleagues who run around using rhetoric about what is or is  not Christian-like. I will say it is inherently un-Christian to allow  migrants to die and call that compassion. It is inherently un-Christian  to allow Americans to die from fentanyl poisoning and say that it is  un-Christian to say that we should secure the border.   It is inherently un-Christian for us to turn our backs on the  responsibility of being a sovereign Nation that defends the rule of law  to be the beacon of hope for people around the world to come here in  the first place.   This country has done more for more people around the world than any  other Nation in history. Yes, our history is about opening our arms and  allowing millions from around the globe to seek freedom and opportunity  here, and we must continue to be. That must be built on the rule of  law.   If we do not maintain the rule of law, then we forsake the very thing  that attracts people from around the world. People come here from  Venezuela, they come here from Cuba because of the rule of law. The  rule of law is supposed to matter.   For people to hide behind asylum claims and hide behind exploitations  of our law, to flood our border, such that we no longer have control of  it, such that then the law becomes meaningless, turns the rule of law  on its head and means we will not be able to be the place of refuge for  the people around the world who need it.   More than that, we should be exporting the rule of law. We should be  improving conditions in the Western Hemisphere and around the world  rather than importing lawlessness and importing fentanyl and killing  our own people and undermining the lives of migrants.   On March 13 a human smuggler transporting 11 illegal aliens in Ozona,  Texas, was being chased by law enforcement, and during the chase the  smuggler crashed into another vehicle killing the other occupants,  including a 7-year old girl and her grandmother. The victims' names are  Maria Alvarez and her granddaughter Emilia Tambunga. Two migrants  perished from the crash. That is one example of hundreds I can give.                                time  1330    I run into the ranchers who find dead migrants on their south Texas  ranches. Madam Speaker, 1,000 migrants have died along the southwest  border last year.   The fact is we are seeing, as we speak, thousands rush our border  from El Paso down along the Texas border because of the failed policies  of this administration.   We have an obligation as a body, but while our Democrat colleagues  bury their heads in the sand and refuse to acknowledge the crisis at  the border, Republicans have an obligation to do exactly what they said  they would do and what they campaigned to do, and that is to secure the  border of the United States.   Let me be very clear. Securing the border of the United States does  not mean more money. It does not mean more technology. It does not mean  more Border Patrol agents. It does not mean throwing money at the  problem. It means actually doing the job of enforcing the laws of the  United States and embracing policies that will stop the abuse of our  law, as this administration is doing to undermine it, to allow people  to flood our zone, and to allow cartels to exploit it, which harms  Americans and migrants.   We absolutely can and will ensure that people who have a credible  claim to asylum will be able to have that claim heard while making sure  that it is not exploited by cartels to rush our border with thousands  of people and make it such that it is bad for them and us while  fentanyl pours in killing Americans and undermining our security. That  is actually our job.   I submit, Madam Speaker, that we should honor the promises that we  made that gave us the majority because I can promise you if we try to  pass border security that doesn't actually stop the problem, then we  will no longer be in the majority.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 1 o'clock and 32 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until Monday next,  April 3, 2023, at 2 p.m.                            ____________________
