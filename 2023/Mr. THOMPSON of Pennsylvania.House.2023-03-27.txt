 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Mr. George Duke, the chairman and sole owner of Zippo Manufacturing  Company.   Started by George's grandfather in 1932, Zippo has become an American  icon. From earning the nickname ``the GI's friend'' to becoming an  international pop culture symbol, this famous windproof lighter  transcends generations.   Since its invention, every Zippo windproof lighter has been proudly  manufactured in Bradford, Pennsylvania. George knows Zippo's success  would not be possible without the local community, and he continually  gives back to the place he calls home.   Zippo's most recent investment in Bradford's future is through a  generous gift to the University of Pittsburgh's Bradford Campus. Last  fall, the campus opened a new engineering and information technologies  building, and thanks to Zippo's investment, students are learning in  state-of-the-art engineering labs.   This investment provides a hands-on, cutting-edge experience for  students, ultimately helping them pursue successful engineering careers  in the region and beyond.   Mr. Speaker, this investment goes beyond the walls of Pitt-Bradford.  It is an investment in our community and in our future.   On behalf of a grateful community, I thank George Duke for his  tremendous dedication to building a thriving workforce in  Pennsylvania's northern tier.                            ____________________
