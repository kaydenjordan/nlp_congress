 Mr. Speaker, I recognize the Meninak Club of  Jacksonville, Florida, which is celebrating 100 years of service and  camaraderie within our northeast Florida community.   Meninak members are often leaders of business, military, and civic  organizations who join together to make a positive impact on others.  For a century, they have made a difference in the lives of many through  their annual charity project and numerous scholarships for students,  including $25,000 in Youth Leadership Grants each year.   Since 1933, Meninak has also sponsored the Ocean Marathon Swim, a  3.5-mile swim competition for members of the American Red Cross  Volunteer Life Saving Corps at Jacksonville Beach.   Their many charitable works include building affordable homes for  those in need, working with the Salvation Army during Christmastime,  and mentoring local disadvantaged folks in Jacksonville.   I congratulate the Meninak Club for 100 years of ``lending help where  none is available.''                            ____________________
