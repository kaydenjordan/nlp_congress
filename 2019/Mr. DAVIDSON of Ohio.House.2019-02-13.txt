 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for  allowing me time, as I do support H.J. Res. 37. Fundamentally, it is  about Article I and the authority of Congress as addressed in  Federalist Paper No. 69.   As the President said, great powers don't fight endless wars. I would  add nor do they fight or participate in undeclared wars.   The United States is not participating in the Yemen war in the sense  that many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have  characterized. In fact, I personally asked Secretary Mattis on two  occasions to help draft authorization against Iranian proxies.   This is, at best, a half measure in that it stops any active  participation in undeclared unauthorized combat. But it also fails to  advance the policy of our country, which is to treat Iran as the threat  it is, not just to the United States of America, but to its neighbors  and our allies in the region.
