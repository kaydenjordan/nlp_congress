 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on  Rules, I call up House Resolution 645 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 645         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 38) to amend       title 18, United States Code, to provide a means by which       nonresidents of a State whose residents may carry concealed       firearms may also do so in the State. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. In lieu of the       amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the       Committee on the Judiciary now printed in the bill, an       amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the       text of Rules Committee Print 115-45 shall be considered as       adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read.       All points of order against provisions in the bill, as       amended, are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any       further amendment thereto, to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary; and (2) one motion       to recommit with or without instructions.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for  1 hour.    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only,  I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Hastings), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only,  I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Hastings), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on House Resolution 645, currently under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Georgia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring forward  this rule on behalf of the Rules Committee. The rule provides for  consideration of H.R. 38, the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act.   The rule provides for 1 hour of debate, equally divided between the  chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. The rule also  provides for a motion to recommit.   Yesterday, the Rules Committee had the opportunity to hear from my  fellow Judiciary Committee members, Chairman Goodlatte, Ranking Member  Nadler, as well as Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee and others.  Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee happens to be the ranking member of  the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and  Investigations.   Last month, the Judiciary Committee rigorously debated H.R. 38 and  considered 22 amendments to this legislation. The committee also marked  up and discussed H.R. 4477, the Fix NICS Act, which is incorporated  into the Rules Committee print.   I thank my friend, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Hudson),  for introducing this legislation, which takes a commonsense approach  and reflects our constitutional right to bear arms.   Mr. Speaker, all of us in this body took an oath to uphold and defend  the Constitution, and, as we all understand, the Constitution enshrines  our right to keep and bear arms in the Second Amendment.   Over the years, this right has been challenged in the courts and, in  some cases, by public opinion. However, lest there be any question  about the constitutionality of our right to keep and  [[Page H9675]]  bear arms, let me remind my colleagues that the Supreme Court, the  highest court in the land, recognized, in a 2008 opinion, that ``the  Second Amendment conferred an individual right to keep and bear arms.''   As the son of a Georgia State trooper, I learned to respect firearms  at an early age, and I have shared that respect with my boys and  daughter. As a Member of Congress, I believe I have a duty to uphold  American liberties for current and future generations. I am a cosponsor  of the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act because I believe constitutional  rights extend past State lines.   Mr. Speaker, the Bill of Rights isn't a philosophical exercise; it is  a document that protects the practical expression of liberties that our  forefathers recognized as essential elements of our democracy. I,  myself, have a concealed carry permit; and, as a husband and father, I  have prioritized being able to defend my family and my home should the  unthinkable happen.   I am also a sportsman, a hunter, and an ardent defender of the Second  Amendment; but, like many others, the primary purpose of owning and  keeping a concealed carry permit is self-defense. I don't think that  right should be undermined simply because I travel to another State.  This bill upholds and recognizes State laws, while ensuring that  driving across State lines to run an errand, go to work, or visit a  relative doesn't blot out an individual's rights.   Mr. Speaker, I will tell you a very recent story about how firearms  can play a critical role in self-defense and promote public safety.  Just yesterday, in Dawson County, in a part of my district in northeast  Georgia, a woman witnessed an individual attacking a sheriff's deputy  at a local gas station. The woman was in possession of a firearm and  fired at the suspect. While details are still unfolding at this point,  it highlights the benefits of a citizenry that is reasonably and  responsibly armed.   Contrary to the claims of Second Amendment detractors, the Concealed  Carry Reciprocity Act is not about expanding access to firearms or  putting guns in the hands of criminals. On the contrary, the bill  includes protections to uphold laws surrounding firearm possession and  safeguards individuals' ability to protect themselves and their  neighbors.   The Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act supports the Second Amendment  rights of law-abiding Americans, and, importantly, it offers a solution  to the current patchwork of State laws affecting concealed carry  permits.   Currently, all 50 States issue concealed carry permits in some  capacity, but these laws leave citizens traveling across State lines to  decipher a variety of State laws or risk inadvertently breaking the  law.   It is also worth noting that, of the States that have adopted right- to-carry legislation, no State has repealed it. Moreover, Mr. Speaker,  we simply have no evidence to indicate that concealed carry permit  holders pose a risk to public safety.   The Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act upholds States' rights to  establish their own permitting requirements, but it takes the  commonsense step of allowing individuals who meet the criteria for  concealed carry in their home States to bear arms in other States as  long as they follow the local concealed carry laws of the State they  are in at any given time.   This bill doesn't allow individuals who currently would be  prohibited, under Federal law, from possessing firearms to obtain those  weapons, and it doesn't tell States how to regulate the use of  firearms. It does, however, ensure that law-abiding citizens can  protect themselves and exercise their Second Amendment rights when  crossing State lines.    Thirty States, including Georgia, already have ``shall issue''  permits, which require States to issue permits to individuals who meet  the legal requirements for a concealed carry permit; eight States have  ``may issue'' laws, which allow for discretionary permit laws; and 12  States allow for the carrying of a concealed weapon without any permit  or license at all.   Many States have some type of reciprocity whereby they mutually  recognize permits from other States or may honor permits or licenses  issued by other jurisdictions. However, there are some States that  neither recognize out-of-State concealed carry permits nor issue  permits to nonresidents, resulting in a complete ban on the concealed  carry rights of nonresidents who find themselves in those States.   The legal landscape of these State laws and their terms for  recognizing concealed carry permits is complex. Yet, Mr. Speaker, we  must recognize and remember that, at a practical level, our Union  functions by acknowledging the necessary reciprocity of certain State  functions, this being one of them and should be. But the current  patchwork of State laws means that these law-abiding individuals have  to stop and think about their rights, where they are located at the  time and whether they recognize their Second Amendment rights, or they  risk breaking the law.   Also, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 38 includes the text of the Fix NICS Act. The  Fix NICS Act ensures individuals who are prohibited from receiving  firearms are properly documented in the NICS system, and it would  require Federal agencies to report relevant records in accordance with  the law.   Mr. Speaker, the legislation before us upholds a constitutional right  to keep and bear arms and recognizes the fact that the Bill of Rights  isn't limited to certain jurisdictions. Our Founding Fathers carved  certain foundational rights into our democracy, and today's bill simply  upholds the spirit and letter of the Second Amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler). She has some language in  this bill. I also would like to thank her for her support for this  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler). She has some language in  this bill.

We have many lively  debates on the floor and many lively debates in the Rules Committee.  But if you really want to see things going in really a tone and tenor  misspeak on this floor, let's at least get back to saying there are  ideas that we agree with and disagree with.   There are ideas of actually just taking a constitutional right and  being able to apply that in the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, which  is what we are talking about here, regardless of who might find that  appealing, what groups or nongroups. That is a constitutional right  that we are fighting for.   But in this regard of saying that puppets--the moment that the group  who enjoys killing babies says, ``You need to make sure that right is  available,'' then my friends across the aisle are quick to jump to  their strings to say, ``Yes, I want to do that.''   When they wanted to have more government-controlled healthcare, they  also said: Oh, but our insurance companies, we need to have a position  for them in which they are taken care of.   I guess that was another puppet string, Mr. Speaker.   I think the bottom line is, let's quit, knowing that many of us on  both sides have our positions, and we have people who like our  positions on both sides, whether they be Democrat or Republican.   But one of the reasons that the American people are very frustrated  with this body is because the tone and tenor is not on policy, which we  can disagree on. It is who controls the other.   If we wanted to lay out a laundry list of supporters of the  Democratic Party and maybe supporters of the Republican Party and say,  that is all that matters, then fine, Mr. Speaker. If we have  degenerated to that, then so be it. But shame on us.   Whether you want reciprocity or not, good. Argue it. Whether you want  to have another thing in our tax reform and you believe tax reform can  be done in a different way, argue it. But when we separate out who is a  puppet and who is not, then we are also racing to the bottom. We are  racing to the bottom of the civil discourse that the American people  are tired of. Look at the last election.   So when I look at this today, Mr. Speaker, I look at a bill--and we  have also heard interesting things that have been said, like: Officers  will be in trouble and possibly can be sued. Look at the language that  is put into the bill, a Terry stop, that they could ask, and that they  are protected from suit.   What they are not protected from is unlawful arrest. Then they will  be held liable. Or maybe, it has also been said that we are going to  turn all of these concealed carry permit owners, like myself and my  friend from Florida, loose on the country and terrible things are going  to happen.   May I remind us here on the floor that Florida, which has issued  nearly 2 million permits, has only revoked 168 due to gun crimes  committed by permit holders. That is 0.008 percent. The fight that  concealed carry permit holders are generally more law-abiding citizens  than the general public, we can disagree, Mr. Speaker, and that is part  of this body.   We can come to different conclusions. That is the reason we have a  debate floor. But when we start to try and bring in other things, and  who is controlled by whom, then I just simply, Mr. Speaker, ask that  the other side cut their strings first.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 645 Offered by Mr. Hastings         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       3440) to authorize the cancellation of removal and adjustment       of status of certain individuals who are long-term United       States residents and who entered the United States as       children and for other purposes. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and       reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then       on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately       after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of       rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 3440.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.   [[Page H9682]]          Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous  question.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.
