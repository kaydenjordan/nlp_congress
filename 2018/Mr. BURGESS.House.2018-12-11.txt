 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7217. This is a  bipartisan Medicaid package that moves forward House priorities with  responsible offsets. The Energy and Commerce Committee has been working  to draft and perfect the legislation before us, and it is encouraging  to see this reach the House floor.   Not only does this package include a new program to improve access to  care, it reauthorizes important and effective programs from which  Americans benefit each and every day. Title I of this package is based  upon Representative Joe Barton and Representative Kathy Castor's ACE  Kids Act.   But I do want to assure families that have children with chronic  illnesses that this legislation is intended to help them, if they want  help, to obtain care coordination services. However, I also want to  clarify that this legislation is not intended to limit families or  their physicians from selecting their provider of medical services.   There is nothing in this legislation that restricts the child's  family and their physician from deciding who is the best provider  amongst those accepting Medicaid and qualified to offer the medical  services. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services has provided  assurances that current freedom-of-choice rules will apply to new care  coordination activity.   As a doctor, I know that many children with chronic illnesses have a  strong relationship with their doctors and with other members of their  healthcare team. I want to make certain that this new law will help  families coordinate their care without affecting the relationship that  families have with their current medical care providers or with other  providers in their communities from whom they may wish to receive their  care.   This package also extends funding for the Money Follows the Person  Demonstration, an effort that was led by my Energy and Commerce  Subcommittee on Health Vice Chair Brett Guthrie and Representative  Debbie Dingell from Michigan.   This Medicaid demonstration was established in 2005 for individuals  in States across our Nation, including Texas, to receive long-term care  services in their homes or other community settings rather than  institutions such as nursing homes. The funding for this program has  already expired, and a funding extension is already overdue. While it  would have been nice to extend this for longer, it was essential to get  this extension across the floor.    A 3-month extension for the protection for Medicaid recipients of  home and community-based services against spousal impoverishment was  also included. This effort was championed by Representatives Fred Upton  and Debbie Dingell.    Mr. Speaker, in an effort to be fiscally responsible,  this legislation includes several offsets to make this package, on net,  a saver.   While it is largely a Medicaid package, there is one small but  important Medicare provision. This provision excludes complex medical  rehabilitative wheelchairs from Medicare's Competitive Acquisition  Program. Currently, these chairs are not included, but because the  statute did not provide the same clear exemption that power wheelchairs  received, there is fear that this unintended omission can lead to them  being included.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the additional time, and I  include my full statement in the Record.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7217, a bipartisan  Medicaid package that propels forward House priorities with responsible  offsets. The Energy and Commerce Committee has been working diligently  to draft and perfect the legislation before us, and it is encouraging  to see this package reach the House floor. Not only does this package  include an exciting new program to improve access to care, it  reauthorizes important and effective programs from which Americans  benefit each and every day.   Title I of this package is based upon Rep. Joe Barton and Rep. Cathy  Castor's ACE Kids Act. I want to ensure families who have children with  chronic illnesses that this legislation is intended to help them, if  they want help, to obtain care coordination services. However, I want  to clarify that this legislation is not intended to limit families and  their physicians from selecting the provider of medical services. There  is nothing in this legislation that restricts the child's family, and  their physician, from deciding who is the best provider among those  accepting Medicaid and qualified to offer the medical services. CMS has  provided assurances that current ``freedom of choice'' rules will apply  to new care coordination activity. As a physician, I know that many  children with chronic illnesses have a strong relationship with their  physician and with other providers. I want to make sure that this new  law will help families coordinate their care without affecting the  relationship that families have with their current medical care  providers or with other providers in their communities from whom they  may want to receive such care from.''   This package also extends funding for the Money Follows the Person  demonstration, an effort led by my E&C Subcommittee on Health Vice  Chair, Brett Guthrie, and Rep. Debbie Dingell. This Medicaid  demonstration, which was established in 2005, has enabled eligible  individuals in states across our nation, including Texas, to receive  long-term care services in their homes or other community settings,  rather than in institutions such as nursing homes. The funding for this  program has already expired, and a funding extension is already long  overdue. While we would have like to extend the funding for longer, it  was essential that we get an extension across the floor, even if a  small one.   A 3-month extension for the Protection for Medicaid Recipients of  Home and Community-Based Services Against Spousal Impoverishment  program is also included. This effort was championed by Representatives  Fred Upton and Debbie Dingell. Our seniors are among our most  vulnerable citizens, and it is programs like this one that help to  protect them from financial ruin.   In an effort to be fiscally responsible, this legislation includes  several offsets that make this package on net a saver, which is  something that Energy & Commerce insists upon and is critically  important.   While this is largely a Medicaid Package, there is one small but  important Medicare provision. This provision excludes manual Complex  Rehabilitative wheelchairs from Medicare's Competitive Acquisition  Program. Currently, these chairs are not included but because statute  did not provide the same clear exemption that power wheelchairs  received, there is fear this unintended omission could lead them to  being included. This provision also delays the application of  competitive bid pricing with CRT accessories used with a CRT manual  chair for 18 months. This mirrors a similar protection last provided by  Congress for power wheelchairs in the 21st Century Cures Act.   This package contains must-pass provisions that the Energy and  Commerce Committee have long fought to pass. The provisions included in  this legislation will improve access to care for Medicaid and Medicare  beneficiaries, which is a laudable and important goal. Not only are  these provisions imperative, but they are responsibly offset. I would  particularly like to thank Energy and Commerce Committee staffer Caleb  Graff, who has spent countless hours negotiating to get this package to  the floor. I support this legislation, and I urge my fellow members and  our friends in the Senate to do so as well.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 2465) to amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize a  sickle cell disease prevention and treatment demonstration program and  to provide for sickle cell disease research, surveillance, prevention,  and treatment.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2465         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SEC. 4. SENSE OF THE SENATE.         It is the Sense of the Senate that further research should       be undertaken to expand the understanding of the causes of,       and to find cures for, heritable blood disorders, including       sickle cell disease.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of S. 2465, the Sickle Cell  Disease and Other Heritable Blood Disorders Research, Surveillance,  Prevention, and Treatment Act of 2018.   The policy included in this legislation is something on which  Congress has been working towards for years, as improvements for  individuals with sickle cell have largely remained stagnant.   This text is similar to H.R. 2410, which was introduced by  Representative  Danny Davis and myself and passed this Chamber  unanimously in February.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Representative Davis, in addition  to Senator Tim Scott and Senator Cory Booker for working with me on  this important policy.   Since the passage of the Sickle Cell Anemia Control Act of 1972, the  first law to address sickle cell, individuals living with this disease  have seen a substantial drop in mortality rates; however, there remains  work to be done.   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there  are approximately 100,000 individuals in the United States with sickle  cell. Additionally, the disease occurs in 1 in 365 African American  births, and in 1 in 13 African American births, the newborn has the  sickle cell trait.   In the 1990s, the Food and Drug Administration approved hydroxyurea,  which stimulates the body to resume production of fetal hemoglobin to  treat sickle cell disease.   Last year the Food and Drug Administration approved Endari, which was  the first new approved treatment in over 20 years.   I met with Dr. Janet Woodcock and Dr. Peter Marks to learn more about  why the approvals have taken such a long time.   This bill would further our commitment to helping those with sickle  cell by both continuing the Health Resources and Service  Administration's Sickle Cell Disease Prevention and Treatment  Demonstration Program and by allowing the Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention to conduct surveillance of the disease and other  heritable blood disorders.   The CDC's surveillance activity will allow for identification of  health disparities, analysis of utilization of existing therapies, and  evaluation of genetic, environmental, behavioral, and other risk  factors.   Having worked with patients with sickle cell disease while at  Parkland Hospital, I have seen firsthand the real consequences that  this disease can have on people.   This bill provides an important step forward in ensuring that we have  the resources to better understand this illness and maintain access for  services for those affected by the disease.   While sickle cell disease has been addressed in bills like the 21st  Century Cures Act, among other rare diseases, it has been a long time  since this illness was substantially addressed in legislation.   The future of sickle cell disease treatment is bright if we pass this  legislation and send it to President Trump. Better understanding of the  landscape of sickle cell disease across the Nation and investing in new  research for new treatments holds much promise for individuals and  families who spend every day managing their disease.   Think of the children who have been unable to play or had to quit  competing, or who have had to struggle through school because they are  frequently absent due to the complications or pain from their  underlying sickle cell illness.   The support this bill provides will enable public-private  partnerships to take the reins to fight this disease head-on in  communities across the country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this legislation so we can  send it promptly to the President's desk.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I want to point out, Mr. Speaker, that this bill we are passing today  has already passed the Senate. While we did work on a similar bill well  over a year ago, this bill has passed the Senate. With our passage  today, this bill goes down the street to the White House for signature  to become law: the first major sickle cell bill to be enacted in quite  some time.   It is a banner day for this institution that we are providing this  help to citizens, fundamentally, on this very crucial problem that  affects so many of our fellow citizens.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to vote in favor of this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 3029) to revise and extend the Prematurity Research Expansion  and Education for Mothers who deliver Infants Early Act (PREEMIE Act).   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 3029         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(b) Duties.--The working group established under subsection       (a) shall--        (1) identify gaps, unnecessary duplication, and       opportunities for improved coordination in Federal programs       and activities related to preterm birth and infant mortality;        (2) assess the extent to which the goals and metrics of       relevant programs and activities within the Department of       Health and Human Services, and, as applicable, those in other       departments, are aligned; and        (3) assess the extent to which such programs are       coordinated across agencies within such Department; and        (4) make specific recommendations, as applicable, to reduce       or minimize gaps and unnecessary duplication, and improve       coordination of goals, programs, and activities across       agencies within such Department.        (c) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date on which       the working group is established under subsection (a), the       Secretary of Health and Human Services shall submit to the       Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the       Senate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House       of Representatives a report summarizing the findings of the       working group under subsection (b) and the specific       recommendations to improve Federal programs at the Department       of Health and Human Services under subsection (b)(4).    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 3029, the PREEMIE  Reauthorization Act of 2018. This bill passed the Senate with robust  bipartisan support, and I expect it will do the same in this Chamber.   This bill reauthorizes a program that is vital to the health and  well-being of premature babies and their mothers. It is fitting that we  have called this legislation to the floor following Prematurity  Awareness Month, which took place the month of November.   While we are taking up the Senate bill, which was led by the Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, Chairman Lamar Alexander and  Senator Michael Bennet, I would like to thank our House champions of  this legislation, Representative Anna Eshoo and Representative Leonard  Lance. I am pleased that we were able to rally bicameral, bipartisan  support around improving the health of premature infants.   Preterm and low birth weight, combined, make up the second leading  cause of infant death following birth defects. This legislation will  increase research relating to preterm labor and delivery and the care,  treatment, and outcomes of preterm and low birthweight infants.   Preemies and low birthweight infants are at risk for various health  challenges and disabilities, and we still have much to learn about  factors relating to prematurity. This bill allows for continued  collection of maternal-infant clinical and biomedical information in  conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's  Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System. Such data collection and  surveillance will allow the CDC, and national, State, and local health  officials to have a better picture of what prematurity, including its  causes and impacts, looks like in our country.   This legislation also requires the Advisory Committee on Maternal and  Infant Health to publicly publish and submit to Congress a report on  its activities and recommendations. That advisory committee has been  tasked with  [[Page H10056]]  developing strategies to address gaps in Federal research, programs,  and education efforts related to the prevention of severe maternal  morbidity, maternal mortality, infant mortality, and other adverse  birth outcomes. This ties nicely into H.R. 1318, the Preventing  Maternal Deaths Act, which will also be on the floor of this House this  afternoon.   Additionally, this legislation establishes an interagency working  group, directing the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human  Services to collaborate with other departments to improve coordination  of programs and activities to prevent preterm birth, infant mortality,  and related adverse birth outcomes. The working group is required to  submit a report to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the  Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support S. 3029, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Lance), one of the authors of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would just like to take a second and  thank Representative Davis for his kind remarks, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support S.  3029, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6615) to reauthorize the Traumatic Brain Injury program, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6615         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Traumatic Brain Injury       Program Reauthorization Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF INJURIES.

SEC. 3. STATE GRANTS FOR PROJECTS REGARDING TRAUMATIC BRAIN                     INJURY.         Section 1252 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C.       300d-52) is amended--        (1) in subsection (a), by inserting ``, acting through the       Administrator for the Administration for Community Living,''       after ``The Secretary'';        (2) by striking subsection (e);        (3) by redesignating subsections (f) through (j) as       subsections (e) through (i), respectively; and        (4) in subsection (i), as so redesignated, by striking       ``$5,500,000 for each of the fiscal years 2015 through 2019''       and inserting ``$7,321,000 for each of fiscal years 2019       through 2023''.       SEC. 4. STATE GRANTS FOR PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY SERVICES.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6615, the Traumatic Brain  Injury Program Reauthorization Act, and I would like to thank  Representatives Bill Pascrell and Representative  Thomas Rooney for  introducing this important legislation.   Traumatic brain injuries impact many families each and every year.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a report last  month that found that young children have one of the highest rates of  TBI-related emergency department visits.   These injuries can harm the developing brain and have the potential  to impact a child's cognitive abilities in the long term.   Whether the result of a hard hit during a football game as a teen, a  car crash in middle age, or a fall as a senior, traumatic brain  injuries pose various and serious risks to Americans.   This legislation reauthorizes the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention traumatic brain injury initiatives at a level of $675  million per year for fiscal years 2019 through 2023.   Additionally, this bill authorizes the National Concussion  Surveillance System at a level of $5 million per year through fiscal  year 2023. This is important in ensuring that we have adequate data  regarding who is getting concussions, how they are treated, and if  there are any trends.   This data will help identify where individuals are seeking healthcare  treatment, if they are seeking treatment at all. Additionally, we do  not currently have national estimates of the number of individuals  living with disabilities due to brain injury, and this system will help  to establish such estimates.  [[Page H10058]]    The Centers for Disease Control plans to conduct its data collection  via telephone surveys and a pilot test to ensure that we will get the  best data from a wide range of households. The bill also reauthorizes  State grants for protection and advocacy services at the Administration  for Community Living.   These services protect individuals with disabilities by providing  them with legal support, especially when it comes to their ability to  make certain lifestyle choices, such as living independently. This is  particularly important given that individuals who suffer from traumatic  brain injury, such as concussions, may experience a disability.   According to the CDC, more than 61 percent of children with moderate  to severe traumatic brain injury experience a disability. We have yet  to see what cost to these individuals and to society these disabilities  convey in the long term.   The culmination of the programs that will be reauthorized by this  legislation provides hope to individuals and families that are affected  by traumatic brain injury. We still have much to learn about the risks  and the short- and long-term effects of traumatic brain injury, and  this legislation will chip away at our goal of increasing knowledge,  awareness, and treatment of traumatic brain injury.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 6615, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6615,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1318) to support States in their work to save and sustain  the health of mothers during pregnancy, childbirth, and in the  postpartum period, to eliminate disparities in maternal health outcomes  for pregnancy-related and pregnancy-associated deaths, to identify  solutions to improve health care quality and health outcomes for  mothers, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1318, the Preventing  Maternal Deaths Act. I am glad that we are finally calling up this bill  for a vote, as it is a truly important bill that will impact the lives  of pregnant women and new mothers across this country. The media's  attention to the issue of maternal morbidity and mortality has shed  light on serious problems within our healthcare system in terms of pre-  and postpartum care and complications in the delivery room.   I thank Representative Jaime Herrera Beutler and Representative Diana  DeGette for their leadership on this critical legislation. Ms. Herrera  Beutler testified before the Energy and Commerce Committee's  Subcommittee on Health this September in support of her bill, which she  and her staff have been working on daily to get across the finish line.  She and I have shared a goal to improve maternal outcomes, and I am  grateful that we had an opportunity to continue to push this priority  forward together.   I also thank the committee staff, which has been working through the  language with the various stakeholders over the course of the past  year. Their work has been imperative in getting this bill to the floor.   Having spent nearly three decades as an OB/GYN, I believe it should  be a national goal to eliminate all preventable maternal deaths. A  single one is too many.   The alarming trend in our country's rate of maternal mortality first  came to my attention in September 2016 when I was reading in my  professional journal called The Green Journal, the journal of  Obstetrics & Gynecology. The original research found that the maternal  mortality rate had increased in 48 States and Washington, D.C., from  2000 to 2014 while the international trend was moving in the opposite  direction. Since reading that article, I have spoken with providers,  hospital administrators, State task forces, and public health experts.  The more I dove into this troubling issue, the more I realized how  little we understand about how our data is lacking.   The Health Subcommittee has held both a member briefing and a hearing  on the issue of maternal mortality. Our hearing this past September had  a varied panel of witnesses, including Charles Johnson, who lost his  wife, Kira, following the birth of their second child in 2016. Mr.  Johnson's wife was a healthy and energetic woman, yet he now has to  explain to his two sons why their mother is never coming home.   The Johnson family is not alone in living through such tragedy.  However, if we pass this bill today and send it to the President's  desk, we will be taking a step in the right direction toward preventing  future maternal deaths.   This is a problem that we cannot address without accurate data.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the United  States' maternal mortality rate was 7.2 deaths per 100,000 live births  in 1999 and increased to 18 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2014.  These are statistics that deserve our full attention.   Representative Jaime Herrera Beutler's bill will address the complex  issue of maternal mortality by enabling States to form maternal  mortality review committees to evaluate, improve, and standardize their  maternity death data. Once we fully understand the problem, there will  be an opportunity to use the data to implement best practices.   Texas is an excellent example of a State that has created and  sustained a maternal mortality and morbidity task force. Texas has put  time, effort, and funding into reviewing maternal deaths in order to  identify trends and causes.   Most of the pregnancy-related and pregnancy-associated deaths--or  many, I should say--are preventable, but they are all tragic. We should  not be losing women to such a fixable problem, leaving their newborn  babies and their families to have to wake up each day to face the  unsolved mystery of why the mother did not make it home from the  hospital or died shortly thereafter.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Herrera Beutler), who is the principal  author of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter), who is a valuable member of the Health  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Colorado (Ms. DeGette).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Just in addition to all the other people who have been thanked, I  want to acknowledge the work of my personal staff, Mr. Ed Kim and  Elizabeth Allen, who have worked so hard on this bill, as well as Dr.  Kristen Shatynski on the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health  staff, who really helped push this along and made sure that we got here  today in a successful manner.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
