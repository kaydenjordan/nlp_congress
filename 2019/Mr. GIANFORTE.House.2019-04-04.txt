 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  remarkable women's basketball team from the University of Montana  Western in Dillon.   The Bulldogs recently captured the NAIA Division I national title to  close out a stellar season. The team's convincing 75-59 victory over  the nine-time national champion, Oklahoma City Stars, brought the  national title to Dillon, Montana.   The school's first national title in women's basketball brought well- deserved recognition to senior Brianna King, a two-time All-American  and NAIA National Player of the Year.   Ms. King, however, was not alone on the court. Fellow All-American  Britt Cooper won the tournament's Hustle Award and Tori Anderson made  All-Tournament First Team.   The Bulldogs' head coach, Lindsay Woolley, led the team to the  national title and was named the 2019 NAIA Coach of the Year.   Congratulations to all the players and coaches. Your school and State  are proud of you.   All Montana is Bulldog Nation.                            ____________________
