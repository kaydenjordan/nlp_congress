 Mr. President, today I recognize Jessica Heinz, an  intern in my Washington, DC, office, for all the hard work she has done  on behalf of myself, my staff, and the State of South Dakota.   Jessica is a graduate of the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign. She is currently pursuing her master of science degree in  terrorism and security policy at American University. Jessica is a  dedicated and diligent worker who has been devoted to getting the most  out of her internship experience and has been a true asset to the  office.   I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Jessica for all of the  fine work she has done and wish her continued success in the years to  come.                            ____________________
