 Mr. President, I join my colleague from Colorado to  come to the floor to talk about the President's misguided decision  earlier today to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals  Program.   This program, put in place by the last administration, gave the  certainty and predictability to so many young children who were brought  to the United States through not their own actions but through others'  actions. As my colleague talked about, there is story after story of  young people who have literally applied for college aid only to find  out they were not here legally and could not pursue that kind of  financial assistance. That is why, since 2001, I have been a supporter  of the Dream Act. Tonight, I cannot believe this is the message from  this President.   In a remarkable act of courage and trust, 17,500 young DACA  recipients are working and contributing to the economy in my State, the  State of Washington. These recipients must submit  [[Page S4958]]  biographical information and biometric information, and allow State  Department, Homeland Security, and other Federal agencies to complete  background checks. They have never committed a felony, and they must  have a job, be in school, or have served in the military. So ending  this program is literally taking workers out of our State, taking the  gross domestic product of over $1 billion that it will cost our Nation  over the next several years.   The President's decision to end DACA runs counter to the longstanding  and proud history in our State of welcoming immigrants. Dreamers invest  in their communities. They pay State and local taxes. In fact, the  Chamber of Commerce supports this program as does a majority of  Americans, and over 300 business leaders agree that Dreamers help us  build a better and more prosperous America. Just today, one of the key  Microsoft executives--one of our key companies--said he would rather  have legislation to protect these individuals in immigration reform  than to have tax reform. That is how important it is to our State.   I am glad my colleagues Senators Durbin and Graham held a bipartisan  press conference to talk about supporting this important legislation to  move forward.   Tonight, as we are returning to the U.S. Senate, with lots of  priorities, we need to make sure we are giving young people--young  people who have benefited from the security of participating in our  economy--the certainty that they will continue to be here in the United  States and to serve in our military. I hope my colleagues will take  this seriously and move toward legislation.   We have worked on a bipartisan basis on this legislation for more  than a decade. Yet it is simple. You either want to protect these young  individuals or you do not. I hope my colleagues will give us a chance  to rectify this as soon as possible.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would also like to say a word about  the World Trade Organization's announcement that was just made  yesterday, one in which the World Trade Organization said that the  Boeing 777X Program did not receive prohibited subsidies. This is a  huge win for 80,000 Boeing employees in the State of Washington as well  as for the 1,700 suppliers and individual businesses across our State  who support our strong aerospace economy.   It is also a loss to the European Union in its efforts to retaliate  against the United States for our challenge to illegal launch aid to  Airbus that began more than 10 years ago. This shows it was right to  raise these concerns by the United States and that the retaliation by  Airbus was wrong.   Last year, the WTO ruled that the EU had not taken steps to comply  with its previous ruling regarding $17 billion in illegal launch aid to  Airbus, and that it had given another $5 billion in illegal launch aid  to the A350 Program even after these kinds of subsidies had been  declared illegal.   We need an aerospace market that is truly competitive, one that is  not distorted by illegal subsidies. So these cases matter because the  outcome impacts jobs here in the United States, and aerospace is one of  the biggest manufacturers in the United States.   We know in our State that there are lots of challenges and there is  lots of competition, but we want that competition to be on a level  playing field. We want to make sure that, in the aerospace industry,  people are playing by the rules. This is the third time the WTO has  said that the massive illegal subsidies the EU has provided to Airbus  are wrong, that they have failed to take the steps to comply, and that  they need to change their behavior.   If the EU will not play by the rules, then we should take the  necessary steps to force an end to these anti-competitive schemes. I  say this because the WTO's ruling today--while I know many of my  colleagues think this process played out all too long--did resolve the  issue as it related to the EU gave Airbus.   Enforcement of these trade rules is important to U.S.  competitiveness. I want to continue to strengthen our ability to  enforce these kinds of rules and continue to make sure that the U.S.  Government has all the resources and personnel it needs to make sure  our trading partners meet their commitments, and our aerospace  workforce in the United States is second to none. I want to continue to  fight every battle to make sure they can be competitive.   I thank everyone at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative for  working so hard on this case for more than a decade. It is finally time  to move on and to make sure that the EU is in line with these past WTO  rulings and that we continue to fight for a fair and competitive  aerospace market.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
