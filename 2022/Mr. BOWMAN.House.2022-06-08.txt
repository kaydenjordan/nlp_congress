 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my resolution,  H. Res. 1152, to condemn the great replacement myth, which is a  delusional white supremacist conspiracy theory.   I am honored to be joined by my co-leads: CBC Chairwoman Beatty, CHC  Chairman Ruiz, CAPAC Chairwoman Chu, LGBTQ-plus Equality Caucus  Chairman Cicilline, CPC Chairwoman Jayapal, Congressman Takano,  Congressman Raskin, and the Representative from Buffalo, New York,  Congressman Higgins. We are joined by more than 140 of our Democratic  colleagues as original cosponsors.   On May 14, a self-described white supremacist and anti-Semite drove  more than 200 miles to Buffalo, New York, where he killed 10 people and  injured 3 others, 11 of which were Black.   In a 180-page manifesto that he posted publicly online, he cites the  great replacement myth as his motivation and cause to target Black  people. The great replacement myth is a racist, anti-Semitic,  Islamophobic, xenophobic, nativist, and hateful lie.   It is 2022, and Black people are still being hunted down and killed  in America. The same goes for every person of color, Jewish people, the  LGBTQ-plus community, and every marginalized person in this country. We  remember the lives of Aaron Salter, Ruth Whitfield, Pearl Young,  Katherine ``Kat'' Massey, Heyward Patterson, Celestine Chaney, Roberta  Drury, Margus D. Morrison, Andre Mackneil, and Geraldine Talley, all  who should still be here with us today.    Madam Speaker, our Nation has been mourning since this  country was founded. We cannot continue to carry on as if this hatred  is an undeniable part of American culture and cannot change. We must  combat white supremacy. I refuse to be complicit in this hatred because  we have failed to take a stand as a Nation.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand together and  condemn this myth as the white supremacist conspiracy theory that it is  and vote ``yes'' on the rule.
