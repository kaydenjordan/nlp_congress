 Mr. President, I rise today to honor Mott  Community College located in Flint, MI. Over the past 100 years, MCC  has become a steadfast partner for local industry, providing high- quality, accessible, and affordable education opportunities. It is a  privilege and honor to recognize the centennial milestone of the  college on September 23, 2023.   Founded in 1923 by the Flint Board of Education, the institution was  originally known as Flint Junior College. Tuition for the first year  was a mere $20, and students could choose to study general literacy,  pre-engineering, pre-dental, pre-medicine, pre-law, or business  administration, as the college was initially designed to prepare  students to transfer to the University of Michigan Ann Arbor.   In 1950, Charles Stewart Mott donated $1 million to develop Flint  Junior College into a 4-year institution in collaboration with the  University of Michigan, a move that created the college and cultural  center. C.S. Mott endowed the college with 32 acres of land and  additional money for the establishment of an entirely new campus. In  1951, William Ballenger, Sr., left a trust of several million dollars,  allowing the college to hire well-qualified instructors and elevate  Flint Junior College into a true community college. Ballenger also  gifted the college $200,000 for the construction of an athletic field  house. The Ballenger Field House would become the first new building on  the new campus.   In 1969, the college was successful in securing a millage,  transforming it into a countywide institution, becoming Genesee  Community College. After the passing of C.S. Mott, the institution  received its name known by the community today, the Charles Stewart  Mott Community College.   The college has a rich athletic history as well. Coach Steven Schmidt  has led the men's basketball team to 753 victories over 30 seasons, the  most by any men's coach in Michigan college basketball history. The  program finished fifth in the Nation in 2021 and has won three national  titles since 2007. The college is also where Justus Thigpen, Sr., the  first athlete from Flint to play in the NBA, got his start as the  basketball team's starting guard in 1965. Mott currently hosts five  varsity men's sports teams, four varsity women's teams, and a co-ed e- sports team.   Today, MCC serves over 8,000 students seeking to gain knowledge and  skills in a wide variety of occupational programs. Mott Community  College continues to be a key partner that delivers on the workforce  development  [[Page S4584]]  needs of the region through continual innovation and investment in  their students' success. By creating programs such as the Mobile  Learning Lab, Workforce Promise, and the operation of Applewood Cafe,  the college has seized every opportunity to support the economic  development in Flint by providing workforce training and experience to  students and workers.   The college is also a leader in expanding diversity, equity, and  inclusion in higher education. From the hiring of Dr. Beverly Walker- Griffea in 2014, its first African-American female president, to the  building of the Lenore Croudy Family Life Center, which is focused on  providing support to students and families experiencing housing and  food insecurity, the college continually works to reduce barriers and  challenges by investing in their students. MCC has also been chosen for  the Aspen Institute Award six times as one of the top 150 community  colleges in the Nation dedicated to excellence and equitable student  success.   Mott Community College has greatly impacted the lives of generations  of students and has positively shaped the city of Flint as we know it  today. I ask you to join me in recognizing the college as they  commemorate their centennial celebration.                            ____________________
