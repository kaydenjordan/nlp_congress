 Ambassador, you've shown the courage to come       forward today and testify, notwithstanding the fact you were       urged by the White House or the State Department not to,       notwithstanding the fact that, as you testified earlier, the       President implicitly threatened you in that call record. And       now the President, in real-time, is attacking you. What       effect do you think that has on other witnesses' willingness       to come forward and expose wrongdoing?        Ambassador YOVANOVITCH. It is very intimidating.         It is designed to intimidate, is it not?        Ambassador YOVANOVITCH. I mean, I can't speak to what the       President was trying to do, but I think the effect is to be       intimidating.         Well, I want to let you know, Ambassador, that       some of us here take witness intimidation very, very       seriously.    Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. The House also subpoenaed the public testimony  of Ambassador William B. Taylor, another career public servant, who  graduated at the top of his class from West Point, served as an  infantry commander in Vietnam, and earned a Bronze Star and an Air  Medal with the ``V'' device for Valor.   Yet, shortly after Ambassador Taylor came forward to Congress,  President Trump publicly referred to him as a Never Trumper without any  basis. Then, when a reporter noted that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  had hired Ambassador Taylor, President Trump responded: ``Hey,  everybody makes mistakes.'' He then had the following exchange about  Ambassador Taylor. Let's listen.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         President TRUMP. He's a Never Trumper. His lawyer is the       head of the Never Trumpers. They're a dying breed, but they       are still there.    Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Ambassador Taylor has since stepped down from  his position as our chief diplomat in Ukraine.   In addition to his relentless attack on witnesses who testified in  connection to the House's impeachment inquiry, the President also  repeatedly threatened and attacked the member of the intelligence  community who filed the anonymous whistleblower complaint. In more than  100 statements about the whistleblower over a period of just 2 months,  the President publicly questioned the whistleblower's motives and  disputed the accuracy of the whistleblower's account.   But most disturbing, President Trump issued a threat against the  whistleblower and those who provided information to the whistleblower.  Let's listen.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         President TRUMP. I want to know who's the person, who's the       person who gave the whistleblower the information. Because       that's close to a spy. You know what we used to do in the old       days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we       used to handle it a little differently than we do now.    Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. The President's need to conceal his actions was  so extreme that he even attacked the credibility of those witnesses who  served our country in combat. This included Active Duty military  personnel and veterans who earned the Purple Heart and Bronze Star,  among other battlefield recognition. But President Trump showed utter  disregard for such patriotism. For example, President Trump attacked  Lieutenant Colonel Vindman during his testimony on November 19, seeking  to question his loyalty to the United States. The President retweeted  that Lieutenant Colonel Vindman was offered the position of Defense  Minister for the Ukrainian Government three times. Lieutenant Colonel  Vindman, the national security director for Ukraine, has been an  Activity Duty Army officer for more than 20 years. Lieutenant Colonel  Vindman earned a Purple Heart for wounds he sustained in an improvised  explosive attack or device in Iraq.   President Trump's campaign of intimidation is reprehensible, debases  the Presidency, and was part of his effort to obstruct the impeachment  inquiry. The fact that it is the President of the United States making  these threats tells us something. It tells us that the President  desperately wanted to keep witnesses from testifying and thus further  obstruct Congress's inquiry.   Senators, we cannot, and we must not, condone President Trump's  attacks on whistleblowers and witnesses--people who truly have the  ability to put our country first.   Mr. Manager NADLER. Now that we have carefully reviewed the facts and  have described the President's categorical obstruction of Congress, we  address questions of law. This discussion need not be abstract. The  President's obstruction impacts the Senate directly. It impacts the  constituents you represent. It impacts you because your job as a Member  of Congress is to hold the executive branch in check. This is true no  matter who occupies the White House or which party controls the House  or Senate. And the further the President--any President--departs from  the law in the Constitution, the more important it is for you to do  your job.   I suspect that there is common ground here. We all know that in order  for Congress to do its work, we must have information. What is  reasonable policy? What is the administration doing? Do we support it?  Should we oppose it? Should we enact legislation to correct the  problem? Asking questions, gathering information, making decisions  based on the answers--this is one of the fundamental functions of  Congress.   I suspect that we agree on this as well: Our ability to do that work  depends on gathering information. It depends on the power of the  congressional subpoena. Even when you make a polite request for  information from a friendly administration, that request is backed by  the threat of a subpoena.   And although the power of the congressional subpoena has been  affirmed repeatedly by the courts, enshrined in the rules of the House  and Senate, and respected by executive branch agencies for centuries,  if the President chooses to ignore our subpoenas, our powers as a  branch of government--our ability to do our jobs, our ability to keep  an administration in check, our ability to make sure that the American  people  [[Page S551]]  are represented by a Congress, not just by a President--are diminished.   Please know that we are not talking about a disagreement over the  last few documents at the end of a long production schedule. We are  talking about a direct order from the President of the United States to  completely disregard all our subpoenas, to deny us all information the  President wants to keep secret. This is in order to deprive Congress of  our ability to hold an administration accountable. It is a bid to  neuter Congress, to render the President all powerful since Congress  could not have any information the President didn't want us to have.  Without information, we cannot act.   We must ask: Is there a consequence for a President who defies our  subpoenas absolutely; who says to all branches of the administration  ``Do not obey a single congressional subpoena''--categorically, without  knowing the subject of the subpoena--just ``Never answer a  congressional subpoena''; who denies Congress the right to any  information necessary to challenge his power?   Would Madison, Hamilton, and Washington support removing a President  who declares that the Constitution lets him do whatever he wants and  who brazenly adds that he can ignore any effort to investigate, even  when backed by subpoenas that the law requires him to obey? The answer  to all these questions is a resounding yes.   Before diving in, I would like to set the historical scene. The  Framers were wise. And so they worried that Presidents would abuse  their power for personal gain. They feared that someday a President  might mistake himself for a King--whose decisions cannot be questioned,  whose conduct cannot be investigated, whose power transcends the rule  of law. Such a would-be King would certainly think things like ``I have  the right to do whatever I want as president.'' He might believe that  it is ``illegitimate'' for anyone to investigate him. Of course, not  even the Framers could have imagined a President would say these things  out loud.   A President with this view of raw power would attack anyone who tried  to hold him to account, branding them ``human scum'' and ``the Enemy of  the People.'' He would argue that courts had no power to enforce  subpoenas against him.   He would conscript his allies to ridicule Congress. He would harass  witnesses who testified against him, declaring it was disloyal to  question his conduct. He would use the powers of his high office to  sabotage our system of checks and balances. All of this we have seen in  the last few years--indeed, in the last few months.   The Framers wrote the impeachment clause to protect the American  people from such a President. The impeachment clause exists to protect  our freedom and our democracy in between elections. It exists to remind  Presidents that they serve the public, not the other way around. It is  a reminder to Presidents that they answer to something greater than  themselves. It confirms that nobody in America is above the law, not  even the President.   As we have discussed, the impeachment power does not magically  protect us when a President commits high crimes and misdemeanors. In  Benjamin Franklin's words, the Framers left us a Republic--if we can  keep it.   One way we can uphold that promise is to do our duty as elected  Members of Congress to hold the executive branch in check. That  responsibility is part of the constitutional design. The burden is  ours, regardless of our political party, no matter who sits in the Oval  Office.   In the ordinary course, when we do our jobs, we do our Nation a  service by holding the executive branch--both its political leadership  and its professional core--accountable to the people for its actions.   When the President's conduct exceeds the usual constitutional  safeguards, it falls on the House to investigate Presidential  wrongdoing and, if necessary, to approve Articles of Impeachment. It  then falls on the Senate to judge, convict, and remove Presidents who  threaten the Constitution.   This entire framework depends on Congress's ability to discover and  then to thoroughly investigate Presidential malfeasance. If Presidents  could abuse their power and then conceal all the evidence from  Congress, the impeachment clause would be a nullity. We the people  would lose a vital protection.   That is why officials throughout history have repeatedly recognized  that subpoenas served in an impeachment inquiry must be obeyed,  including by the President. It is why, before President Trump, only a  single official in American history has ever defied an impeachment  subpoena. And that is why that official, Richard Nixon, faced Articles  of Impeachment for doing so.   As the House Judiciary Committee reasoned in its analysis of Nixon's  obstruction: ``[U]nless the defiance of the [House] subpoenas . . . is  considered grounds for impeachment, it is difficult to conceive of any  President acknowledging that he is obligated to supply the relevant  evidence necessary for Congress to exercise its constitutional  responsibility in an impeachment proceeding.''   Representative Robert McClory, a Republican from Illinois, explained  the importance of this Article of Impeachment for our separation of  powers. He said:         . . . if we refuse to recommend that the President should       be impeached because of his defiance of the Congress with       respect to the subpoenas that we have issued, the future       respondents will be in the position where they can determine       themselves what they are going to provide in an impeachment       inquiry and what they are not going to provide, and this       would be particularly so in the case of an inquiry directed       toward the President of the United States. So, it not only       affects this President but future Presidents.    That is where we find ourselves now but with even greater force.   President Nixon authorized other executive branch officials and  agencies to honor their legal obligations. He also turned over many of  his own documents. President Trump, in contrast, directed his entire  administration--every agency, every office, and every official--not to  cooperate with the impeachment inquiry. As in Nixon's case, President  Trump's obstruction is merely an extension of his coverup.   As in Nixon's case, President Trump's obstruction reveals  consciousness of guilt. Innocent people do not act this way. They do  not hide all the evidence. And like Nixon, President Trump has offered  an assortment of arguments to excuse his obstruction. But as was true  in Nixon's case, none of these excuses can succeed.   At bottom, these arguments amount to a claim that the President can  dictate the terms of his own impeachment inquiry. President Trump's  lawyers may insist his grounds for defying Congress are unique and  limited; that they only apply here, just this one time; that it was the  House, not the President, that broke from precedent; that he would  gladly comply with subpoenas if only the House would do as he insists.   That is pure fantasy. The President's arguments are not a one-ride  ticket. They are not unique to these facts. Unless they are firmly and  finally rejected here, these bogus excuses will reappear every time  Congress investigates any President for serious abuses of power--every  single time. They will constitute a playbook for ignoring oversight,  available to all future Presidents--Democratic and Republican.   These arguments are not consistent with the Constitution. They are  lawyerly window dressing for an unprecedented, dangerous power grab.   Plenty of Presidents and judges have complained about impeachment  inquiries, declaring their own innocence, attacking the House's  motives, and insisting that due process entitled them to all sorts of  things. But no President or judge--except Richard Nixon--has ever  defied subpoenas on that basis. And no President or judge--none--has  ever directed others to defy subpoenas categorically across the board.  They have all eventually recognized their obligations under the law.  President Trump stands alone.   If President Trump is permitted to defy our subpoenas here in an  impeachment inquiry, when the courts have said the congressional power  of inquiry is at its highest, imagine what future Presidents will do  when we attempt to conduct routine oversight.   President Trump is the first leader of this Nation to declare that  nobody can investigate him for official misconduct, except on his own  terms. In word and in deed, President Trump has declared himself above  the law. He has done so because he is guilty and wishes  [[Page S552]]  to conceal as much of the evidence from the American people and from  this body as he can. In that, he must not succeed. If President Trump  is allowed to remain in office after this conduct, historians will mark  the date that this Senate allowed this President to break one of our  mightiest defenses against tyranny. They will wonder why Congress so  readily surrendered one of its core constitutional powers. They will  wonder why Congress admitted that a President can get away with  anything, can violate any constitutional rule, any liberty, any request  for information, and get away with it simply by saying: I don't have to  answer your questions. Congress has no power to make me answer  questions about my conduct.    That is what is at stake. In the future, people will despair that  future Presidents will abuse their power without fear of consequences  or constraint.   Let's begin with a legal premise of the second Article of  Impeachment.   Congress has the power to investigate Presidents for official  misconduct. This premise is indisputable. In article I of the  Constitution:         All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in       the Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a       Senate and House of Representatives.        Each House may determine the rules of its own proceedings.    Our investigations are grounded in article I of the Constitution,  which grants Congress all legislative powers and authorizes each House  to determine its own rules. As the Supreme Court has explained, the  Constitution thus vests the House and the Senate with the power of  inquiry, that it is ``penetrating and far-reaching.''   Moreover, Congress can effectuate that power of inquiry by issuing  subpoenas commanding the recipient to provide documents or to testify  under oath. Compliance with subpoenas is mandatory. It is not at the  option of the executive or the President. As the Supreme Court has  explained:         [I]t is unquestionably the duty of all citizens to       cooperate with the Congress in its efforts to obtain the       facts needed for intelligent legislative action. It is their       unremitting obligation to respond to subpoenas, to respect       the dignity of the Congress and its committees, and to       testify fully with respect to matters within the province of       proper investigation.    More recently, U.S. District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson has  elaborated:         [B]latant defiance of Congress' centuries-old power to       compel the performance of witnesses is not an abstract       injury, nor is it a mere banal insult to our democracy. It is       an affront to the mechanism for curbing abusers of powers       that the Framers carefully crafted for our protection, and,       thereby, recalcitrant witnesses actually undermine the       broader interests of the people of the United States.    In recognition of the important role that congressional inquiries  play in protecting our democracy and in guarding the American people,  it is unlawful to obstruct them.   Of course, while Congress investigates many issues, one of the most  important is misconduct in the executive branch.   There is a long history of congressional investigations into the  executive branch. To name a few especially famous cases, Congress has  investigated claims that President Lincoln mishandled Civil War  military strategy; the infamous Teapot Dome scandal under President  Harding; President Nixon's involvement in the Watergate scandal;  President Reagan's involvement in the Iran-Contra affair; President  Clinton's real estate dealings and the Monica Lewinsky scandal;  warrantless wiretapping under President George W. Bush; and attacks on  personnel in Benghazi under President Obama.   Since the dawn of the Republic, Presidents have recognized Congress's  power to investigate the executive branch. Even in sensitive  investigations involving national security and foreign policy,  Presidents have provided Congress with access to senior officials and  important documents.   For example, in the Iran-Contra inquiry, President Reagan's former  National Security Advisor, Oliver North, and the former Assistant to  the President for National Security Affairs, John Poindexter, testified  before Congress. President Reagan also produced ``relevant excerpts of  his personal diaries to Congress.''   During the Clinton administration, Congress obtained testimony from  top advisers, including the President's Chief of Staff Mack McLarty,  his Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles, White House Counsel Bernie Nussbaum,  and White House Counsel Jack Quinn.   In the Benghazi investigation, President Obama made many of his top  aides available for transcribed interviews, including National Security  Advisor Susan Rice and Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic  Communications Benjamin Rhodes. The Obama administration, in that case,  also produced more than 75,000 pages of documents, including 1,450  pages of White House emails, with communications of senior officials on  the National Security Council.   To be sure, certain House Republicans complained loudly that the  Obama administration's response to the Benghazi investigation was  insufficient. Just imagine how they would have reacted if Obama had  ordered total defiance of all subpoenas. They would have been outraged.  Why? Because Congress unquestionably has the authority to investigate  Presidential conduct.   Not only does Congress have the power to investigate the Executive,  but, as we have discussed, article I of the Constitution gives the  House the sole power of impeachment. The Framers intended this power to  be the central check on out-of-control Presidents. But it does not work  automatically. The House must investigate, question witnesses, and  review documents. Only then can it decide whether to approve or not  approve Articles of Impeachment. Therefore, when the House determines  that the President may have committed high crimes and misdemeanors, it  has the constitutional duty to investigate his conduct.   In such cases, the House acts not only pursuant to its ordinary  legislative authority but also serves as a ``grand inquest of the  Nation'' because an impeachment inquiry wields one of the greatest  powers of the Constitution--a power that exists specifically to  constrain Presidents.   Its subpoenas are backed with the full force of the impeachment  clause. They cannot be thwarted by ordinary executive privileges or  ordinary objections. It is therefore presumed--as President Polk  conceded over 150 years ago--that ``all the archives and papers of the  Executive Departments, public or private, would be subject to . . .  inspection'' and ``every facility in the power of the Executive [would]  be afforded to enable [the House] to prosecute the investigation.''  What investigation? The impeachment investigation of President Polk.   President's Polk's statement, which we will return to, was no  outlier. Presidents have long understood that they must comply with  impeachment inquiries. Consistent with this understanding, in the  history of the Republic, no President has ever claimed the unilateral  prerogative to categorically defy a House impeachment inquiry. On the  contrary, every President facing this issue has agreed that Congress  possesses a broad and penetrating power of inquiry when investigating  grounds for impeachment.    This directly refutes President Trump's claim that he obstructed  Congress to protect the Office of the President. Every prior occupant  of his office has disavowed the limitless power that he asserts. That  matters.   As the Supreme Court explained just a few years ago:         [L]ong settled and established practice is a consideration       of great weight in a proper interpretation of constitutional       provisions regulating the relationship between Congress and       the President.    Let's take a quick tour of the historical record. To begin at the  beginning--a sweltering summer in Philadelphia, 1787--the Framers  discussed at length the balance between Presidents and Congress.  Remember, they had just fought a bloody war to rid themselves of a  tyrant, and they were very conscious they didn't want another tyrant.  When impeachment came up, they agreed it would limit the President's  authority. But a strong majority of Framers saw that as a virtue, not a  vice. They wanted to empower the President but also to keep his power  from getting out of hand.   Yet impeachment could not serve that role if the House was unable to  investigate the President for suspected high crimes and misdemeanors.  This was recognized early on, starting with our very first President.  In 1796, the  [[Page S553]]  House requested that President Washington provide it sensitive  diplomatic materials relating to the hugely unpopular Jay Treaty with  Great Britain. President Washington declined since this request  intruded upon his executive functions. But Washington agreed that  impeachment would change his calculus. In the ensuing debates, it was  noted on the House floor that Washington had admitted ``that where the  House expresses an intention to impeach, the right to demand from the  Executive all papers and information in his possession belongs to it.''   ``All papers and information.'' This was only the first of many  references to that point in our constitutional tradition. For example,  less than 40 years later, in 1833, Justice Joseph Story remarked upon  the dangers of Presidential obstruction. He wrote:         The power of impeachment will generally be applied to       persons holding high offices under the government; and it is       of great consequence that the President should not have the       power of preventing a thorough investigation of their       conduct.    Consistent with this teaching, President Polk later offered his clear  and insightful explanation of why Presidents must honor all impeachment  subpoenas. As I mentioned just moments ago, he said:         It may be alleged that the power of impeachment belongs to       the House of Representatives, and that with a view to the       exercise of this power, that House has the right to       investigate the conduct of all public officers under the       government. This is cheerfully admitted.    Decades later, during our first Presidential impeachment inquiry,  President Andrew Johnson recognized Congress's power to thoroughly  investigate him and his executive branch subordinates.   In 1857, for example, the House Judiciary Committee obtained  executive and Presidential records. The committee interviewed Cabinet  officers and Presidential aides about Cabinet meetings and private  conversations with the President by his top aides and Cabinet  officials. Multiple witnesses, moreover, answered questions about the  opinions of the President's, statements made by the President, and the  advice given to the President. There is no evidence that Johnson ever  asserted any privilege to prevent disclosure of Presidential  conversations to the committee or failed to comply with any of the  committee's requests.   Thus, in the first 80 years of the Republic, Presidents Washington,  Polk, and Johnson, along with members of committees of the House and a  Supreme Court Justice, all recognized that Congress is authorized by  the Constitution to investigate grounds for impeachment and that  Presidents are obligated to give all information requested. President  Trump's attempt to stonewall Congress would have shocked those  Presidents.   With only a few exceptions, invocations of the impeachment power  subsided from 1868 to 1972. Yet, even in that period, while objecting  to ordinary legislative oversight, Presidents Ulysses S. Grant, Grover  Cleveland, and Theodore Roosevelt each noted that Congress could obtain  key executive branch documents in an impeachment inquiry. They thus  confirm yet again that impeachment is different. Under the  Constitution, it requires full compliance.   Then came Watergate, when President Nixon abused the power of his  office to undermine his political opponents. But even Nixon--even  Nixon--understood that he must comply with subpoenas for information  relating to his misconduct. Thus, he stated in March 1973, regarding  the Senate's Watergate investigation:         All members of the White House staff will appear       voluntarily when requested by the committee. They will       testify under oath, and they will answer fully all proper       questions.    As a result, many senior White House officials testified, including  White House Counsel John Dean, White House Chief of Staff H. R.  Haldeman, and Deputy Assistant to the President Alexander Butterfield.   In addition, Nixon produced many documents in response to  congressional subpoenas, including notes from meetings with the  President.   As the House Judiciary Committee explained at the time, 69 officials  had been subjected to impeachment investigations throughout American  history. Yet, ``with the possible exception of one minor official who  invoked the privilege against self-incrimination, not one of them  challenged the power of the committee conducting the investigation to  compel the production of evidence it deemed necessary.''   President Nixon's production of records was incomplete, however, in a  very important respect: He did not produce tape recordings of key Oval  Office conversations. In response, the House Judiciary Committee  approved an Article of Impeachment against the President for  obstruction of Congress.   Twenty-four years later, the House undertook impeachment proceedings  against President Clinton. Consistent with precedent and entirely  unlike President Trump, Clinton ``pledged to cooperate fully with the  [impeachment] investigation.'' Ultimately, he provided written  responses to 81 interrogatories from the Judiciary Committee, and 3  witnesses provided testimony during the Senate trial.   As this review of the historic record proves, Presidents have long  recognized that the Constitution compels them to honor subpoenas served  by the House in an impeachment inquiry.   Stated simply, President Trump's categorical blockade of the House-- his refusal to honor any subpoenas, his order that all subpoenas be  defied without even knowing what they were--has no analog in the  history of the Republic. Nothing even comes close. He has engaged in  obstruction that several of his predecessors have expressly said is  forbidden and that led to an Article of Impeachment against Nixon.   President Trump is an outlier. He is the first and only President  ever to declare himself unaccountable and to ignore subpoenas backed by  the Constitution's impeachment power. If he is not removed from office  and if he is permitted to defy the Congress entirely, categorically,  and to say that subpoenas from Congress in an impeachment inquiry are  nonsense, then we will have lost--the House will have lost, and the  Senate, certainly, will have lost--all power to hold any President  accountable.   This is a determination by President Trump that he wants to be all  powerful. He does not have to respect the Congress--he does not have to  respect the representatives of the people. Only his will goes. He is a  dictator. This must not stand. That is another reason he must be  removed from office.   Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, we have now shown  how the extreme measures President Trump took to conceal evidence and  block witnesses defies the Constitution and centuries of historical  practice; but there is more to this story, and it only further  undermines President Trump's case. The position he has taken is not  only baseless as an historical matter; it is also inconsistent with the  Justice Department's stated reason for refusing to indict or prosecute  Presidents.   The Department of Justice's unwillingness to indict a sitting  President creates a danger that the President can't be held accountable  by anyone, even for grave misconduct. To its credit, the Department of  Justice recognized that risk. In its view, ``the constitutionally  specified impeachment process ensures that the immunity would not place  the President `above the law.'''   This argument by the Justice Department is really important. In  justifying its view that a President can't be held criminally liable  while in office, the DOJ relies on Congress's ability to impeach and  remove a President, but the Justice Department's rationale falls apart  if the ``constitutionally specified impeachment process'' can't  function because the President himself has obstructed it.   The Supreme Court correctly noted in Nixon v. Fitzgerald--and that is  not Richard Nixon; it is Judge Nixon--``vigilant oversight by  Congress'' is necessary to ``make credible the threat of impeachment.''   The President should not be treated as immune from criminal liability  because he is subject to impeachment but then be allowed to sabotage  the impeachment process itself. That is what this President did. That  places him dangerously above the law and beyond the separation of  powers. Presidents can't be above the law. Presidents, like everyone  else, must obey subpoenas served in an impeachment inquiry.   In 1880, the Supreme Court explained: ``Where the question of such  impeachment is before either [House of Congress] acting in its  appropriate sphere  [[Page S554]]  on that subject, we see no reason to doubt the right to compel the  attendance of witnesses, and their answer to proper questions, in the  same manner and by the use of the same means that courts of justice can  in like cases.''   Almost a century later, Judge John Sirica's influential opinion on  the Watergate ``roadmap'' in 1974 emphasized the special weight  assigned to Congress in an impeachment.   He wrote:         [I]t should not be forgotten that we deal in a matter of       the most critical moment to the Nation, an impeachment       investigation involving the President of the United States.       It would be difficult to conceive of a more compelling need       than that of this country for an unswervingly fair inquiry       based on all the pertinent information.    That same year, the Supreme Court decided the famous case of Nixon v.  United States. That is President Nixon. I was standing just across the  street from the Court when the case was handed down, and I remember  seeing the reporters running down those marble steps, clutching the  Court's unanimous decision. That decision forced the release of key  Oval Office tapes that President Nixon had tried to cover up by  invoking executive privilege. In short order, it led to the resignation  of President Nixon.   The plaintiff in that case was actually the special prosecutor, Leon  Jaworski, who had been appointed to investigate the Watergate burglary  and who had issued subpoenas for the Nixon tapes. The Supreme Court  upheld these subpoenas against President Nixon's claim of executive  privilege. It reasoned that his asserted interest in confidentiality  could not overcome the constitutionally grounded interest in the fair  administration of criminal justice.   In reaching that conclusion, the Court said:         The ends of criminal justice would be defeated if judgments       were to be founded on a partial or speculative presentation       of the facts. The very integrity of the judicial system and       public confidence in the system depend on full disclosure of       all the facts, within the framework of the rules of evidence.    That reasoning, which was a unanimous decision by the Supreme Court  in the Nixon tapes case, applies with full force--indeed, greater  force--to impeachments.   The House Judiciary Committee recognized this when it approved an  Article of Impeachment against President Nixon for obstruction of  Congress.   It reasoned as follows:         If a generalized Presidential interest in confidentiality       cannot prevail over ``the fundamental demand of due process       of law in the fair administration of justice,'' neither can       it be permitted to prevail over the fundamental need to       obtain all the relevant facts in the impeachment process.       Whatever the limits of legislative power in other contexts--      and whatever need may otherwise exist for preserving the       confidentiality of Presidential conversations--in the context       of an impeachment proceeding the balance was struck in the       favor of the power of inquiry.    Accordingly, President Trump's conduct is unprecedented and,  actually, offensive to the precedents, and it is inconsistent with his  duty--his oath--to faithfully execute the laws. That obligation to see  that the laws are faithfully executed is not just about enforcing  statutes; it is a duty to be faithful to the Constitution--every part  of it--as stated in the text and understood across history, and it is a  duty that he has violated by obstructing Congress here.    I want to make one additional point regarding the judiciary.   Presidents have an obligation to comply with Congress's impeachment  inquiry regardless of whether a court has reviewed the request. We make  this point even though, I think, President Trump's lawyers would be  making a mistake to raise it. After all, the President's lawyers can't  have it both ways. They can't argue here that we must go to court and  then argue in court that our case can't be heard.   Anyway, the House's ``sole Power of impeachment'' wouldn't be  ``sole'' or much of a ``power'' if the House could not investigate the  President at all without first spending years litigating before the  third branch of government. It would frustrate the Constitution for the  House to depend entirely on the judiciary to advance its impeachment- related investigatory powers.   Consistent with this understanding, before President Trump, the House  had never before filed a lawsuit to require testimony or documents in a  Presidential impeachment. We didn't have to. No President had ever  issued a blanket ban on compliance with House subpoenas or challenged  the House to find a way around his unlawful order. In this strange and  unprecedented situation, it is appropriate for Congress to reach its  own judgment that the President is obstructing the exercise of its  constitutional power.   As then-Representative Lindsey Graham explained in 1998 during the  Clinton proceedings, where we served together on the Judiciary  Committee: ``The day Richard Nixon failed to answer that subpoena is  the day he was subject to impeachment because he took the power from  Congress over the impeachment process away from Congress, and he became  the judge and jury.''   There is still another reason it would be wrong and dangerous to  insist that the House cannot take action without involving the courts,  and that reason is delay.   Consider just three lawsuits filed by House committees over the past  two decades to enforce subpoenas against senior executive branch  officials. I served on the Judiciary Committee when we decided that we  needed to hear from former White House Counsel Harriet Miers.   In Committee on the Judiciary v. Miers, the Judiciary Committee tried  to enforce a subpoena that required her to give testimony about the  contentious firing of nine U.S. attorneys. The committee served the  subpoena in 2007. We negotiated--as the courts indicate you should-- with the White House, and we finally filed suit in March of 2008. We  won a favorable district court order in July 2008, but we didn't  receive testimony from Miers until June of 2009. That was 2 years.   In Committee on Oversight and Government Reform v. Holder, the  Committee on Oversight and Government Reform tried to force Attorney  General Eric Holder to produce additional documents relating to the so- called Operation Fast and Furious. The committee served the subpoena in  October 2011. They filed suit in August 2012. They won a series of  orders requiring the production of documents, but the first such order  did not issue until August of 2014--nearly 3 years.   In Committee on the Judiciary v. McGahn, the House Judiciary  Committee sought to enforce a subpoena to require White House Counsel  Don McGahn to give testimony regarding matters relating to the special  counsel's investigation. We served that subpoena in April of last year.  We filed suit in August of last year. We won a favorable district court  order in November of last year. The court of appeals stayed that ruling  and didn't hear arguments until early this month--with an opinion and,  potentially, a Supreme Court application likely to follow. We will  likely not have an answer this year.   Sometimes courts move quickly, but, here, they have not--not at all.  Even when the House urges expedited action, it usually takes years, not  months, to get evidence through judicial proceedings.   The President can't put off impeachment for years by ordering total  defiance of the House and then insist that the House go to court even  as he argues that it can't go to court. That is especially true when  the President doesn't just raise one or two objections to specific  subpoenas but orders a blanket, governmentwide coverup of all evidence.   That kind of order makes this clear. The President sees himself  completely immune from any accountability--above the law. It reveals  his pretentions, really, to absolute power. It confirms he must be  removed from office.   Here is the key point: President Trump's obstruction of Congress is  not merely unprecedented and wrong; it is also a high crime and  misdemeanor, as the Framers used and understood that phrase, warranting  his immediate removal from office. To see why, let's return to first  principles.   As the Framers deliberated in Philadelphia, George Mason posed a  profound question: ``Shall any man be above justice?''   That question wasn't a hypothetical. The Framers had just rebelled  against England, where one man, the King, was in fact above justice.   By authorizing Congress to remove Presidents for egregious  misconduct,  [[Page S555]]  the Framers rejected that model. Unlike Britain's King, the President  would answer to Congress and, thus, to the Nation, if he engaged in  serious wrongdoing, because the impeachment power exists not to punish  the President but to check Presidents. It can't function if Presidents  are free to ignore all congressional investigation and oversight.   An impeachment scholar, Frank Bowman, said this:         Without the power to compel compliance with subpoenas and       the concomitant right to impeach a president for refusal to       comply, the impeachment power would be nullified.    So the consequences of Presidential obstruction go beyond any  particular impeachment inquiry. They go to the heart of the impeachment  power itself. They weaken our shield against a dangerous or corrupt  President.   Now, of course, Presidents are still free to raise privacy, national  security, or other concerns in the course of an impeachment inquiry.  There is room for good-faith negotiations over what evidence will be  disclosed, although there is a strong presumption in favor of full  compliance with congressional subpoenas.   But when a President abuses his office, abuses his power to  completely defy House investigators in an impeachment inquiry, when he  does that without lawful cause or excuse, he attacks the Constitution  itself. When he does that, he confirms that he sees himself as above  the law.   President Nixon's case is informative. As noted, President Nixon let  his senior officials testify, he produced many documents. He did not  direct anything like a blanket indiscriminate block of the House's  impeachment inquiry. Still, he did defy subpoenas seeking records and  recordings of the Oval Office.   Now, President Nixon claimed that his noncompliance was legally  defensible. He invoked the doctrine of executive privilege. The  judiciary rejected that excuse.   The committee emphasized that ``the doctrine of separation of powers  cannot justify the withholding of information from an impeachment  inquiry.'' After all, ``the very purpose of such an inquiry is to  permit the House, acting on behalf of the people, to curb the excesses  of another branch, in this instance the Executive.''   ``Whatever the limits of legislative power in other contexts--and  whatever need may otherwise exist for preserving the confidentiality of  Presidential conversations--in the context of an impeachment proceeding  the balance was struck in favor of the power of inquiry when the  impeachment provision was written into the Constitution.   Now, ultimately, the committee approved an article against Nixon  because he sought to prevent the House from exercising its  constitutional duty.   Article III charged Nixon with abusing his power by interfering with  the discharge of the Judiciary Committee's responsibility to  investigate fully and completely whether he had committed high crimes  and misdemeanors. President Nixon's third Article of Impeachment  explained it this way:         In refusing to produce these papers and things, Richard M.       Nixon, substituting his judgment as to what materials were       necessary for the inquiry, interposed the powers of the       Presidency against the lawful subpoenas of the House of       Representatives, thereby assuming to himself functions and       judgments necessary to the exercise of the sole power of       impeachment vested by the Constitution in the House of       Representatives.        In all of this, Richard M. Nixon has acted in a manner       contrary to his trust as President and subversive of       constitutional government, to the great prejudice of the       cause of law and justice, and to the manifest injury of the       people of the United States. . . .    President Nixon's case powerfully supports the conclusion that  Presidential defiance of a House impeachment inquiry constitutes high  crimes and misdemeanors.   You know, I have been thinking a lot about the Founders and have been  rereading the Constitution and the notes from the Constitutional  Convention. It was just a little over 230 years ago that they met in  Philadelphia, not too far from here. They had been at it for a long  time. They didn't know whether the constitution they were going to  write would sustain freedom, but they were trying to create a  completely different type of government.   On July 20, Governor Morris said this:         The magistrate is not the king. The people are the king.    George Mason, of Virginia, on that same day said:         Shall any man be above Justice? Above all, shall that man       be above it who can commit the most extensive injustice?''    And Elbridge Gerry argued that he hoped that the maxim that the chief  magistrate could do no wrong ``would never be adopted here.''   Now, finally, on September 8, they adopted the impeachment clause in  the U.S. Constitution, but I hope that we will remember the admonition  that we should never accept the fact that the magistrate--the  President--can do no wrong.   They crafted the Constitution to protect our liberty and the liberty  of those who will follow us.   Professor Noah Feldman talked about the Constitution in his testimony  before the House.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Noah FELDMAN. A President who says, as this President did       say, I will not cooperate in any way, shape, or form with       your process, robs a coordinate branch of government, he robs       the House of Representatives of its basic constitutional       power of impeachment.    Ms. Manager LOFGREN. You know, a President who does that also  endangers the American people by stripping away the Constitution's  final safeguard against Presidents who abuse power and harm the Nation.  Such a President acts like a King, which the Founders were fighting  against. That is what they wrote out of the Constitution. A President  cannot be immune from oversight, accountability, and even simple  justice in the exercise of the powers entrusted to him.   We can't let that stand in this case. The President must forfeit the  powers that he has abused and be removed from office.   Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Mr. Chief Justice, distinguished Members of the  Senate, counsel for the President, my colleagues, the American people  who are assembled here today, I think we have our next break scheduled  for within the hour, and so I find myself in the unenviable position of  being the only thing standing between you and our dinner. But be not  discouraged because I am going to try to follow the advice of a former  Sunday school teacher of mine. I grew up in the Cornerstone Baptist  Church in Brooklyn. She said: Jeffries, on the question of public  presentations, be brief, be bright, and be gone.   And so I am going to try to do my best.   Presidents are required to comply with impeachment subpoenas. This  President has completely defied them. That conduct alone is a high  crime and misdemeanor.   The facts here are not really in dispute. President Trump's defense  appears to be: I can do whatever I want to do. Only I can fix it. I am  the chosen one.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         President TRUMP. Then I have an Article II, where I have       the right to do whatever I want as president. Nobody knows       the system better than me. Which is why I alone can fix it.       Somebody had to do it. I am the chosen one. Somebody had to       do it.    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Is that who we are as a democracy?   President Trump can't address the substance of our case. He therefore  complains about process, but these procedural complaints are baseless  excuses, and they do not justify his attempts to hide the truth from  Congress and from the American people.   The President's arguments fail for four simple reasons. First, the  House, not the President, has the ``sole Power of Impeachment'' and the  soul power ``to determine the Rules of its Proceedings.'' That is  article I, section 2, of the Constitution.   Second, President Trump's ``due process'' argument has no basis in  law, no basis in fact, no basis in the Constitution. President Trump  may not preemptively deny any and all cooperation to the House and then  assert that the House's procedures are illegitimate because they lack  his cooperation.   Third, President Trump's claim that he is being treated differently  completely lacks merit. Despite what he contends, the House provided  President Trump with greater protection than what was given to both  President Nixon and President Clinton. The fact  [[Page S556]]  that President Trump failed to take advantage of these procedural  protections does not mean they did not exist.   President Trump is not the first President to complain about House  procedures. He won't be the last. He is not the first one to challenge  the motives of any investigation or certainly an impeachment inquiry.  Such complaints are standard operating procedure from the article II  executive branch.   President Johnson, President Nixon, President Clinton had plenty of  complaints, but no President--no President, no President--has treated  such objections as a basis for withholding evidence, let alone  categorically defying every single subpoena--none--except Donald John  Trump.   Finally, the obligation to comply with an impeachment subpoena is  unyielding. It does not dissipate because the President believes House  committees should invite different witnesses, give his defenders  unfettered subpoena power, or involve his personal lawyers at the  deposition stage of the process, when that has never been done.   And if a President can defy Congress on such fragile grounds, then,  it is difficult to imagine why any future President would ever comply  with an impeachment or investigative subpoena again.   Now, throughout our history, impeachments have been rare, and the  Supreme Court has made clear that it is wary of intruding on matters of  impeachment. This, of course, leaves room for interbranch negotiation,  but it does not allow the President to engage in blanket defiance.   President Trump's objections are not genuinely rooted in the law.  They are not good-faith legal arguments. We know that because President  Trump said early on he would fight all subpoenas. We know that because  he declared the impeachment inquiry illegitimate before it even adopted  any procedures; we know that because he has denounced every single  effort to investigate him as a witch hunt; and we know that because he  never even claimed executive privilege during the entire impeachment  proceeding.    President Trump's first excuse for obstructing Congress is his  asserted belief that he did nothing wrong--that his July 25 call with  President Zelensky was ``perfect.''   In the October 8 letter sent by his Counsel, President Trump asserted  the prerogative to defy all House subpoenas because he has declared his  own innocence. As Mr. Cipollone put it, at President Trump's behest,  ``the President did nothing wrong,'' and ``there is no basis for an  impeachment inquiry.'' Yes, the White House Counsel includes this in a  formal letter to the House, defying every single subpoena.   As we have shown in our discussion of the first Article of  Impeachment, these claims of innocence are baseless. They lack merit.  We have provided overwhelming evidence of President Trump's guilt.   The President cannot unlawfully obstruct a House impeachment inquiry  because he sees no need to be investigated. One of the most sacred  principles of justice is that no man should be the judge in his own  case, and yet that is exactly what President Trump has been determined  to do. But this is America. He cannot be judge, jury, and executioner.  Moreover, the President cannot simply claim innocence and then walk  away from a constitutionally mandated process.   Even President Nixon did not do that, as we have previously  established. Congress has a constitutional responsibility to serve as a  check and balance on an out-of-control executive branch. Our  responsibility is not to this President; it is to the American people.   Blanket Presidential defiance would bring a swift halt to all  congressional oversight of the Executive. That principle would have  authorized categorical obstruction in the impeachments of President  Johnson, President Nixon, and President Clinton. In each of those  cases, the House was controlled by a different party than the  Presidency, and the President attacked those inquiries as partisan. Yet  those Presidents did not view their concerns with excessive  partisanship as a basis for defying every single subpoena.   The purpose of an impeachment inquiry is for the House to collect  evidence to determine, on behalf of the American people, whether the  President may have committed an impeachable offense because the  Constitution vests the House alone with the ``sole Power of  Impeachment.''   A President who serves as the judge of his own innocence is not  acting as a President. That is a dictator. That is a despot. That is  not democracy.   The President also believes, it appears, that blanket obstruction is  justified because the House did not expressly adopt a resolution  authorizing an impeachment inquiry or properly delegate such  investigatory powers to its committees.   The full House voted in January in advance of the inquiry to adopt  rules authorizing committees to conduct investigations, issue  subpoenas, gather documents, and hear testimony.   Beginning in the spring and summer of 2019, evidence came to light  that President Trump and his associates might have been seeking the  assistance of another foreign government, Ukraine, to influence the  upcoming 2020 election.   On September 9, the House investigating committees announced they  were launching a joint investigation. They requested records from the  White House and the Department of State. This investigation was  consistent with all rules approved by the full House. At the same time,  evidence emerged that the President may have attempted to cover up his  actions and prevent the transmission of a whistleblower complaint to  the Intelligence Committees of the Senate and the House.   Given the gravity of these allegations and the immediacy of the  threat to the next Presidential election, the Speaker of the House, a  constitutional officer, explicitly named in article I, announced on  September 24 that the House would begin a formal impeachment inquiry.  There is nothing in the Constitution, nothing in Federal law, nothing  in Supreme Court jurisprudence that required a formal vote at the time.   The President has put forth fake arguments about process because he  cannot defend the substance of these allegations.   Following the announcement of the impeachment inquiry, the House  investigating committees issued additional requests--and then  subpoenas--for documents and testimony. The committees ``made clear  that this information would be collected as part of the House's  impeachment inquiry and shared among the Committees, as well as with  the Committee on the Judiciary as appropriate.   Then, on October 31, the full House voted to approve H. Res. 660,  which directed the House committees to ``continue their ongoing  investigations as part of the existing . . . inquiry into whether  sufficient grounds exist for the House of Representatives to exercise  its Constitutional power to impeach Donald John Trump.''   In addition to affirming the ongoing House impeachment inquiry, H.  Res. 660 set forth procedures for open hearings in the Intelligence  Committee and for additional proceedings in the Judiciary Committee.   Every step in this process was fully consistent with the  Constitution, the rules of the House, and House precedent.   The House's autonomy to structure its own proceedings for an  impeachment inquiry is grounded in the Constitution. The President's  principal argument to the contrary is that no committee of the House is  permitted to investigate any Presidential misconduct until the full  House acted.   As a Federal district court recently confirmed, the notion that a  full House vote is required to authorize an impeachment inquiry ``has  no textual support in the U.S. Constitution [or] the governing rules of  the House.''   The investigations into misconduct by Presidents Andrew Johnson,  Nixon, and Clinton all began prior to the House's consideration and  approval of a resolution authorizing the investigations.   Recently, under Republican control, the Judiciary Committee  considered the impeachment of the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue  Service following a referral from another committee and absent a full  vote of the House for an impeachment inquiry.   There is no merit to President Trump's argument that the full House  [[Page S557]]  had to vote. The sequence of events in this particular case largely  tracks those in the Nixon proceedings. There, the House Judiciary's  proceedings began in October of 1973, when resolutions calling for  President Nixon's impeachment were introduced in the House and referred  to the Judiciary Committee.   Over the next several months, the committee investigated the  Watergate break-in and coverup, among other matters, using its existing  investigatory authorities. The committee also hired a special counsel  and other attorneys to assist in these efforts. Most importantly, all  of this occurred before the House approved a resolution directing the  Judiciary Committee to investigate whether grounds to impeach Richard  Nixon existed.   In this instance, the committees began the investigation with their  existing powers authorized by the full House. That course of events is  entirely consistent with the Richard Nixon precedent. It is also common  sense. After all, before voting to conduct an impeachment inquiry, the  House must ascertain the nature and seriousness of the allegations and  the scope of the inquiry that may follow their actions.   President Trump's second excuse also fails. Let's now address the  President's so-called due process and fairness argument. The President  has phrased his complaints in the language of ``due process.'' He has  complained that the procedures were not fair, even though they reflect  prior practice and strike a reasonable balance between Presidential  involvement on the one hand and the House's obligation to find the  truth on the other.   Presidents come and Presidents go. They have all sharply criticized  House procedures, but no President has ever treated those objections as  a basis for complete defiance. No President has ever done that.   In the context of a House impeachment inquiry, it is fair to say that  the President is a suspect--a suspect who may have committed a high  crime or misdemeanor. He cannot tell the detectives investigating the  possible constitutional crime what they should do in the context of  their investigation.   In the President's October 8 letter, Mr. Cipollone complains that he  was denied ``the most basic protections demanded by due process under  the Constitution and by fundamental fairness,'' including ``the right  to cross-examine witnesses, to call witnesses, to receive transcripts  of testimony, to have access to evidence,'' and ``to have counsel  present.''   It sounds terrible, but it is not accurate.   The President appears to have mistaken the initial phases of the  impeachment inquiry for a full-blown trial. The trial phase of the  impeachment inquiry is taking place right now.   Chairman Peter Rodino of the Judiciary Committee once observed, as it  related to the impeachment proceedings against President Nixon, that  ``it is not a right but a privilege or a courtesy'' for the President  to participate through counsel.   An impeachment inquiry is not a trial; rather, it entails a  collection and evaluation of facts before a trial occurs. In that  respect, the House acts like a grand jury or a prosecutor investigating  the evidence to determine whether charges are warranted or not. Federal  grand juries and prosecutors do not allow targets of their  investigation to coordinate witness testimony. The protections that the  President labeled as ``due process'' do not apply here because those  entitlements that he sought, many of which were actually afforded to  him--but those entitlements that he sought would not necessarily be  available to any American in a grand jury investigation.   Moreover, it should be clear that the House, notwithstanding this  framework, has typically provided a level of transparency in  impeachment inquiries, particularly as it relates to Presidents.   In past impeachment inquiries, this has typically meant that the  principal evidence relied upon by the House Judiciary Committee is  disclosed to the President and to the public, though some evidence in  past proceedings has actually remained confidential.   The President has typically been given an opportunity to participate  in the proceedings at a stage when evidence has been fully gathered and  is presented to the Judiciary Committee. President Trump was given the  chance to do that in this case, but he declined.   Presidents have been entitled to present evidence that is relevant to  the inquiry and to request that relevant witnesses be called. President  Trump was given the chance to do that in the House impeachment inquiry  before the Judiciary Committee, but he declined.    Under H. Res. 660, President Trump received procedural protections  not just equal to but in some instances greater than that afforded to  Presidents Nixon and Clinton. So let's be clear. The privileges  described in the October 8 letter were in fact offered to President  Trump as they had been in prior impeachment inquiries. The President  was able to review all evidence relied on by the House investigating  committees, including evidence that the minority's public report  identified as favorable to President Trump.   During the Judiciary Committee proceedings, the President had  opportunities to present evidence, call witnesses, have counsel present  to raise objections, cross-examine witnesses, and respond to the  evidence raised against him.   As the Rules Committee report accompanying H. Res. 660 noted, these  privileges are ``commensurate with the inquiry process followed in the  cases of'' Nixon and Clinton. President Trump simply chose not to avail  himself of what had been afforded to him.   The fact that President Trump declined to take advantage of these  protections does not excuse his blanket, unconstitutional obstruction.  Unlike the Nixon and Clinton impeachments, in this particular instance,  the argument that the President has made--the argument that he has made  as it relates to the investigative process--is not analogous.   In this case, the House conducted a significant portion of the  factual investigation itself because no independent prosecutor was  appointed to investigate the allegations of wrongdoing against  President Trump. Attorney General William Barr refused to authorize a  criminal investigation into the serious allegations of misconduct  against the President. They tried to whitewash the whole sordid affair.  Left to their own devices, the House investigating committees followed  standard best practices for investigations, consistent with the law  enforcement investigation into Presidents Nixon and Clinton, in advance  of their impeachments.   The committees released transcripts of all interviews and depositions  conducted during the investigation. During the investigation, more than  100 Members of the House participated in the so-called closed-door  proceedings--more than 100 Members of the House, 47 of whom were  Republicans. They all had the opportunity to ask questions. They all  had the opportunity to ask questions with equal time.   The Intelligence Committee held public hearings with 12 of the key  witnesses testifying, including several requested by the House  Republicans. It is important to note that the very same procedures in  H. Res. 660 were supported by Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick  Mulvaney when he served as a member of the Oversight Committee and by  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo when he served as a member of the Select  Committee on Benghazi.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)
