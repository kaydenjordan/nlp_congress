 Mr. Speaker, I would like to address the current  situation in what used to be called the Gaza Strip.   I believe looking at American polls prior to the invasion that took  place in October, there were too many segments of the American  population who--insofar as there were disagreements between, I guess,  what we will call Gaza and the State of Israel or Palestinians in the  State of Israel--sided with the Palestinians. They felt somehow Israel  was doing something wrong.   I still run into some of these people when I go back to my office  across from the Capitol building because sometimes they are out there  protesting or making some sort of a case.   I believe that all Americans should realize that--until what they did  to themselves about a month and a half ago--that the people in the Gaza  strip were fortunate to belong in an area right adjacent to Israel  proper.   First of all, in that part of the world, there is probably nowhere  where you would want to live more than Israel.   As far as basic freedoms, which we take for granted in the United  States, those freedoms are available to people living in Israel, and  the freedoms, to a large extent, came from a Western culture which was  brought to that part of the world as Jews moved there from other areas  around the Middle East and from Europe beginning before World War II.   Indeed, that land was largely a wasteland. It is interesting to read  Mark Twain's comments when he toured that part of the world. It was  largely a wasteland until the great Jewish migration.   At that time, it not only eventually benefited the Jewish people who  came to Israel from Europe, but it benefited the Arabs, as well.   Indeed, between about the year 1900 and right prior to World War II,  as the number of Jewish people in that area went up from about 100,000  to 600,000, the number of Arabs in that area moved up from 600,000 to  1.3 million people.   In other words, Arabs from the other areas around Israel, as more  people moved there from Europe, they moved there as well to take  advantage of the economic opportunity that became available as more  Westernized people moved in there, and that continues to this day.   I don't think it is reported enough in the press that many people  from Gaza who were working worked in Israel, and the economic  opportunities in Israel were far greater than the economic  opportunities in Gaza.   Indeed, I believe something like a person who left Gaza to work in  Israel may be making four times as much than if they tried to stay in  Gaza and work for the employers in Gaza. Again, they are very fortunate  that Israel was right next door.  [[Page H6077]]                                     time  1315    Now, why is Gaza not well off in other ways? Because they are getting  huge amounts of aid from around the world, and particularly aid from  European countries.   Well, the problem is that the people they have elected, Hamas, grabs  that money. There are people who are billionaires, not because they  have done anything worthwhile or thought of a new way of doing  something or opened a chain of hotels or whatever, the people who are  connected with Hamas have become billionaires, taking money off the top  that comes from the very poor people who are living in the Gaza Strip.   Indeed, they not only take the money and skim the money off the top,  but they then don't recycle the money in the Gaza Strip. They live in  Qatar, or maybe they live in Turkiye. This is what Hamas does to the  local people.   By the way, I think if you look around the globe, the biggest  difference between the prosperous countries and the not prosperous  countries, is are the people that are running the not prosperous  countries, are they siphoning off the money themselves?   In other words, we have a crooked government.   Nobody could not say that when left to their own devices, the Gazans  have elected themselves, Hamas, I guess I would say, a very crooked  government, which insofar as they don't have as much money as they  would like, it is caused by who they have elected themselves.   Remember, I think there is some feeling out there that Hamas is this  fringe group that happens to be running Gaza. Hamas was elected  overwhelmingly by the Gazans.   Now, we can feel sorry for people that make such a stupid choice but  we also have to say that you are guilty, to a certain extent, by  electing such people.   Another indication of how lucky you would think people should be for  being in that part of the world, in a region on the beautiful  Mediterranean Sea, is that the people from all around the globe are  coming not just to be next to Israel, but to be right in Israel.   One of the things that surprised me, as you read about what is going  on, is that apparently some of the hostages were from Thailand. I  thought, why in the world are hostages from Thailand being grabbed by  these horrible Hamas militants?   Well, I looked into it. People, particularly from Thailand or  Philippines but sometimes from other places as well, are coming from  halfway around the globe to live in Israel.   Now, ask yourself that. I assume that these people from Thailand or  Philippines are not Jewish, but, nevertheless, things are so good in  Israel that people come from halfway around the globe, from Philippines  and Thailand, to work and live in Israel.   If you know anybody who says how horrible it is and how the Israelis  are picking on these people, ask them: If it is so bad there, why do  these people come from all over the globe to work there?   Another point to be made, Gaza is not the freest country in the  world, but they live next to Israel, which probably has as many  freedoms as anywhere else in the world, as far as freedom of speech,  freedom of religion; things are about as open as they can be, which is  another benefit. They have an example of a modern western state right  next door.   The next thing I think the public should consider as far as these  poor people on the Gaza Strip, is apparently no one else in that part  of the world will take them.   I mean, there are all sorts of people who feign interest in them, who  feign sympathy toward them. How many of these people are being invited  into, say, Qatar, a Muslim country, in that part of the world that  presumably needs people to do work.   I have a feeling there are a lot of people in Qatar from Asia as well  doing the work. Why don't the Qataris say, oh, you are wonderful  people. Why don't you come to our country?   What do the Egyptians think? The Egyptians are right next door.   If this is such a sympathetic group of people, why don't the  Egyptians say: Come here, we can easily take another 1 to 1.5 million  people in Egypt. We can even take over that part of the world.   You don't hear that from the Egyptians or from any of the other  Muslim countries in the region.   You don't hear Turkiye saying we want these people.   You don't hear Syria saying we want these people.   You don't hear Iran, who is funneling some of the money toward this  terrorism, you don't hear them saying we want these people.   So before you have too much sympathy for this group--and I guess we  can have sympathy for all human beings--you have to ask yourselves, why  do none of these other Arab-Muslim countries in that part of the world,  or in the case of Iran, a Muslim country, why aren't they taking them?   Mr. Speaker, I ask the American people who are out there, the  demonstrators and such, before saying how horrible things are for the  people in Gaza, look at the history. Look and see the benefits that  these people are getting from living next to Israel. Look and see the  number of Arabs who moved to what is today the Gaza Strip, or Israel as  a whole, moved there from other parts of the Middle East after--not  before--but after the big Jewish migration that took place in the first  half of the last century.                Illegal Immigration Across Our Southern Border     Mr. Speaker, the next issue I think is the most  important issue facing the United States today, and that is the illegal  immigration across our southern border.   We have new numbers that came out for October. Again, we hit records,  as far as the number of encounters, of people coming across the  southern border.   The most recent number shows 241,000 encounters at that border, up  from 1 year ago at 231,000; up from 2 years ago at 164,000; up from 3  years ago at 72,000 when we had a different President.   So again, we hit records on the number of people who are coming here.    We have 71,000, what they call got-aways, which are people who come  across the border and do not check in with the Border Patrol.   Most people who come across the border ask for asylum. They don't  need asylum but at least they ask for it, and there is a perfunctory  check on things.   We hit another near high of almost 62,000 got-aways who won't even  check in and ask for asylum crossing the southern border.   This is a disaster waiting to happen. You are permanently changing  America. Our forefathers anticipated that America be a country for a  moral and religious people. We have no idea what the background of  these people is.   Are they going to stand with our Constitution?   Do they understand the natural ideal that our forefathers wanted  independent people coming here, not people who would view the  government as giving something to them?   So I would hope that the press--it is still not too late--think about  running a banner headline rather than focusing on some of the less- important issues around here to educate the American public. We, again,  are getting record numbers in our country.   By the way, when you look at migrants who stay here--not just  encounters, but who stay here--they are estimating 235,000 in October;  1 year ago, it was 178,000.   So what is that? That is about a 35-percent increase over the last  year. Doesn't that merit a banner headline given that Joe Biden isn't  hardly kicking anybody out?   After Joe Biden became President 2 years ago, that number was over  100,000; 3 years ago, at the end of President Trump's term, it was  about 19,000.   So from 3 years ago in October when we had a different  administration, we have gone up by about a factor of 12. Think about  that; 12 times as many people crossing the border in October 2023  compared to October 2020.   Mr. Speaker, America had better wake up or we are going to lose this  country. People back home tell me that we must let some immigrants in  here; we are a country of immigrants.   I attended a ceremony in Milwaukee of over 250 people, in one day, in  one city, who were sworn in to be new citizens. We are now swearing in  over 1 million people a year that do things right, that are vetted,  that we know are not breaking the law, that almost always have jobs;  sometimes they have opened a business by themselves.  [[Page H6078]]    It is not like America is saying you could never get into America or  we are so xenophobic, that we are no longer a country of immigrants.  No. We have over 1 million people every year coming here, that are  sworn in. That is not including children who are born here to parents  who are non-immigrants. Right now our government wrongly is saying that  if you are born in this country, you are automatically an American  citizen.   It is also not counting the tens of thousands of people who are on  visas that have expired. So we are flooding America with new people.   America, again, has to remember, and I want to repeat those figures  one more time, in this October compared to three Octobers ago, we have  about 12 times as many people coming into this country and being let in  across the southern border than were in that short time period ago. I  encourage America to wake up.                             Appropriations Bills     Mr. Speaker, one more issue I would address so that the  American public is aware, is that when we put together what I think a  normal person would refer to our budget, we try to break it into 12  different parts, which we call appropriations bills.   The Senate has an appropriations bill--we are trying to get them to  break things up--and the House has separate appropriations bills, and  then negotiations take place between the House and the Senate to see  what the new law will be.   Now, there are a variety of the things that the press should be  paying attention to in these bills. A lot of things are details with  regard to spending.   We have to remember that right now we are borrowing about 22 percent  of our budget. I hope all Americans are paying attention as debates are  being had over every item in these appropriations bills, as to whether  we are spending more or spending less.   Remember, the reason we have these high interest rates, which are  making it almost impossible for young people to buy a house, is because  of inflation, which comes from excessive spending. That is one thing  for people to look up.   The thing I want to address today is that in almost every one of  these bills there are efforts being made to increase the number of  bureaucrats who are involved in diversity.   In other words, people are going to get into these agencies, and  rather than doing something productive, they are going to stick their  nose in and say when we hire somebody, when we promote somebody, when  we fire somebody, whether we give somebody a grant or not, one of the  things to look at is that person's ethnic background.   This is an incredibly divisive thing to do. These people add  nothing--by the people, I mean the diversity bureaucrats--add nothing  to the wealth of our country, but they do create divisiveness because  they begin to cause people to view themselves not as Americans first,  but they begin to say: What are you going to give me because my  ancestors are from Africa? What are you going to give me because my  ancestors are from Southeast Asia? What are you going to give me  because my ancestors are from India? What are you going to give me  because my ancestors are from Bolivia?   That is a very dangerous thing to do. Also, this is something that is  going to result in kind of lower standards, because rather than just  saying we are going to hire the best person for the job, you begin to  look at people's ancestry.   There are going to have to be debates on every one of these 12 bills  in which we say, are we going to let new committees into these bills?  Are we going to let new bureaucrats into these bills who use their  power to judge people solely by ancestry?    I hope that, again, our press corps, which is sometimes missing the  boat on these issues--and in there, I will even include the  conservative press corps--I hope that they pay attention as each one of  these bills move forward.   Since now is the time of year when we appropriate money, in other  words, now is the time of the year when we spend money, are we going to  allow an increase or any of these diversity bureaucrats to be hired?   Nowadays, you are getting college degrees and these sorts of things  saying I want to spend my whole life trying to divide people and trying  to cause Americans to view themselves as an ethnic group; an ethnic  group from a country where not only their parents or grandparents or  maybe even great-grandparents have never stepped foot in.   I talked about Bolivia. Are they going to identify as Bolivian, even  though they may have never seen Bolivia, their parents never saw  Bolivia, their grandparents never saw Bolivia, or even though they have  never spoken a word of Spanish? Maybe they think it is important that  they be part of this agency so they can bring a Latin-American  viewpoint to this agency or represent other Latin Americans. It is just  a completely ridiculous idea.                                time  1330    That idea is taking root. I think the only reason I would push it is  if I wanted to destroy America, if I wanted Americans to turn to a  fight between each other or a contest between each other, which is sure  to end in the weakening of America.   Again, we ask the press corps to pay attention as each one of these  appropriation bills moves forward and educate the American public,  which is what the press corps should be doing, educating the American  public on the degree to which we are hiring more people to judge new  hires, promotions, and grants or government contracting, who gets the  contract based on their ancestry.   Those are three new issues that I hope the press covers.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the remainder of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 1 o'clock and 31 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until Monday,  December 4, 2023, at noon for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
