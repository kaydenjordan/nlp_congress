 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, for weeks now, almost daily, I have  spoken about the need to get our appropriations process back on track  and the need for bipartisan agreement to fund the Federal Government  and, particularly, to provide our military commanders with the  resources and stability they need.   That kind of smooth process was exactly what Congress was on track  for just a few months ago. Leaders in both parties, in both Houses, and  at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue signed onto a deal that set top- line funding levels and ruled out obstacles like poison pills. Alas, as  I have discussed at length, policy riders crept back into the process,  and our discussions stalled. As a result, here we are again--behind  schedule.   We need to get results on appropriations before the end of the year.  So, while the House and the Senate continue negotiations on setting the  allocations, we need to buy more time. The House and the Senate need to  pass a continuing resolution to fund the government through December 20  and allow these talks to continue. The Senate can't originate this  funding bill, but we will wait to receive legislation from the House  and then vote on it before we head back to our home States.   This is what we need: a CR, as clean as possible, through December 20  to enable more progress on appropriations before the end of this year.  A clean CR through December 20 would pass the Senate, and the White  House has indicated that President Trump would sign it. Let me say that  again. The administration indicates the President is willing and ready  to sign a clean CR through December 20 so that we can finish our work.   This is our opportunity to get a bipartisan process back on track.  First, with bipartisan, bicameral cooperation, we can safely fund the  Federal Government through mid-December so talks can continue. Then,  with more cooperation, we can reach agreement on allocations and pass  as many of the 12 appropriations bills as possible before the end of  the year.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now, on another matter, while we wait  on the House, the Senate will take the opportunity to consider three  more of President Trump's well-qualified nominees to the Federal bench  and the diplomatic corps.   Later today, we will vote to advance the nomination of Justice Robert  [[Page S6616]]  Luck, of Florida--the President's impressive nominee--to be a U.S.  circuit judge for the 11th Circuit. Then we will consider Justice  Barbara Lagoa, who has also been nominated to the 11th Circuit. Both  are impressive nominees who have sterling qualifications--two more fine  choices by President Trump. Finally, the Senate will turn its attention  to the diplomatic corps and confirm Adrian Zuckerman, of New Jersey, to  serve as the Ambassador to Romania.   I hope each of my colleagues will join me in supporting all three  confirmations as the Senate continues to give the American people the  government for which they voted.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on a final matter, in the last few  days, the reports and images coming out of Hong Kong have become even  more disturbing. The police crackdown on Hongkongers who are standing  up for their freedom and their region's autonomy has intensified.   University campuses now literally look like war zones, with  government forces laying siege to groups of students and other  protesters. Many observers feel the situation may be verging on  something truly terrible. In the midst of this crackdown, just today,  Hong Kong's High Court ruled against the executive and actually in  favor of the protesters' rights--yet another signal it is the  government that is acting beyond the bounds of its authorities.   This latest escalation against Hongkongers comes as Beijing faces  international fallout from leaked documents that delineate the  government's chilling, systematic campaign against ethnic minorities in  another supposedly autonomous region, Xinjiang--hundreds of pages of  internal documents from the Chinese Communist Party government. It is a  handbook for this Orwellian campaign to effectively erase a religious  and ethnic minority in a region that, again, is supposed to be legally  distinct from the rest of China. This effort is being conducted using  ``organs of dictatorship'' and ``absolutely no mercy.''   The protesters are not the problem. It is Beijing and the Hong Kong  leadership that must deescalate. The Communist Party must know it will  hurt them catastrophically if it turns Hong Kong into some 21st century  version of Tiananmen Square. The United States would not forget it, and  neither would China's other trading partners all across the world.   So what can the United States do?   In September, I worked to add language to the State and Foreign  Operations appropriations bill to modify the reporting requirements of  the 1992 Hong Kong Policy Act, which, by the way, was my bill back in  1992. My additions would work to expose the current tools the Chinese  Communist government is using to subvert the autonomy of Hong Kong and  to allow the U.S. Government to pay for the legal support for Hong  Kong's democracy activists.   One important step to help Hong Kong is for the House and Senate  Democrats to finally get to ``yes'' on the appropriations process.   Last week, I had a productive meeting with the senior Senator from  Florida on the subject of revising and extending the Hong Kong Policy  Act through new legislation. As I indicated, I authored the original  bill back in 1992 and have been keenly interested in Hong Kong's status  for decades. So I appreciate the leadership Senator Rubio and others  have shown and hope we can find a way to move this important bill. Yet,  while I support additional legislation, the United States does not need  to wait for new laws to act further. There are already significant  tools at the administration's disposal, and I strongly encourage them  to use them.   I have been encouraged to hear clear statements on China from key  members of President Trump's team in recent months. I would encourage  this President, who has seen Chinese behavior for what it is with a  clarity that others have lacked, not to shy away from speaking out on  Hong Kong himself. The world should hear from him directly that the  United States stands with these brave men and women.   This administration has rightly understood what prior administrations  have entirely missed. The old consensus was that economic modernization  in China would automatically import our values of freedom and human  dignity into their society. Now, every day reminds us that this simply  has not happened. Instead, Beijing is using modern technology it has  obtained through integration with the West to further its political and  social control over its own population and expand China's reach beyond  its shores.   So, rather than focusing solely on trade, I encourage the  administration to make Hong Kong's autonomy a key topic within our  bilateral diplomacy. The administration should also take advantage of  the tools Congress has already provided in Global Magnitsky to target  the individuals who are responsible for egregious human rights abuses.  In Xinjiang and Hong Kong, the world is seeing the true face of the  Communist Party of China.   The United States has a role to play in standing up for the universal  principles of human rights, and I am confident we will fulfill it. Yet  our allies and partners must also ask themselves whether they are  prepared to live in a world that is being increasingly shaped by those  who show absolutely no mercy to religious and ethnic minorities and who  confront peaceful protest with violence.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I have 2 requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of  the Majority and Minority leaders.   Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committees are authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:           Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs    The Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs is  authorized to meet during the session of the Senate on Monday, November  18, 2019, at 5:40 a.m., to conduct a hearing on the nomination of Peter  Gaynor, of Rhode Island, to be Administrator of the Federal Emergency  Management Agency, Department of Homeland Security.

Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:28 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, November 19, 2019, at 10 a.m.
