 Mr. President, I object.    Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive all applicable  sections of that act and any other applicable budget points of order  for the purpose of the pending bill, and I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  allowed to finish my remarks prior to the scheduled vote.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about  the legislation before us and how it is an investment today for jobs  tomorrow.   And I want to thank my colleague from Mississippi for his partnership  on this legislation. It seems like a century ago that we had a markup  in committee and passed this out--the science portion, which we are now  voting on--24 to 4, more than a year ago. And yet here we are today, on  the product of much negotiation, not just in our committee but in eight  other committees--seven other committees.   We are here because we know that innovation is in the DNA of  Americans, and we know that it helped us win the world wars; it helped  us cure disease. We know it has helped create millions of jobs, and it  has helped members of the business community on opposite sides of a  phone call or an email connect to each other to get a product or a  service.   So this bill embraces American innovation and our tradition of it,  and I, too, encourage a ``yes'' vote.   After watching the COVID crisis mangle our supply chain and see  semiconductors be a big part of inflation, the shortage of  semiconductors has increased the cost of a used car by more than 40  percent, putting it out of reach of many families at a time when they  just needed a car to drive to work.   So this bill is about making sure that we face our manufacturing  challenges here at home and that we train and skill the scientists and  the workers to get that done.   And so thanks start with Senators Schumer and Young for their hard  work in introducing this legislation more than 2 years ago. Senator  Schumer's great work with Senator Young on this was an eye-opening  change in the way that we make investments in R&D. It was a concept  novel then, but I think we have a lot of understanding of it now, and  that is to move our R&D into faster translation into products and  services. Why? Because the rest of the world is doing that and we need  to hurry as well.   I also want to just point out that there are lots of contributions  from Members in this bill: Senator Peters on AI scholarships, Senator  Cortez Masto on national science technology strategy, Senator Rosen on  critical minerals, Senator Sinema on our NASA authorization, Senator  Warnock on semiconductor supply chains, Senators Brown and Coons on  Manufacturing USA Institutes, Senator Ossoff on cyber security  education grants, Senator Menendez on supply chain issues. So many,  many things in this legislation were contributed by many different  Members through a regular order process.   But let's get specific about it. There are about five or six things  in this bill that really matter to our Nation at this critical moment.   First is a new mission at the National Science Foundation. That new  mission is different because the National Science Foundation has been  focused on basic research. So we are creating, for the first time, in a  $20 billion investment over 5 years, the focus for that new mission at  NSF to say that they have to focus on translating that science into  faster discoveries in products and solutions that will help U.S.  manufacturing here at home.   And while the United States has excelled at basic research, we have  allowed other countries to excel at translational research, and that  needs to stop now.   We need to make the investment in industries from aerospace to  pharmaceuticals, to farming, to information technologies that will help  increase the pace of innovation here in the United States of America.   Second, we say that NSF is not alone in its mission. We recognize  that the Department of Energy also has a key role to play in  translational science.   I want to thank the Presiding Officer, Senator Lujan, for his  contribution of a $16.9 billion DOE investment that doubles down on the  current work in key technology areas that we also have to do faster  translational science to scale up in cutting edge energy R&D. This was  a very large portion of the energy innovation that was funded in this  bill.   This legislation also includes a 5-year, $50 billion, first-ever  reauthorization of the Department of Energy Office of Science. And I  want to thank Senators Manchin and Barrasso for working on this and its  inclusion in this.   Combining these investments will go a long way in reversing the  decline in Federal R&D that has dropped three-fold since 1978. We need  to improve U.S. competitiveness, but we are only going to do it by  investing today for those jobs tomorrow.   Third, the bill also says that we need to be smarter at how we make  our investments. Now, I would say I represent a tech hub. It is already  in existence. It took 30-plus years to create. There are places like  Seattle, San Jose, San Francisco, Boston, and San Diego that you could  say are tech hubs. They account for 90 percent of the growth in  innovation sectors between the years 2005 and 2017. But is that all we  are going to do in the United States of America, allow innovation to  just continue to be more and more expensive because it is only produced  in those areas?   I am a firm believer in distributed generation, whether that is  electricity or whether that is innovation. And the more dispersed the  innovation is, you never know where the next Bill Gates or Bill Boeing  is going to be from and what innovation they might come up with.   So this bill also has a new mission in the Department of Commerce in  technology hubs, where it will focus on trying to foster new  collaboration between  [[Page S3714]]  universities, businesses, labor, and local government to accelerate  economic growth and opportunity in innovation. These tech hubs will  focus on the key technology areas that are in this bill and help us  move faster at innovation.   I want to thank my colleague Senator Tester, from Montana, who is a  very big advocate in making sure that there was geographic diversity to  the tech hubs. And we know that while we want to grow more technology  advancement in the United States, that we also want to see it not just  in Seattle, but in places like Spokane or Indianapolis or West Virginia  or Wichita.   We also increase in this Act the Manufacturing Extension  Partnerships. During the pandemic, we saw that many companies could not  survive without supplies that were no longer available to them. And we  know that with the manufacturing extension ecosystem, that we have to  stay competitive by innovating. This bill delivers $76 billion over 10  years to develop the next generation of chips and to reestablish chip  manufacturing in the United States.   Now I know my colleague from Vermont and my colleague from Florida  and many others have criticized this part of the legislation. I know  that they think that this is somehow--I wish, trust me, I wish that--I  would probably agree more with the Senator of Vermont on the  prioritization within our budget on the various things that will help  American families. But we can't ignore that chip production has gone  overseas and that the United States has lost its share of that  production to the point that we are now down to as little as 12  percent--or could go to 12 percent, at which point, who wants to  manufacture when the ecosystem is somewhere else? We know that just  last year alone, chip shortages cost the U.S. economy $240 billion.  That is the automobile industry that didn't have chips; that is part of  the electronics industry that didn't have chips. You can say it is even  in the cost of every product that you buy because we certainly didn't  produce the transportation system to even move products throughout the  United States in companies like PACCAR that are from the Northwest,  because they too did not have chips to put into their trailers to move  products across the United States. So we know that with every dollar of  chip R&D investment, that increases GDP gains by $16.50.   So I know my colleagues would like us to make other investments, but  I would say that chips are just as essential as wheat is in America.  People think about our farm investments and with no hesitation say:  Let's make sure that we keep wheat production in the United States of  America. I guarantee you, chips are no less important. And we have to  have an increase in the United States, or we are going to continue to  fall behind on national security issues and on economic development  issues that are so critical.   We also, in this legislation, make one of the most significant  investments in STEM over the last many years. It puts $13 billion into  science, technology, engineering, and mathematics workforce  development. It creates $2 billion to minority-serving institutions,  including Native American institutions, to encourage their research and  innovation.    And I want to thank Senator Wicker for his leadership on the F-score  provision, probably one of the more hotly debated conversations between  our colleagues here in the Senate and in the House. But I would say to  my colleagues, this is about innovation everywhere. This is about  growing opportunity everywhere. And that is exactly what we are saying  with F-score. You never know what the next innovation is going to  bring.   So these key provisions, from diversifying our investment in  education and job training, from making investments in tech hubs, to  the investment in R&D by both DOD and NSF through faster translational  science, we are improving the ecosystem that we have in the United  States of America. This ecosystem has been built over a long period of  time. It represents competing and collaborating organizations. That is  what the strength of our R&D is.   So I want to thank Senators Schumer and Young, Senators Cornyn and  Kelly, and many other people who helped introduce and move this  legislation. I want to thank Senator Warner for his contributions and  thank, again, Senator Wicker and his team for the many advances in this  legislation. I also would be remiss if I didn't thank retiring Chair  Eddie Bernice Johnson and Ranking Member Frank Lucas who worked hard to  craft the legislation before us.   I want to thank on my staff: Lila Helms, Melissa Porter, Mary  Guenther, Amit Ronen, Stacy Baird, Nikki Teutschel, Christi Barnhart,  Jonny Pellish, Rosemary Baize, Erica Holman, and Emma Stohlman for  their help; and on Senator Wicker's staff, as he already mentioned,  James Mazol and many other people. I want to thank on Senator Schumer's  staff Jon Cardinal, Mike Kuiken, and Meghan Taira for their hard work.  But no one deserves more focus and attention than Richard-Duane  Chambers from my staff, who literally worked on the last COMPETES bill  and then worked at DARPA, so clearly knows seriously the challenges  that we faced in getting this legislation done and getting it over the  goal line.   So I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. We  don't know exactly what innovations will come out of this, but we do  know this: America will be more competitive because of it. And we do  know this: that we will be able to grow our economy for the future  because of the investments that we have made today.   I yield the floor.
