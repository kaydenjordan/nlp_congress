 Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member for yielding.   Mr. Chair, I have supported every National Defense Authorization Act  since I arrived in Congress 11 years ago.   Unfortunately, in its current form, I rise in opposition to H.R.  2500, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020.   This bill does a number of good things. Notably, it includes an  authorization of 11 ships, it reaffirms congressional support for  midlife refueling of the USS John C. Stennis, it robustly supports the  merchant marine with the reauthorization of the Maritime Security  Program, and it provides for a new tanker security program that our  services need.   In summary, the bill did a good job with the resources that were  provided.   However, due to the decrement of $15 billion from the President's  budget request, the bill imposed the limitations on low-yield nuclear  weapons, restrictions on the President's request to secure the border,  and an entirely avoidable failure to adequately restrict the 9/11  detainees. All of these issues led me to oppose final passage of the  NDAA in committee.   In the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, the reduction of  $15 billion will lead to delay in the construction of the next Ford- class aircraft carrier by 1 year, eliminate a replenishment ship,  reduce the Navy's innovation by limiting development of unmanned  surface vessels, and restrict critical development of anti-mine warfare  programs.                                time  1730    Additionally, this top-line reduction limited our subcommittee's  flexibility to address critical shortfalls in amphibious ships and  weapons. Simply put, we can do better.   While I am concerned about the entirety of this current bill, I am  not concerned about the bipartisan nature of our subcommittee. I want  to specifically thank Chairman Courtney and his team for their  extraordinary effort and their leadership toward a bipartisan  subcommittee mark. He did extraordinary work reaching across the aisle  and getting everybody's thoughts and ideas about what should be in the  subcommittee mark, something that should also be part of every  continuing effort subsequently. I have no doubt in his support for our  national security, and I appreciate his dedication and passion for this  effort.   In the end, I am hopeful that our amendment debate in the following  days will serve to make our bill a stronger, bipartisan bill. But in  its current form, I urge my colleagues to oppose final passage.
