 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this amendment that would  allow a small number of special immigrant visas to the world's top  scientists and technical experts selected by the Secretary of Defense.  I trust the Secretary of Defense looking out after the Nation's  security interests, and it is important that our security depends on  having access to the top scientists in the world who are committed to  the success of our country.   We need to take bold action to make sure that we educate and train  our American people to be the best scientists they can be. But that  doesn't mean that every smart person who loves America was born in  America. In fact, some of the most patriotic people I have ever met  were immigrants who came here and became Americans by choice.   It is absolutely clear that nations that attract and retain highly- skilled innovators gain a competitive advantage, and we can help do  that for America through this very thoughtful plan. For us, the promise  of the American Dream remains a powerful draw for the world's  innovators.   This amendment would move us in the right direction and help ensure  that America, and not our competitors, benefits from the world's best  minds.   I want to thank Mr. Langevin for this smart amendment, and I urge its  adoption.
