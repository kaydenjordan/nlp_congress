 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate a group of  young men who had an excellent undefeated season at LSU and won the  national championship.   I also rise to congratulate Coach Orgeron for his leadership in  shaping not only those young men on the field, but off the field also.   I also take great pride, Mr. Speaker, in recognizing one outstanding  individual on that team, his name is Grant Delpit.   Grant Delpit was my first batboy at the congressional baseball game.  Last year he was the unanimous All-American, and this year he caused a  fumble in the national championship game. But more importantly, his  parents, a lawyer, law enforcement, and his grandmother serves on the  board of a charter school in my district. They are an exceptional  family.   Mr. Speaker, we have a commitment that when we see our young people  doing well that we recognize them and congratulate them. So, to all of  the outstanding young men at LSU for winning the national championship,  and to Grant Delpit for excelling in the classroom, off and on the  field, I just want to say congratulations, we recognize you. And good  luck in whatever you do in your future.                            ____________________
