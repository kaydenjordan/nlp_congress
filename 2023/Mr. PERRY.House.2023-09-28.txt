 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk as the designee  of the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Biggs).    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment, which  eliminates $230,599,000--a lot of money whether you are in Arizona,  Pennsylvania, or Washington, D.C.--in funding to the U.S. Agency for  International Development, funds appropriated to the President capital  investment fund.   I once again bring up the amendment to address the massive spending  that is appropriated to USAID. The capital investment fund is for  expenses for overseas construction and related costs and for the  procurement and enhancement of information technology and related  capital investments.   We all want a new office. We all want a new computer. We all want a  new phone. We have massive debt right now. We are going to run $2.2  trillion behind this year alone.   I don't know who at home when they can't pay their bills, when they  are literally borrowing money from their enemy, goes out and spends  more.   We are not even talking about spending more on our own home or our  own phone or our own computer. We are talking about spending more on  somebody else's and, quite honestly, in many cases in places where they  don't even like America.   Mr. Chairman, our country is now $33 trillion in debt. How in good  conscience can we continue with this spending?   This is the time to invest in the United States of America and our  constituents who are struggling to pay for their groceries, to pay for  gasoline, to pay for their ever-rising electricity bill, and it is  going to keep on rising.   Your gas prices are going to keep going up, and so are your food  prices because of the policies of this administration.   Mr. Chairman, we don't have any more money to spend on things that  might be great to have, might be nice to have, might make us feel good.  We don't have the money. When you don't have the money, you don't spend  it.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I agree with the gentlewoman from the other  side of the aisle. We should be countering China. If we are going to  use USAID to do that, well, that is all well and good, too, but let's  enumerate how we are actually going to use this money to counter China.   What we are expected to believe is that they need this money, and we  are  [[Page H4762]]  going to counter China somewhere in Eastern Europe. Maybe we are, but  let's make the case.   What you are asking is the American people to borrow money from China  to then somehow counter China and just give all these folks that are  smarter than all the rest of us all the money, and I am sure they will  figure it out.   I don't know if you are keeping up with current events, but China is  eating our lunch right now while we are spending all this money that we  are borrowing from China.   I think the case makes itself. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, when everyday Americans, like the folks I  have the honor to represent in Pennsylvania's 10th Congressional  District, have too many expenses, they are simply forced to cut back.  They don't have any choice.   That is what they had to do in this high inflation, high cost of  living, Biden economy where gas, food--seemingly everything. I don't  know that anything has gone down. For sure, food, gas, electricity  prices are just going up and up.   So what do folks do at home?   They don't go out to eat as often. They don't have a meal out with  their family. They might have to cancel a few subscriptions, put off  some repairs around the house, put off buying a new pair of shoes, you  name it. The point is that they pare back their spending sometimes to  the bare bones because they have to keep a roof over their head and  food in their bellies.   Now, the paring back that I just discussed is something that this  body, this institution has been unwilling, unable, and simply refused  to do now for decades. Decades, $33 trillion worth of that.   Many of my colleagues on this side of the aisle have highlighted via  amendment the wasteful, bloated spending that this place has  perpetuated, especially during the pandemic; unbelievable amounts  during the pandemic.   I appreciate the work of the chairman. He has worked diligently to  bring this thing back closer in line with some reality, but there are  still places we can cut.   This amendment reduces the amount of international disaster  assistance from $3.9 billion to zero.   Now, everybody is going to take a gasp.   Zero international disaster assistance?   Ladies and gentlemen, in our country, the International Disaster  Assistance account is zero. It has dried up.                                time  1100    The good gentleman from Florida, his State just suffered a hurricane.  There isn't any disaster money for them. What about the folks in  Hawaii? What about the folks all across the country dealing with floods  and fires?   There isn't any money in the United States of America for them, but  heaven forbid, we have to make sure we are all around the globe helping  all those folks at the expense of the people in America.   I am not trying--and no one is trying--to be punitive or cruel here.  The fact is that this process is broken and the results of it are  broken, and the American people are tired of being broke from what we  do here in Washington.   This is a nearly $4 billion line item that we simply can't afford. We  want to be helpful. Every single one of us wants to help, but we are  using the money that other people earn to help other people overseas  while the people that earn the money are struggling, and that is  immoral and unacceptable.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I am glad that the gentlewoman mentioned people  of faith and their care for people, not only in their community but  around the globe. It is awesome. In the church that I attend, that is  exactly what we do, and that is exactly what we should do--be our  brother's keeper, be our brother's and sister's keeper--but the good  Lord never said force your brother to be someone else's keeper. That is  between them. And that is exactly what we are doing here is forcing  people that can ill afford their own bills and their own tragedies that  they are suffering in the United States to pay for the tragedies in  other places. That is immoral.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, this amendment reduces the amount of economic  support funding from $2.9 billion to $1.8 billion.   Like a few of my colleagues on this side of the aisle have said this  week, this is a necessary haircut to a program that has ballooned  massively just since two Presidents ago.   In the 5 years from fiscal year 2018 to 2023, this account went from  $1.8 billion to $4.3 billion. People wonder, how do we get $33 trillion  in debt? You get it a billion at a time just adding up.   Let's look at the use of these funds from the report of this bill.  Cooperative projects, sustainability challenges relating to water  resources, agriculture, and energy storage. That is interesting. Have  you ever heard of Flint, Michigan? They are concerned about their water  resources.   Agriculture? Our farmers aren't allowed to buy fertilizer--or can't  afford it in this country based on the policies of the administration.   Energy storage? We are paying for batteries overseas. It is not  enough that we force our own constituents to use unreliable power, now  we are going to force the rest of the world to do it and pay for it.   How about scientific research collaboration in the Middle East? That  is awesome because other than our one ally there, there is not much  scientific collaboration that I am interested in participating in-- certainly not with Iran.   The Middle East partnership initiative, which according to the State  Department supports governments and their citizens to achieve shared  political economic and stability objectives, how much money are we  going to throw in this money pit year after year after year, decade  after decade?   In the administration's budget request they will say the use of funds  to foster economic resilience in Greenland. Are they in peril in  Greenland?   Strengthen transparent governance and promote civil society and  independent media in South Asia and provide rapid, flexible support and  assistance to government and civil society in Africa.   These are all laudable things. The question is can you afford them,  and we cannot. I remind everybody we are simply borrowing from China to  pay for these things--all of these things.   Reasonable people can disagree about whether the American taxpayer  dollars need to promote civil society or scientific collaboration  abroad; however, the fact remains we must find places to save, and this  reverts a highly inflated item--highly inflated. Again, $1.8 billion to  $4.3 billion in 5 years.   I would just ask what is the metric we use to determine whether this  is successful or does anything at all to support the American people?   Mr. Chair, I urge support, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, again, we all want to do what we can, but we  shouldn't be borrowing money from China, our number one adversary. We  are borrowing it from them allegedly to counter them, and, oh, by the  way, while we are borrowing it from them to counter them, we are  allowing them to operate in our financial markets without the same  controls and restrictions we place on American companies.   That is ridiculous. It is so ridiculous that it probably costs us  more to counter them. We could do much more by just not allowing that,  but, instead, we are going to allow that and take taxpayers' money and  spend it to do this. It would cost so much less to do this if we would  just do the right thing in the first place.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, this amendment cuts migration and refugee  assistance funding from $2.5 billion to $0.   This money, the $2.5 billion, goes toward refugee programs around the  world, including for shelter, healthcare, and sanitation.   Again, we all want to do what we can. We all want to help. Nobody is  trying to be cruel or punitive here, but we don't have enough money to  deal with the refugee crisis in our own country, which is self-imposed.   Our constituents here at home can't afford their own shelter, can't  afford their own healthcare, their own food because of the policies of  the administration, yet we are forcing them to pay for it around the  globe, oftentimes with companies that have encouraged and inspired  people to migrate to their countries and become refugees in their  countries, and yet we are paying for that.   Furthermore, during the debate on the Homeland Security funding bill  this week, many of my colleagues on this side of the aisle rightfully  pointed out the disaster occurring at our southern border to the tune  of thousands of people every single day coming in.   Oh, by the way, what other countries around the world are helping  with our refugee crisis, with our refugee and migration assistance?   So our taxpayers are paying for the one that we are encouraging and  allowing in our country, and they are being forced under penalty of law  in their taxes to pay for the ones in other countries, too.   All of our districts have been affected by the influx of drugs,  including fentanyl. In my district just in the last week, half a dozen  people died from fentanyl that came across the southern border into my  town thousands of miles away from the border.                                time  1115    One of the refrains of the Biden administration and border czar  Harris seems to be that the only way to solve this is to address the  root causes instead of simply enforcing our own border.   Mr. Chair, we are not going to solve any of this under the current  policies that we are seeing, and we are certainly not going to solve it  around the globe by forcing our taxpayers to pay for it, encouraging  more of it all around the globe.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, like I said, every single one of us wants to  help. Every single one of our hearts breaks for people who are forcibly  displaced.   I would say, as well, that I question the numbers of forcibly  displaced. There are people in this country saying that all the people  coming illegally to this country are being forcibly displaced when that  is obviously not true.   By the way, maybe we would be more amenable to taking the taxpayers'  hard-earned money and spending it overseas on these migrations if we  would solve our problems here in the United States of America. How can  we force them, how can we ask them, to spend their hard-earned tax  dollars overseas when we refuse to solve the problems right here at  home and force them to pay for that, as well? It is insult upon injury.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, let me say from the outset that I certainly  appreciate that the bill's drafters prohibit assessed contributions to  the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, also known as UNRWA.   Now, that is a nice-sounding name. Unfortunately, what the  organization does is not so nice. This amendment applies a bill-wide  prohibition on making any ``funds appropriated to otherwise made  available by this act'' for UNRWA.   The issues with UNRWA have been well established and well known in  this town and around the globe. They effectively turned a blind eye to  terrorists storing weapons at their facilities in 2014 and hired staff  with ties to terrorist organizations.   Further, and almost maybe even more disturbing, the curriculum of  UNRWA's schools, which uses the textbooks of the host government or  authorities, has long contained materials that are anti-American, anti- Israel, anti-Semitic, and supportive of violence--direct violence. It  just can't be understated, and that is not histrionic. That is not  hyperbole. That is what it is.   As recently as 2022, watchdog organizations found that UNRWA  educational material still contains anti-Semitic and otherwise  objectionable material even though it has been brought up time and time  again. Yet we keep paying for it, and they keep doing it because they  don't care. Why would they care? We keep paying for it.   Not one more dime of our taxpayer money should go toward an agency  that has continuously promoted hatred toward this country, toward our  taxpayers, toward the things we believe in, and toward our allies--in  particular Israel.   I absolutely urge support of this amendment. I don't quite honestly  understand why we have to do this.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, oversight. I am sure there is always oversight.  There is going to be oversight again with this bill and the next bill  and with the authorization, the State Department authorization. The  oversight and accountability haven't gleaned any results.   I have been in the hearings. I have seen the textbooks. I am sure the  gentlewoman from the other side has seen them, as well.   As long as we keep paying, they are going to keep doing it. We can  provide all the oversight we want to, but no one is going to be held  accountable. You know how I know that? Because they have been doing it,  and no one has been held accountable.   I am sure they are grateful. I am sure the students are grateful to  receive the textbooks. I am sure the population is grateful to receive  our money as they thumb their nose at us and do things that are  antithetical to every single person in this country that is paying the  bill.   It is long past time that we say enough. If you are not going to  respect and appreciate what we give you appropriately, then we are not  going to give it to you until you can get your act together and stop  espousing violence to the very people--biting the hand that feeds you.  That is what it is. It is biting the hand that feeds you, Mr. Chair.   Until they are willing to do that, there is only one way to send a  message--and that is to quit funding our own demise.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, let me just tell you what I think is damaging  to our leadership: having our allies see us pay with our hard-earned  tax dollars for their adversaries to promote violence toward them. I  think that is damaging. If I were those allies, I would be questioning  how that is helpful.   Now, I am glad that my colleague brought up the fact that the  textbooks are checked and that we should know what is in them and there  are constant reviews and so on and so forth. Mr. Chair, we can't trust  the textbooks in our schools in our own towns in this country. You  think we know what is going on in the Middle East with the money we are  paying for theirs? I suggest we don't.   As far as consistency and educational appropriateness, let me remind  everybody, this is the same organization that pays stipends for people  that go kill Jews and Americans. They pay stipends for that. So, of  course, it is culturally appropriate. It is educationally appropriate.  It is consistent. It is consistent with their message of hatred, and we  are paying for it, and that is why we should end this now.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
