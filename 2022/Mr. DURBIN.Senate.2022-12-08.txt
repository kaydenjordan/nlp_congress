 Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm  another highly qualified judicial nominee: Jeffrey Hopkins, who has  been nominated to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of  Ohio.   Judge Hopkins received his A.B. from Bowdoin College and his J.D.  from the Ohio State University College of Law. After graduating from  law school, Hopkins clerked for Judge Alan E. Norris, both on the Ohio  Court of Appeals for the Tenth District and on the U.S. Court of  Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.   For the last 25 years, Judge Jeffrey Hopkins has served with  distinction as a Federal bankruptcy judge in the Southern District of  Ohio. In this role, Judge Hopkins has presided over approximately 3,000  cases that have gone to verdict or judgement, and he served as chief  judge of the district's bankruptcy court from 2014 to 2021. Prior to  being appointed to the bench, Judge Hopkins worked as a litigator in  private practice and served as Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern  District of Ohio, where he became chief of the civil division in the  U.S. Attorney's Office.  [[Page S7047]]    Judge Hopkins has the strong, bipartisan support of his home State  Senators, Mr. Brown and Mr. Portman. Additionally, he received a  unanimous rating of ``well qualified'' from the ABA. I support this  highly qualified nominee, and I urge my colleagues to do so as well.    I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Ms. Duckworth)  and the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Hickenlooper) are necessarily  absent.    I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Ms. Duckworth)  and the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Hickenlooper) are necessarily  absent.    I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Ms. Duckworth)  and the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Hickenlooper) are necessarily  absent.    Madam President, I am sure some people who are tuned into  C-SPAN think they are watching an alternative universe because all of  these Democrats have come to the floor to say something nice about a  Republican, but it is Rob Portman--a special Republican and a special  friend.   (Laughter.)   We have worked on many things together over the years, but I really  think the highlight of it has been the work that we have done together  in the past year as cochairs of the Ukrainian Caucus.   I know that you have been there more often than I have, but I also  know that your commitment to this issue goes way beyond anything  political. It is personal. It is real. It is human. You can feel it.   Rob is the type of person, the type of Senator, who takes his job so  very seriously. He put me to shame with the maps that he brought to the  floor of the Senate on a regular basis to chart the course of the  bravery and courage of the people of Ukraine as they fight for their  freedom and their future and resist the invasion of Vladimir Putin and  his thugs.   I know that you have been there to meet with Mr. Zelenskyy, who heads  up the Ukrainian effort. I know, as we met this week and many weeks  before, that when the Ukrainian Parliamentarians come to town, they  look forward to meeting our caucus and particularly meeting the Senator  from Ohio because they know that he understands their plight and that  he is a voice for them.   It must be difficult to be a native of a small country--so distant  from the United States--that is under constant attack, where people are  leaving, their lives are being turned upside down, where innocent  people are being killed every day, and you are counting on your friends  in other parts of the world--the NATO alliance and particularly the  United States of America. They find their way here to this Capitol  Building with their Ambassador. We sit down, and we talk about the  state of the war in Ukraine.   So many times, they look to you, Rob, and they look to our caucus for  the kind of message to take back home--a message of hope that they are  not in this alone.   Of all of the causes that I have worked on in the course of my  senatorial career, this is one that means a lot to me. My mother was  born in Lithuania, as I have probably mentioned to you. My feelings  about freedom and my feelings about the oppression by the Russians and  the Soviets over the years are very strong. That is being played out  today in the course of the war in Ukraine.   I thank President Biden for his leadership, but I thank you, Rob, for  making this bipartisan. Honest to goodness, that is why it is strong;  that is why it is credible; that is why it is a cause that many of us  in the Senate take so very seriously. You have made that commitment.   I would like to mention one other issue. I know that you take pride  in your legislative legacy--and you should--but back in 2013, you made  an announcement that sent shock waves throughout Washington. You became  the only sitting Republican Senator to endorse marriage equality. At  the time, you attributed your position to a member of your family who  was part of the LGBTQ community. You said that your son's courage  ``allowed me to think about this issue from a new perspective, and  that's as a dad who loves his son'' so very much.   Well, that evolution came full circle when you joined 11 of your  Republican colleagues in supporting the Respect for Marriage Act, which  protects marriage equality under Federal law. It was one of your final  votes in the Chamber and a fitting coating to your proud legislative  career.   Loretta and I wish you and your wife, Jane, and your three children  all the best as you say farewell to Washington and welcome to  Cincinnati or wherever your life may take you next. It has been an  honor and a pleasure to serve with you.   Thank you, Rob.    Mr. President, since 1963, the State Journal-Register,  the oldest newspaper in Illinois, has awarded its First Citizen Award  to residents of Springfield who have selflessly given their time and  resources to help and serve others. This year, the State Journal- Register has selected a central Illinois legend to receive its 2022  First Citizen Award: businesswoman and philanthropist, Evelyn Brandt  Thomas.   If you ask Evelyn Brandt Thomas how she is doing, she often replies,  ``Better than I deserve.'' She is a true pioneer with deep roots in  central Illinois. Evelyn was born in 1923 on a farm in Salisbury  Township, just outside of Pleasant Plains. Her father, Albert Brandt,  raised horses for the first 12 years of her life. And as life on a farm  goes, Evelyn had to do it all. She would handle tractors, gather eggs,  and milk the cows, all without the luxuries of electricity or indoor  plumbing.   She was ahead of her time. Evelyn graduated from Springfield High  School at just 16 years old and went on to receive a degree in  accounting from Illinois Business College, an impressive feat at a time  when women had few higher education opportunities and even fewer  prospects in the fields of business and accounting.   After several years of working in advertising, in the early 1950s,  Evelyn and her younger brother, Glen--``GB'' for short--founded Brandt  Fertilizer, a company that sold liquid fertilizer to central Illinois  farms. At the time, dry fertilizer dominated the local market, but it  also would come in heavy, 50-lb. bags that farmers would have to haul  all across the farm. GB and Evelyn recognized a need and seized on the  opportunity. Their original motto was, ``All You Have to Do is Lift the  Hose.'' GB relied on his ``gift of gab'' going farm-to-farm selling  this new product to make farmers lives easier while Evelyn handled the  financials, which she watched like a hawk. Evelyn and GB were quite the  duo, building their business on the principles of honesty and hard  work.   Their principles paid off. What started as a liquid fertilizer  company operating out of a truck and an office has now grown into  BRANDT Consolidated, Inc., a successful agricultural business that  sells products in more than 45 countries, has several hundred  employees, and generates hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue  each year. And it is still a family business. GB's son and Evelyn's  nephew, Rick Brandt, has served as CEO and president since 1995.   But Evelyn's long list of accomplishments goes far beyond profits and  sales. Over the years, she has pursued a number of philanthropic  projects and given back to central Illinois and the region. She has  been a champion of education--especially in encouraging more women to  explore careers in agriculture--supporting a variety of institutions of  higher learning, like the University of Illinois Springfield and  Lincoln Land Community College, as well as nonprofits like the  Education Center for the Visually Impaired. Evelyn has established  scholarships at the University of Illinois Springfield--UIS--and the  University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. She continues to support 4-H,  the youth development nonprofit organization where she met her late  husband Gordon, and the Future Farmers of America--an organization that  prepares young people to be leaders in business and agriculture.   In her work with the Education Center for the Visually Impaired,  Evelyn has sought to improve the quality of life for people who are  blind or visually impaired. In doing so, she has helped to provide  education, training, and development opportunities through services and  programs.   For her decades of work, Evelyn has received numerous awards. She  received the ATHENA International Award presented by the Greater  Springfield Chamber of Commerce in 2009, a Doctor of Humane Letters  award from UIS in 2014, and was inducted into the Senior Illinoisans  Hall of Fame in 2020.   I have also been glad to get to know Evelyn's family over the years.  In 2019, I worked with Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White to help  the Brandt family secure the specialized World War II license plate,  ``GB,'' in honor of his military service. GB passed away in June 2020  at the age of 94. In January 2020, we held a press event at BRANDT  Consolidated, Inc., to celebrate the benefits of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada  Agreement for the agriculture production industry and the Brandt  family's global leadership.   How is Evelyn doing? I would say she is doing pretty well for a farm  girl from central Illinois. And she deserves it. Evelyn and her family  are a true Illinois success story. I want to thank Evelyn for her many  years of service to the central Illinois community and congratulate her  for receiving the State Journal-Register's 2022 First Citizen Award.  Illinois is grateful for all of her service and sacrifice.                            ____________________
