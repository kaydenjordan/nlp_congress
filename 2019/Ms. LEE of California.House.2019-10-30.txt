 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  and legacy of the late Congressman John Conyers and to extend my  deepest condolences to his wife, Monica, his family, children, former  staff, and the people of Detroit, who he served so well for more than  50 years.   Congressman Conyers was a tireless advocate for racial and economic  justice and an ardent defender of civil rights. We all owe him a debt  of gratitude for his unwavering commitment to pushing our Nation to  live up to its ideals of liberty and justice for all. That is his  legacy.   I met Congressman Conyers during my time as a staffer to our beloved  late Congressman Ron Dellums, who was also a cofounder of the  Congressional Black Caucus with Congressman Conyers. They were very  close friends and worked together on many issues, including the  establishment of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Federal holiday. I always  remember staffing the many meetings with Ron, Congressman Conyers, and  the legendary Stevie Wonder, who worked with us as we planned our  outside-inside strategy for the holiday legislation. And it worked.   John believed in our democracy and the power of the people. He  recognized that the only way democracy can work is with the input,  vision, and voice of the people.   Congressman Conyers stood on the front lines of the fight for so many  important issues during his time in office, and he was cosponsor of the  Voting Rights Act of 1965. I probably wouldn't be standing here as a  Member of Congress had it not been for Congressman Conyers.   As a cofounder of the Congressional Black Caucus, he focused the  Nation's attention on racial inequality and injustices faced by African  Americans around the country, from inequity in education, to poverty,  to mass incarceration. He stood up for those who needed his advocacy  the most.   Of course, when Rosa Parks fell on hard times after refusing to give  up her seat on a segregated Montgomery bus, in what launched the civil  rights movement, John hired her to work in his district office in  Detroit, where she worked until she retired in 1988.   For more than 30 years, he fought for H.R. 40, the Commission to  Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African-Americans Act, which  calls for a commission to study reparations for descendants of enslaved  people from Africa.   Congressman Conyers, Chairman Conyers, he was masterful, drawing a  connection between the historical injustices faced by African Americans  and the present-day inequities experienced in our communities.   I am so proud to support H.R. 40 today and to continue his work. In  his honor, I hope that my colleagues support Congresswoman Sheila  Jackson Lee's efforts to take H.R. 40 over the finish line.   Congressman Conyers was a progressive champion who fought for all of  us. He was an early supporter of single-payer healthcare. I believe the  bill was H.R. 676, which I was proud to cosponsor.   He fought to ensure that every American has access to quality,  affordable healthcare. He fought to protect our safety net so that  folks who needed a helping hand, no matter their color, can keep a roof  over their heads and food on the table.   He spoke out vocally against the Trump administration's attacks on  civil rights and human rights for people of color and the LGBTQ  community. Indeed, though Congressman Conyers represented Detroit, he  truly fought for all Americans and earned his affectionate name of  ``America's Congressman.''    Also, John formed the Poor People's Caucus in the House, where he  encouraged Members to speak out for the poor and low-income folks.   In his memory, let us fight for the most vulnerable Americans. Like  our friend, Congressman Elijah Cummings, who we recently lost as well,  Congressman Conyers' legacy and impact will live on, though he is no  longer with us. His legacy should continue to inspire us to keep up the  fight for justice and equality, which he dedicated his life to.   Mr. Speaker, so today, once again, I offer my condolences to Monica,  to Congressman Conyers' family and loved ones, and join them in  celebrating his life and legacy. May he rest in peace, and may he rest  in power.                            ____________________
