 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to  complete my remarks before the rollcall vote.    Mr. President, first, let me say I concur with the  comments by the Senator from North Dakota. I think he makes wonderful  points about what is being done in terms of pandemic relief and the  issues that we as a nation are facing.   As his State and mine are similar, with so many small businesses, and  we see the impact and the success related to the Paycheck Protection  Program, I just want to associate my beliefs with those that we have  just heard expressed from the Senator from North Dakota.                                   Protests    I come to the floor today to talk about another epidemic, and that is  the epidemic of violence that is sweeping our country.   Monday's Washington Post headline warns: ``Protests explode across  the country; police declare riots in Seattle and Portland.''   Tuesday's Wall Street Journal editorial is headlined: ``A Weekend of  Urban Anarchy.'' ``A weekend of Urban Anarchy.'' In Seattle, on  Saturday, rioters blew a hole in a police precinct. They hurled  explosives, and they injured 53 police officers. In Portland, rioters  threw Molotov cocktails Friday night. Several officers were hit with  heavy explosives. The rioters returned Sunday and attacked the  courthouse.   In spite of what the Democrats say when they call these ``peaceful  protests,'' these are not peaceful and they are not protests. This is  active violence. This is organized violence, and it is meant to destroy  and to intimidate.   Portland has now endured 60 days of senseless destruction. These  violent protests are a powder keg for our entire Nation. The rioters  threaten entire communities. They are ruining lives, and they are  ruining neighborhoods. They are wrecking public property, and they are  wrecking private property. They burn, they loot, and they kill.   Across the country, a number of police officers have been killed.  According to the New York Times report, murder rates in our big cities  are now up 16 percent compared to last year. In New York alone, murders  are up 24 percent. In Atlanta, murder is up 31 percent. In Chicago,  murder is up 51 percent. In Chicago, last week, 15 people were shot  while attending the funeral of a victim of gang violence. Children are  being hurt and killed. A 7-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy were  among those shot and killed in Chicago over the Fourth of July weekend.   This is a crisis of leadership in our liberal cities. Where are the  Democratic mayors? They have surrendered to the mob. Where are the  Democratic Governors? They have surrendered to the mob. Instead of  leading, they are turning their backs on the safety and security of the  law-abiding citizens of our communities. In these liberal cities, mob  rule has replaced the rule of law. We are seeing in realtime--in  realtime--the result of the radical ``defund the police'' movement that  is embraced by many Democrats.   We should defend, not defund, the police and law enforcement.  Americans do not want to defund the police. According to a recent  Rasmussen poll, two out of three Americans oppose cutting police  funding. A majority say that they want the Federal Government to help  fight crime in these cities. One thing is clear: The violent rioting  plaguing our cities cannot continue. The police are being targeted for  doing their job, and their jobs come at great personal risk. At the  same time, elected Democratic mayors and city  [[Page S4572]]  council members and Governors refuse to condemn the rioting and the  coldblooded murder.   It is time for local leaders to restore law and order. It is time to  make sure our communities are safe again. The death and destruction  lies at the feet of elected Democratic leaders. Each must be held  accountable for their leadership failure.   I yield the floor.                                Cloture Motion
