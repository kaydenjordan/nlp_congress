 Madam President, on December 21, 2017, Senator Isakson  was necessarily absent for the vote on the continuing resolution. He  intended to vote yea, and it was my intention to vote no. As a courtesy  to Senator Isakson, I voted yea, in order to pair our votes.                            ____________________
