 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 495, I  call up the bill (H.R. 288) to amend title 5, United States Code, to  clarify the nature of judicial review of agency interpretations of  statutory and regulatory provisions, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 288.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 288, Separation of  Powers Restoration Act or SOPRA. The Constitution separates the powers  of the Federal Government into a system of checks and balances.   Article I, Section 1 grants Congress all legislative power, while  executive power is granted to the President, and judicial power is  vested in the courts, as we all know.   However, since 1984 when the Supreme Court ruled that courts must  defer to an agency's interpretation of an ambiguous statute rather than  what Congress intended, the executive branch has begun usurping the  legislative branch to issue regulations with the force of law.   This consolidation of power departs from the constitutional  principles and harms our own liberties. It is certainly not what our  Founders intended. Yet, this 1984 ruling, known as Chevron, has paved  the way for unelected bureaucrats to issue sweeping rules with no  consequences.   Just in 2021, for example, executive branch agencies issued more than  3,200 rules that imposed vaccine mandates on workers. They were also  involved in overturning the Keystone pipeline, and required a $15  minimum wage for Federal contractors, and allowed the IRS to spy on  Americans' bank accounts.   Meanwhile, that same year, only 143 bills passed by Congress were  signed into law. This means executive branch agencies impose more than  20 times as many mandates as actual legislators. These regulations are  not without cost. According to the American Action Forum, Federal  agencies collectively finalized $200 billion in regulatory costs in  2021, equivalent to more than $600 per U.S. household.   In 2022, we saw an additional $117 billion in regulatory costs added  to the bottom line. Taken with rules from previous administrations and  according to the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the total annual  costs of regulation is almost $2 trillion, or about 8 percent of the  U.S. GDP.   If it were a country, for comparison, U.S. regulation would be the  world's 8th largest economy, only behind France.   If Members of this Chamber impose that kind of cost on taxpayers-- well, we know what would happen--we would all be voted out of office.   Yet, the Biden administration continues to issue binding rules and  courts continue to apply the Chevron doctrine when determining its  statutory authority. It is no surprise to see that the President will  probably oppose this legislation and promise to veto it. Just 5 months  into 2023, and we have already seen his administration circumvent  Congress to make changes to non-competes, require climate disclosures  by Department of Defense contractors, and ban the use of pistol braces  nationwide.   An unchecked administrative state is dangerous to the American  people. That is why it is imperative that Congress regain its  legislative power by passing H.R. 288.   The Separation of Powers Restoration Act would displace Chevron and  other precedents that require courts to defer to agency positions. It  ensures that courts independently consider what Congress has said  through its statutes rather than putting a thumb on the scale in favor  of the Federal agencies.   By forcing courts to apply de novo review, the standard would reclaim  the courts' constitutional role as the branch that interprets the law,  and Congress' role will once again be underscored as the branch that  writes them.   Agencies are not supposed to make laws, and it is past time to bring  the power of legislating back to the branch our Founders intended.   Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Jordan for his leadership on the  issue, and I urge my colleagues to support the bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a cost  estimate for H.R. 288, prepared by the Congressional Budget Office.

Increases net direct spending in any of the four       consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2034? a        Increases on-budget in any of the four consecutive 10-year       periods beginning in 2034? a        Statutory pay-as-you-go procedures apply? Yes.        Mandate Effects:        Contains intergovernmental mandate? No.        Contains private-sector mandate? No.        H.R. 288 would authorize federal courts that review agency       actions to decide all relevant questions of law, including       the interpretation of constitutional and statutory provisions       and rules, without deferring to previous legal determinations       by the agency.        Under the bill, federal courts could overturn some agency       decisions that they would have upheld under current law. Some       of those decisions could affect federal spending by       overturning regulations that affect direct spending,       revenues, and spending subject to appropriation. However, CBO       has no basis for estimating either the likelihood that such       actions would be overturned or what the effects on spending       might be.        The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Jon Sperl. The       estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director       of Budget Analysis.                                                 Phillip L. Swagel,                             Director, Congressional Budget Office.     Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. McClintock).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from California.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Once again, I remind everyone that SOPRA is not deregulatory. That  has not been the goal at all. The goal is to forward this discussion  between what should be legislative powers and the administration so  that, in the future, it also sets a ground floor for many of the  statutes. Congress remains free to regulate in a very detailed way and  so do the administrative agencies.   I have heard this before. We heard it in committee, that somehow we  were setting up or juxtaposing these two different goals, and it just  isn't true.   I think that the other thing we would see is that you would find that  legislators would do a much better job of drafting bills in the first  place. I mean, shame on us if we leave a piece of legislation so vague  that it opens the door for an administrative agency to somehow go in  and interpret.  [[Page H2942]]    There are many times when the scope of the legislation is the first  thing that should be determined before you even sit down and actually  write the bill.   So, I know it is a criticism that has existed, but I don't think it  is valid.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   The other thing I will mention came up in our discussions during the  committee. When you find yourself in a situation--we just had this  discussion in relationship to the REINS Act--where the administrative  powers continue to kind of escalate and bloom out from that original  piece of legislation, what you will find is, later on, that has to be  revisited because oftentimes it is done hastily, doesn't make sense, is  arbitrary in nature. It is very difficult for legislators to even read  through those powers that have been granted and try to make sense of  that. It is another thing that came up in committee that I think is  valid.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   The other thing I will relay is that SOPRA does not turn judges into  legislators. SOPRA helps to restore the court's constitutional role as  the branch that construes the law.   Specifically, SOPRA requires that courts apply de novo review to all  relevant questions of law when reviewing agency action. This means that  the courts, not agencies, will interpret what a law means.   In other words, SOPRA enhances, not violates, the separation of  powers under our Constitution. Within that discussion, the  interpretation of the law is also something that I think would, once  again, focus where we are.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Wyoming (Ms. Hageman).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Once again, I will say that by forcing the courts to apply the de  novo review, this standard would reclaim the court's constitutional  role as the branch that interprets the laws and Congress' role as the  branch that writes them.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
