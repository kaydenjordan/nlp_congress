 Mr. Chair, I rise as the designee of Chairwoman Lowey,  and I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Foster).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                     Amendment No. 65 Offered by Mr. Crow     Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  rise in strong support of this amendment.   The Commerce Department has not answered basic questions related to  the purpose behind its sharing agreement with the Department of  Homeland Security.   Although I am not suggesting the Census Bureau will use the  information for something other than statistical purposes, I think it  is important to remind the Department we are mindful of how  individuals' information will be handled.   Ensuring the public trust in the Census is vital to getting an  accurate count, and this amendment helps in that goal.    Mr. Chair, I rise in very strong support of the  gentlewoman's amendment.   The zero-tolerance experiment has been a tragic mistake. It has  swamped U.S. Attorneys, U.S. Marshals, and district courts with low  level nonviolent cases previously handled by DHS and, if necessary,  immigration courts. It has also separated thousands of families and  traumatized children and parents. Children may remain with parents in  DHS custody, but they cannot follow them into jail, even for such  misdemeanor charges.   DOJ should focus on criminal gangs, human trafficking, and smuggling,  most of which passes through, not between, the ports of entry.   The zero-tolerance policy restricts seasoned prosecutors from  pursuing serious crime and distorts priorities by requiring an  unbalanced and inflexible approach. It is clearly not improving things  at the border.   Mr. Chair, I urge the House to adopt this very important amendment.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from California for  yielding.   Mr. Chair, I recognize what my friends from Maine are attempting to  do to help an important industry in their State, but I must oppose them  in favor of supporting the critically endangered Atlantic right whale.   The decision support tool that this amendment would block is used by  States to determine how they can ensure they are taking steps to  protect these whales. Preventing its use would, therefore, remove the  ability of the States to make their own determination.   Consequently, NOAA would be forced to set a national standard.  Additionally, given the way it is drafted, this amendment would block  NOAA's conservation work on right whales, not just in the Atlantic, but  also in the Pacific.   Other agencies that rely on this tool include the Coast Guard and  Navy, who rely on it to ensure that they are in compliance with the  Marine Mammal Protection Act.   As I said earlier, I understand my friend's concern, and I would  support funding to help develop new and more whale-friendly fishing  gear and other mitigation options. I cannot, however, support an  amendment that removes a scientific tool to make informed natural  resource management decisions. It would only further endanger these  majestic animals.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of my colleague from  the Bronx's amendment.   Opioids are a serious threat to the health and well-being of our  communities, and we must do everything we can to combat this epidemic.   Within the Department of Justice grant programs, the bill provides  $501 million in funding, an increase of $33 million for grants to  combat the crisis. This funding includes drug and veterans courts,  residential treatment, and for the first time, a grant program for Law  Enforcement Assistance Diversion, or LEAD, which seeks to get  individuals into treatment and out of the criminal justice system.   The addition of this amendment further strengthens a bill that  increases grants for treatment and prevention.   Mr. Chair, I support the amendment, and I urge my colleagues to do  the same.    Mr. Chair, I rise to support the amendment. My colleague  sends an important message by calling attention to the misuse and  overuse of solitary confinement in Federal correction and detention.   In 2016, the National Institute of Justice issued a detailed study of  the use of restrictive housing in U.S. detention. In addition, the  Office of Inspector General in 2017 reported on the use of restrictive  housing for mentally ill persons in the custody of BOP and included 15  recommendations to improve how BOP treats such inmates.   While solitary confinement represents a small percentage of  restrictive housing, it is particularly concerning because of evidence  that its use can be harmful and even counterproductive to correctional  objectives.   Mr. Chair, I encourage the Department to take note of the concerns  expressed here, and I ask that the amendment be adopted.    Mr. Chair, I rise to support the amendment.   When, in March, the Justice Department broke with the principle that  its core mission should be to defend, not sabotage, the law of the  land, it went too far.   The White House is entitled to push its own policy position on  healthcare--it has made no secret of its hostility to the Affordable  Care Act, despite never offering an alternative of any kind--but it  cannot pick and choose which laws to support.   My friends across the aisle criticized the Obama administration for  its use of prosecutorial discretion. In this case, the Department is  not just neglecting to defend the law, it is using appropriated funds  to directly attack it.   This amendment will, hopefully, stop that, and that is why I strongly  support it.
