 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  the Committee on Foreign Affairs be discharged from further  consideration of the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 92)  recognizing the deep and abiding friendship between the United States  and Israel, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the  desk.
