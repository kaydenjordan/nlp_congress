 Mr. President, one of the most ubiquitous technologies in  the world today is the cell phone. According to Pew Research, a  stunning 97 percent of Americans own some sort of mobile device. These  devices are critical to our everyday lives, keeping us connected to one  another while also serving as a gateway to entire sectors of our  economy. Most Americans probably do not realize that they are holding a  piece of Vermont in their hands every time they use their phone, but  thanks to engineers at GlobalFoundries in Essex Junction, every cell  phone in the world contains a chip manufactured in my home State.   Today, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the efforts of  one of those engineers, Anthony ``Tony'' Stamper of Burlington and  thank him for his contributions to the global innovation ecosystem from  his corner of Vermont. Tony retired this summer from GlobalFoundries  after 30 years of semiconductor engineering at the Essex facility.  During Tony's celebrated career, he has been responsible for over 500  patented inventions, making him one of the world's top 100 most  prolific inventors of all time.   Tony's leadership at GlobalFoundries has helped keep Vermont at the  forefront of an ever-changing industry for over 70 years. In 2015,  GlobalFoundries acquired IBM's Essex plant and their talented  workforce. Thanks to Tony and Essex innovators like him, the Vermont  GlobalFoundries facility leads the industry in manufacturing radio  frequency power semiconductors.   While Tony has been a prolific inventor, U.S. Patent No. 6,310,300 is  one of his most notable inventions. It solved the significant problem  that the space between an insulation layer and a metal wire in a chip  would degrade over time. He and his team members created a barrier  layer that prevented degradation and allowed for much smaller metal  wires on the chip, hence much smaller chips. The invention has been  used in every chip produced in the last 20 years.   Tony is not only an accomplished inventor but has repeatedly led  teams of engineers to utilize these inventions to create leading edge  products for high-speed computing and mobile communications. Tony has  been a dedicated mentor and teacher to a new generation of inventors,  which led him to be nominated for the GlobalFoundries Diversity and  Inclusion Inventorship Champion Award. He knows that collaboration is  the key ingredient to successful innovation and has fostered that kind  of environment in all of the invention teams he has led.   Tony's story shows that innovators can thrive anywhere in the  country, not just in Silicon Valley. I know his fellow engineers, who  have relied on his expertise over the years, will feel his absence and  miss him dearly. As he embarks on this next exciting part of his life,  I want to acknowledge Tony's work and thank him for his decades of  service to Vermont and the industry. Marcelle and I join his friends at  GlobalFoundries and wish him the best of luck.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to take a moment today to  recognize the incredible impact of Farm to School programs in Vermont  and across the country and the great work of Vermont students, their  schools, and their broader communities to improve access to healthy  food options.   Since 2000, Vermont Food Education Every Day--FEED--has facilitated  collaboration between schools and farms in Vermont, helping cafeterias  to source meals locally and working with schools to institute  curricular and cocurricular programming to educate students on local  food systems. In 2010, I was proud to author the national Farm to  School Program in the Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act. Since then, Vermont  FEED and its Farm to School programs have become a national benchmark,  with Farm to School programs now operating in all 50 States and the  District of Columbia.   A few weeks ago, I had the chance to speak with students from Harwood  Union High School about their Farm to School program. For the past 15  years, Harwood has sourced its food locally and worked with Vermont  FEED to develop opportunities for students, teachers, and staff to  connect with local farmers beyond the cafeteria. For 5 years, Harwood's  student-led Farm to School Club has coordinated educational  programming, farm visits, and recipe competitions to help students and  staff to experience local agriculture and the Vermont food system. Even  through the COVID-19 pandemic, the Harwood Farm to School Club adapted  its programming by shifting to virtual tours of local farms and at-home  recipe contests.   As a truly Vermont-grown initiative, I have always been proud of the  impressive adoption of Farm to School programs in communities  nationwide. In April, I reintroduced the Farm to School Act, a  bipartisan piece of legislation that would increase mandatory funding  for the Farm to School Grant Program, ensuring that more schools,  students, and farmers can take advantage of the program. And every year  in the annual appropriations process, I have worked to increase  discretionary funding for this popular program.   The Farm to School Club at Harwood serves as a testament to the  importance of community engagement and the educational, economic, and  nutritional benefits of Farm to School programs. The club was recently  featured in an article published by Seven Days, and I ask unanimous  consent that the article, ``Vermont Leads National Farm-to-School  Movement, and Harwood Union High School Demonstrates How'' be printed  in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                      [From Seven Days, Sept. 7, 2021]  Vermont Leads National Farm-to-School Movement, and Harwood Union High                          School Demonstrates How                            (By Melissa Pasanen)         On August 19 at Shelburne Farms, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.)       and U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack       heard from 10 Vermonters involved with the state's farm-to-      school program.        The group included school food service directors, nonprofit       and government leaders in agriculture and child nutrition, a       vegetable farmer, and Jeswin Antony, a 16-year-old Harwood       Union High School student.        When it was Antony's turn to speak, he introduced himself       as a leader of Harwood's farm-to-school club. The teen       explained that he was 3 when his family moved from India to       Waterbury. ``My first experiences with American cuisine were       in the lunchroom at school,'' he said.        The chicken was Vermont-raised, and the vegetables were       grown in the school garden, Antony recounted. ``From a young       age, I was taught and I saw that this food is grown locally,       and it tastes better and is more nutritious,'' he said.  [[Page S6736]]         The Shelburne gathering followed Leahy's early August       announcement that he had secured committee approval to       include $5 million in the federal budget to establish a       National Farm-to-School Institute at Shelburne Farms.        The proposed national institute will expand the reach of       the existing Vermont-based Northeast Farm to School Institute       currently run by Vermont FEED (Food Education Every Day), a       nonprofit partnership managed by Shelburne Farms and the       Northeast Organic Farming Association of Vermont.        Founded in 2000, Vermont FEED has been instrumental in       fostering connections between Vermont schools and farms--from       the cafeteria to the classroom--in support of improved       childhood nutrition, local agriculture and lifelong wellness.        The organization's influence spread beyond the state's       borders until it was codified when Vermont FEED established       the Northeast Farm to School Institute in 2010. The institute       has helped share best practices via training and coaching in       more than 100 schools and districts in New England and New       York.        States from Massachusetts to Nebraska have also worked with       the Northeast Farm to School Institute to build their own       successful statewide programs.        Shortly after the Mississippi Farm to School Network was       established in 2015, co-director Sunny Baker visited Vermont       for a workshop.        ``We knew right away Vermont was the model,'' Baker said       over the phone. ``It's not one-size-fits-all. It's about       putting power back into the communities while providing       formal support to help them connect the three Cs,'' she said,       referring to cafeteria, classroom and community. ``It's less       top-down, more roots-up.''        Anna Mullen, spokesperson for the National Farm to School       Network, described Vermont as a national leader in creating       and propagating effective farm-to-school models and in       leveraging critical legislative support. In a phone       interview, she noted that the state was the first to create a       farm-to-school grant program in 2006 and that Leahy has long       been ``a huge champion'' of the movement at the federal       level.        The pending federal line item would fund expansion of ``a       really impactful . . . coaching and support model that brings       together teams to fit the needs of their school and achieve       the vision of their own community,'' Mullen said. The       proposal to take it national ``is a testament to a model       that's really helping and working.        At Shelburne Farms in August, Antony continued to share why       he was drawn to farm-to-school. In middle school, he said, he       took a sustainability course that taught him about the food       system. Joining the farm-to-school club deepened his       understanding of the ``inner workings'' of how schools source       and prepare food, Antony explained.        During the pandemic, he and his co leaders worked hard to       keep fellow members connected to the club and to one another       through virtual farm tours and Harvest of the Month recipe       contests, Antony said. They created recipes with beets, sweet       potatoes and dairy at home, for example, and then took       virtual tours of farms that produced those foods.        ``Keeping the students engaged, telling them where their       food comes from, making them informed about what they eat       really creates a better environment and healthier kids,''       Antony concluded.        ``I wish I'd had you testify before the committees,'' Leahy       said, drawing an appreciative chuckle from the group.        A couple weeks after meeting the senator and agriculture       secretary, Antony met with Seven Days in the Harwood       cafeteria along with three other teens in the farm-to-school       club. Joining the four were Paul Morris, co-director of food       and nutrition services for the Harwood Unified Union School       District; Paul Kramer, a teacher and club faculty adviser;       and Jen Dreimiller, a school counselor who is also on       Harwood's farm-to-school team. That team is composed of       teachers, staff, students and community members working to       deepen the high school's farm-to-school efforts.        Like Antony, Miranda Rayfield of Fayston and Macie Whalen       of Northfield are 16 and just started 11th grade. The trio       leads the club. The students look forward to getting back       into the cafeteria kitchen with ``chef Paul,'' as they call       Morris, to design, prepare and serve Harvest of the Month       taste tests. While they enjoyed the monthly recipe contests       that Antony had described to Leahy and Vilsack, sharing the       results of their efforts remotely wasn't the same.        ``We provided the food, and [members of the school       community] got to make something out of it and share it via a       slideshow we'd show at an online school assembly,'' Whalen       explained. Photographs of beet recipes included a       mouthwatering array of several different beet-chocolate       cakes; beet-tahini pasta; a beet and potato roesti; and a       version of halwa, the traditional Indian sweet, made with       beets.        ``Some people think vegetable are `gross and disgusting,'       '' Whalen said. ``But then when they cook with them and see       or taste what others have made, they might change their       mind.''        ``When you share it with the whole school, it gets more       attention,'' Antony added.        During the pandemic, the students drew other benefits from       their shared cooking experience. ``You were at home, locked       down. It gave us a great way to connect,'' Whalen said.       ``Like, Jeswin's sweet potato and black bean curry--it looked       so good! [We were asking each other,] `Did he send the       recipe?' It was really cool to be connected through food.''        Haley MacDonald, 13, of Moretown, joined the club last year       when she was in seventh grade. With the kale she received       through the club, she made two kinds of kale chips at home:       one salted and the other sweetened with a little maple syrup.        ``It was my first time making them myself,'' MacDonald said       proudly in the cafeteria. Her family, including her 9-year-      old twin brothers, inhaled them. ``They were gone in a       minute.''        ``It also helped me realize there are lots of local       farms,'' MacDonald said. ``Like, `Oh, I got kale from there.'       It's really cool to be able to cook with what they grow and       support them.''        During a virtual farm visit to Butterworks Farm in       Westfield, Whalen described excitedly, ``They showed us their       cows and their butter compared to store-bought butter. You       could literally see the difference in color.''        ``And texture,'' Rayfield said. ``You could almost feel the       love.''        ``I've gotten a whole community out of it,'' Whalen       continued. In addition to the teachers and chef Paul at       school, she said, that includes the farmers. ``It's a       community beyond Harwood Union High School.''        The 5-year-old club is just one aspect of the district's       well-established farm-to-school program.        Morris, the food and nutrition services codirector, has       been sourcing from local farms all 15 years he has worked at       Harwood. But, while the cafeteria was lauded initially for       its fresh, locally sourced menu, Morris said there was       untapped opportunity. ``It was not super connected to       teachers and staff. It was us trying to push it out,'' he       said.        Enter the Northeast Farm to School Institute. Six years       ago, a team of Harwood school and community members started       meeting regularly with a coach from Vermont FEED to build on       efforts in the school kitchen. That was what ``kind of got       the ball rolling,'' Morris said.        ``The program really started to gain momentum when students       had experience outside the cafeteria,'' he said. ``They       didn't want to talk about it; they wanted to do things.''        This fall, Harwood students will return to a neighboring       nonprofit farm, Living Tree Alliance in Moretown. There, they       have moved mulch, planted hazelnuts, made sauerkraut and       learned how the farmers rotate their small flock of sheep to       graze different paddocks. The farm has sold Harwood cabbage       and potatoes for use in its cafeteria.        One Harwood civics and social studies teacher used grant       money to build a hoop house behind the school in which       students grow salad greens. These, too, become cafeteria       fare.        The farm-to-school team came up with a local food challenge       offered to all homerooms: Students tasted something locally       grown and learned about the concept of food miles and the       benefits of buying closer to home. Farm-to-school club       members even collaborated with students in a graphic design       course to develop a logo emblazoned with a shovel and fork       and the words ``community, cafeteria, classroom.''        Kramer, the club's faculty adviser, said he was pleased       when students asked how they could build advocacy skills and       help others access local food. Last year, a group of club       members partnered with a local gleaning organization to pick       apples at a Randolph orchard to donate to area food shelves.       Antony and a student who has now graduated worked with       Vermont FEED to testify in front of the state legislature.        ``We are very grateful to eat this healthy, local food, but       not everyone gets to,'' Antony said in the cafeteria.        ``The students are seeing the larger picture,'' Kramer       said. ``Farm-to-school is a great, tangible lens for kids to       understand things like equity and social justice. They are       understanding how things are connected and using that       understanding to find leverage points to solve problems.''        Being involved in farm-to-school, Antony said, has opened       his eyes to the complexity of the food system and to his own       ability to make a difference.        ``It's all intertwined: nutrition, the education system,       the legislative system, even waste,'' he said. ``There's       massive change we can do in all those spheres. I want to take       some action.''                            ____________________     Madam President, I would like to take a moment today to  recognize the iconic Vermont Lake Monsters and their championship  victory in the team's first season as members of the Futures Collegiate  Baseball League. The Vermont Lake Monsters have seen various iterations  over the years, and the determination, grit, and resilience of the  team's players, coaches, staff, and fans are clear to all Vermonters  and fans of the team.   The Lake Monsters began in 1994 with establishment of the Vermont  Expos, a minor league baseball team affiliated with the Montreal Expos.  When the Montreal Expos moved to  [[Page S6737]]  Washington, DC, and became the Nationals, the Vermont Expos changed  their affiliation and their name, becoming the Lake Monsters in 2004  and affiliated with the Oakland Athletics. When Major League Baseball  elected to shrink the minor league in 2019, the Lake Monsters sadly  lost their affiliation. The loss of affiliation and the prospect of the  closure of the Lake Monsters were devastating for the baseball  community in Vermont.   Luckily, the Lake Monsters seized the opportunity to join the Futures  Collegiate Baseball League, bringing the team back to Centennial Field  in Burlington after a 2-year hiatus. Quickly, a new coaching staff was  hired, and a roster filled. The Lake Monsters returned to Centennial  Field on May 21, beginning a fantastic season run that brought them to  a championship title on August 20.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S6737, September 28, 2021, the following language  appears: The Lake Monsters returned to Centennial Field on May 21,  beginning a fantastic season run that brought them to a  championship title on September 17.      The online Record has been corrected to read: The Lake Monsters  returned to centennial Field on May 21, beginning a fantastic  season run that brought them to a championship title on August 20.    ========================= END NOTE =========================      The Lake Monsters have garnered an immense following in Vermont and  have become a mainstay of our community. The team, their games, and  their fans have been an intrinsic aspect of the summertime fun for so  many Vermonters. The resiliency of the Lake Monsters and their  resounding victory in their return to the field, particularly at a time  of such turmoil and uncertainty in our world, brings a welcome sense of  joy, hope, and levity to our community.   Congratulations to the Vermont Lake Monsters for their championship  victory; may your success continue for years to come. Vermonters will  look forward to going to Centennial Field for a game next summer to  enjoy some peanuts, Cracker Jacks, and a Lake Monsters win.                            ____________________
