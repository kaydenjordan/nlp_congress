 Mr. Speaker, COVID-19 originated in the Communist Chinese  Party's Wuhan bio-weapons lab, and forces Americans into a damned if  you do, damned if you don't choice.   You can refuse to take the COVID-19 vaccine and face the risk of  death and debilitating injury when you catch COVID-19. Or you can take  the COVID-19 vaccine and face the risk of death or debilitating injury  from the vaccine's side effects, as described in a letter by Mary  Constance Seibert, who honorably served America in the United States  Navy.   Ms. Seibert states: ``Dear Congressman Mo Brooks: This is my  explanation and statement regarding the impact of the vaccine that was  being given as a result of extreme pressure but now is mandated by the  Armed Forces. This has resulted in my partial paralysis that has  confined me to a wheelchair.   ``On March 22, 2021, I received my second shot of the COVID-19  vaccine supplied by Pfizer. Shortly after, I became sick for a few  days, as expected. A few weeks later, I got sick again, and was so ill  I was out for 2 weeks. Medical staff were unable to determine what I  had caught. I developed ringing in my ears, which I still have.   ``After, I started to develop medical problems where muscles would  inflame along with severe restless leg syndrome, which sent me  screaming from pain in the dead of sleep. I went to physical therapists  and Navy doctors alike to no avail to stop it. Shortly proceeding, my  knees started to give out, and I'd need--and still need--to pop them to  terminate the pain. I also experienced the development of digestive  problems like IBS and joints that would become so painful that I would  cry from the pain in my hips and feet just from standing for 30  minutes.   ``All these symptoms developed in 2 months with no explanation.  Eventually, they would level out as I was put into a command to focus  on medical problems.                                time  1130    ``By May, I started losing vision in my right eye and slight vision  in my left. This was accompanied by pain and my vision going from 20/20  in my right eye to 20/25 and from 20/17 in my left eye to 20/20. They  assumed I had optic neuritis in my right eye but were wrong and still  do not know why the pressure was off in my eye.   ``On July 2, I experienced my first painful set of convulsions. They  started small but grew as the days went on.   ``On July 5, I was sent to the ER as I was no longer functional and  the feeling of electricity going through my body would not stop. I went  into the ER walking and on July 8, I came out in a wheelchair as I  slowly lost my ability to walk as the days went by and the spasms kept  happening. They never did figure out what was wrong with me. I only  knew my copper was high, my white blood cells were high, and my  inflammation levels were very high, with no explanation. My current  symptoms have been trouble breathing, joint pain, migraines, unknown  convulsions, vision loss, unsteady gait, vomiting, nausea, mouth  ulcers, frequent heavy nose bleeds, tremors, slurred speech, heat  aversion, and lack of motor coordination.   ``I am now reliant on a wheelchair and now await separation from the  military. I have been told there is no other explanation other than a  reaction from within my body due to the vaccine.''   Let me repeat that.   ``I have been told there is no other explanation other than a  reaction from within my body due to the vaccine.   ``Respectfully submitted, Mary Constance Seibert.''   Mr. Speaker, I stand for freedom and liberty and against vaccine  mandates because in America, Americans should have the freedom to  choose which of two bad COVID-19 options is best for them, vaccination  or no vaccination. I stand against dictatorial government vaccine  mandates because mandates are the antithesis of the liberty and freedom  on which America is based.                            ____________________
