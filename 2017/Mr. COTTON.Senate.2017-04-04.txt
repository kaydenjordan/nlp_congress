 Mr. President, this week the Senate will fulfill one of  our most important responsibilities: advice and consent for a nominee  to the Supreme Court. The stakes don't get much higher than a lifetime  appointment to a court of final appeal, especially if the court has  presumed over the last two generations to take more and more political  and moral questions out of the hands of the people.   President Trump has nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch, a distinguished  jurist who understands the critical but limited role of the Federal  courts in our constitutional system. To my knowledge, no Senator  genuinely disputes his eminent qualifications, his judicial  temperament, and his outstanding record over the last decade on the  Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.   Indeed, Judge Gorsuch would appear headed toward an easy,  noncontroversial confirmation based on the comments by Democratic  Senators.   The senior Senator from Colorado introduced Judge Gorsuch at his  confirmation hearings with this high praise:         I have no doubt that . . . Judge Gorsuch has profound       respect for an independent judiciary and the vital role it       plays as a check on the executive and legislative branches. I       may not always agree with his rulings, but I believe Judge       Gorsuch is unquestionably committed to the rule of law.    The senior Senator from Indiana recently announced his support for  Judge Gorsuch, saying:         I believe that he is a qualified jurist who will base his       decisions on his understanding of the law and is well       respected among his peers.    The senior Senator from West Virginia has noted:         [Judge Gorsuch] has been consistently rated as a well-      qualified jurist, the highest rating a jurist can receive,       and I have found him to be an honest and thoughtful man.    The junior Senator from North Dakota also praised Judge Gorsuch for  his ``record as a balanced, meticulous, and well-respected jurist who  understands the rule of law.''   Remember, these admiring statements all come from Democrats, and all  of them support an up-or-down vote on confirming Judge Gorsuch.   Even those who oppose Judge Gorsuch used to sing a different tune  about the standards for judicial confirmation.   For instance, the senior Senator from California put it best when she  said:         I think, when it comes to filibustering a Supreme Court       appointment, you really have to have something out there,       whether it's gross moral turpitude or something that comes to       the surface.    Speaking of a previous Republican President's nominee, she further  said:         Now, I mean, this is a man I might disagree with. That       doesn't mean he shouldn't be on the court.    In fact, President Obama filibustered a Supreme Court nomination  while he was a Senator, yet later expressed regret over that decision.  He said:         I think that, historically, if you look at it, regardless       of what votes particular Senators have taken, there's been a       basic consensus, a basic understanding, that the Supreme       Court is different. And each caucus may decide who's going to       vote where and what but that basically you let the vote come       up, and you make sure that a well-qualified candidate is able       to join the bench even if you don't particularly agree with       him.    Despite all of this, though, it appears that a radical Democratic  minority intends to filibuster Judge Gorsuch's nomination. The minority  leader is encouraging this extreme fringe, claiming, ``If Judge Gorsuch  fails to earn 60 votes and fails to demonstrate he is mainstream enough  to sit on the highest court, we should change the nominee, not the  rules.''   I will return later to the minority leader's central and ironic role  in all of this. For now, let's take a trip down memory lane so as to  understand just how radical this partisan filibuster would be.   No Supreme Court nominee has ever failed because of a partisan  filibuster--never, not once, ever--in the 228 years of our venerable  Constitution. One nominee, Justice Abe Fortas--to be elevated to Chief  Justice--lost one cloture vote in 1968 on a bipartisan basis. He then  withdrew under an ethical cloud, but no Supreme Court nominee has ever  been defeated by a partisan filibuster.   This historical standard has nothing to do with changes in the Senate  rules. The filibuster has been permitted under Senate rules since early  in the 19th century. It is not a recent or a novel power. The cloture  rule was adopted 100 years ago. In other words, at any point in our  history, a Senate minority could have attempted to filibuster a Supreme  Court nominee. They had the tools. The rules permitted it. It would  have only taken one Senator--just one. Yet it never happened for a  simple reason: self-restraint. While written rules are important,  sometimes the unwritten rules are even more so. Habits, customs, mores,  standards, traditions, practices--these are the things that make the  world go round, in the U.S. Senate no less than in the game of life.  Our form of self-government depends critically on this form of self- government. Let's reconsider some recent nominees in light of these  facts.   Justice Clarence Thomas was probably the most controversial  nomination in my lifetime, perhaps ever. He was the subject of a  vicious campaign of lies and partisan smears--a ``high-tech lynching''  in his words. He was confirmed in 1991 by a bare majority of 52-to-48.  Yet Justice Thomas did not face a filibuster. Not a single Senator  tried to block the up-or-down vote on his nomination--not Joe Biden,  not Ted Kennedy, not Robert Byrd, not John Kerry--not one. Why? Any one  Senator could have demanded a cloture vote, could have insisted on the  so-called 60-vote standard and, perhaps, defeated Justice Thomas's  nomination, but they did not because they respected two centuries of  Senate tradition and custom.   It was likewise with Justice Sam Alito, whose nomination  unquestionably shifted the Court's balance to the right in 2006. He,  too, received fewer than 60 votes for confirmation--58 to be exact--but  he received 72 votes for cloture. Here again, a large, bipartisan  majority upheld the Senate tradition and custom against partisan  filibusters of Supreme Court nominees. Even Judge Robert Bork, whose  name is now used as a verb to mean the ``unfair partisan treatment of a  judicial nominee,'' received an up-or-down vote in 1987. Yes, Judge  Bork, who only received 42 votes for confirmation, did not face a  partisan filibuster.   But let's not stop with Supreme Court nominations. Let's also  consider other kinds of nominations so that we can understand just how  radical is the Democratic minority's position.   To this day, there has never been a Cabinet nominee defeated by a  partisan filibuster--never, not once, ever--in 228 years of Senate  history. To this day, there has never been a trial court nominee  defeated by a partisan filibuster--never, not once, ever--in 228 years  of Senate history. Until 2003--just 14 years ago--there had never been  an appellate court nominee defeated by a partisan filibuster.   That is just how strong the custom against filibusters was. It had  never successfully happened in 214 years.  [[Page S2203]]  From our founding, through secession and civil war, through world wars,  no matter how intense the feeling and how momentous the occasion, no  matter how partisan the atmosphere, Senators always exercised self- restraint and allowed up-or-down votes on nominees for the Supreme  Court, the court of appeals, the trial court, and the Cabinet.   But that changed in 2003, thanks in no small part to the senior  Senator from New York, Chuck Schumer, now the minority leader. With the  help of leftwing law professors, he convinced extremists and the  Democratic caucus to filibuster President Bush's appellate court  nominees. For the first time in more than two centuries of the U.S.  Senate, a radical minority defeated nominations with a partisan  filibuster.   Why did the Senate start down this path? Some point to racial  politics and Miguel Estrada, who was one of the most talented appellate  litigators of his generation and President Bush's nominee to the DC  Circuit. That court is often a proving ground for future Supreme Court  nominees, and Mr. Estrada's confirmation might have enabled President  Bush to nominate him, subsequently, to the Supreme Court. A Republican  President appointing the first Hispanic Justice? Surely, the Democrats  couldn't allow that.   Whatever the reason, there can be no doubt that the minority leader  has set in motion a chain of events over the last 14 years and has  brought us to the point he claims to deplore today. So the Democrats  can spare me any hand-wringing about Senate traditions and customs.   The minority leader and like-minded extremists in the Democratic  caucus can also spare us their exaggerated claims of the Republican  obstruction of President Obama's judicial nominees. The Democrats,  after all, were the ones who broke a 214-year-old tradition  specifically to obstruct 10 of President Bush's nominees. Of course,  the Republicans followed suit, though I would note that they have  filibustered fewer judges over more years in their having been in the  minority.   Put simply, the Democrats broke one of the Senate's oldest customs in  2003 so that they could filibuster Republican judges, and they  subsequently filibustered more judges than did the Republicans. So it  should come as no surprise that the Democrats took an even more radical  step in 2013 when they used the so-called nuclear option to eliminate  the filibuster for executive branch, trial court, and appellate court  nominations. They broke the Senate rules by changing the Senate rules  with a bare majority, not the effective two-thirds vote required under  those rules.   The radical Democrats will accept no constraints on their will to  power--when in power. Whatever it takes to pack the courts with liberal  extremists or to block eminently qualified Republican nominees is  exactly what they will do.   But don't take my word for it. Let's review what the Democrats were  saying last year when they all believed they would be in power with  Hillary Clinton as President and Democrats controlling the Senate. We  did not hear much talk about the sacred 60-vote standard back then. On  the contrary, the Democrats were promising to use the nuclear option  again--this time to confirm a Democratic nominee to the Supreme Court.   Former Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said:         I have set the Senate so, when I leave, we're going to be       able to get judges done with a majority. . . . If the       Republicans try to filibuster another circuit court judge,       but especially a Supreme Court Justice, I've told `em how,       and I've done it . . . in changing the rules of the Senate.    The junior Senator from Virginia, who would have been Vice President  had Secretary Clinton won, said, quite frankly, about the Supreme Court  vacancy:         If these guys think they are going to stonewall the filling       of that vacancy or other vacancies, then a Democratic Senate       majority will say, ``We're not going to let you thwart the       law.''    The junior Senator from Oregon warned ominously:         If there's deep abuse, we're going to have to consider       rules changes.    The senior Senator from New Mexico perhaps summed it up best of all  when he said:         The Constitution does not give me the right to block a       qualified nominee no matter who is in the White House. . . .       A minority in the Senate should not be able to block       qualified nominees.    Do not think for a minute that the radical Democrats would not have  made good on these threats. They have exercised little restraint on  judicial nominations over the last 14 years. They have betrayed over  200 years of Senate tradition and custom. They would not start  respecting those traditions now.   In reality, there were good reasons to respect and uphold the old  Senate tradition against the filibusters of nominees before 2003.   First, our responsibility under the Constitution is not to choose but  to advise and consent. A partisan filibuster would, essentially,  encroach upon the President's power to nominate the person of his  choice.   Second, nominations are not susceptible to negotiation. We cannot  split someone down the middle, Solomon-like. We can vote yes or no.  This is not the case with legislation, where differences can be split,  compromises negotiated, and bipartisan consensus reached.   Third, when legislation fails to win 60 votes, it is not the end of  the world; it can go back to the drawing board or be enacted through  other legislative vehicles. But when nominations are long delayed or  defeated, then real work is left undone, cases go unheard, disputes go  unresolved, and the law remains unclear.   It would have been better for the Senate if the minority leader and  the Democrats had recognized these things in 2003 and not started us  down this path, the end of which we reach this week. It is rarely a  good thing when an institution ignores or breaks its customs and  traditions, its unwritten rules. They should have known better, and  they should have acted better. But we have come to this point because  the radical Democrats didn't act any better.   Now they propose to create a new standard never known to exist  before: The Senate will not confirm a Republican President's nominees  to the Supreme Court, because if the Democrats will filibuster Neil  Gorsuch, then they will filibuster any Republican nominee. I will never  accept this double standard, and neither will my colleagues.  Republicans aren't going to be played for suckers and chumps.   After this week, the Senate will be back to where it always was and  where it should have remained: Nominees brought to the floor ought to  receive an up-or-down, simple-majority vote. And don't expect to hear  regret from me about it.   There is no moral equivalence here between the two parties. To  suggest any equivalence is to divorce action from its intent and aim.  In 2003 and again at this moment, the radical Democrats overturned  venerable Senate traditions. The Republicans are acting to restore  them. Those who cannot see the difference, to borrow from Bill Buckley,  would also see no difference between a man who pushes an old lady into  the path of an oncoming bus and a man who pushes the old lady out of  the path of the bus, because after all, both men push around old  ladies.   So I am not regretful. I am not wracked with guilt. I am not  anguished. I am really not even disappointed. There are no school yard  taunts of ``you did it first.'' There are no charges of hypocrisy.  There is no pox on both our houses. The Republicans are prepared to use  a tool the Democrats first abused in 2013 to restore a 214-year-old  tradition the Democrats first broke in 2003, and we are supposed to  feel guilty? Please. The radical Democrats brought this all on  themselves and on the Senate. The responsibility rests solely and  squarely on their shoulders.   The minority leader is hoist with his own petard, the Senate is  restored to a sensible, centuries-old tradition, and Judge Gorsuch is  about to become Justice Gorsuch. Not a bad outcome. Not bad at all.  Pretty good, in fact.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
