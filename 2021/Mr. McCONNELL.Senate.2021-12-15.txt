 Mr. President, in the aftermath of Western Kentucky's  devastating tornado outbreak, I have maintained close contact with  State and local officials. My staff has been on the ground since the  outset of the crisis, helping residents access Federal resources and  keeping me up-to-date with any developments. Toward the end of the  week, I will travel back to Kentucky to meet with my constituents and  visit the areas affected.   The stories coming out of Kentucky are harrowing. But in recent days,  we also heard about the generosity, the hard work, and the hope that  are helping our State recover.   Kentuckians desperately need help to rebuild, so our universities,  normally bitter rivals on the court, are rallying together to raise  money and gather supplies for relief efforts.   This Christmas is shaping up to be exceptionally difficult for  children all across Western Kentucky, so churches  [[Page S9168]]  are organizing toy drives to help make the holidays a little bit  brighter. Western Kentucky community organizations are stretched to the  limit, so businesses based in the Commonwealth, from distilleries to  car manufacturers, to insurance companies, have stepped up and donated  literally millions. Remarkable stories of survival and resiliency have  trickled out of the disaster zone.   Last weekend's storm destroyed much of the First Christian Church in  Mayfield, but the congregation discovered their communion table and  altar cross fully intact while picking through the rubble. A symbol of  hope and rebirth survived amid so much pain.   Across town, the Mayfield Health and Rehabilitation nursing home was  physically devastated when it took a direct hit from the tornado on  Friday night, but all 74 of the facility's elderly residents survived  with only minor injuries. As one staff member said, this was ``truly a  miracle.''   And in Bremen, KY, when a man visited the wreckage of his home on  Saturday, he discovered his grand piano mostly undamaged--undamaged-- despite the storm. Amid the surrounding devastation, he sat down to  play and to sing hymns. His songs, shared on social media, warmed the  hearts of thousands.   These stories of hope have ricocheted across the Commonwealth,  bringing smiles and strength to communities that need them most. And  they give me faith that Kentucky will recover from this crisis stronger  than ever.                                   S. 1605    Now, Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, today, the  Senate will pass this year's National Defense Authorization Act by a  big bipartisan margin.   I have talked for weeks about the importance of this legislation,  given the global threats and international challenges that face our  country from China to Russia, to the fight against terrorists in the  Middle East.   I will also be proud to vote for this bill because of the enormous  impact it will have on my home State. The proud servicemembers based in  Kentucky play an outsized role in our national defense. From deploying  across the world to fighting COVID-19 here at home, they do amazing  work to keep America safe.   In the past week, they have stepped up to provide critical support as  Kentucky deals with the aftermath of our devastating tornadoes. Our  Commonwealth's heroes and their families deserve our full support, and  I am proud that this year's National Defense Authorization Act delivers  for them.   Nearly $1 billion for the Assembled Chemical Weapon's Alternative  Program that supports the chemical munitions destruction mission at the  Blue Grass Army Depot; robust funding to deter Russia in Europe; the  emission of Fort Knox's Fifth Corps Headquarters; continued investments  in research and modernization that will guarantee our soldiers,  including those at Fort Campbell, are prepared to counter emerging  threats like China.   We have also built on our previous efforts to lift up Kentucky's  military families. The bill provides additional funding for modern,  high-quality childcare facilities, including $27 million for a new  childcare development center at Fort Knox. It authorizes an across-the- board 2.7-percent pay raise for our troops.   This bill is critically important to the servicemembers who make  immense sacrifices to keep our Nation safe. I am proud to support it  and help cement the Commonwealth's role as America's most military- friendly State.                                  Inflation    Mr. President, now one final matter, I described yesterday how  inflation is hurting families all across our country. Since then, yet  another key economic indicator has set an unfortunate record.   In the last year, wholesale prices grew at their fastest pace on  record. Anyone with a shred of sense knows this is the absolute wrong  time--wrong time--to unleash a multitrillion-dollar taxing-and-spending  spree.   Every single day brings new evidence our Democratic colleagues should  give the country a break. But the cost of Washington Democrats' latest  obsession isn't the only problem. The context of what they want to pass  is actually just as bad.   We have known since the start of the COVID pandemic that Democrats  saw it as an opportunity to transform American society. They have  actually been quite candid about that. And their reckless taxing-and- spending spree they are writing behind closed doors is a Trojan horse  to let the radical left dictate intimate details to American families.   There is a long list of policies inspired by the authors of the Green  New Deal. A whole slew of new programs and mandates are aimed at  fitting the entire country's systems for producing and consuming energy  into sort of a California-shaped box: special subsidies for expensive  lifestyle choices like electric vehicles and electric bicycles; new  redtape to strangle the most reliable and affordable sources of  American energy; subsidies for supply chains that China dominates so  that America borrows in order to ``Build Back Beijing''; and don't  forget the so-called Civilian Climate Corps, just what we need at a  time of inflation and labor shortages--a Potemkin make-work program for  liberal activists.   Of course, Washington Democrats intend to grab greater control over  the development of America's young people long before they are eligible  for made-up green jobs. Their spree contains a massive ``toddler  takeover'' that insults the diversity of American families and their  aspirations. It only throws money at a subset of secular childcare  centers that woke bureaucrats happen to favor.   Forget faith-based options, forget flexible part-time arrangements,  forget being remotely fair to families with a parent at home, Democrats  want to bring their inflation into childcare and make daycare more  expensive, more inflexible, and more unfair.   And then there is the latest offensive in a long campaign to restrict  more of American's healthcare choices. Democrats' plan would mean more  one-size-fits-all programs, more government control, a wet blanket over  the world-leading innovation pipeline that creates new cures, and a  further gamble with seniors' Medicare when the trust fund is already in  danger of insolvency.   Then there are the massive tax hikes our colleagues want to use to  cover the bill--all those radical changes, all those Big Government  intrusions into family life, compared with the crushing tax hikes that  would hit our country like a ton of bricks.   There are new surcharges on individual taxpayers. There are tax hikes  for passthrough businesses. There is a brandnew, radical scheme to make  American industry less competitive that Senate Democrats scribbled down  with no hearings or committee process.   President Biden promised he wouldn't raise taxes one penny on anyone  making less than $400,000. But experts agree that Democrats' tax hikes  would break that promise. People with far less income would be  affected.   So for goodness' sake, in 2022, their bill would give a bigger  percentage tax cut to people making more than $1 million every year  than the families that pull in between $75,000 and $100,000. That is  according to the Joint Committee on Taxation.   The average person who makes upward of $1 million gets a bigger tax  break--a bigger tax break--from Democrats' bill than the average  household that makes just under--just under--six figures.   In large part, that is because of an absurdly expensive tax giveaway  that Democrats want to hand out to benefit high-income earners in blue  States. Their SALT policy would make the Federal Government subsidize  the property tax bills of people with mansions who choose to live in  high-tax States.   It is an insane proposition, and it is struggling to even earn  support from Democrats' rank and file. But their leaders from New York  and California are obsessed with it, so go figure.   But SALT is only just the beginning of the gravy train this bill  steers toward Democrats' pet projects and causes. There is also a tax  code tweak that would create a special deduction for union dues, while  letting one for charitable contributions actually expire. Another  special incentive--to the tune of $10 billion--would help liberal  colleges and universities indoctrinate students in new ``environmental  justice'' programs, whatever that is. Still,  [[Page S9169]]  others would pour $29 billion into funding a ``National Green Bank,''  $2.5 billion into increasing--listen to this--``tree equity,'' $1.67  billion to bail out news outlet, and an extra billion on top for  ``improving climate resilience'' of Pacific salmon--an extra billion on  top for ``improving climate resilience'' of Pacific salmon.   And then, of course, there are the extra special ways Democrats want  to use this bill to fulfill more personal hometown priorities. Speaker  Pelosi didn't end up getting to earmark millions of Federal dollars for  redeveloping a park in her district. Ah, but she did secure one  Congressman's vote by upping the funding for a defunct regional  commission that largely benefits his district by 13,000 percent. That  is old-school vote-buying, a slap in the face to taxpayers.   Our own colleague, the Democratic leader, has pledged to ``use all of  [his] power'' to personally steer tens of billions of dollars toward a  hometown New York City housing authority with a long and storied  reputation of corruption, mismanagement, and scandal.   So it is hard to wrap your head around all this; that is, unless you  subscribe to Washington Democrats' apparent core principle--core  principle: When the American people are footing the bill, the menu is  all-you-can-eat.
