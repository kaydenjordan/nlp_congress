 Mr. Speaker, 50 years ago today, New Mexico was  the first State to adopt a law that recognizes language and culture are  inseparable, that students learn better if they take the language from  their kitchen into their classroom.   Fifty years ago, my parents helped write and pass the Bilingual  Multicultural Education Act so Keres, Tiwa, Tewa, Towa, Dine, Apache,  Zuni, Spanish, and ASL would be taught in our schools.   Like many New Mexicans, they understood the importance of culturally  relevant content. Today, 70 percent of New Mexico school districts have  bilingual multicultural instruction.   Bilingualism is a treasure. Nearly 22 percent of the U.S. speaks a  language other than English at home, and roughly 245 indigenous  languages are spoken across the country.   Studies have shown that having a second language helps students be  better problem solvers, more creative, able to concentrate, and  communicate better.   ``Que viva nuestra herencia y cultura.'' ``Long live our heritage and  culture.''                            ____________________
