 I thank Senator Blackburn.   Mr. President, I join Senator Blackburn today to honor the heroic,  lifessaving actions by Officer Rex Engelbert of Nashville, TN;  Detective Michael Collazo of Smyrna, TN; Detective Sergeant Jeffery  Mathes of Nashville, TN; Detective Ryan Cagle of Charlotte, TN; and  Detective Zachary Plese of Nashville, TN. These dedicated officers  showed exceptional courage by putting their lives on the line to save  others.   On March 27, 2023, an unspeakable tragedy took place at The Covenant  School in Nashville, TN. A cowardly and depraved murderer's gruesome  actions took six innocent lives--including those of three 9-year-old  children. I join the families affected, the Nashville community,  Tennesseans across our State, and millions of Americans in mourning  this heartbreaking and outrageous act of evil.   What is unmistakably clear is the incredible bravery and heroism of  the first responders, who prevented this tragedy from being even worse.   Officer Engelbert, Detective Collazo, Detective Sergeant Mathes,  Detective Cagle, and Detective Plese, nobly and without hesitation,  rushed into an active shooter situation at The Covenant School.  Released body camera and surveillance footage shows that these officers  confronted and eliminated the lethal threat within a mere 3 minutes.   The rapid response and swift assessments of the emergency not only  underscore the strength of their training, but also their bravery as  they quickly entered the school despite obvious risks to their own  safety. Their actions likely saved countless lives.   I echo the words of Governor Bill Lee when I say, ``Gratitude doesn't  begin to cover it.''   Today, we honor the heroic actions of Officer Engelbert, Detective  Collazo, Detective Sergeant Mathes, Detective Cagle, Detective Plese,  and the other brave first responders who rushed to the aid of  strangers, putting others before themselves that day. I join  Tennesseans and all Americans to express our heartfelt gratitude.                            ____________________
