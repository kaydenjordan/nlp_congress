 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for his work  on this.   Mr. Speaker, after weeks of empty promises that he had a secret plan  to insure every American at lower costs with higher quality care,  President Trump is now standing behind a House GOP repeal plan that was  introduced last night that fails every single one of those promises.  Based on estimates that we have seen so far, millions of Americans  stand to lose coverage, out-of-pocket costs will skyrocket, and the  quality of care will plummet.   But today, hours after that bill was introduced, Mr. Speaker, our  President referenced a to-be-announced second and third phase of his  healthcare rollout that Secretary Price referred to as ``a work in  progress,'' once again injecting our healthcare system with crippling  uncertainty that is hurting our patients, hospitals, behavioral health  providers, and local economies.   If you are so proud of this bill, why has it been locked in dark  rooms? Why not have an open debate? What are we so afraid of to have a  debate on this floor?   That is why I urge my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, to  support my resolution of inquiry tomorrow, to try to make sure that the  details that have been discussed by this White House and by the  Republicans behind closed doors are open for America to understand  before we cram a healthcare overhaul down our throats.
