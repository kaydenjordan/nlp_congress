 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill not only for  the important semiconductor provisions but for some of the provisions  that are less noticed, including the text of the SUPER Act authored by  Representative Gonzalez of Ohio and me which focuses on how to get the  carbon emissions out of steelmaking.   It is often the people from steelmaking parts of the country who  stand up in support of provisions like this, but this is important for  every American. Every American uses 600 pounds of steel every single  year. If you think about the roads you drive on, the bridges and  buildings you enter, your own car, and your own house, Mr. Speaker, it  starts to add up.    There is nowhere in the world that they make this steel without  emitting more CO2 into the atmosphere. Somewhere someone in  the world is going to figure out how to do that. If we do it here in  the United States--we are already emitting less than everybody else-- but if we can get it to zero, then we will have a product that everyone  in the world is looking for and is crucial to our future. This bill  will help us do that.
