 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 962,  the Born-Alive Survivors Protection Act, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.    Madam Speaker, if this unanimous consent request cannot  be entertained, I urge the Speaker and majority leader to immediately  schedule the born-alive bill so that we can stand up and protect the  sanctity of human life.    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Gohmert for yielding, and I  thank Judge Carter for this incredible honor. The gentleman is a dear  friend and someone I admire very much. His love for the State of Texas  is unmatched.   This truly is an honor. I am proud to be a North Carolinian, but I do  love the State of Texas.   I would first suggest that we should all remember that seven North  Carolinians, if my recollection is correct, died defending the Alamo.   I also have family ties to Texas. My great uncle Joseph Wesley  Humphrey was a deputy sheriff, a member of the Texas legislature, and  county judge in Rains County, Texas.   Another great uncle, Reverend Daniel A. McRae, was a Methodist  minister in San Augustine County, Texas. I believe that might even be  in Mr. Gohmert's district. And the church and the cemetery there is  still named ``McRae'' after my great uncle.   So I do have family ties. I do love the State. I am deeply honored to  receive this commission, honorary as it may be, and I will be proud to  recite the oath:        I, Richard Hudson, do solemnly swear that I will support       and defend the Constitution of the United States and of the       State of Texas against all enemies, foreign and domestic;       that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and       that I will obey the orders of the President of the United       States, the Governor of Texas, and the orders of the officers       appointed over me, according to regulations and the Uniform       Code of Military Justice. And I will remember the Alamo. So       help me God.    Madam Speaker, I thank Judge Carter.
