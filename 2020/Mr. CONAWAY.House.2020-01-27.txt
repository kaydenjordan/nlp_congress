 Madam Speaker, the IRS Free File program is an  innovative public-private partnership between tax preparation software  companies, the IRS, 22 States, and the District of Columbia offering  free online tax preparation and e-filing services to low- and moderate- income taxpayers at no cost to the Federal Government.   Since 2003, over 51 million American taxpayers have filed their taxes  for free through Free File, collectively saving over $1.5 billion in  tax preparation fees.   A recent independent study of the Free File program highlighted the  value of this critical public-private partnership and reaffirmed that  the IRS would not be able to offer the Free File program without the  financial support of the private sector.   With over 100 million taxpayers eligible for Free File each year, I  believe it is important to make sure more eligible taxpayers are aware  of this Free File service, which is an outstanding complement to the  other free tax preparation services offered to low- and mid-income  families.   Today, I am introducing a resolution formally recognizing the  contributions Free File has made to our country and expressing the  House's support for this vital program.   I would like to take this opportunity to thank my cosponsor,  Congressman Butterfield, for joining me in introducing this resolution  and for his continued work as co-chair of the House Free File Caucus.                            ____________________
