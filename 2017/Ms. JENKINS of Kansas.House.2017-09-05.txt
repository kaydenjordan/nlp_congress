 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Bob Dole Congressional Gold  Medal Act, which recognizes Senator Dole's service to this great Nation  as a soldier, legislator, and statesman.   As a kid growing up in rural Kansas, there were many times I could be  found wearing a Styrofoam cap and a sandwich board in support of my  Senator. I introduced this legislation, which calls for the Secretary  of the Treasury to strike a single gold medal of appropriate design in  honor of Senator Bob Dole, and I am humbled to have the opportunity to  honor him for his lifetime of service on the floor of the United States  House of Representatives.   Throughout Senator Dole's life, he has consistently exemplified  humility, hard work, and leadership. He was born and raised in a small  town, Russell, in north-central Kansas. As a young man, he served  heroically in the Army during World War II, where he was gravely  wounded while trying to save a fellow soldier during a military  offensive in Italy.   Senator Dole later went on to carry out one of the most storied  careers in politics, where he set the record as the Nation's longest  serving Republican leader in the United States Senate. He is seen as a  political statesman who reached across the aisle for the good of the  country. To this day, Senator Dole continues to serve his country and  fellow man by fighting for our veterans and working to help curb child  hunger and poverty.   Senator Dole's passion, dedication, and service to our country is a  testament to his character and a great blessing to the State of Kansas  and our Nation. He is not only an American hero, but a role model,  mentor, and a dear friend of mine. There is no person I would rather  see be honored with the Congressional Gold Medal than Senator Bob Dole.   Please join me in supporting this legislation to honor Senator Dole  for his unwavering service to our country.
