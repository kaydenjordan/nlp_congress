 Mr. President, Senator Lee and I rise in support of  this amendment to the antitrust provisions of this legislation for one  purpose: to ensure that they match the language of the original bills  that earned strong bipartisan support in this Senate as well as in the  House of Representatives. We are simply restoring the language that  passed in the Senate and passed in the House before this bill went  through the mix master that is called the omnibus.   I want to thank Senator Grassley for his work on the Merger Filing  Fee Modernization Act, which updates and reforms the merger fees-- something we have not done for 22 years.   Senator Cotton's Foreign Merger Subsidy Disclosure Act is included  and the State Antitrust Enforcement Venue Act--strongly supported by  all members of the Judiciary Committee, which Senator Lee and I have  led.   This bill passed the Senate by unanimous consent, and this language  was scored to language originally in the bill.   Senator Lee will speak briefly, and then in the spirit of the  holiday, with Santa Claus on our side, we will ask for a voice vote.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.
