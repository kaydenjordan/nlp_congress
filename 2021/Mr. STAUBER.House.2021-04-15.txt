 Madam Speaker, on day one of this administration, Joe  Biden destroyed thousands of jobs at the stroke of a pen.   One of these jobs was held by my constituent, Patrick Thorssen, an  operating engineer and a member of Local 49. By stopping the Keystone  XL pipeline, Joe Biden devastated countless families and communities.   Madam Speaker, I am asking tonight: Mr. President, where are these 1  million jobs? These families and communities deserve better.
