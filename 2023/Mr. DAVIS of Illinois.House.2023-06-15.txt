 Madam Speaker, beginning tomorrow there will  be thousands and thousands of events, commemorations, and activities  all over America celebrating Juneteenth, which will be June 19. There  will be many of those in the district that I represent, at Malcolm X  College and also at the JLM Center.   I look forward to participating with many of my constituents as we  remember and recall but project the future,  [[Page H2938]]  and that is what Juneteenth means. We look back to go forward.   Happy Juneteenth to all of the constituents in my district and  throughout America.                            ____________________
