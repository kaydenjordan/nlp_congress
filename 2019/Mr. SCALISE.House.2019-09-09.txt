 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Eastbank  All-Stars from River Ridge, Louisiana, for winning the 73rd Little  League World Series Championship.   It is exciting any time that the United States competes against the  world and wins and does so in such a classy fashion that represents the  great values of this Nation. It is even more special that these young  men from my district were the first in the State of Louisiana's history  to win the Little League World Series.   It was an exciting series for all of us. It captured the imagination  of the people of Louisiana, especially to watch how these young men  represented themselves and the rest of us in such a classy way as they  competed against the nation of Curacao and ultimately delivered an 8-0  victory for the United States.   I, along with all of my colleagues from Louisiana, introduced H. Res.  547 to formally congratulate these young men. They look forward to  going to the White House to meet the President. He has extended the  invitation.   It is a great moment for Louisiana and a great moment for the United  States, especially for River Ridge, Louisiana.                            ____________________
