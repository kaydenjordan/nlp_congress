 Mr. Speaker, ObamaCare is built on broken promises.   President Obama promised that, through his healthcare law, premiums  would go down. Instead, they have gone up. In most States, premiums  have increased by double digits. In some States, like Oklahoma,  premiums are going up by as much as 76 percent.   I am from Indiana. In Indiana, in 2017, based upon current  enrollments, the average rate will increase by 18.7 percent. Overall,  the premiums in Indiana have gone up by 70 percent since the Affordable  Care Act was first enacted.   Not only are Americans paying more for coverage, the costs have gone  up as well: out-of-pocket costs, deductibles. For 2017, four carriers  will be selling on the Indiana Marketplace. I have one county in my  district, Wayne County, where no carriers provide for the local  hospital.   Today, we will start a process of keeping our promises, Mr. Speaker.  We promised the American people that we would repeal and replace this  failed healthcare law. Only in Washington would keeping your promise  somehow be controversial.                            ____________________
