 Mr. Speaker, I oppose this resolution because it would  remove consumers' right to control their online privacy and put it in  the hands of corporations.   Every time people go online, they create trails of data that have  tremendous commercial value. This creates incentive for the ISPs to  sell web history to a third party, be it an advocacy group, a for- profit company, or even a foreign government.   Late last year, the FCC put Americans in charge of how ISPs use and  share their consumer data. The FCC's rule also required that the ISPs  engage in reasonable data security practices.   Even if people believe that the FCC's rule went too far and should be  modified, it is unclear how the FCC could move forward with such a plan  given the constraints of the Congressional Review Act. Furthermore, as  several people have mentioned, the FCC, which is charged with  protecting consumers' privacy, does not even have the authority to  oversee ISP practices.   Given the number of data breaches in recent years at companies such  as Yahoo, we should, frankly, be strengthening data retention  requirements, not weakening them. At its core, S.J. Res. 34 weakens  consumer protections today and makes them harder to implement in the  future, which is why I urge my colleagues to oppose it.
