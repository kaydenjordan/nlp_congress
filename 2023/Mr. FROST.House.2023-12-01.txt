 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate and honor one of  Orlando's legends, the first Black man hired to teach at Winter Park  High School, the first Black administrator at Rollins College, the  first Black man from Orlando who was elected to the State legislature  since Reconstruction, the first Black chairman of the Orange County  Democratic Executive Committee, and the first Black legislator to pass  two constitutional amendments--Dr. Alzo J. Reddick.   A son of central Florida, Dr. Reddick has been a tried and true  tireless leader for our Orlando community and, importantly, for the  advancement of our Black and Brown people, and folks across the entire  country.   He was on the forefront of the fight to uplift the working class and  poor folks of our community, to extend educational opportunities to  students from all walks of life, and to create a world where our  community knows peace, equity, and equality. Dr. Reddick paved the way  for legislators like me to be where we are today.   Today, I thank him and honor him for all the work he has done for  every single Floridian.                            ____________________
