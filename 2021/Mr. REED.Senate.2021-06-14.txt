 Madam President, reserving my right to object.    Madam President, like the Senator from New York, I believe  that we should transfer crimes regarding sexual misconduct to a special  prosecutor, as the Senator of New York has outlined, and that is a  decision that many of my colleagues have made over the last few months.  In the past, they have been opposed, as I have opposed that approach.   The difficulty is the transfer of other crimes like burglary, arson,  financial mismanagement, misappropriation of government funds or  properties. Those issues have not been carefully studied, and they  should be studied, and that is the purpose of the committee.   We will take this up. We will study it very closely. We will also  look at something that I think has to be looked at seriously: How do we  implement this reform, and how much time do we need? The last time that  we made a major change to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, we  allowed the Department of Defense 2 years, and they took all of it. The  present legislation would allow 18 months. This is something we have to  look at.   We also have to look at the resources that are needed. This involves  a change in the structure of the military legal system, and the  committee is a place where we will get the best views of people who  have dedicated themselves in the Senate to thinking hard and thoroughly  about issues of military justice, issues of military preparedness, and  all of these things.   Looking forward to a debate, but looking also forward to, I think,  what  [[Page S4513]]  is becoming increasingly secure--the transfer of responsibility for  sexual assault and crimes of that nature to an independent  prosecutorial approach--it is something I think that we can anticipate  going forward.   And with that, I would object.
