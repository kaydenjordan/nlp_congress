 Madam Speaker, I rise to acknowledge  Juneteenth, which on Sunday, will be celebrated for a second year as a  Federal holiday.   Now, on June 19, 1865, news of the end of slavery finally reached  Galveston, Texas, more than 2 years after the  [[Page H5638]]  signing of the Emancipation Proclamation.   Now, my great-grandmother and many of my ancestors were born during  slavery in Galveston, Texas. My grandfather was born in 1867 in  Galveston, Texas. So this day has always symbolized a time for me  personally, as well as for many African Americans; a time for  reflection, as well as a recommitment to justice.   Each year, Juneteenth compels us to confront the darkest moments in  our Nation's history, a chapter that was born in the Middle Passage,  continued through slavery, and manifests itself today through systemic  racism.   We must acknowledge the legacy of slavery and systemic racism that  continues today in education and healthcare and a broken criminal  justice system. I could go on and on.    It is also at the heart of the crises facing our Nation today,  including economic injustice and hate-fueled violence.   As we recognize this important day in history, it is also crucial  that we pass Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee's H.R. 40 legislation to  develop a commission on reparations and recommit to an agenda for Black  America that realizes true equity and justice.                            ____________________
