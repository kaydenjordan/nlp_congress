 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 132 would allow a title transfer of two Federal  buildings to the Arbuckle Master Conservancy District in south central  Oklahoma. These buildings are part of the Arbuckle Project, which is a  water project authorized by Congress in 1962 to provide flood control,  recreational opportunities, and municipal water supply.   Nearly all of the facilities within the Arbuckle Project were already  transferred to the Arbuckle Master Conservancy District in 2012 after  the district finished repaying what it owed the Federal Government for  construction. However, due to some overly narrow language in the  legislation authorizing the Arbuckle Project, two buildings within the  project have yet to be transferred.   Transferring the two remaining buildings will save taxpayer money  that would otherwise be needed to operate and maintain the buildings  and will also relieve the Federal Government of any potential future  liability associated with the buildings. This is straightforward  legislation that should be quickly passed.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 648 would increase the amount of water that can be  stored in the Fontenelle Reservoir in Lincoln County, Wyoming, by  allowing the active storage capacity of the reservoir to be used. This  bill has been written in a balanced manner that respects existing laws,  compacts, and treaties, and does not attempt to expand Wyoming's  entitlement to Colorado River supplies at the expense of other Colorado  River Basin States.   H.R. 648 is a straightforward, noncontroversial piece of legislation  that is identical to a bill that was unanimously passed by the  Committee on Natural Resources last Congress. I support H.R. 648 and  urge its adoption.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   H.R. 267 is an important and historically significant piece of  legislation that has broad bipartisan support. In fact, it passed the  House on a voice vote just over a year ago. The bill accomplishes two  primary goals: to designate the Martin Luther King, Junior, National  Historic Site in Atlanta, Georgia, as a national historical park; and  to adjust the boundary of the park to include the Prince Hall Masonic  Temple, the first headquarters of the Southern Christian Leadership  Conference. Taken together, these actions will enhance the National  Park Service's ability to tell and elevate the story of Dr. King.   The site, which is the final resting place of the great civil rights  leader, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., continues to connect visitors with  the historical and contemporary struggles for civil rights in this  country.                                time  1700    These stories are as relevant today as they were half a century ago.  By officially designating the area as a national historical park, this  legislation will provide the site with the acknowledgement it so justly  deserves.   Lastly, I want to thank Congressman Lewis, who remains an important  and iconic civil rights leader, for bringing this important bill  forward.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis), my esteemed  colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers. I  again urge adoption of this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
