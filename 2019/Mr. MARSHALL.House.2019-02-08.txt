 Madam Speaker, Kansas has deep roots in the creation of  the National Prayer Breakfast. President Eisenhower, who grew up near  my hometown, in Abilene, Kansas, was the first President to join  Members in their informal prayer event in 1953. Since that year, it has  been honored as a nationally recognized event and, to this day, every  President since Ike has attended.   This week, I had the great honor to attend the 67th Annual National  Prayer Breakfast, where we gathered to ask God for wisdom, discernment,  and strength, as well as how to lead this great Nation.   This country has always looked to God in times of need and will  continue to do so. And now, more than ever, it is important to pray for  a united Nation.   I was reminded this week of the scripture from 1 Timothy that  requires us to all pray for our kings and those in authority. But what  I had forgotten was that there was a promise that came along with that  request; that we live peaceful and quiet lives in all Godliness and  holiness.                            ____________________
