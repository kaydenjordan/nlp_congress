 Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to thank the  gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Foundations for  Evidence-Based Policymaking Act.   First, I want to thank the sponsors of the bill. I want to thank Mr.  Farenthold. I want to thank Mr. Kilmer. I want to thank Chairman Gowdy.   Blake Farenthold and Derek Kilmer were the key drivers of this  measure, and they made it stronger by incorporating their OPEN  Government Data Act.   Trey Gowdy and his staff--I don't know where he is. He is probably  working on his hair. Trey Gowdy and his staff--especially Katy Rother-- spent countless hours working with our team--especially Ted McCann--and  others to turn the Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking's vision  into legislation. All the members of this Commission did incredible  work.   I want to especially thank Senator Patty Murray for her willingness  to  [[Page H9289]]  work together on this issue. We may be on different sides of the aisle,  but there is one thing that we passionately agree on, and that is what  the government does, it should do it well. The taxpayer's money should  always be protected, and that is exactly why we came together to write  this bipartisan legislation.   So what does this bill actually do? It protects privacy. It improves  transparency. It ensures that Federal agencies are protecting the data  collected by the government.   The American people deserve to know and they deserve to understand  exactly what data the government is actually collecting. They deserve  to know that the strictest safeguards are placed on that data.   The driving purpose of this legislation is very simple: we are  requiring Federal agencies to prioritize evidence when they are  measuring a program's success.   Go figure.   Here is what we are talking about. Let's just take poverty, for  example. Instead of measuring success based on inputs, instead of  measuring success based on how many programs we have created, how much  money we are spending, how many people are on those programs, let's  measure success based on results: Is it working? Are people getting out  of poverty? Are the goals and objectives of these bills and these laws  actually being achieved or not?   By directing agencies to do this, no longer will ``we don't know'' be  an acceptable answer when asked if a program is actually working.   It is really just kind of crazy, but so much of what government does,  government doesn't actually see whether or not it is actually  succeeding at doing it. So we have got to get off of this input effort- based system, this 20th century relic, and on to clearly identifiable,  evidence-based terms, conditions, data, results, outcomes.   With this bill, we are asking the Federal bureaucracy to step up its  game. We are asking ourselves: How can we improve the lives of our  fellow citizens by better understanding the programs that we put in  place? How can we make sure that the money that is being spent on  behalf of the hardworking taxpayers, who send the money here in the  first place, is being spent wisely, efficiently, effectively?   We need results, not just effort. This is just good, commonsense  policy, and it is going to mean a real sea change in how we solve  problems and how government actually works.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this bill, and I thank the sponsors  for all of their hard work.                                time  1445    Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act, as  amended, would establish a framework to support greater access and use  of government data.   I want to thank Representatives Derek Kilmer and Blake Farenthold for  their work on the OPEN Government Data Act, which is the basis for  title II of this bill. I also want to thank Speaker Ryan, Senator  Murray, and Chairman Gowdy for their bipartisan work on this issue.   This bill would require that agencies make data ``open by default''  and develop a plan for building evidence in their agencies.   The bill would require that the Office of Management and Budget  develop a Federal catalog and inventory of agency data assets and that  each agency designate chief evaluation officers and chief data officers  who would work to ensure that agencies utilize data effectively.   The goal of this bill is to ensure that Congress and the executive  branch are able to make important policy decisions based on evidence.  This is not always the case. For example, take the Teen Pregnancy  Prevention Program. Funding for that program was recently cut even  though there is significant evidence that it works well.   If we are going to demand more and higher quality evidence from these  Federal agencies, it is imperative that Congress and the executive  branch advance policies supported by that evidence.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
