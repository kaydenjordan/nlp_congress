 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy  of a true New Hampshire original, a dedicated public servant, and a  passionate advocate for the causes that he held dear.   Renny Cushing, the Democratic leader of the New Hampshire House of  Representatives, passed away on Monday after a courageous battle with  cancer.   I served with Renny in the State House and I saw firsthand his  compassion, empathy, and good faith that he brought to every issue and  every debate. He was guided by a strong moral compass and a sense of  liberty and justice, right and wrong.   His loss leaves a hole in New Hampshire that can never be filled, and  we should all take inspiration from the legacy that he leaves behind.  We will miss our friend. New Hampshire will miss the tireless spirit of  a man who spent his life in the arena striving to make people's lives  better and striving to make hope and history rhyme.   My thoughts are with his family, his three daughters, and all who  knew him and were touched by his example.                            ____________________
