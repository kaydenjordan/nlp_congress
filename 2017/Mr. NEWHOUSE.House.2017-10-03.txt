 Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from  Arizona, my good friend, Mr. Gosar, for holding this Special Order and  for giving us the opportunity not only to address the House on this  very important issue, but also to address our Nation.   Mr. Speaker, this year alone, over 8 million acres have burned across  our country. And get this: ten times that, another 80 million acres,  are considered high risk to threat of catastrophic wildfires.   If this doesn't amount to a national disaster, nothing does. If we  don't acknowledge that it does, this will only continue to devastate  our rural communities across the Nation.   The previous speaker, my friend from Oregon, talked about the impact  of the health to people living in these communities. I could attest to  you myself, living in central Washington, we had smoke where the  visibility was less than a quarter of a mile for weeks at a time. I  knew people who had chronic coughs as a result of this smoke. Myself,  get this: I had to come back to our Nation's Capital for my cough to  clear up over our August break. The air was that bad.   So, Mr. Speaker, this evening, as you have heard from my colleagues  from across the Western United States, as we gather to draw attention  to this devastation, these catastrophic wildfires, what they pose to  our communities, so States from Arkansas to Arizona, from Colorado to  California, Montana to New Mexico, from Wyoming, from Oregon, to the  great State of Washington, we are here to stress the importance of  addressing the broken funding systems as well as the lack of  resources that are necessary to adequately prevent and then suppress  and fight these wildfires.    So we gather to highlight the dire need to reform the mismanagement  of our Federal forests, which leads to the exacerbation of this  devastation. Mr. Speaker, we gather to give voice to our often  forgotten communities and our constituents.   Now, you have heard these Special Orders before. We as Members of  Congress take these good opportunities to simply speak about a problem  and bring light to its actuality, to let people know about it, but  tonight is different, because my colleagues and I are here not just to  talk about this, not just to highlight the major problem of wildfires  across the country, but, in fact, we bring good news as well. We offer  solutions to this important issue.  [[Page H7740]]    So this evening, I rise in support and urge support of two provisions  originating right here in Congress, the people's House, to address  these issues.   First of all, H.R. 2936, the Resilient Federal Forests Act, which is  sponsored by my good friend from the State of Arkansas, Mr. Westerman,  which addresses the disastrous consequences of catastrophic wildfires  by utilizing tools the Forest Service and other agencies can use to  reduce the threats that are posed by wildfires, by insects, by disease  infestation, and dangerous old forest overgrowth that serve as a  tinderbox for wildfires.   This legislation would enable the necessary management techniques to  address our forest health crises and significantly improve the  resiliency of our Nation's forests.   On top of that, H.R. 167, the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, which is  sponsored by my good friend and colleague from Idaho, Mr. Simpson,  fixes the way that we budget for wildfire suppression by treating these  catastrophic wildfires like any other natural disaster, which they are.   Currently, agencies like the Forest Service are forced to borrow  funding from accounts outside of their firefighting in order to address  these fire suppression costs. This has become known as fire borrowing.  This tool was intended to be an extraordinary measure, but in the past  8 of the last 12 years, the Forest Service has had to move funds from  other operating accounts to fight these fires.   Mr. Speaker, this problem is systemic, it is dire, and we must  address it.                                time  1945    The Wildfire Disaster Funding Act is a necessary solution to solve  the crisis.   Mr. Speaker, the fourth district of the State of Washington, which I  am proud to call my home, has been devastated by wildfires in recent  years, from the Carlton Complex Fire of 2014, which at the time was the  largest in State history, to the Okanogan Complex Fire, which only the  next year surpassed that record. In addition to that, we lost three  firefighters in the process.   Our communities know what it means to live with the overwhelming  consequences of continual disastrous wildfires year after year after  year, and it doesn't have to be this way. We can solve this problem.   My colleagues and I gather tonight to shed light on this problem and  to offer solutions and to let our constituents know that we will not  give up in this effort.
