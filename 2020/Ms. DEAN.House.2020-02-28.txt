 Madam Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a  vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Madam Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Madam Speaker, as Black History Month comes to an end, I  would like to acknowledge some of my local NAACP leaders:   Ms. Val Ward of Willow Grove; Mr. Craig Brown of Cheltenham; Shaykh  Anwar Muhammad of Ambler; Mr. John Milligan of Norristown; Ms. Diana  Robertson of the Main Line; Mr. Johnny Corson of Pottstown, whose  ancestral farm in Plymouth Meeting was a key stop on the Underground  Railway.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank these and other local leaders for  their tireless efforts toward racial equality.   Today, I am pleased to stand here to tell you about a roundtable that  we held on Monday with Black business owners. As one constituent  expressed to me, they need allies; and so I stand here today as an ally  for the Montgomery County and Berks County communities in pursuit of a  world free from divides of race, ethnicity, gender, and nationality.   Yes, Black History Month is ending tomorrow. May we never stop  celebrating Black History Month. It is our American history, and it is  the pathway to equality for all.                            ____________________
