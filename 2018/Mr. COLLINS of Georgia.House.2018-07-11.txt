 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on  Rules, I call up House Resolution 985 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 985         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 50) to provide for additional safeguards with       respect to imposing Federal mandates, and for other purposes.       The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All       points of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not       exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair       and ranking minority member of the Committee on Oversight and       Government Reform. After general debate the bill shall be       considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. The       amendment recommended by the Committee on Oversight and       Government Reform now printed in the bill shall be considered       as adopted in the House and in the Committee of the Whole.       The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read. All points       of order against provisions in the bill, as amended, are       waived. No further amendment to the bill, as amended, shall       be in order except those printed in the report of the       Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution. Each such       further amendment may be offered only in the order printed in       the report, may be offered only by a Member designated in the       report, shall be considered as read, shall be debatable for       the time specified in the report equally divided and       controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall not be       subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand       for division of the question in the House or in the Committee       of the Whole. All points of order against such further       amendments are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill, as amended, to the House with such further       amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and       any further amendment thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 3281) to       authorize the Secretary of the Interior to facilitate the       transfer to non-Federal ownership of appropriate reclamation       projects or facilities, and for other purposes. All points of       order against consideration of the bill are waived. The bill       shall be considered as read. All points of order against       provisions in the bill are waived. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and on any       amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion       except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled       by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Natural Resources; and (2) one motion to recommit.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only,  I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Mrs. Torres), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on House Resolution 985, currently  under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring this rule  forward on behalf of the Rules Committee. The rule provides for  consideration of H.R. 50, the Unfunded Mandates Information and  Transparency Act, and also H.R. 3281, the Reclamation Title Transfer  and Non-Federal Infrastructure Incentivization Act.   The rule provides for 1 hour of debate for each bill, equally divided  by the chair and ranking member of the Oversight and Government Reform  Committee and the Natural Resources Committee, respectively. It also  provides for a motion to recommit for each bill.   Last night, the Rules Committee had the opportunity to hear from the  sponsor of H.R. 3281, Mr. Lamborn from Colorado, about his bill and its  importance for improving the management of water and water-related  facilities. We also heard from my friend and a former Rules Committee  member, Chairwoman Virginia Foxx, on H.R. 50, which she introduced.                                time  1230    Mr. Speaker, both of these bills are, at their core, about promoting  effective government and enhancing the cooperation and collaboration  between the government and non-Federal entities.   The Federal Government has its hands in a lot of things. That is not  always a bad thing, but we see far too many instances where Federal  involvement does more harm than good. That is why Republicans in this  Chamber are committed to reining in the Federal Government where it  needs to be reined in, to increasing its efficiency and transparency,  and to giving the American people a louder voice in the decisions that  impact them.   H.R. 3281, the Reclamation Title Transfer and Non-Federal  Infrastructure Incentivization Act, empowers water users and seeks to  reduce the administrative paperwork and liability Federal taxpayers  bear by streamlining the process through which some Bureau of  Reclamation projects are transferred to non-Federal entities.   Today, the Bureau of Reclamation is the Nation's largest wholesale  water supplier, providing one out of five Western farmers with  irrigation water and delivering trillions of gallons to people  annually.   Under the current law, the BOR is allowed to transfer day-to-day  operational and maintenance responsibilities to project beneficiaries,  but the Bureau cannot transfer title or ownership of any of these  facilities unless  [[Page H6054]]  Congress specifically enacts legislation authorizing such a transfer.   This legislation recognizes that Federal bureaucracy is not doing any  favors for water users or for aging infrastructure projects. That is  why this bill focuses on empowering local water users and incentivizing  non-Federal investment in water infrastructure. This bill helps reduce  regulatory paperwork and the Federal backlog on water infrastructure  repair, while increasing efficiencies for water users.   Where Congress can streamline Federal operations and increase local  control to the benefit of taxpayers and end users, we should act. H.R.  3281 is a step toward accomplishing both of these goals on Bureau of  Reclamation projects.   On the next bill, Mr. Speaker, the rule provides for consideration of  H.R. 50, the Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act. As I  mentioned earlier, this bill continues the trend of empowering State  and local governments and lightening the grip of the Federal  Government.   In 1995, Congress acted through the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act to  prevent the imposition of burdensome and costly Federal unfunded  mandates on State and local governments. That was a worthy goal 23  years ago and remains so today.   As a former appropriator at the State level in the State of Georgia,  I understand, many times, what good-intentioned work from up here can  do, actually, on impacts to State budgets and local budgets, and this  is a worthy goal for us to take up.   It has become clear, however, unfunded mandates are slipping through  the cracks or, perhaps more accurately, flooding through gaping holes  in the system. In fact, according to an Office of Management and Budget  report, unfunded mandates and Federal regulations cost States, cities,  and the public between $44 billion and $62 billion annually. Even in a  town used to throwing around big numbers, that is a big number.   Mr. Speaker, I know the communities in my home of northeast Georgia  often struggle to make ends meet. Local governments are rarely flush  with cash, and they have to make tough decisions about what priorities  receive funding, and in what amounts, in order to best serve their  communities. Unfunded mandates, particularly the unexpected ones, can  significantly hamper those efforts.   In fact, in recognition of this problem and in pursuit of a solution,  those who are most affected by the issue of unfunded mandates--State  and local governments--overwhelmingly support this legislation.   The so-called Big 7 organizations representing the State and local  governments and officials--the National Governors Association, the  National Association of Counties, the National League of Cities, the  United States Conference of Mayors, the Council of State Governments,  the National Conference of State Legislatures, and the International  City/County Management Association--sent a letter earlier this year  urging enactment of H.R. 50.   The Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act represents the  type of action Congress is supposed to take. It identifies a problem,  it acknowledges the need for policy updates, and it incorporates  stakeholder feedback in order to solve that problem.   The bill provided for by this rule closes loopholes in the Unfunded  Mandates Reform Act and applies the requirements of that law to  independent agencies. The bill provides for expanded input from State,  local, and Tribal governments, as well as from the private sector, by  requiring agencies to consult with the government and with the private  sector when they are developing significant regulatory mandates.   Mr. Speaker, the importance of this update to the law cannot be  overstated. I believe that the men and women eking out a living or  building a business on the ground know what problems exist and how to  remedy them better than the people who are currently residing in  cubicles in Washington, D.C.   When bureaucrats are writing regulations that impact northeast  Georgians, they need to consult with and glean insight from northeast  Georgians. They also need to understand that what works for northeast  Georgia might not work for southeast Georgia, Alabama, Nevada, Maine,  Ohio, or anywhere else besides where they are.   If the Federal Government is going to implement regulations that  impact private entities--which they do far too often, with far too  little benefit, in my opinion--those entities need to have and deserve  a voice in the process.   H.R. 50 helps give the private sector that agency. It also requires  rules that aren't preceded by a notice of proposed rulemaking to  undergo a UMRA analysis if the effects on State, local, and private  sectors total $100 million or more. The bill codifies longstanding  regulatory principles regarding cost-benefit analysis and when to  regulate, and supports more accurate economic analysis.    Mr. Speaker, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act was designed to promote  informed decisionmaking throughout the legislative and regulatory  process, in consultation with the entities affected by those processes.  Those goals are just as important, if not more important, today as when  the UMRA was originally signed into law in 1995.   Congress needs to take responsibility to help reduce the burdens  regulatory agencies have placed on State and local governments, as well  as private entities. Without question, Congress must work to close  these loopholes and reduce bureaucracy.   These are the simple concepts, Mr. Speaker: Unnecessary, burdensome  Federal regulations should be identified and reconsidered, and the  people and businesses impacted by regulations should have a voice in  the regulatory process.   I believe government can operate more efficiently and effectively  when we give local stakeholders a voice, when we seek to increase  efficiency and remove unwieldy mandates, and when we work to reduce the  Federal bureaucracy.   The bill provided for by this rule takes steps in doing just that. I  believe that they are steps that we in the House should support to help  American communities, citizens, and consumers.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  the time.   Mr. Speaker, I will close by paraphrasing a comment that the  Honorable Chairwoman Foxx made yesterday evening in the Rules  Committee.   By the way, I want to bring it back: There is a lot of discussion  that we are going to have, but, actually, the rule is about two bills  that my friends didn't discuss at all. I hope they vote yes on that, so  we can move legislation that has helped move the bureaucracy out of the  way, so that things can actually, with common sense, get done. We don't  choose to talk about that.   We have a lot of issues. I am in agreement on a lot of things that we  need to do. We need to fix our immigration system. But today, let's  remind ourselves on the floor what we are doing. It is a rule to deal  with two specific bills dealing with regulatory issues.   Ms. Foxx said this yesterday in far more eloquent words than I am  offering right now, that those opposed to the Unfunded Mandates  Information and Transparency Act are those who support unbridled  regulations.   I do not support unbridled regulations. I think there are some good  regulations, and I think there are some regulations that are necessary.  Far too often, we see the Federal Government flooding our community  with regulations that do little to achieve their intended benefits, yet  come with massive bills, and Washington expects the American people to  foot the bill.   Maybe my friends across the aisle enjoy that. Maybe my friends across  the aisle want that to continue to happen. Maybe my friends across the  aisle who want to vote no on this want to continue to see this happen.  We don't. We believe that there is a better way.   The bills provided for by this rule recognize the role of the Federal  Government, but they take needed steps to magnify the voices of those  closest to the issues.   I support this rule, and I support the underlying bills. I encourage  all to do so and look at it honestly from the perspective of those who  pay our bills, the people who pay the bills for this government, the  ones who go to work every day, who pay their taxes, who want their  government to do what the government is supposed to do and stay out of  the areas where they are not supposed to be.   This is what this is about, Mr. Speaker, plain and simple, bringing  it back to the truth of the rule that we are debating, and that is what  I believe is important.   Mr. Speaker, I support this rule and the underlying bill, and I urge  my colleagues to do the same.   The material previously referred to by Mrs. Torres is as follows:             An Amendment to H. Res. 985 Offered by Mrs. Torres         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the joint       resolution (H. J. Res. 31) proposing an amendment to the       Constitution of the United States relating to contributions       and expenditures intended to affect elections. The first       reading of the joint resolution shall be dispensed with. All       points of order against consideration of the joint resolution       are waived. General debate shall be confined to the joint       resolution and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on the Judiciary. After general debate the joint       resolution shall be considered for amendment under the five-      minute rule. All points of order against provisions in the       joint resolution are waived. At the conclusion of       consideration of the joint resolution for amendment the       Committee shall rise and report the joint resolution to the       House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the joint       resolution and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and       reports that it has come to no resolution on the joint       resolution, then on the next legislative day the House shall,       immediately after the third daily order of business under       clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole       for further consideration of the joint resolution.        Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of House Joint Resolution 31.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.
