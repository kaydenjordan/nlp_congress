 Madam Speaker, mob violence is not representative of our  country or of this building. The American people--at least the ones who  are still up watching right now--have seen this body return to a  peaceful debate. And that is the American way. So let's get back to  that debate and let's talk for a moment about Pennsylvania.   For decades, absentee voting was reserved for members of the military  and citizens who are medically or physically unable to get to the  polls. But in 2019, Pennsylvania dramatically increased the amount of  ballots that would be cast in the Presidential election through  expanded, no-excuse, mail-in voting.   On September 17, Pennsylvania's Democrat-controlled Supreme Court  violated the Constitution by extending the deadline to receive mail-in  ballots. Article II states that legislatures, not the courts, determine  the time, manner, and place of their States' elections. But  Pennsylvania's high court directed the State officials to assume that  non-postmarked ballots were received on time without any evidence that  they were sent before election day.   On October 23, while early voting was already underway, the State  supreme court ruled that election officials did not have to  authenticate signatures for mail-in ballots.   To sum it up, Pennsylvania officials illegally did three critical  things:   One, they radically expanded vote by mail for virtually any reason.   Two, they removed restrictions when a ballot can be sent in.   Three, they removed signature verification on those very ballots.   Just this week, the Pennsylvania Senate pleaded with Members of this  body to delay certification until the Supreme Court resolves these  disputes. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania violated their own  constitution. They violated the U.S. Constitution. They opened the door  for thousands of unverifiable ballots.   Because they failed to guarantee the integrity of their votes, I  cannot consent to accepting Pennsylvania's electoral votes.                                time  0130
