 Mr. Speaker, Mr. Majority Leader, my chairman, Chairman  Neal, today this body is here to send a united message to the American  people: Help is on the way.   Yesterday, the Department of Labor released devastating numbers  revealing that 3.28 million people in America filed unemployed claims  in the past week. My home State of Nevada alone saw a 182 percent  increase in claims. That is unprecedented job loss. American families  need unprecedented relief to address it.   An important provision in the Families First Coronavirus package laid  the groundwork for expanding unemployment benefits. Now, with the CARES  Act, we are going above and beyond for our country's workers, providing  an additional $600 per week for the next 4 months.   No person in this country should worry about putting food on the  table or paying their bills while trying to keep themselves, their  families, or their neighbors safe.   I know the pain and uncertainty that losing a job or facing a  furlough causes.
