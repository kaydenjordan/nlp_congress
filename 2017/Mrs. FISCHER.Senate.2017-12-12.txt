Under the previous order, there will now be 30 minutes of debate  equally divided between the two leaders or their designees.   The Senator from Nebraska.    Mr. President, the U.S. Senate has the opportunity  today to vote on a nominee to the Eighth Circuit Court who exemplifies  the qualities we all seek in a judge.   Steve Grasz from Nebraska is a nominee who has earned the respect of  his peers. He believes in the rule of law. He has the education and the  training. He has the experience needed to prepare him for this serious  responsibility. Steve has a keen intellect and the humility that allows  him to show respect toward all. He has an even and calm temperament--a  judicial temperament.   Steve Grasz served as the chief deputy attorney general of Nebraska  for 12 years. In that role, Mr. Grasz professionally and capably  defended the laws of the State of Nebraska, authoring nine briefs in  the U.S. Supreme Court. He has earned the respect of the Nebraska legal  community. Timothy Engler, president of the Nebraska State Bar  Association, has stated he always found Steve ``to be professional,  civil, and ethical in all respects.'' In short, Steve is an outstanding  Nebraskan and a talented legal mind.   The scores of recommendation letters we have received for Steve are a  testament to his temperament, his integrity, and his character. These  recommendations come from a diverse group of Nebraskans, from political  officials to church pastors, business and community leaders, and  Steve's friends and neighbors.   Steve has bipartisan support from those who know him best. Nebraskans  from across the political spectrum have pointed to Steve's  thoughtfulness, fairmindedness, high ethical standards, and brilliant  abilities as a jurist. This includes former Democratic Governor and  U.S. Senator Ben Nelson, who wrote that Steve ``was an asset to our  state and Nebraskans benefited from having such a capable and  thoughtful professional in public service. Today, he is unquestionably  one of the foremost appellate lawyers in the state, making him an  obvious choice for this seat on our federal appeals court.''   Debra Gilg, the former U.S. attorney for Nebraska and a Democrat  appointed by President Obama, said:         Steve has always enjoyed a reputation for honesty,       impeccable integrity, and dedication to the rule of law. He       possesses an even temperament well-suited for the bench and       always acts with respect to all that interact with him.    This is a nominee who should receive bipartisan support in the U.S.  Senate as well.   I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to put their  lockstep partisan politics aside on these nominees and join with me and  my Nebraska colleague in voting to confirm this decent man of integrity  to the Eighth Circuit. I urge a ``yes'' vote on Steve Grasz.   Mr. President, I yield back all time.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, all time is yielded back.   The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the Grasz  nomination?    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
