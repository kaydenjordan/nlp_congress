 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, first, I echo the majority leader's  remarks on the tragic death of Matthew McClanahan last Tuesday. We all  know the Architect of the Capitol employs plumbers, landscapers,  painters, electricians, custodians, and mechanics. They make their  careers by ensuring that our buildings and grounds are well maintained,  safe, and beautiful. The stunning tragedy of last week has shaken this  entire staff to its core.   Matthew McClanahan died way too young. That he died at work in  repairing the Capitol's sprinkler system has hit our entire community  very hard.   To those who worked so hard to save him, you have our gratitude and  admiration.   To those who feel his absence so keenly in their daily lives, you  have our sympathy and our support.   May you remember the words of Scripture fittingly from Matthew:  ``Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.''   Our prayers go out to his family--his wife, Lauren; his 7-year-old  daughter, Evie; his young son, Matthew; and to his parents, brothers,  and sisters-in-law, and grandparents.   His funeral was yesterday, and I understand it was completely packed,  with some mourners outside and unable to get in. He was well loved. He  will be well remembered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I join the majority leader in welcoming  everybody back to the Senate after the 2-week recess. We have a lot of  business to attend to this week. Most importantly, we have to pass a  spending bill to keep the government open.   So far, the discussions between our two sides have been constructive  and are progressing nicely. Without interference, I believe our two  parties can come together on an agreement by the end of the week. The  four-corner negotiations--that is Leader McConnell, Speaker Ryan,  Leader Pelosi, and I--have been going very well, and a monkey wrench  was thrown into them.   I will caution: If the administration insists on poison pill riders  or extraneous funding requests, then our talks could get sidetracked,  particularly if the administration demands funding for a border wall.   Democrats have been long clear that the border wall is a nonstarter.  More than a month ago, here on the floor, from this desk, I warned  against including funding for the border wall in any must-pass  government spending bill. If the administration insists on funding for  a wall in this bill, it will endanger the prospects of a bill's passing  and raise the prospects of a government shutdown because a border wall,  we believe, is a pointless waste of taxpayer money for several reasons.   First, President Trump promised that Mexico would pay for the wall,  not American taxpayers. The idea that President Trump is fulfilling a  campaign promise when he says that America will pay for the wall now  and Mexico will pay it back later is untrue. He will only fulfill his  campaign promise if he gets Mexico to pay for the wall now. That is No.  1.   Second, the Trump administration has not shown us any specific plans  about how and where the wall will be built. How high will it be? How  much will it cost? Where along the Rio Grande River will it be built?  The President's own Secretary of the Interior, Mr. Zinke, said:         The border is complicated, as far as building a physical       wall . . . the Rio Grande, what side of the river are you       going to put the wall? We're not going to put it on our side       and cede the river to Mexico. And we're probably not going to       put it in the middle of the river.    Zinke said it well: How, where, when, and how many dollars is this  wall going to cost? Before rushing into it, we ought to see some real  plans, not just talk.   Third, the cost of the wall is staggering. Some estimates peg it as  high as $50 billion. That money could be spent a lot better elsewhere  on things like infrastructure and education. For example, with $50  billion, we could connect more than 98 percent of Americans to high- speed internet, more than double the Federal funding for roads and  bridges across our country, and update every VA building listed in the  VA's long-range strategic capital plan. The money would be better spent  elsewhere.   Fourth, there are much better ways to protect our borders--with  drones, fences, and other more cost-effective measures. The President  said the wall is needed to stop the flow of drugs, but drugs come into  our country in several ways, including by water, through tunnels, and  snuck in by cars and trucks. We have all seen the pictures on TV where  they hide them in the carburetor of the car, and no one finds them.   A huge, expensive wall will still have to have border crossings for  vehicles. A huge, expensive wall could still have tunnels dug beneath  it. In reality, a combination of drones and fencing and other more  sophisticated means would be a much more effective way to secure the  border.   Fifth, in order to build the wall, the President--the Federal  Government--would need to take private land, using eminent domain from  thousands of law-abiding Americans. Much of the  [[Page S2475]]  land on the border is privately owned. It is not owned by the Federal  Government. Eminent domain? A lot of people on that side of the aisle  don't like it, and we all know it would take a very long time to get it  done.   For those reasons, it is not just Democrats who oppose the wall, many  Republicans oppose the wall. According to a Wall Street Journal survey:  ``Not a single member of Congress who represents the territory on the  southwest border said they support President Trump's request for $1.4  billion to begin construction of his promised wall.'' That includes my  friends Senators Cornyn, Cruz, McCain, and Flake.   For the very same reasons, the American people don't support the idea  of a border wall by almost a 2-to-1 margin. A recent Quinnipiac poll  found that 64 percent of Americans oppose a wall on the border with  Mexico, versus only 33 percent who favor it, and that poll didn't even  include the fact that Mexico would not be paying for it under the  President's plan.   Now, I say to my colleagues and to President Trump, we Democrats  don't mind having a debate on the wall in regular order. We don't think  it would pass, given the amount of opposition on both sides, but  certainly a proposal with as many flaws as this one shouldn't be the  thing the administration uses to hold the government hostage and  certainly shouldn't be pushed through without debate, without regular  order, without answers to these questions.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now, let's talk a little bit about the  President's first 100 days. We are approaching the 100-day mark of the  Trump Presidency. It is an appropriate time to take stock of what this  President has accomplished so far. Unfortunately, it is not much.   In the first 100 days, so many of the promises the President made to  working families during the campaign have either been broken outright  or remain unfulfilled.   The President ran as a populist. I have said this to him. The  President ran as a populist against both the Democratic and the  Republican establishments, promising to stick up for the American  worker. He talked like a different kind of Republican who might be  willing to work with Democrats, particularly on issues like trade or  infrastructure. Instead, the President has spent the first 100 days  governing from the far right on behalf of the powerful and the special  interests he once campaigned against, breaking his promise to be a  President for the American worker--the forgotten men and women, as he  called them. It sure didn't take long for the President to forget them  too.   The President has broken promises or has yet to fulfill them in areas  that matter to so many of his voters and to so many Americans, whether  they voted for him or not. He promised he would drain the swamp, right?  He talked about it over and over again. He promised he would drain the  swamp, but instead he has filled his Cabinet with billionaires and  bankers. And listen to this: He has given out secret waivers that allow  lobbyists to work in his administration on the very issues they  previously lobbied on. That is not draining the swamp. That is filling  it up to the brim, going far beyond what others have done.   He said he would deliver better healthcare that would cost less and  provide more benefits. At one point, he said we are going to give  healthcare to everybody, but his bill, TrumpCare, does the exact  opposite, providing fewer benefits at higher costs, all to finance a  massive tax break for the wealthy.   He promised a $1 trillion infrastructure bill. We Democrats sent him  our proposal--a $1 trillion infrastructure bill, taking the number he  talked about in the campaign--over a month ago. We haven't seen any  proposal or gotten any response from the President.   The President promised he would be tough on trade, outsourcing, and  jobs. He promised he would label China a currency manipulator and fight  back against their rapacious trade policies which robbed America of  millions of jobs and cost trillions of dollars of our wealth. He hasn't  done that either.   The 2018 budget he proposed is a dagger to the heart of the middle  class, cutting some of the programs that matter to the middle class  most, including transportation, education, and scientific research.   So as we head into the 100-day mark, Democrats are going to hold the  President accountable for the promises he made to working-class voters.  We obviously disagreed with a lot of what he said in the campaign, but  he made a number of promises to working-class voters that we could have  helped him to accomplish. Unfortunately, he has abandoned those  promises in favor of a hard-right, special interest agenda.   We can work together, but only if President Trump and Republicans  actually seek Democratic input and are willing to compromise. Right now  it seems the President's idea of compromise is never talk to Democrats,  put forward his own Republican proposal, and pressure us to support it;  never talk to Democrats, that is, about the issues he is moving  forward. I have talked to him, but it is never on the issues that are  before us. That is not the way our politics have ever worked. Unless  the President's approach changes, the next 100 days will be just like  the first: a whole lot of talk and no progress, a series of broken or  unfulfilled promises to the working families of America.                            ____________________     Mr. President, finally, one final issue, the nomination  of Rod Rosenstein to be Deputy Attorney General, which we will vote to  proceed on later tonight.   I sat down with Mr. Rosenstein a few weeks ago and spent time asking  him about his career, his views on the Department of Justice, and  protecting the integrity of the Department. I came away with the  impression that he is someone who is independent, who would stand up  for the law, regardless of which party controlled the White House, and  his career backs that up.   With respect to the executive branch investigation into ties between  the Trump campaign and Russia, Mr. Rosenstein committed to me he would  appoint a special counsel to conduct that investigation if one is  required. He has developed a reputation for integrity. He has promised  to give this issue careful consideration. I believe, if he studies the  Department regulations, he will come to the same conclusion many of us  have; that a special counsel is merited.   For those reasons, I will be voting for cloture this evening and  voting for his confirmation.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
