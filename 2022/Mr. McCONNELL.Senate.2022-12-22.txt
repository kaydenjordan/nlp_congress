 Mr. President, before the conclusion of the 117th  Congress, I want to add a few of my own congratulations to the outgoing  Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, as she concludes her second  history-making and history-changing tenure as Speaker.   It is a cliche to begin these kinds of tributes with the obligatory  observation that the person speaking and the subject of the reflections  had their fair share of disagreements. In this particular case, that  cliche certainly applies in full. Over the course of our careers,  Speaker Pelosi and I have disagreed both frequently and forcefully on  practically every kind of national issue that comes before Congress. We  have led opposite parties. We have spent many years fighting hard on  behalf of policies, ideas, and visions that usually sharply diverged.   But all of the frequent interactions that have brought our  differences into sharp relief have also given me a close-up view of the  formidable qualities that fueled the Speaker's historic life journey to  becoming the first woman ever to lead the House and made her such an  effective advocate for her party's point of view.   Throughout our Nation's history, rising to prominence in Congress has  often seen leaders sorted into competing archetypes of either a  pragmatist or an idealist. But Speaker Pelosi's leadership has  resembled a combination of both. Even while working to synthesize the  views of the entire Democratic Caucus, the Speaker never relinquished  her own passionate, substantive set of convictions on policy matters.   Speaker Pelosi's ability to marshal her side of the aisle to support  specific tactics and outcomes has been formidable. It has made her a  powerful partner to multiple Democratic Presidents. These abilities  paved the way for the Speaker's instrumental role in helping to deliver  a long list of consequential policy changes. I have no doubt that  historians will reserve Speaker Pelosi a place on their lists of the  most influential and consequential Speakers that our country has seen  thus far.   On the very rare occasions when the Speaker and I did find ourselves  rowing in the same direction--such as our shared determination that the  House and Senate reconvene as soon as humanly possible on the evening  of January 6, 2021, and complete our constitutional duties  straightaway--I was glad to have this formidable leader in my corner.   I congratulate the Speaker on the conclusion of her time leading the  House.                            ____________________
