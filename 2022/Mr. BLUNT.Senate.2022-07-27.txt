 Madam President, I just was able to watch the  administration climb the inflation rate cliff, and I want to talk more  about this problem of what happens when the administration ignores the  warning signs that are going to produce the kind of results that they  have produced.   You know, Democrats, all by themselves, after five bipartisan bills  the year before to try to fight COVID and save the economy, decided  that the recovering economy needed even more help to recover and passed  a $1.9 trillion spending bill in March of last year. And that money  almost immediately went out.   You know, we talk about $1.9 trillion. I don't even know quite how we  compare that in a way that people can think about it. The normal annual  spending for the whole discretionary budget is $1.47 trillion. So in  one bill, in addition to the money that the government would be  spending that year in the budget that we vote on--the discretionary  budget we vote on--Democrats decided: We are going to spend that much  and more. We are not going to spend just twice the normal discretionary  spending. We are going to spend twice the normal discretionary spending  plus another 25 percent or so.   You know, we spend every year about 700, and last year we spent $780  trillion to defend the country. That is a third of the money, roughly,  in the $2 trillion American Recovery Act. We spent less than $700  billion to do everything else that we vote on. All of the debates we  have here about spending are spending that results in a little less  than $1.5 trillion of spending that is part of the normal budget.   So when you double that and then you add to the doubling of that, and  you put all of that into the economy at one time, you are clearly going  to create a situation where you have inflation.   That is what Democrats in previous administrations, like Clinton's  Secretary of the Treasury and people in  [[Page S3719]]  the Obama administration, all said--that this will create runaway  inflation. But if that wasn't enough, we hear that they want to spend  even more.   But over the next year, after they passed that bill, inflation kept  skyrocketing. Cracks kept appearing in the economy. There were plenty  of warning signs, but our colleagues on the other side kept pushing to  write the biggest check they possibly could and to write another one.   Their latest plan is a massive amount of government spending. This  one will be really focused on the Affordable Care Act, sometimes called  ObamaCare. Apparently, the Affordable Care Act wasn't all that  affordable or isn't all that affordable, because if you believe the  reason for this bill, almost nobody can afford it. If you don't get  insurance at work, it is almost unaffordable.   In the original healthcare law, there were government subsidies for  people who didn't make much money so that they could afford to be in  what turned out to be an overpriced system. But that law capped how  much you could earn and still get a subsidy.   The $2 trillion I talked about earlier, the reckless tax-and-spending  spree from March of last year, got rid of those income limits.  Apparently, the income limits--no matter how high they were--weren't  high enough. So they eliminated the income limits. Now the amount you  would get from the government would be based on how big a share of your  income you were spending on insurance, no matter how big that income  was.   One study found that a typical family of four making $106,000 would  almost immediately--and did almost immediately--get almost $10,000 in  subsidies. Before that, they got zero in subsidies. Four hundred  percent of the poverty level appeared to be enough in the original  bill. That is the system that should have provided insurance that  people could afford, but, apparently, it hasn't done that.   The insurance on the government exchanges is so expensive in some  areas that people making half a million dollars or more could qualify  for thousands of dollars from the government under this new structure.  This, by the way, is the structure that the next spending bill is  supposed to be trying to make permanent or at least permanent enough  that people will get so used to having it that they will never want to  give it back.   The bill was called the American Rescue Plan. Its supporters kept  telling us it had to be big because there were still people in real  need and the economy was struggling. But we now know that while there  are always people in need, it is not because the economy is struggling.  Now people are in need because the economy is spiraling out of control,  and whether it is at the gas pump or the grocery store, you are having  to make decisions you wouldn't have thought you would have to make.   The health insurance subsidies in particular were meant to be  temporary--at least if you believed the reason that was given when that  bill was passed--and would only last until the end of this year. Now  our friends across the aisle want to make these temporary subsidies  permanent.    For purposes of the law itself, they don't want to admit that. So  they say: Well, we just want to extend this year for another couple of  years.   And, by the way, I think we are clear that when we get to the next  deadline, once you have had these subsidies for 1 year, as it turns  out--let alone 2 or 3 more--the whole idea is to get people so  committed to getting this money that the government will never back up  and take it away.   It is just a budget gimmick--everybody knows that--a gimmick to  extend the program to further redistribute taxpayer money to people who  are making big incomes but have decided it is better for the government  to pay for their insurance than it is to pay for their insurance  themselves.   This doesn't relate to everybody. In fact, the 400 percent of  poverty, which many people thought at the time, and still think, sounds  like an income where you ought to be able to pay your own insurance-- and, if you can't, there must be something wrong with the healthcare  system. In fact, last year, my colleague from West Virginia, Senator  Manchin, said he had serious problems with another version of this bill  because there wasn't a cap. He said: ``What I see are shell games-- budget gimmicks that make the real cost of the so-called $1.75 trillion  bill estimated to be almost twice that'' much during the full time of  the bill.   So the Congressional Budget Office looked into this health insurance  study plan or subsidy plan. They found that when it actually gets  extended, this extension over 10 years costs another $250 billion. If  we have people who are making more than 400 percent of poverty--in  fact, if we have people who are unlimited in their income--who somehow  need to have government help to buy insurance, we ought to figure out  what happened with the insurance marketplace that ObamaCare created.   The CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, figured that $36 million of  that $250 million would go to people who make more than 400 percent of  poverty, which works out to be about $140,000 for a family of 4. They  also say that 48 percent of the new people entering the program would  be making more income than that $140,000 level.   Even if you think someone who makes $140,000 is low income--as maybe  our friends on the other side of the aisle do--and deserves a handout  from taxpayers to buy their insurance, again, I would say there must be  something wrong with the insurance plan. If we have an affordable  healthcare plan that nobody can afford, that should be our focus  instead of focusing on making other taxpayers pay for the unaffordable  healthcare plan rates that we have.   The Congressional Budget Office expects 2.3 million fewer people, by  the way, to get their insurance on their job if the subsidies become  permanent. Why should your employer pay for your insurance if the  government will pay for it instead? Why would you pay some portion of  the cost of your insurance if the government will pay 100 percent of  the cost of your insurance? Another 200,000 people, because of this,  would end up in Medicaid and the CHIP Program, or the Children's Health  Insurance Program.   This is a plan to get people committed to something that just simply  doesn't work. All it does is prove what President Reagan said, which he  once said:         Nothing lasts longer than a temporary government program.    So we are going to be discussing, in the next few days, about how we  want this 1-year program to become another 2- or 3-year program, which  clearly would become a permanent program.   Temporary assistance in March of 2021 and the other things in that  bill that were spent immediately--that $1.9 trillion bill--fed the fuel  to the fire of inflation that we see right now. Combine that with  terrible energy policies, and American families feel it every single  day.   We don't need to do more of the same. We need to figure out what we  did that created this problem and stop doing it.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I am glad to join you and the other Senator  from Georgia, Mr. Ossoff, here today and join both of you in sharing  some thoughts about Senator Isakson.   Senator Ossoff has already said a lot of things that are easily said.  Not that they were easy for him to say, but anybody that knew Johnny  Isakson would make many of those very same points and, hopefully, make  them as well. I was glad to join him as the original cosponsor of this  bill.   Johnny and I served together in the House from 1999 until 2005. I was  the majority whip during most of that time. And he was one of the half  dozen deputies that really are key to getting things done. And Johnny  Isakson liked to get things done.   In 2005, he came over here to be in the Senate and brought that same  determination to get things done, to find the place--wherever that  place was--where something could happen. And he was a master at making  things happen.   When I joined him in the Senate in 2011, I was pleased to get a  chance to serve alongside him again. He was a fast friend and a friend  that you could count on. He knew how to bring people together. He did  view, as Senator Ossoff said, people as his current friends or people  who--the only reason they weren't his friend is they hadn't become his  friends yet. And that is quite a way to approach life. And Johnny did  it really well. I don't think there was anyone more respected by the  other Members of the Senate than Senator Isakson was.   In September of last year, I had the opportunity to join you, Mr.  President, along with Senator Coons and Senator Graham, in hosting a  bipartisan lunch that Johnny first started 13 years ago. I think we are  going to do that again in September of this year. We have Democratic  lunches, and we have Republican lunches. The Johnny Isakson lunch every  year was the bipartisan lunch. And I think that is a great tradition to  at least one more time do in honor of his service here and his  friendship.   He understood the value of sitting down over a cup of coffee or over  a meal, of talking to one another, of finding the things you agree on,  and then working together.   And one thing I found here--and I think one of the ways I found it  was watching what Johnny did--when a Democratic and Republican Senator  find something to do together and get it done, invariably, they start  looking for the next thing to do together. And their staffs start  looking for the next thing their bosses can do together. And it is an  infectious kind of thing that gets things done. And that was one of the  great understandings of the legislative process that Johnny brought to  the Senate.   I think when Johnny was in the Georgia House, there were a handful of  Republicans in the Georgia House when he got there. He told me he got  to be minority leader pretty quickly--maybe it was because he didn't  show up in the room that day before they could choose who their leader  was going to be. But he understood what it took to bring things  together. He liked to help people. He liked to get things done. He  especially liked to get things done for his fellow veterans.   Now, we are going to approach this veterans issue this week. And I am  sure we are going to get it done. We just had a discussion about  veterans and our commitments to veterans. But as chairman of the  Veterans' Affairs Committee, Johnny really led efforts particularly to  increase accountability at the VA. And there was an accountability  problem at the VA that Johnny was intent on making sure we got to the  bottom of it, to be sure that veterans received the care that they were  entitled to and the benefits they had earned.   Under his leadership, Congress also passed a MISSION Act, legislation  that gave veterans real and permanent choice in their healthcare. This  is something that particularly younger veterans care about. They want  to go to the doctor that they want to go to. They want to go to a  doctor close to home, or they want to still have the option, as they  would have, to go to a veterans facility or be referred from that  facility to another place where their care would be more easily  available to them.   But what veterans really want was the idea of having not just a pilot  project on choice, which was the case  [[Page S3736]]  before Johnny Isakson as chairman decided, no, we are going to have a  permanent process where veterans are going to have those choices in the  future. And so here we have just passed legislation designed to  designate the VA facility in Decatur, GA, the Senator Johnny Isakson  Department of Veterans Affairs Atlanta Regional Office.   I am certainly proud to join my colleagues today as we sought and  received unanimous consent for this legislation to pass. I really can't  think of a more fitting way today, as we talk about veterans, to honor  Johnny's legacy than to have his name associated with an issue he cared  deeply about.   Another issue he and I cared about and worked closely on was health  research and what was happening at the CDC. There will be a building-- the ground is being broken right now, as I understand it, for a  building--at the CDC headquarters in Atlanta that will also be named  for Johnny Isakson.   Those are two very fitting areas of focus for what he did for the  people in Georgia, what he did for veterans in Georgia, what he did for  healthcare in Georgia, and what he did for all of those things as it  related to the entire U.S.A. I am glad to see this legislation pass.   I yield the floor.
