 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a truly  incredible and historic individual.   Dan Cnossen is a textbook definition of honor and bravery. His story  began when he was accepted into the U.S. Naval Academy after high  school. In 2003, he completed the grueling process. Over the course of  the next 6 years, Dan was deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan where he  rose in rank to becoming the officer in charge of an 18-man SEAL  platoon. In 2009, late on a night mission in the mountains, Dan stepped  on an improvised explosive device and lost both of his legs. Later, he  was awarded a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star with Valor. Over the next  2 years, Dan fought for his life. He endured 40 different surgeries,  while simultaneously reintroducing himself into civilian life--neither  an easy task on their own, but coupled together creates one  extraordinary obstacle.   While Dan was in rehab, though, he was introduced to the sport of  cross-country skiing and biathlon. Dan pushed himself and was dedicated  to earning a spot in the 2014 U.S. Paralympic Team, leading to an  incredible--and ongoing--career. In 2018, Dan outstandingly won a gold  medal, four silvers, and one bronze. In addition to his 2018 medals, he  also earned the honor of Best Male Athlete of the Games. Most recently,  at the 2022 Winter Paralympic Games, Dan made his country proud once  again by winning gold in Cross Country Skiing Mixed Relay.   I think his motto ``keep going, keep covering ground'' beautifully  sums up his journey so far and should serve as an inspiration for those  who get to hear his story. His Paralympic career has been remarkable to  see, and it is with great pride that I get to share Kansas as a home to  such an outstanding individual and athlete. I ask my colleagues now to  join me in recognizing Dan and his unbelievable story.                            ____________________
