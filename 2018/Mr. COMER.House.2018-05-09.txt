 Mr. Speaker, many Members have gathered in recent months  to remind the American people about the great impact the Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act is having on individuals, families, and our economy. I join  with them today to reiterate that reminder and reflect on the  accomplishments of tax reform.   We kept our promise to deliver on tax reform, and with new  legislation in place, we are finally creating an environment that  fosters growth in our job market, brings jobs back to the U.S., and  supports companies that want to compete globally.   Under the new tax law, the typical family of four in the First  District of Kentucky will see an average tax cut of over $1,700. Some  people look at these cuts as nothing more than crumbs, which is  unfortunate. A resident of Scottsville, Kentucky, shared with me that  she plans to use her crumbs, as some in Congress like to call it, to  put toward remodeling her house, updating appliances, and even helping  her daughter and son-in-law remodel their home. The new tax law lowers  tax rates on American businesses to help grow jobs, increases wages,  and promotes economic growth here at home.   Until this legislation was passed, the United States had nearly the  highest corporate tax rate in the world, making U.S. businesses  uncompetitive, stunting economic growth, and sending jobs and profits  overseas. Now many businesses across the U.S. are demonstrating how a  lower tax rate helps boost business and the workforce.   One story of success from my district comes from Casey Jones  Distillery in Hopkinsville, Kentucky. Miss Peg Jones, who works at the  distillery, stated that they have already made plans to reinvest in the  distillery for new space, employees, production, and barreling. This is  all made possible by craft beverage modernization provisions in the tax  bill which reduce taxes across the board, especially for small  distilleries like Casey Jones.   Computer Services, Inc., or CSI, out of Paducah, Kentucky, which  provides financial technology solutions, has acknowledged the positive  effects of a reduced corporate tax rate, which has allowed them to  reinvest in their employees in the form of bonuses and contributions to  retirement plans.   The changes we have made to the Tax Code incentivize businesses to  invest in new equipment and facilities. This is good news for  businesses and communities throughout my district  [[Page H3840]]  and across the Nation. An employer in my district shared with me how  the new 100 percent expensing provision has helped their customers  afford more of the products they sell, which has, in turn, boosted  their business.   Each time I return to my district, I hear about the different ways  families and businesses are utilizing savings from the Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act. Delivering on these reforms was long overdue, but the tax  reform is truly working for the American people. After more than 30  years, Americans are finally able to reap the benefits of a simplified  Tax Code that cuts middle class taxes and supports expanding  businesses. I am thrilled to see the continued success of tax reform  and am eager to see more lasting changes that will strengthen our  workforce and economy.                            ____________________
