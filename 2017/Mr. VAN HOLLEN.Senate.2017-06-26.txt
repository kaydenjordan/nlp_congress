 Mr. President, I wish to start by thanking my  colleague from the State of Connecticut for bringing those powerful  testimonies to the floor of the Senate. It is really important that all  of us--all 100 of us--spend time back home in our States listening to  people who are telling us those kinds of stories.   I have received over 2,500 calls in my office just since Thursday,  all of them strongly opposed to this so-called healthcare proposal.   Some things improve with time. Some things improve with age, like red  wine. Some things get stinkier and smellier the longer they sit out  there, like rotten things. That is the case with the series of  Republican so-called healthcare bills, TrumpCare 1, TrumpCare 2.0, and  now, TrumpCare 3.0. They are all rotten to the core, and the more they  sit out there, the stinkier they get, and the American people know it.   If you had any doubts, take a look at the most recent Congressional  Budget Office report we got today. There is a pretty clear pattern  between all of these Congressional Budget Office reports and the first  bill we saw and the second bill and now on this latest version.   Here is the pattern. Tens of millions of Americans will lose access  to affordable healthcare in the United States of America in order to  provide tax breaks for powerful special interests and richer Americans.  That is the pattern. In this most recent report, we are told by the  nonpartisan professionals at the Congressional Budget Office that 22  million of our fellow Americans are going to lose access to affordable  healthcare. For what? To give powerful special interests and wealthy  Americans a tax break.   Insurance companies currently are not allowed to deduct the bonuses  they pay to their CEOs. Now you are going to allow insurance companies  to deduct the bonuses they pay to CEOs, and while tens of millions of  Americans will lose access to affordable care, millionaires in America  will get an average annual tax break of $50,000 a year, every year.   So make no mistake. You can call this a healthcare bill, but it has  nothing to do with healthcare and everything to do with wealth care and  transferring wealth from more struggling vulnerable Americans to the  very wealthy.   If this were about healthcare, why is it that we have all received in  our offices long lists from patient advocacy organizations that are  dead-set against this legislation? These are organizations that have  been dedicated to trying to improve healthcare for people and patients  in our country: the American Cancer Society, the American Diabetes  Association, the American Heart Association, the American Lung  Association, National Alliance on Mental Illness, National Breast  Cancer Coalition, and National Multiple Sclerosis Society. The list  goes on and on from organizations that have dedicated themselves to  advancing patient health.   On the other side, I haven't seen a single--not one--patient advocacy  group that has come out to support this so-called healthcare bill. How  can that be? If this is good for the health of our fellow citizens, why  is it we have a long list of organizations dedicated to that cause  against it and not one for it?   How about healthcare providers, the folks who help provide the care  to our constituents? They are all dead-set against it: the nurses, the  doctors, the hospitals, the people who have that network of care.   I was just out on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, a rural part of our  State. The National Rural Health Association is opposed to this bill.  They know the people they serve are going to be badly hurt, and, by the  way, it is also going to hurt the economies in those parts of our  State, especially the rural parts of the States, because those  hospitals depend heavily on many of the people who get help through the  Affordable Care Act, whether through the exchanges or through expanded  Medicaid. As those patients come in the door and no longer can pay for  their care, those hospitals said they may have to close down operations  and lay people off. It is a double whammy--bad for patients and bad for  those who provide the care to our patients.   That is why AARP has been all out against this, because they know  that for Americans between the ages of 50 and 64, before you get on  Medicare, this is a total disaster. As they have said, there is an age  tax. If you are older, you are going to pay a whole lot more under this  Republican bill than you pay today.  [[Page S3770]]    Many people are just realizing now as they follow this debate that  two out of three Americans who are in nursing homes today are supported  by Medicaid payments. So millions of our fellow Americans who now get  their care in nursing homes, where Medicaid is providing support for  two out of three, are going to be put at risk and made vulnerable  because of this legislation.   Remember, Donald Trump said he wasn't going to cut Medicaid. This  cuts it by over $750 billion. Make no mistake, on this issue, this  Senate bill is a lot meaner than the House bill. We all know that  President Trump out in the Rose Garden celebrated the passage of the  House bill. But behind closed doors, what did he call it? Mean. This  Senate bill, as time goes on, will cut Medicaid far more deeply than  the House bill. As we look at this Congressional Budget Office report,  it talks about how you get to the end of year 8 and 9 and 10, and you  go beyond that. You are going to have very deep cuts, much more  painful, much meaner than in the Senate bill.   We have heard a lot about preexisting conditions. The reality is that  the Senate bill is very devious in this regard. It is a great sleight  of hand. On the one hand, it creates the impression that if you have  preexisting conditions, you are going to be all right. But what it  pretends to give with one hand, it takes away with the other. It makes  those Americans as vulnerable as they were before the passage of the  Affordable Care Act.   I am not talking about those who are directly benefiting, like those  on expanded Medicaid or those in the exchanges. I am talking about  those who are benefiting from the patient protections in the Affordable  Care Act.   I just got a note the other day from Mark in my State of Maryland  saying:         My son was diagnosed with Crohn's disease in 2008, at age       18. He was repeatedly denied insurance and was only able to       cover part of the cost of care through the Maryland high-risk       pool. Obamacare made it possible for him to be insured and       care for this lifelong disease.    It was ObamaCare that ``will literally save his life.'' We have many  stories like this one from others who were denied access to care  because of preexisting conditions before the Affordable Care Act.   There is another major sleight of hand in this Senate Republican  proposal, and that relates to premiums. I have been listening. We have  been hearing a lot from our Republican Senate colleagues about how this  is going to bring down the price of premiums. We all know that what  Americans care about is what they are having to put out in total for  their healthcare. There are premiums. How much is the deductible?  Great, I got a lower premium, but my deductible is now $10,000. There  are copays.   Here is the dirty little secret if you dig into the Congressional  Budget Office report, after listening to many of our Republican  colleagues talk about premiums. Now, you have to translate a little bit  here because this is in the budgetese of the Congressional Budget  Office. What they say on page 9 is this: Some people enrolled in  nongroup insurance--in other words, in the individual market, the  people who are currently in the Affordable Care Act exchanges--would  experience substantial increases in what they would spend on healthcare  even though benchmark premiums would decline on average in 2020 and  years later.   So the translation is that in some cases the premium--that sticker  price--may go down, but you are going to end up paying a whole lot more  when it comes to your deductible and your copays.   It goes on to say that because nongroup insurance--in other words,  the individual market--would pay for a smaller average share of  benefits under this legislation, most people purchasing it would have  higher out-of-pocket spending on healthcare than under current law. It  goes on and on.   In other words, keep your eye on the ball, America, because when  someone tells you your premiums are going to go down, watch what  happens to all your other healthcare costs. The Congressional Budget  Office, the nonpartisan analysts, are telling you they are going up.   This brings me to my final point. I said at the beginning that some  things get better with time and some things get stinkier and smellier.  We know that the more the American people get a look at this latest  Senate Republican proposal--TrumpCare 3.0--the less they are going to  like it. The more they see it, the more they will hate it. Just like  something that is rotten gets stinkier with time, this will get worse  and worse with time. That is why it is so important that we not try to  jam this through the Senate.    I understand the Republican leader. He knows this is rotten to its  core, and he knows the more it sits out there, the more people are  going to see what it is all about and the more they are going to hate  it.   Let's have a full debate, and let's make sure all of us go back to  our States over the Fourth of July--to the parades, the barbecues, and  the picnics--and look our constituents in the eye and tell them that we  are going to take healthcare away from tens of millions of Americans,  that we are going to open up the discrimination once again to  preexisting conditions. We are going to increase their overall  healthcare costs, even though we tell them we are going to be reducing  them. Let's look them in the eye and tell them what this bill is all  about rather than trying to push it through in 24 or 48 hours or later  this week.   Our constituents deserve to know the facts, and we need to make sure  we vote to protect the interests of the United States of America, not  just provide another round of tax breaks to powerful special interests  and millionaires.
