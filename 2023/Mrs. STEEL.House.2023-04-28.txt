 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 48th  anniversary of Black April.   I am proud to represent Orange County's Little Saigon, which is home  to the largest population of Vietnamese in the world outside of Vietnam  itself.   During Black April, we remember the fall of Saigon, those who served  in Vietnam, and those who lost their lives fleeing communism.   The fall of the Republic of Vietnam is one of the greatest tragedies  in modern history. It reminds us that freedom is not free. It reminds  us that we are blessed to live in the greatest country in the world.   Today, I invite all of my colleagues to join me and stand with the  Vietnamese community in Orange County and across the country during  Black April.                            ____________________
