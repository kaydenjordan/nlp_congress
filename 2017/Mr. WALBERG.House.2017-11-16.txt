 Mr. Speaker, hardworking families in Michigan have been  squeezed for far too long under our broken Tax Code. Wages aren't going  up, yet the cost of living keeps getting more expensive.   We developed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act with those low- and middle- income families in mind. They need a break.   For folks in Michigan, in Monroe, Jackson, Charlotte, and all across  my district, this tax cut plan means bigger paychecks and more money in  their pocket. At every income level, people will see meaningful tax  relief.   Our plan doubles the standard deduction and increases the child tax  credit to help with the costs of raising a family. It also eases the  tax burden on small businesses so they can give their workers a raise  and create more jobs in the community. It brings back jobs from  overseas and incentivizes job creators to expand and hire here at home.   Mr. Speaker, this is a progrowth and proworker plan. Let's pass it  today and help the families we represent get the relief they need.                            ____________________
