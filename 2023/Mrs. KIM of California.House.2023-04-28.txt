 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 11 a.m. on  Tuesday, May 2, 2023.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to thank and celebrate  the 50th birthday and retirement of Ernesto Mendoza for his dedicated  service to our community, to protect and to serve the people of Los  Angeles.   Ernesto served our great country in the United States Army overseas  in Germany and then came home to serve in the Los Angeles Police  Department, with a combined total of 30 years of service.   He consistently operates with integrity and honesty and has  established strong, trusted leadership, retiring as a detective III  through various LAPD departments, including the 77th Division and, most  recently, South Bureau.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Ernesto for all that he has done for our  community, and I thank him for his service to our country. I hope  Ernesto enjoys his 50th birthday with his family, and I wish him a  joyful retirement.                            ____________________
