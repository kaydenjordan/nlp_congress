 Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to  honor a member of my staff. I thank Senator Fischer and Senator Manchin  for giving me an opportunity to speak at this moment.   MJ Kenny has been part of my team in the Senate for 9 years, and for  the past several years, he was a constant on the floor of the Senate as  deputy floor director of my staff. At the end of this week, he is going  to be moving on to a new professional opportunity.   Unlike many of us who work in this building, MJ actually is a  resident of the Washington, DC, area. He graduated from Walt Whitman  High School in Bethesda, MD, a suburb of the city of Washington.   Walt Whitman wrote in his essay, ``Democratic Vistas,'' the  following: ``Did you too, O friend, suppose democracy was only for  elections, for politics, and for a party name?'' Walt Whitman  understood that democracy is more than campaigns. Democracy is  certainly more than just yelling at one another. Democracy is a  process. It is a daily dedication to the institutions and norms and the  rule of law. Making democracy work takes skill and commitment, and it  takes many people who are willing to make a sacrifice and see the  demands for long hours and the demands for time on the floor as part of  their democratic commitment. This can demand great patience and great  sacrifice. I think Walt Whitman would have given MJ Kenny high marks,  as do I.   For the last few years, MJ has helped to make sure the Senate does  the daily work of democracy. I have counted on him to make sure that my  interests were represented on the floor of the Senate, that my  constituents in Illinois had a voice in the Senate, and that stories  about Dreamers and other important information be shared in the  Congressional Record with my colleagues and beyond. Making certain that  the information was floor-ready was a responsibility of MJ Kenny, and  he handled it professionally.   MJ and my floor director, Reema Dodin, are my dynamic duo who help  make things happen around here. Together, they are my eyes and ears on  the floor when meetings and other obligations take me away. MJ has also  been a big help to so many other Senators.   He came to my office 12 years ago for an informational interview. We  tried to decide whether we were right for one another. Luckily, I came  to the conclusion that this graduate of Northwestern University in  Chicago with a degree in history, who had already interned for then- Congressman and now Senator Chris Van Hollen, was a good fit for my  team and a good prospect to help us move forward. I gave MJ Kenny his  opportunity, and I am sure glad I did. He flourished.   In one year he moved from legislative correspondent to legislative  aid to becoming a key part of my floor team. In every job he has done  for me, MJ has been a steady, reliable partner. Even in difficult  times, he works long hours without complaint and with grit and good  humor.   In college, he studied history. In the U.S. Senate and on this floor  for the last 9 years, he has not only witnessed history, he has helped  to shape it. I couldn't ask for more in a staff.   I suspect that some of what MJ knows about patience and perseverance  he learned as a lifelong, long-suffering Baltimore Orioles fan. It is  like being a Chicago Cubs fan. Among his treasured possessions on his  desk is a bobblehead of Manny Machado, the former O's third baseman and  Golden Glove winner. Just as Manny Machado left the O's, MJ Kenny is  leaving the Senate at the end of this week. I want to wish him  continued success and thank him again for being such an important part  of my team over the years.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker)  and the Senator from California (Ms. Harris) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, in the early 20th century, hundreds of  emigrants left the Palestinian town of Beitunia to come to Chicago for  a better life. Many could not read or write in English. Still, they set  about succeeding in America and fitting into society, overcoming  obstacles in a new land, becoming salesmen, shopkeepers, and factory  workers. Miriam Zayed grew up in this community outside of Chicago.   Khalil Gibran once wrote, ``I slept, and I dreamed that life is all  joy. I woke, and I saw that life is all service. I served, and I saw  that service was joy.'' The call to service isn't an easy path, and not  nearly enough answer this call, but there are times when you meet  someone who embodies the joy of service. This was Miriam Zayed.   Miriam passed away last fall in October after a lifetime of  leadership. She spent her life fighting for Arabs and Muslims in the  Chicagoland area and the rights of everyone.   Born and raised in Chicago, Miriam always had a love of politics and  education. She convinced her parents to let her go to Chicago State  University, becoming among the first in her family to attend college.  But there was one stipulation. Her mother had to go with her every day.  Miriam's thirst for knowledge would not be deterred by having her mom  take her to and from school and wait outside her classes. She went on  to receive her master's degree from National Louis University in  curriculum education.   Miriam was one of the first Arab Americans in the Chicagoland area to  run for public office when she ran for District 230 School Board in the  1990s.   As treasurer of the Arab-American Democrat Club, Miriam brought all  local politicians and candidates to attend the annual candidate's forum  brunch and encouraged the Arab-American Community to attend and be  recognized as voting constituents. I have attended the AADC forums, and  promise you, it was always a full house, and Miriam was always working.  She never sat for the entire event.   Those that attended AADC brunches, events at the United Holy Land  Fund, or the Beitunia Club events knew the tireless work of Miriam  Zayed. She never sought the limelight, but all who knew her respected  her.   When she wasn't building her community, Miriam was teaching in the  Chicago Public School system in the Englewood neighborhood in Chicago.  For decades, she taught at the Earle Elementary School. She took her  classes to the Art Institute in Chicago, and for some students, it was  the first time they ever went downtown. She educated her students about  State government and introduced them to public officials. Miriam  purchased school supplies and clothing for her students too. Miriam  also somehow found time to run her own business as a certified public  accountant, helping people in the community with their tax preparation  and planning needs. She treated everyone as family.   The week before she passed away, a candidates' forum and brunch that  she helped organize took place to celebrate politics and the 2018  election. By then, she was too ill to attend as she had done so many  times before. The brunch's keynote speaker, Illinois House Speaker  Michael Madigan, reported that April would be designated Arab Heritage  Month by the State of Illinois. There wasn't a better place to make  that declaration.   In May of this year, Miriam will be awarded the 2019 Najeeb Halaby  Award for Public Service posthumously by the Arab American Institute  Foundation at the Kahlil Gibran Spirit of Humanity Awards. This award  is given to those who promote greater understanding and appreciation of  diversity and inclusion. Her decades of work for her students, the  greater Chicago area, and the many communities of which she was a  member make her more than worthy of the award.   Miriam's joy in service and love for her family and community will be  missed. She is survived by her husband Refat Zayed; her children Hythem  Zayed, Belal Zayed, Holly (Zayed) Murad, and Lena Hussien; and by her  brothers and sisters, Nancy, Zayid, Adele, Heyam, Hanan, Cindy, and  Dena.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the late Pulitzer award-winning historian  Studs Terkel in his seminal book, ``The Good War,'' described how the  Second World War helped give birth to a new middle class for America.  The GI bill helped make new things possible. One of those things was  the opening of the suburbs for everyone and not just the exclusive  domain of the upper class. Thanks to the GI bill, new suburbs became  places for returning soldiers and their families to earn a better way  of life. This is how Park Forest entered the lexicon of Americana. It  was one of America's first ``GI Towns.''   Park Forest has always been on the frontlines of progress. The town  won the All-American City award twice, first in 1953 and then in 1977,  for its work in racial integration and open housing initiatives. For  the last 20 years, my friend, Mayor John Ostenburg, has maintained this  tradition while leading Park Forest through a new time of transition  and anxiety. Now, as John passes his leadership to a new generation,  Park Forest has never been stronger.   John's vocations and career highlights were too numerous to count.   John was born and raised in Springfield, IL. Graduating high school  in 1963, he joined a Catholic seminary called the Clerics of St.  Viator, where he developed a lifelong sense of justice and humanity.  His expertise and interest in the studies of the Trappist monk Thomas  Merton earned the admiration of so many, and John regularly is  published discussing Thomas Merton.  [[Page S2426]]    As a young seminarian, John joined 35,000 others in rallying with Dr.  Martin Luther King at Soldier Field in Chicago and then marched with  him as he went to Chicago City Hall to post his demands on its doors.  He remains, to this day, a life member of the NAACP. Making a  difference has always been part of who John Ostenburg is as a person.  He witnessed firsthand the violence at the 1968 Democratic Convention  while working as a campaign manager for Eugene McCarthy's Presidential  campaign.   Upon leaving the seminary, John became a reporter at the Springfield  State Journal covering the African-American community. He would go on  to be an editor for the Joliet Herald-News, a sports editor for the  Tinley Park Crescent Newspapers, and a reporter for the Hammond Times.  He even was part-owner and managing editor for the Lockport Free Press.   What brought him to Park Forest was education. He took a job as  communications director for Prairie State College. John has been a  classroom teacher at the grade school, high school, community college,  and university levels. His expertise teaching and administrative work  made him an ideal leader in the Chicago Teachers Union. He edited the  Union's publications, chaired the communications department, and was  legislative director and chief of staff from 2007 to 2010. He also  helped move the organization out of debt into fiscal stability.   John's love of Park Forest and its residents always came through to  everyone. It was the late Marge Friedman Scherr, a legend in the  community, that talked him into running for the Park Forest village  board. She saw greatness in him. He lost in 1983, but he didn't give  up. He won a 2-year term in 1985, and after the board approved a  staggered 3-year term, won again in 1985.   In 1992, John ran and won a seat in the Illinois Legislature for the  80th District. He lost reelection 2 years later, but it was a blessing  in disguise. John returned to the Park Forest village board in 1997,  and in 1999, he ran and won his first term as mayor. He would go on to  win reelection in 2003, 2007, 2011, and 2015, becoming the longest  serving mayor in the history of Park Forest.   During his time as mayor, John helped Park Forest continue its  tradition as a place of progress. His visionary approach made the town  an All-American award finalist in 2000 and 2006. John continued Park  Forest's tradition of diversity by encouraging unity and equality in  Chicago Southland, earning a 2009 Award from Diversity, Inc. John's  expertise in housing is respected nationally, and he has served on  panels for the Brookings Institute on confronting poverty in America.   John implemented the Park Forest Sustainability Plan to help ensure  residents maintain high-quality life for future generations through  green projects that bring the community together. Under John's  leadership, Park Forest was the recipient of the Distinguished Budget  Award and Certificate of Excellence in Financial Reporting for more  than 20 years.   John Ostenburg's focus on service to others and the greater good is a  trademark of his lifetime. His role model Thomas Merton once said, ``We  do not exist for ourselves.'' John's career is a reflection of this.  Son, father, grandfather, author, and mayor are all roles in which he  excelled. The people of Park Forest, the people of Illinois, and I take  pride in calling him a friend. We thank him for his public service.  John will never cease being a servant to people.                            ____________________
