 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Walter ``Sticky''  Burch, who is going to be 100 years old on October 21. And that is a  great day, Mr. Speaker. It is also my birthday, although mine is just a  few years after his.   Walter Burch was born in Asheville but grew up in Greensboro and  spent much of his life serving in the Greensboro Police Department. His  service to our Nation began just 9 days after the bombing of Pearl  Harbor.   During the Second World War, he helped gather intelligence on enemy  operations in Europe, but his service to his country did not end there.   Walter returned home and joined the police department, where he  served for nearly 50 years.   He officially retired in 1981, but he ran for sheriff just a few  years later. He went on to serve two terms as the sheriff of Guilford  County.   Since retiring from law enforcement, Walter has remained deeply  involved in our community, and the people of Guilford County are lucky  to have him.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in celebrating the 100th birthday of  Walter ``Sticky'' Burch and his lifelong commitment to public service.                            ____________________
