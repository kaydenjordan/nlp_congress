 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank him for his work as the ranking member on the Budget Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I am about to say something that the American people  don't want to hear: the swamp is back.    Mr. Speaker, let me be clear: The swamp is back.   Every day since January 20, the Democrats have sided with their  special interest allies and ignored the real needs of the American  people. The result is the bill before us today--or I should say  tomorrow.   Congress won't actually vote on this bill until about 2 a.m. Saturday  morning.   Why?   Because Democrats are so embarrassed by all the non-COVID waste in  this bill, they are jamming it through in the dead of night.   We ran the numbers. The amount of money that actually goes to  defeating the virus is less than 9 percent. So don't call it a rescue  bill and don't call it a relief bill. If you are a friend of the  Speaker, you do pretty well under this bill. But for the American  people, it is a loser.   Let's consider Medicare. Tonight, the CBO confirmed that this bill  will cost $36 billion in cuts to Medicare starting this year. If  Members vote for this bill, I want them to go back to their districts  and look the seniors in the eye and look at the hospitals, those who  have been working night and day, and tell them why you voted to cut  their health benefits.   Or consider the blue State bailout. This bill calls for States and  local governments to receive $350 billion. Most States are not in  financial distress. Nearly half saw an increase in their revenue last  year, and some--even including my home State of California, and the  Speaker's as well--actually have a budget surplus. But none of that  money is tied to reopening.   Or consider elite institutions, Harvard and others. This bill calls  for them to receive hundreds of millions of dollars, but Harvard  already has a $40 billion endowment.                                time  2340    Compare that to K-12 education. This bill allocates only $6 billion  to help reopen American schools in fiscal year 2021. More than two- thirds of the education funding would not be spent until 2023 or later.   Almost every one of this bill's 592 pages includes a liberal pipe  dream that predates the pandemic. Let's check the fine print.   On page 97, for those of you who have not read it, it hands out  healthcare subsidies to illegal immigrants.   On page 347, it fast-tracks $1.5 billion to Amtrak. Now, Amtrak has  $1.5 billion from the last package they haven't even spent.   On page 306, it gives Federal employees up to an extra $21,000 to  help cope with virtual schooling. Let me read that so every American  understands: If you are a Federal employee, you get an extra $21,000 to  cope with virtual schooling. There are a lot of Federal employees who  are going to vote for this bill tonight. But if you are one of the  millions of parents outside of Washington, outside of the swamp, who  are struggling through school closures, including the 1 million mothers  who had to quit their jobs to take care of their kids at home with  school, and the fathers that quit, you are ignored.   On page 358, it funnels--earlier, it funneled less, just a little  over $100 million. But last night, the Rules Committee was able to add  more, up to $140 million for a subway tunnel near Speaker Pelosi's  district.   When you add it all up, the size of this payoff is jaw-dropping: $1.9  trillion in new spending. It is the single most expensive spending bill  ever.   But will it help people get back to work? No. Will it help students  get back in the classroom immediately? No. Will it help get vaccines to  those who want it? The answer is no.   It doesn't spend a third of the entire cost of the bill for another 2  years, undermining the claim that this bill is so urgent. This money  won't be spent for another 2 years.   It doesn't have any guardrails to protect against fraud, which has  already cost taxpayers tens of billions of dollars, including  especially in California. It just throws out money without  accountability, even though we have over $1 trillion unspent from the  last bill.   President Biden promised unity, but Democrats are delivering one- party rule.   Mr. Speaker, based on the facts, the Democrats' spending bill is too  costly, too corrupt, and just too liberal for this country.   To my colleagues who say this bill is bold, I say it is bloated. To  those who say it is urgent, I say it is unfocused. To those who say it  is popular, I say it is entirely partisan and has the wrong priorities.   Republicans will support whatever is needed to get America back to  work, back to school, and back to health. After 12 months of  struggling, suffering, and sacrificing, that is what Americans want,  what they need, and what they deserve.  [[Page H838]]    That is why Republicans will introduce a motion to recommit to  bolster the resources that families can access to help their children  cope with the emotional stress of school closures. And it won't be for  parents who just work for the Federal Government. It will be for all  American parents.   In every single district, if you watch, the anxiety and the fear for  children have risen, the 3 million children that now mark a year that  they have not been in the classroom. Our proposal would shift the $140  million from Speaker Pelosi's subway to grants that would be used for  mental health services for children. It puts children first, not the  swamp.   Democrats have conveniently ignored the education and mental health  crisis affecting our children, but failing to address it is  unacceptable. Families deserve answers. Tonight, they will finally get  them.   Our colleagues, it is a very clear and concise question you have  before you. If you vote for the bill, you are cutting Medicare, you are  cutting your hospitals, you are cutting your health providers with your  vote.   If you vote against the motion to recommit, which you changed, you  are picking $140 million that you just added last night to a subway  tunnel just outside of the Speaker's district.   So, who do you pick? All American parents, to give them the grants  and the resources they need to cope with their children's anxiety, the  rise of suicide, and their mental health; or do you think that subway  is really appropriate, right here, right now?   Make a decision. Is the swamp back, or do hardworking American  taxpayers come first? It is an easy question. It is easy for me to  decide, and I think it is easy for America to decide as well.
