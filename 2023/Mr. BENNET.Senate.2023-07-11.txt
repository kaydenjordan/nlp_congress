 Mr. President, I rise to honor LTC James Harvey III, a  Tuskegee Airman and decorated fighter jet pilot in celebration of his  100th birthday on July 13, 2023. Lieutenant Colonel Harvey flew as part  of the 99th Fighter Squadron in World War II before becoming the first  African-American U.S. Air Force pilot to fly in Korean airspace during  the Korean war. The U.S. Army was segregated when Lieutenant Colonel  Harvey joined in 1943, but his perseverance and heroism, both at home  and in the skies, continue to inspire us all.   Lieutenant Colonel Harvey excelled in high school as senior class  president and valedictorian. Drafted in April 1943, he was initially  assigned to the U.S. Army Air Corps as an engineer. It was there, on a  train bound for Fort Meade, he first encountered prejudice and  discrimination. While in the Army, he worked to carve airstrips out of  jungle terrain before applying for cadet training. He later received  his wings and commission in 1944 at Tuskegee Army Air Field. From  there, Lieutenant Colonel Harvey was assigned to the 332nd Fighter  Group's 99th Fighter Squadron, where he served as one of the original  members of the ``Tuskegee Airmen.'' The 332nd Fighter Group was noted  as one of the Army Air Forces' most successful and most-decorated  escort groups and helped encourage the eventual integration of the U.S.  Armed Forces.   Lieutenant Colonel Harvey's skill stood out even among those  decorated pilots. In 1949, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force arranged  an aerial weapons competition among the best pilots in each group. In  May of that year, Lieutenant Colonel Harvey joined his group's three- member team to compete at the inaugural ``Top Gun'' team competition,  which was hosted at the Las Vegas Air Force Base, now known as Nellis  Air Force Base. Lieutenant Colonel Harvey's team led the competition  from the beginning to the end, ultimately winning against teams flying  far more advanced equipment.   Lieutenant Colonel Harvey's service to the Air Force did not end  there. He was the first African American fighter jet pilot to see  combat in the Korean war. On October 16, 1950, he led an element of  four F-80s in close support to a bomber mission under adverse weather  to attack enemy troops three miles north of Yongsan, Korea. Flying at a  low ceiling of 800 feet, Lieutenant Colonel Harvey's flight found the  enemy encampment and immediately inflicted heavy damage. For this  engagement, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, along with  multiple Air Medals. His heroism on that day and on the 140 total  missions he flew during the Korean war will never be forgotten.   After the Korean war, he served as a flight commander, test pilot,  assistant group operations officer, flight safety officer, and battle  staff training officer for the Commanding General of the North American  Aerospace Defense Command, NORAD. Lieutenant Colonel Harvey retired  from the Air Force on May 31, 1965, joined Oscar Mayer as a corporate  salesman, and settled down with his family of four daughters in Denver,  where he still resides.   Lieutenant Colonel Harvey won numerous awards during his decorated  22-year career in the U.S. Army Air Corps/U.S. Air Force. These awards  include the WWII Victory Medal, Air Medal with 10 oakleaf clusters,  Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, and the United  Nations Service Medal. Lieutenant Colonel Harvey, along with every  member of the Tuskegee Airmen, received the Congressional Gold Medal in  2006.   As Americans, we owe a debt of gratitude to Lieutenant Colonel Harvey  for his heroism. His service to our Armed Forces, recognized by 11  medals during his Air Force career through segregation and  discrimination, is an inspiration for generations to come. It is in  this spirit of gratitude that I rise today to honor Denver's own  Lieutenant Colonel James Harvey III on his 100th birthday.                            ____________________
