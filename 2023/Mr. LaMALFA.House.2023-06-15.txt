 Mr. Speaker, Federal bureaucrats have usurped more and  more power over the American people in the last few decades.   Three-letter agencies now regularly enact sweeping unilateral rules  without congressional approval or consent of the American people. This  kind of governance is not in the spirit of the Constitution.   Congress makes the laws, the executive branch enforces the laws, and  the judiciary makes sure the laws are constitutional.   Agency rulemaking makes a mockery of this system of checks and  balances. This is why House Republicans passed the REINS Act. This bill  will allow Congress to rein in out-of-control agencies by requiring our  oversight over any regulation that is going to cost the people over  $100 million.   Congress for too long has abdicated its authority over these  agencies. It is time for that to end.   It has been devastating, especially to our rural economies in  agriculture, in mining, and in timber. It is killing small towns.  Instead, they are burning up because they can't get over the  regulations to do normal things like timber harvest, et cetera.   The American people elected us to do the job--not the EPA, not the  ATF, not the FDA--to make the laws of this country.                            ____________________
