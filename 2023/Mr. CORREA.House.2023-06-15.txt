 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service and the  work of Sandy Torres for a lifetime of commitment and service to Santa  Ana Unified School District.   Sandy was born and raised in Orange County, and Sandy attended local  Santa Ana schools. She started working at Madison Elementary School  when she graduated from college in 1982.   Mr. Speaker, 40 years later, she is still there, working and helping  children learn to become good citizens.   She has been a three-time recipient of the Madison School Employee of  the Year Award and was recognized last year as a classified employee of  Santa Ana Unified.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored today to nominate her as my Congressional  Woman of the Year.   We thank Sandy for a lifetime of service, and we honor her  commitment.                            ____________________
