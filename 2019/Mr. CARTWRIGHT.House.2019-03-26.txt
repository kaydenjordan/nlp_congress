 Madam Speaker, I read with dismay this morning that  the Justice Department and the current administration has decided to  continue to treat the Affordable Care Act as an unconstitutional wrong  committed by the House and the Senate and signed into law by the last  administration. I can't believe that they are taking this position.   This has been a long national struggle that we have gone through. We  have had this debate, we have had this discussion, and we have had this  fight. And to say now that it continues to be unconstitutional, the way  that they have said all along, we don't need to do this again. We have  10 to 20 million  [[Page H2803]]  Americans with preexisting conditions that depend on the workings of  the Affordable Care Act to keep covered so that they don't have to file  for bankruptcy when they get sick, so that they can move from job to  job without worrying about their healthcare coverage. Let's not do this  again.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues here in the House to reject the  idea that the ACA is unconstitutional.                            ____________________
