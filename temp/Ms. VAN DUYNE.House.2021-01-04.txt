 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H. Res.  8.   I came to Congress expecting to engage in vigorous debate with my  colleagues to ensure legislation was passed in its best form. I am  ready to legislate with Members on both sides of the aisle, but the  majority is not interested in bipartisan legislating or even permitting  the free expression of ideas. Instead, because Republicans made  historic gains in the House, Democrats are changing the rules to limit  their own Members from defecting.   Since the very first Congress, the motion to recommit has protected  the rights of the minority, both Republican and Democrat alike.   The majority would overturn a century's worth of precedent by  eliminating the motion to recommit and also pave the way for reckless  spending by forgoing critical pay-as-you-go requirements to fund costly  socialist policies.   Finally, and most ridiculous of all, Democrats are banning terms like  ``mother,'' ``father,'' ``daughter,'' and ``son'' from the House rules.   With so many tasks and obligations the American people expect us to  undertake, this proposal demonstrates Democrats' true intentions, which  is to advance radical liberal policies that have no meaningful impact  on the American public.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this resolution.
