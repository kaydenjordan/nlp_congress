 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  expanded child tax credit and in support of making it permanent.   I was so proud to fight for the expanded tax credit to be included in  the American Rescue Plan and to have made so much progress on ending  childhood poverty in my first 4 months in Congress.   Across the country we will lift 5 million kids out of poverty this  year. In my district alone, that is 12,000 kids who will no longer live  in poverty, and it is more than 44,000 families and more than 148,000  kids who will be helped.   But our work isn't done. It is unacceptable that we would let the  child tax credit expire and allow even a single kid to fall back into  poverty. We have the opportunity to make investments now that will  impact a generation of Americans. So let's expand the child tax credit  permanently. Let's invest in parents and families, and let's build a  better future for all of our kids.                            ____________________
