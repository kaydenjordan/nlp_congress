 Mr. Speaker, it has been 395 days since the  United States-Canadian border closed, and the closure was just extended  another 30 days.   Families on both sides of the border have been torn apart. People who  love each other, parents, and grandchildren are unable to see each  other. Vaccinated citizens of both countries significantly lower the  risk of getting COVID and wearing face masks significantly lowers the  risk of giving COVID.   We need a plan to open the U.S.-Canadian border with vaccines, face  masks, and good physical distancing. We can do so safely and  successfully.                            ____________________
