 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    First, Madam Chair, I commend Chairwoman DeLauro, the  gentlewoman from Connecticut, and Ranking Member Cole for their work on  this bill and accommodating a bipartisan amendment. I thank my  colleagues, Congressman David McKinley, Congresswoman Diana DeGette,  and Congressman Scott Tipton, for working together with me on this  quest for the past 2 years.   The Alternatives to Opioids in the Emergency Department program, or  ALTO, was first piloted by Dr. Mark Rosenberg, a doctor at St. Joseph's  emergency department in my hometown of Paterson--one T--New Jersey, and  hospitals in Colorado as well. ALTO tests alternative pain management  protocols to limit the use of opioids in emergency departments.   ALTO programs can serve as a new preventive blueprint for hospitals  and healthcare providers across America. As our health providers  grapple with ways to combat the opioid epidemic wracking every  community in our Nation, they have been working and achieving results  to prevent unnecessary use of opioids.   To build on these successful programs, we introduced H.R. 5197, the  Alternatives to Opioids in the Emergency Department Act, last Congress.  To help tackle the opioid crisis and limit the use of opioids in  emergency departments, this bill authorized a $10 million grant program  to fund demonstration programs to test alternative pain management  protocols. Thanks to the Energy and Commerce Committee, our bill was  signed into law as part of H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and  Communities Act.   This bipartisan Pascrell-McKinley-DeGette-Tipton amendment No. 2  would provide the full authorized funding for the Alternatives to  Opioids program. Our amendment has the support of the American College  of Emergency Physicians.   Madam Chair, I include in the Record their letter.                                                 American College of                                            Emergency Physicians,                                                      June 11, 2019.      Hon. Bill Pascrell, Jr.,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Pascrell: On behalf of the American       College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) and our 38,000       members, thank you for your steadfast commitment to address       the nation's opioid epidemic, especially your continued       efforts to promote your Alternatives to Opioids (ALTO) in the       Emergency Department Act that was successfully included in       the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act (P.L. 115-271)       last year. ACEP was proud to work with you to secure       enactment of this important law that will help expand access       to appropriate options to treat a patient's pain without       opioids.        ALTO is based on a very simple premise that the best way to       avoid opioid misuse and addiction is to never start a patient       on opioids. ALTO protocols use specific nonaddicting drugs       and therapies that target receptor sites and enzymes that       mediate the pain. As you well know, within two years of       implementing the ALTO program at a hospital in New Jersey,       there was an 82 percent reduction in opioid prescriptions.       More recently, 10 hospitals in Colorado established a similar       program and saw a decrease in opioid use of 36 percent in       just the first six months.        ACEP was deeply grateful for your efforts last year to       secure this program's authorization as part of the SUPPORT       Act, and we continue to support your efforts to secure       appropriated funding for this critical program. Thank you       again for your leadership on this issue, and please know that       ACEP stands ready to assist you in this effort.            Sincerely,                                      Vidor E. Friedman, MD, FACEP,                                                    ACEP President.     Madam Chair, let's give our ERs the resources to help  save some more lives. I respectfully ask the House to support my  amendment so that we may fully fund the ALTO program.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield such time as she may consume to  the distinguished gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).    Madam Chair, I thank my colleagues for the support. I  urge the passage of the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
