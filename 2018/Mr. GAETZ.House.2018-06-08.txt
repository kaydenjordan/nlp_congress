 Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the 100-year  anniversary of the independence of Azerbaijan and to highlight the  significance and importance of the U.S.-Azerbaijan relationship.   Throughout its history, Azerbaijan has resisted invasion from the  Soviet Union. They were pioneers in advancing the cause of women's  suffrage. Day in and day out, Azerbaijan cooperates on defense,  counterintelligence, and counterterrorism activities. Azerbaijan  established the first secular parliamentary democracy in the Muslim  world. They have offered unconditional support to the United States  after 9/11.   Here is to another 100 years of great prosperity for the people of  Azerbaijan and a strong relationship with the United States.                            ____________________
