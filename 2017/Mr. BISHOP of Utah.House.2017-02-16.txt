 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I  demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground  that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum  is not present.    Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Republican  Conference, I offer a privileged resolution and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 131         Resolved, That the following named Members be, and are       hereby, elected to the following standing committees of the       House of Representatives:        Committee on the Budget: Mr. Smith of Missouri, to rank       immediately after Mr. Johnson of Ohio.        Committee on Education and the Workforce: Mr. Russell, to       rank immediately after Mr. Grothman.        Committee on Ways and Means: Mr. Bishop of Michigan.    Mr. BISHOP of Utah (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that the resolution be considered as read and printed in the  Record.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 123, I  [[Page H1260]]  call up the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 69) providing for congressional  disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the  final rule of the Department of the Interior relating to ``Non- Subsistence Take of Wildlife, and Public Participation and Closure  Procedures, on National Wildlife Refuges in Alaska'', and ask for its  immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.J. Res. 69.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman  from Alaska (Mr. Young), the only Member of Congress in the House from  Alaska, the dean of the Republican side.   (Mr. YOUNG of Alaska asked and was given permission to revise and  extend his remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman  from South Carolina (Mr. Duncan).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. McClintock), the chairman of the Subcommittee on  Federal Lands in our full committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman), the vice chairman of the Federal Lands  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman  from Arizona (Mr. Gosar), a member of our committee, who is also going  to talk about the reality of what we are facing here.    I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia  (Mr. Austin Scott).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  [[Page H1267]]  from Alaska (Mr. Young), the one who actually lives there and knows the  area and knows the names of the towns.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Madam Speaker, we are here to repeal a rule issued by the Federal  Fish and Wildlife Service to restrict hunting on the national wildlife  refuges in Alaska.   This rule is a solution. The only problem is no one knows for what it  is a solution because there is no problem. And the sad part is that  means that this rule is basically a useless rule. It has no efficacy to  it. Despite the assertions that had been made repeatedly and a  cacophony of all sorts of practices that are seeming to be wrong and  bad, this rule doesn't do that.   This rule does not abandon any of the practices you are talking about  on subsistence hunting, only on nonsubsistence hunting, which simply  means that, if you are classified as a subsistence hunter, anything  that the other side talked about and raled about is actually allowed by  the silly rule. That is why the rule makes no sense.   The State of Alaska had it under control, and there is no real  problem that is solved by this rule that is totally inefficient, but  did make something nice about it.   Now, it makes things worse because it is talking about predator  control only on nonsubsistence hunting. Unfortunately, the predators  don't know, when they go after their prey, whether that prey is  designed for a subsistence hunter or a recreation hunter. They haven't  learned to distinguish that yet.   Ergo, how you administer this law is totally ineffective. It is  impossible to do so, and what you do is simply make a blanket approach  so that everyone gets harmed in the same equal fashion. That is what  Fish and Wildlife has decided to do.   In addition to that, yes, it is illegal. It usurps State authority,  and it usurps it very clearly. You know, it is amazing to me. I cannot  believe that in the first Congress that we had, the Founding Fathers  were there coming up with the Bill of Rights and the 10th Amendment,  they thought the 10th Amendment would eventually some day be imagined  by a bureaucrat in Washington to overrule Congress on matters that were  clearly intended for State discretion, but that is precisely what we  have done here.   This rule violates three congressionally passed statutes that have  precedence on this particular issue. And this rule violates Federal law  passed by Congress on three separate occasions.   What was supposed to be envisioned with this system was a cooperative  relationship between the State and the Federal Government. What this  rule simply does is allow for Fish and Wildlife on the Federal level to  have supremacy, to destroy that cooperation and coordination and take  over control totally. That is wrong. It should never be there.    There are 16 different refuges up there. That is 76 million acres of  land now going to be controlled by the Fish and Wildlife system here in  Washington. That is more acreage than 46 of the 50 States that we have.  And, once again, for many of those people, this hunting is a source of  subsistence up there.   Here is the bottom line: Mr. Blumenauer came up here and said, why  don't we let the professionals make their decisions. They do. Those  professionals are the Alaska Department of Fish and Game who know  exactly what they are doing, they know the area, and they know the  animals.   The so-called helicopter hunting that was raled against up here is  not done by any recreational hunter. Alaska doesn't allow that. The  Alaska Fish and Game will do that for management control based on  scientific purposes and reasons and that only.   This rule doesn't change any of that. No. I'm sorry, this rule  actually doesn't change any of the recreational hunting, which is  already outlawed by the State of Alaska. It only stops the Fish and  Wildlife system of Alaska from simply doing their job as they know how  to do it.   I include in the Record a letter supported by 27 different  organizations all dealing with outdoor life in support of this  particular resolution.                                                  February 6, 2017.      Hon. Paul D. Ryan, Speaker, House of Representatives      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy, Majority Leader, House of         Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader McCarthy: We write       representing organizations that collectively include millions       of wildlife conservationists, hunter conservationists,       wildlife enthusiasts, and wildlife scientists, in strong       support of H.J. Res. 49 from Cong. Young (AK), which would       nullify the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's (FWS) final rule       ``Non-Subsistence Take of Wildlife, and Public Participation       and Closure Procedures, on National Wildlife Refuges in       Alaska'' (81 Fed. Reg. 52248 (August 5, 2016)). Our community       exhausted all Executive Branch appeals and remedies urging       the FWS to slow down the Proposed Rule, and revise it to       reflect a proposal mutually agreed to by the State of Alaska       and the FWS; all to no end. It is time for Congress to       nullify this final rule.        This final rule boldly preempts the authority of the Alaska       Department of Fish and Game to manage wildlife for both       recreational and subsistence hunting on NWRs, which authority       of the state is affirmed by Congress in the Alaska Statehood       Act, the Alaska National Interests Land Conservation Act, and       the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act. The FWS       final rule was premised on meeting as a priority the FWS       policy on Biological Integrity, Diversity and Environmental       Health; which  [[Page H1268]]       would inadvisably set a precedent nationally. Many members of       our organizations enjoy Alaska's bounty of fish and wildlife       resources and their habitats for unrivaled hunting, fishing       and outdoor experiences. The sustainable management of these       natural resources needs to be led by the State working in       cooperation with the FWS. We urge that you favorably consider       H.J. Res. 49 which will restore the jurisdictional state-      federal relationship as Congress has previously directed.        Thank you very much for your consideration of our concerns       about this harmful and illegal rule which if left un-      remedied, significantly affects the use and appreciation of       the magnificent natural resources found in Alaska.            Sincerely,        Archery Trade Association, Association of Fish and Wildlife       Agencies, Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation, Council to       Advance Hunting and the Shooting Sports, Dallas Safari Club,       Delta Waterfowl Foundation, Ducks Unlimited, Houston Safari       Club, Masters of Foxhounds Association, Mule Deer Foundation,       National Rifle Association, National Shooting Sports       Foundation, National Trappers Association, National Wild       Turkey Federation, Orion the Hunter's Institute.

Madam Speaker, this comes from groups all over  the Nation who understand what is going on and also realize the problem  of this--I mean, there are some people who might think this only deals  with Alaska. Technically, it does.   The problem is, if this happens to Alaska, if the ability of the  Federal Government to supersede the State happens in Alaska, this could  also happen to anyone of the lower 48 States.   We are simply one lawsuit away from Fish and Wildlife Service being  either allowed or required to order similar regulations for everything  across the lower 48 States as well. And that is what is so difficult  and impossible to understand.   Look, let me try and sum it up this way: None of the practices that  have been railed about today actually are existing, and any of those  that are are easily controlled by the Alaska Department of Fish and  Game.   The underlying premise, both of the rule that the Fish and Wildlife  Service of the Department of the Interior did and the underlying  premise of most of the debate that has happened here on the floor, is  that only somebody who lives here in Washington has the intelligence,  the foresight, the vision to make these kind of rules that  unfortunately people in Alaska are simply too dumb to do it. You are a  bunch of redneck hicks that don't understand how to rule yourself. You  don't understand science. You barely have television.   I don't know what it is, but why do we have this mindset that only  Washington can make these decisions when actually the States have  proven, not only that are they capable, they are superior to what  happens from this Department here in Washington.   That is what this is about, an illegal rule that simply takes away  from the States what they are doing and what they are doing well; and  that is why this should be opposed. That is why this rule should be  pulled away. This midnight rule, once again, should be taken back.   Allow them to start over and do something intelligently. At least,  recognize the professionals--the real professionals who work in the  States to make this system work. They can do it. They have done it.  Allow them to do their jobs, and protect the rest of us from any judge  saying, oh, if it happened in Alaska, maybe it can happen in your State  as well. That is the fear.   This is a rule passed by Fish and Wildlife at the last minute of the  Obama administration that doesn't solve anything and will be impossible  to administer. It violates everything that has gone on before.   Vote for this rule. Bring back sanity and allow the States to do  their job as they are supposed to do and as the law prescribes for them  to do.   I urge support of this. I don't know if you are undecided on whether  I was for this resolution or not. Just, for the record, yes, I support  this resolution.   I yield back the balance of my time.
