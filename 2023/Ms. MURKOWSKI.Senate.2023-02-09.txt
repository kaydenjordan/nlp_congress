 Mr. President, I was in Utqiagvik, AK, also known as  Barrow, AK. It is the northernmost community in the United States. I  was there for what some describe as a Messenger Feast. The Inupiat word  is ``Kivgiq.'' And it really was a reunion, a glorious family reunion,  where the communities of the North Slope region, all eight communities  and actually neighbors from Canada, gather together during the winter  to celebrate family, to celebrate community. It is an extraordinary  sharing.   It is very similar to the sharing that they have during the summer  months, when the communities come together to celebrate the whale  harvest, the Nalukataq, yet another extraordinary family-type reunion  but one of a sharing in a region that is built on a culture of  sharing--sharing of subsistence foods, sharing of resources--and that  is what I want to focus my comments on today, the resources within the  North Slope region.   As I was preparing to leave Utqiagvik on Sunday morning to go back to  Anchorage, I was at the hotel and visiting  [[Page S280]]  with people who were gathered there for coffee. And as one gentleman  was leaving, he said: Lisa, I think there are just two things that we  need you to do. We need you to make sure that you protect our whale  quotas so we can continue to provide for the sustenance of the people  in this region, and we need for you to ensure that Willow is opened up  for oil production so that we can continue our lifestyle.   Some might suggest that there is some inconsistency between this  culture of a traditional subsistence lifestyle and the harvest of a  whale to feed entire communities and the production of oil in the  Arctic region. And I would suggest that it is not only absolutely not  inconsistent but absolutely compatible because it is with the sharing  of these resources that the people of the North are able to have much  of what we enjoy in other parts of America today: the opportunity to  see our kids educated, the opportunity for healthcare, the opportunity  to be safe in our communities, the opportunity to have economies.   So I am here today to speak in strongest possible terms of the Willow  Master Development Project within the National Petroleum Reserve- Alaska. We just refer to it as the NPR-A. And what I hope to do, along  with my colleague Senator Sullivan, is to further educate Members of  the Senate and really people around the country about this project by  explaining how it will help to benefit the nearly 11,000 Alaskan Native  people and residents who call the North Slope home, how it will support  good-paying union jobs, how it will reduce our energy imports from,  quite honestly, some of the worst regimes in the world, and why its  approval is both necessary and prudent.   And I want to start with a little bit of background just to put  Willow in context. Our NPR-A is a Federal petroleum reserve. It is a  Federal petroleum reserve. Its lands were explicitly designated back in  1923--so 100 years ago--designated under the Harding administration. It  is an area that encompasses 23.4 million acres. It is roughly the size  of Indiana up in the northwest corner of Alaska.   It is home to the Alaska Native communities of Wainwright, Utqiagvik,  Atqasuk, and Nuiqsut. These people from these communities have been  living in this region since time immemorial. They still practice a  traditional lifestyle, but they live in this region, and they care what  happens in their region.   I mention that the NPR-A is 100 years old this year. Yet it has only  seen a few projects, and those have been in the very recent years. And,  in part, ironically, that is because the Obama-Biden administration  pushed for the oil companies to turn their focus there. They explicitly  encouraged--they said: Go develop in the NPR-A--explicitly designated  for oil and resource development. They said: Don't go in the offshore,  don't go in the nonwilderness part of ANWR. Go over to NPR-A.   That is exactly what ConocoPhillips decided to do. The company first  acquired its leases for the Willow Project back in 1999. This was  during the Clinton administration. They started developing them shortly  thereafter, but they really accelerated that work during the Obama- Biden administration and then moved into Federal permitting in 2018. So  they have been seeking Federal approval for 5 years now.   Then, last Monday, the Department of the Interior published its final  supplemental environmental impact statement, the SEIS, for the Willow  Project in order to address two issues that had been identified by the  Federal court. So now where we are is, roughly, 30 days from now, in  this time period, the Department of the Interior will be able to issue  a final Record of Decision announcing its decision on whether and how  this critical project should be allowed to proceed.   So you have got this final SEIS. This is a document that has been  worked with career BLM officials. These are scientists. These are  engineers. They have decades of experience evaluating environmental  impacts of proposed projects. And they, together, with all of this  analysis over this 5-year project, selected a new preferred alternative  for the Willow Project. They call it Alternative E.    But keep in mind that these scientists, these engineers, these career  Agency officials took years of analysis and very rigorous review. They  had significant--significant--input and support--support--from the  Alaska Native communities within the NPR-A and the North Slope Borough.  So in other words, the people who live up there, the people whose home  region it is, gave that input. There was back-and-forth. There was  give-and-take. They listened to the Native people, and they worked to  develop this Alternative E. Now, keep in mind, the Willow Project was  already quite small when it was first advanced, in line with all modern  development on the North Slope. But what BLM's preferred alternative-- what Alternative E does is it reduces its footprint even further. So  from what ConocoPhillips originally wanted to do to now this  Alternative E is they have gone from five drill pads to now three, with  a fourth deferred to later permitting. The project will have 19 percent  fewer road miles, cover 11 percent fewer acres, avoid further--avoid  ecologically important areas. These were all considerations that were  taken into place and placed into this Alternative E.   So at this point, the total project will cover just over 400 acres.  So I have already shared with you the size of the NPR-A. What we are  talking about here with the Willow Project is that .002 percent of the  NPR-A will be impacted. It will be in full compliance with all of the  restrictions that are included in the land management plan that the  Obama-Biden administration issued back in 2013. So under that plan,  they effectively took 50 percent--50 percent--of the NPR-A's surface  area, some 11.8 million acres, they took that off the table to resource  development. That is already off. We are not talking about that. We are  talking about the area that is available now for development. The  Willow Project is just .002 percent of the NPR-A.   The Willow Project itself is not going to cover all of its leased  land, not by a long shot. There are areas that will have no  development--no development will take place. There will be areas where  development is only allowed with a waiver that would be required and  areas where additional considerations will apply before any development  takes place.   So, again, think about this. You have got 11.8 million acres of the  NPR-A that has been taken off the table. This project is 429 acres.  What we are trying to develop here, the project we are talking about  developing, is literally 27,500 times smaller than what has already  been taken off the table. I impress this upon folks because I think it  is important to recognize that this is an extraordinarily significant  project for the State of Alaska--for the resources that it will bring  to my State, the economic development that it will spur. It is  significant to the people of the North Slope Borough who call this  region home and who rely on the revenue and the resources.   But as significant as it is, the footprint for Willow is miniscule.  It has been meticulously planned to coexist with the wildlife, with the  tundra, with the subsistence lifestyle on the North Slope.   Think about it. You would not have the two whaling captains who were  wandering the halls here just this week--two whaling captains from the  North Slope who are advocating for development of Willow if they felt  that this was going to be harmful to their subsistence activity or to  the subsistence caribou hunter who was also being interviewed by  reporters and meeting Members of the Senate here just Tuesday to talk  about why he believes that this coexistence with development, as  proposed in the Willow Project, can proceed and is compatible with  their life and their lifestyle.   ConocoPhillips, in moving forward with this, will have to abide by  hundreds of lease stipulations and best practices. And best practices,  keep in mind, when you are exploring and developing in the State of  Alaska in the North Slope, it is not like Louisiana; it is not like New  Mexico. They are operating in an Arctic environment, which means you  have to work within the contours of the area around you. So best  practices mean that exploration is effectively limited to about 90  days--90 days out of 365. You have got a lot more time that you can be  building. We have to use ice ropes to help facilitate the exploration  rigs that might go out.  [[Page S281]]  You cannot be on the tundra when the tundra is not sufficiently frozen,  but then that also means that you have got to get off the tundra as  soon as the spring comes.    So these conditions, this scenario, is so different than anywhere  else that we produce in the United States of America. Even with these  lease stipulations, even with all that has to go on, Conoco believes  that they can make this extraordinary environmental commitment. They  believe that this project, this Alternative E, is viable for them to  proceed.   You know, if you are following the news about Willow, you would  probably get the sense that the support from most Alaskans is not there  because there are a few voices whom we see in objection. I get that,  but I will tell you that one of the reasons--probably the biggest  reason--that has helped the Willow project garner support throughout  the State is that the people of the North Slope who live there have  come forward and have said: We believe that this will be helpful to us.   It is not just those who are living on the North Slope. The broader  Alaska Federation of Natives has come together in support; bipartisan,  nonpartisan entities from around the State. One of the leaders in the  region, the North Slope Borough mayor--and I had dinner with him and  his wife on Saturday night. Mayor Brower is not only the mayor--a  pretty extraordinary man--but he is also a whaling captain himself and  is strongly, strongly in support of the Willow project.   In a letter to Secretary Haaland, he wrote:         Responsible oil and gas development is essential to the       economic survival of the Borough and its residents. Oil and       gas activities are the primary economic generator for our       region, and . . . by far the most significant source of       funding for the Borough's community services and       infrastructure.    To put that into context, when he says ``significant source of  funding,'' over 95 percent of the Borough's revenues come from oil in  the region.   So when we think about our communities and our counties and where  they may gain sources of revenue, it is pretty, pretty extraordinary to  find any area where 95 percent of your revenues come from one single  source.   And what do these revenues provide? They enable the Borough to  provide for basic, basic services and basic infrastructure like clean  drinking water, like education, like healthcare, like emergency  services. The Borough does it all. The Borough is funding their own  government, their own government to include search and rescue. I just  mentioned emergency services.   I mentioned that the NPR-A is the size of Indiana but that the North  Slope Borough is pretty significant in its size and scope, with eight  communities spread out over hundreds and hundreds of miles--no roads.  In the wintertime, the way that you move around is by snow machine, and  in the summer, it might be by boat. But the reality is that the weather  is very, very harsh, and snow machiners get lost. As people are trying  to travel from one village to the next, who is there on a search and  rescue? It is the local community, funded by the North Slope Borough.  These are activities that, I think, most don't think that a borough  would be providing, but they are able to do so--they are able to care  for their people--because of the revenues that they receive from oil.   As one former mayor put it: Oil and gas activities are responsible  for 200 years of development on the North Slope in the span of 30  years.   I was on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee when he made that  statement on the record.   It is extraordinary how the quality of life has advanced since the  days of revenue coming from our oil, and a recent study really kind of  brings it home. It is not just about infrastructure that brings clean  water or heat to your home, but it is what happens to one's health and  well-being. When you have improved infrastructure, when you have  sanitation systems, when you have medical care that these revenues have  helped to facilitate, people are healthier, and people live longer.   There is an increased life expectancy among Alaska Natives who live  on the North Slope. Get this: If you were born in 1985, your life  expectancy is about aged 65--pretty young. For those born in 2014, the  average life expectancy is 77 years. Think about that. Think about the  dramatic leap in life expectancy. The only thing that has changed-- because they still live a subsistence lifestyle; they are still living  in a really harsh environment. The only thing that has changed is that  they have access to resources that allow them to be better cared for,  that allow them to have a quality of life that we would just accept as  basic. I think clean running water is basic. I think a flushed toilet  is basic. I can't tell you how many communities in my State I go to  where they are waiting for the day--waiting for the day--that they will  get running water and a flushed toilet--pretty basic.    I think this is important. I have been talking a lot about the  benefits to the people of the North Slope region, but when I mentioned  that the Kivgiq and the Nalukataq are celebrations of sharing--the  sharing of gifts at Kivgiq, the sharing of the whale at Nalukataq--it  is not just the subsistence lifestyle that our Native people share. It  is in the structure of how ANCSA really came to be such an amazing  benefit to the Alaska Native people. ANCSA is the Alaska Native Claims  Settlement Act. There is a provision within ANCSA, section 7(i) that  requires--and this was agreed to by the 12 regional Native  corporations--that 70 percent of all revenues received by each regional  corporation from timber and subsurface estates be divided annually  according to the number of Natives who are enrolled in that region.   What I am sharing with you is that, of the resource wealth that comes  from the North Slope, the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation is not the  only Native corporation and beneficiaries to that. All Native  shareholders throughout the State, through the 12 regional  corporations, are entitled to that sharing of those benefits.   Think about what that means. If you are from a region where you don't  have the resources, think about what that means to then have sharing  coming to you from the north. When adjusted for inflation, between 1982  and 2015, a total of $3.1 billion was shared between the regional  corporations for the benefit of their shareholders, and 56 percent of  that, or $1.794 billion, came from oil and gas operations.   So when people ask what is the benefit that you receive from the oil  sector in Alaska, it is certainly jobs. Absolutely. It certainly  benefits our State, absolutely, in terms of our revenue, and you have  all heard of our permanent fund dividend. But the immediate benefit-- the real, tangible benefit--that is shared with the Alaska Native  people is an extraordinary model. I think those of us here in the lower  48 think that corporations are all sharp elbows, you know, wanting to  get as much as they possibly can for themselves. That is not who the  Alaska Native people are. The value that they bring is truly one of  sharing.   The North Slope is an amazing place, whether it is summer or whether  it is the heart of winter, as it was just this weekend at 30 below. I  know the Sun was up for a brief moment in time there for a period of  time. Everyone is very excited that the Sun is coming back. You know,  it is dark, and it is cold. But for those who would suggest that  responsible resource development and a subsistence way of life are  incompatible, I invite you to go up to Utqiagvik. Go to these  communities and hear for yourselves and see for yourselves how it is  just simply wrong, because you will be able to see the benefits of  responsible resource extraction and what it can mean to the lives of  people in their communities.   I was in Utqiagvik again this past weekend, but I was there in the  first week of January for a memorial service for a friend of mine and a  great, great Native leader, Oliver Leavitt. Oliver was not only the  head of ASRC. As an extraordinary corporate leader, he helped, really,  with the formation of the North Slope Borough, and he was a whaling  captain. He spent a lot of time here in Washington, DC, trying to  educate people.   He would always get grumpy with me when I would say: Oliver, I am so  happy you are back.   He would say: I should be at hunting camp. The caribou are coming  through.   You know, he was a man who lived in two worlds, but you listened. I  listened. I share this. I went to the school of Oliver Leavitt, and I  heard his stories about how hard it was for him as a  [[Page S282]]  young boy and as a young man. His job was to go out before school and  collect driftwood so that their family home could have some form of  fuel.   Keep in mind that there are no trees on the North Slope. It is hard.  It is hard.   He said: I went to school not because I wanted to learn but because  there was heat in the school.   He saw a transformation of what it meant for the people when they  were finally able to get natural gas into his community and how, now,  an elder can turn on the heat by just turning on the thermostat. What a  concept. Well, for us, we kind of expect that, but it is just a  reminder, again, of the benefits that come to those who live there and  who have lived there for generations and thousands of years--of how  they are compatible with Alaska's future here.   The Willow project will allow development, health outcomes, and life  expectancy all to improve--all to improve--on the North Slope.   You think about the resources that the people need and what will  happen if they no longer have access to those resources. What will  happen? They are telling me, Lisa, we can't go back in time. We don't  want to be left out in the cold. We will not be left out in the cold.   This is not social justice. So I ask us, as we are looking at this  particular project, to keep in mind and keep in your hearts the people  for whom it will most benefit.   But don't forget, the rest of Alaska and the country as a whole--they  are also going to benefit. It is projected to create an estimated 2,500  construction jobs. Seventy-five percent of them will be filled by union  labor, so unions are pretty supportive of this. Once complete, it will  support 300 permanent jobs, which then in turn spins off thousands more  across the State and across the country.   I mentioned the unions. If you support unions, you should be  supporting Willow. The Alaska AFL-CIO, the Alaska District Council of  Laborers, the North America's Building Trades Union, the Labors'  International Union of North America, the International Union of  Operating Engineers, the United Association--plumbers and pipefitters-- they are all on board. They are all on board and strongly supportive.  So are countless others who recognize the importance of creating good  jobs in Alaska and around the country to help reverse our GDP decline.   We are in a tough place in Alaska right now. I think we are No. 47,  if I am not mistaken, out of 50 States. We are seeing a net migration  out of Alaska. That is greatly concerning--greatly concerning. We have  a higher than average unemployment rate. So we are looking at this and  saying that Alaska needs this project.   I know there is criticism out there. You have folks who are saying:  Nope, can't move Willow forward. We all have to address climate. We  have to address the issue of climate change.   Let's talk about that for just a second because you know, Mr.  President--you have heard me talk about it. You have heard me stand up  and say that we need to be actively working to reduce emissions and  increase our use of clean energy. I have been pushing policies to do  just that. But I think we also recognize that you just can't flip a  switch. You just can't get there from here overnight. There is a  transition.   So I think what we need to focus on, the true choice that we have to  face, is how painful, how chaotic do we want the transition to be for  the people whom we serve?   On Tuesday night, when the President spoke at the State of the Union,  he acknowledged it. He said we are going to need oil for at least  another decade and beyond that. I would argue it is going to be longer  than a decade, regardless of what we do at the policy level.   So the question is, What are we going to do to take care of our own  needs with our own resources or are we going to empower OPEC at our own  expense, and are we willingly going to return to the days of being  highly dependent on foreign oil, with all of the economic, all of the  environmental, all of the geostrategic consequences that entails?   We have seen what happens when we make poor choices and we don't plan  for what a rational energy transition is going to look like. Europe is  certainly one example there. But I would suggest--let's bring it a  little closer to home. California is another example. Alaska's oil  production has declined. We send a lot of our stuff to California. As  our oil production has declined, what is happening in California is  that their imports have risen and they have risen dramatically. They  have turned where? They have turned to countries like Saudi Arabia and  Russia for their supply. So now that the Russian supply is outlawed, we  saw a recent New York Times article that noted that ``one in every nine  tanks of gas, diesel, or jet fuel pumped in California comes from the  Amazon.'' So, really, are we OK with this? Are we really OK with this?  I don't think California is going to be happy knowing their gas came  from Russia. But now that we are not taking it from Russia, now it is  going to come from the Amazon rather than from a petroleum reserve in  Alaska.   The choice here is not whether we need to continue to develop our oil  resources--we do; we clearly do--the choice is where the source is  going to come from. We are going to need it for decades to come. I will  tell you, I am going to choose Alaska anytime over foreign sources. I  will choose Alaska because we have a better environmental track record,  because development there benefits our people there, and it ultimately  makes it a little easier to address climate.   So you can oppose production on the North Slope. You can impoverish  Alaska Natives and blame them for changes in the climate that they did  not cause. But can you really feel good about that given the autocrats  you are going to empower around the world and the harm and the  devastation that come?   We have a better answer, and the better answer here is Willow. It is  going to provide up to 180,000 barrels per day at peak production. This  is going to help us refill our Trans-Alaska Pipeline. It is going to  keep the lower 48 from having to import from some of the worst regimes  in the world. So instead of importing from places with no environmental  standards to speak of, we should be confident that the energy we need  is coming from a project with a tiny footprint that is safely operated  with as little impact as humanly possible. And we can ensure that the  benefits of production go to the Alaska Natives of the North Slope and  the communities around the State and around the country rather than  petrocrats like Vladimir Putin.   All we need--all we need--is the approval of the Willow project,  which will allow us to continue to tackle climate change while  maintaining our energy security. It is not going to be a violation of  the President's pledges, which were--I will remind you, they were to  allow responsible development on existing leases to occur. Well,  Willow--valid existing leases--was approved when he came into office.  Its reapproval next month would simply signal to Alaska Natives, to  Alaskans, to Americans, and the world that we are serious not only  about our climate policies but also our energy policies.   I urge the Biden administration in the strongest possible terms to  listen to all who support this important project, and I urge them to  reject the false and misguided claims about impacts coming from some. I  would urge them to issue a Record of Decision early next month  selecting Alternative E without new limits or extraneous conditions. We  need to get to work.   With that, I yield the floor.
