 Madam President, I, too, would like to come to the  floor and thank my colleagues from the Upper Midwest for their great  work on this legislation, the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 2022.   Our colleagues from the Upper Midwest know how important agriculture  products are, and they know how important it is for them to reach their  destination. As Senator Thune was the previous chair of the Commerce  Committee, he knows all too well about how products can get boxed out  because of other products on the rails.   My colleague from Minnesota knows all too importantly about exports  and has been a big supporter of our export economy in general and  represents a State that is very robust on the global economy. So her  leadership on a very tough issue has been very, very appreciated.   I would like to thank, from the Commerce Committee staff, a variety  of people, and from Senator Wicker's staff and from Senator Thune's. A  lot of people worked on this: Nicki Teutschel, Alexis Gutierrez, Dave  Stewart, Grace Bloom, Charles Vickery, Eric Vryheid, Michael Davisson,  Matt Filpi, and Megan Thompson. From Senator Wicker's staff: Andrew  Neely, Fern Gibbons, Brendan Gavin, Paul Wasik, Kyle Fields. And from  Senator Klobuchar's staff: Obviously Baz Selassie--couldn't have done  it without all of his hard work. He is really the guy behind this. And  Senator Thune's staff: Chance Costello. And certainly Rob Hickman from  Senator Schumer's staff.   So, today, the passage of this bipartisan legislation couldn't come  at a more important time for our growers and producers and exporters;  that is, today we are saying that American farmers matter, and their  survival matters more than the exorbitant profit of international  shipping companies. That is what we really tried to tackle in this  legislation. Our two colleagues brought forth this legislation in  record time. It was passed in the House of Representatives, led by  Congressmen Garamendi and Johnson. Those two passed that in December,  and our colleagues got this bill here in the Senate in February, and we  were able to pass it now here at the very end of March.    I thank again our two colleagues--Senator Klobuchar for her  leadership and Senator Thune for getting it done so quickly. Literally,  it was introduced in February and passed in March. I hope it is an  example of what we can do on other legislation that is affecting our  supply chain.   Our economy is built on trading goods in a timely manner with our  partnerships from all over the world. Anderson Hay Grain in Washington  said:         The agriculture economy in our region does not work if we       don't have competitive access to world markets.    Right now, the supply chain isn't working. Our ports have been  clogged. Shipping companies have struggled to keep up with demand, and  the costs for American exporters who are trying to get hay and milk and  apples to the global market have gone through the roof. It is hurting  our consumers here at home as they see prices increase, and it is  hurting our exporters when they are looking at products that they are  trying to get to market.   American exporters are being charged more and more for containers due  to shipping delays that are really out of their control. They are  trying not to increase these costs. But, basically, consumers are  paying more, and our exporters are having a tough time getting their  products to market.   According to the freight index, by September 2021, shipping a  container had gone from $1,300 a container to $11,000 a container.  Reports and news articles talk about how that has affected our supply  chains, that there have been increases in costs in consumer  electronics, like computers and other equipment, and in furniture and  apparel. They are all seeing increases because of the increases in our  shipping costs.   The Federal Maritime Commission found that between July and September  of 2021, American businesses were charged $2.2 billion in fees in  addition to freight rates. That is a 50-percent increase compared to  the 3 prior months.   Getting overcharged is only part of the problem. Some of our  businesses can't even get their containers on the ship. During 2021,  there was a 24-percent drop in full shipping containers leaving from  the Ports of Seattle and Tacoma. That drop increased to 30 percent in  January and February of this year. That means 30 percent less  containers are leaving for international markets that are full of  American products. American exporters and their products are being left  on the docks. That is why we wanted to act quickly.   The American farmer, with growing season upon us, can't afford to  wait another minute for the Federal Maritime Commission to do its job  and help police this market and make sure that our products and our  farmers are not being overcharged or left on the dock.   The Washington State Potato Commission reported an 11-percent  decrease in exports in 2020 from 2019. According to Darigold, American  dairy producers lost $1.5 billion last year due to port congestion and  related challenges.   All of this means that getting this legislation onto the President's  desk could not be more important. That is why we acted fast in moving  this legislation today to give the first reforms to the Federal  Maritime Commission in two decades. Those new tools given to the  Commission are to increase the rules to prevent American products from  being left on the docks; increase transparency so that the fees the  shippers are charged are known and they can't be overcharged; and  three, prevent the shipping companies from retaliating against our  local American businesses.   These three changes are significant changes to the authority, and the  committee made sure in the changes to the legislation that these new  rules need to be in place in the next few months. We cannot continue to  wait for those rules to take place until next year. They need to be  done now. That is why the Commerce Committee I am sure will work in a  bipartisan fashion to see the implementation of this law and to make  sure that the Commission is aggressive in going after the exorbitant  fees that are being charged by these international shipping companies.   It is a huge task. The Commission is charged with regulating a $14  trillion international shipping industry. But this industry has done  nothing but become more concentrated in the last several decades. As  the supply chain challenges unfold, it is clear that the Commission is  left trying to rein in the practices of five very large international  companies. That is why we had to act fast and we had to be aggressive  in making sure the Federal Maritime Commission would work to put rules  in place that will help American ag exporters and help protect American  consumers.   Again, I thank my colleagues for their great work on this  legislation.  [[Page S1899]]  The State of Washington desperately needed to see the Federal Maritime  Commission reform. I am proud to say that we were able to get a new  Federal Maritime Commissioner, Max Vekich--who I think will officially  be sworn in soon--from the State of Washington, who has been working on  the docks for 40 years. He knows what it takes to move product. He also  knows that we need aggressive action by the Federal Maritime Commission  to protect all of us from these exorbitant shipping costs and to help  us in making sure that products--good American exports, like our apples  and hay and wheat--are not left on any dock but reach their destination  in foreign markets.   I yield the floor.
