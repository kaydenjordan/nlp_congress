 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize Don Nottoli and  celebrate his retirement from the Sacramento County Board of  Supervisors after seven terms on the board and a lifetime of service to  the Sacramento community.   Don started his public service career in 1977 when he was elected to  the Galt High School Board of Trustees. I have had the privilege of  working with Don over the years. He is a tireless public servant. All  of us get to go to Eagle Scout ceremonies, medal awards, and so forth.  Don is at every one of those.   Our community is a much better place because of the service and the  representation that we had from Supervisor Don Nottoli.   I extend my congratulations and thank County Supervisor Nottoli for  his lifelong dedication to public service in Sacramento County. His  commitment to the betterment of our region will stand as an example of  public service for years to come.   Sacramento County is a better place to live and raise a family  because of Don Nottoli's lifetime of service, and I ask my colleagues  to join me in celebrating Don Nottoli for his work in our community and  his service to our country.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern) for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the select committee on China  and to support this select committee on China.   These past two Congresses I have had the privilege of being the  chairman on the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific and a senior  member on the Foreign Affairs Committee. I have worked very closely  with my ranking member,  Steve Chabot--a good friend whom we are going  to miss--but I also served as ranking member when Mr. Chabot was  chairman on that committee.   We learned a lot on how we should approach China. We have looked at  supply chains. We have traveled to the region. We have talked to our  partners in southeast Asia and ASEAN. We have understood the  vulnerabilities.   Our subcommittee had the first hearing on the novel coronavirus back  in February of 2020 when we didn't have a name on it. So we understand  the importance, as a doctor, of understanding the origins of COVID,  where it came and how we can best prevent the next pandemic.    None of those questions are ones that we should be looking at and  bickering about as Democratic or Republican questions. Those are  questions that just make a lot of sense to our security, our economic  strength, and where we go from here.   So I applaud the Speaker's comments on wanting this to be an American  strategy, not a Democratic or Republican strategy.   If we look at our own history, what served us well in the Cold War is  we had an American strategy. It didn't change every 2 years. It didn't  change with the new Presidential administration. We acted on it, we  laid it out there, we executed it, and we won the Cold War without  going to war. That is what the challenge is that faces us today. I wish  China had gone a different direction. I wish they had opened up.   I applaud the work that Mr. McGovern does on human rights and  addressing the Uyghur genocide. Speaker Emerita Pelosi has been a  champion on looking at the human rights abuses and the tragedy that is  taking place in Tibet. Those are all issues that we should come  together on, not just the United States of America, but with our allies  and friends because they have the same concerns.   I don't want to say we are in a new cold war, but we are in a real  challenge right now. So I support the select committee. Let's make it  nonpartisan, and let's work together to create an American strategy.
