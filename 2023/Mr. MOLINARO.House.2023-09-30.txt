 Mr. Speaker, with hours to go before the potential  shutdown of this Federal Government, we are posed with a single  question:   Vote ``yes'' to continue to provide services and support to our  military, to our defense, to our communities, to law enforcement; or  vote ``no'' and shut the government down? That is the question.   Being told, by the way, for years during the pandemic with the  government shut down that somehow people should just sort of fend for  themselves; being told for years how great that was, we have an  opportunity in this very moment to confront what is a real crisis for  real people.   Keep the government functioning, continue to focus on appropriations,  drive down Federal spending, but meet the needs and the expectations of  the American people today.   Vote ``yes'' to keep the government open. Vote ``no'' to shut the  government down. I, on behalf of my constituents, will be voting  ``yes'' to keep this government functioning.    Mr. Speaker, having listened for 45 minutes, I am  amazed and confused as to what exactly my colleagues across the aisle  thought we were doing in this very moment.   In just moments, we have the opportunity to avert a Federal  Government shutdown. It is a responsibility that we have to ensure that  the people who work for this Federal Government have the support and  the backing of those who employ them. It is critically important to the  men and women who serve and sacrifice across the globe that they know  that we have their backs. It is critically important that those in law  enforcement, emergency response, and those all across this country know  that in this moment we vote ``yes'' to keep this government  functioning.
