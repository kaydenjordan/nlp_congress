 Mr. Speaker, most Americans get it. Frankly, it is just  common sense. We can't continue to reward folks who come to our country  illegally while those who work hard and play by the rules struggle to  get ahead.   It is way past time to fix our broken immigration policies in  America.   Today, the House is considering two commonsense reforms to combat  illegal immigration, restore rule of law, and protect public safety.  [[Page H5307]]    The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act defunds sanctuary cities and  cracks down on dangerous sanctuary city policies that shield criminal  investigations from Federal immigration enforcement and puts American  citizens at risk.   Kate's Law increases penalties for deported felons who return to  America and commit further crimes.   Kate's Law was named after a young woman who was tragically gunned  down by a five-time deported felon nearly 2 years ago to this day. It  is outrageous.   The Federal Government's first duty is to protect its citizens. I  urge my colleagues to support these much-needed reforms and then do  more to stop illegal immigration in the United States.                            ____________________
