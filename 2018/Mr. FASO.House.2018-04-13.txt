 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 70th anniversary  of the State of Israel.   The United States was the first nation to recognize Israel as an  independent nation in 1948. Since then, our nations have cultivated a  significant and enduring relationship, one built on a shared commitment  to democracy, peace in the Middle East, and economic prosperity.   Israel is among the United States' most important allies in the  international community. Since its independence, the Jewish state has  resolved to maintain a free and democratic society, despite being  surrounded by powers committed to its destruction.   I extend my sincerest congratulations to the citizens of Israel on 70  years of independence. I wish the Jewish state continued prosperity in  the next 70 years, and I look forward to our two nations continuing to  strengthen our alliance.
