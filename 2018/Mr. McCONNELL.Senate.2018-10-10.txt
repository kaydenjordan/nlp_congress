 Mr. President, later this morning, the Senate will  vote to deliver the most substantial infrastructure legislation yet  considered by this Congress to communities across America.   Yesterday, I spoke about President Trump's challenge to improve our  Nation's infrastructure, and I laid out how America's Water  Infrastructure Act will represent a major step toward meeting that  challenge nationwide. This comprehensive legislation meets all sorts of  pressing needs unique to different corners of our country--from dams,  levees, and flood control, to safer drinking water and sewage systems.   There are national issues at stake, such as the ability of American  producers and manufacturers to access markets around the world, but the  questions at stake are also very local. By way of example, I would like  to highlight just a few of the ways this legislation will have a direct  impact on communities in my home State of Kentucky.   First, the bill before us includes a measure that will protect  property owners from paying thousands of dollars in fees to fix  decades-old surveying mistakes by the Army Corps of Engineers. This is  a critical issue for Kentucky's Rough River community, where the Army  Corps' own errors threatened to stick local landowners with a steep  bill. I was pleased to lead the charge in crafting a commonsense  solution to prevent this Kentucky community from paying a financial  price for government mistakes.   This legislation also halts the imposition of burdensome fees on  water use in Lake Cumberland, and it extends my Freedom to Fish Act for  5 years by barring the Army Corps from prohibiting fishing in the  tailwaters of Barkley and Wolf Creek Dam. For so many communities in my  State, fishing is both a hobby and a way of life. This is not an area  where the Federal Government needs to jump in between Americans and  their own backyards. We had to pare back this regulatory overreach.  This legislation does exactly that.   Here is one more example. In States like Kentucky where waterways  play such a pivotal economic role, it is also crucial that the Army  Corps be equipped to demolish defunct parts of our waterways  infrastructure that now stand in the way of progress. These efforts  will allow communities along Kentucky's Green and Barren Rivers to make  these waterways healthier, safer, and more attractive for outdoor  recreation.   I am proud this legislation authorizes these important steps forward.   This is the beauty of America's waterways. It is a national issue,  but it touches local communities across the country in very direct and  specific ways.   I am proud of the ways this legislation will help Kentucky. I know  each of my colleagues knows just as many ways this bill will impact  their own State for the better. That is underscored by last night's  overwhelming bipartisan vote of 96 to 3. I look forward to a similar  bipartisan vote later this morning to send this significant  infrastructure bill to the President's desk for signature into law.  [[Page S6736]]                                ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, today the Senate  will also vote on an effort by my Democratic colleagues to strip away  health insurance options for families whom ObamaCare has failed.   The first 4 years of the ObamaCare experience was one of failure  after failure--skyrocketing premiums and broken websites built on  broken promises. Many families were caught right in the middle of the  ObamaCare mess--those who earned too much to receive subsidies but not  enough to keep pace with premiums--so it became even more important to  look for alternatives. The American people are resourceful. Some held  on to so-called grandfathered and grandmothered plans, and others  looked for lower cost, short-term plans that could be held for up to a  year.   We all know that Big Government doesn't like it when citizens try to  avoid the micromanagement and run their own lives as they see fit, so  in the waning months of the Obama administration, Democrats issued a  new regulation that cut these plans from 12 months down to 3 months and  made them nonrenewable. I guess the goal was to force even more  Americans into ObamaCare. The real effect was just to punish these  people twice for Democrats' bad policy.   Fortunately, this year the Trump administration righted the ship.  They undid the restriction and restored the status quo that was in  place from the 1990s through most of the Obama administration. It was a  simple fix. It doesn't take away the choices they have under ObamaCare  but empowers Americans to use this alternative choice if they prefer  it. According to even the liberal Urban Institute, more than 1.7  million Americans will likely be insured with this option, who  otherwise would have gone uninsured. But apparently our Democratic  colleagues can't tolerate even this modest step away from top-down  government control. They have introduced a resolution of disapproval to  overturn the Trump administration's fix and snatch these options away  from families once more. We will be voting on it today.   I know my Democratic colleagues are embarrassed by the state of  ObamaCare. It has been more than 8 years since they passed their  signature law that was supposed to make it all better. Instead, working  Americans are saddled with increasing costs and decreasing choices. But  surely they must have a better answer than snatching away one of the  remaining options that some Americans still prefer to anything  Democrats have been able to come up with.   This is an easy decision. I urge every one of my colleagues to vote  against this resolution. Our constituents deserve more options, not  fewer. The last thing we should do is destroy one of the options that  is still actually working for American families.                            ____________________     Mr. President, one final matter. While the Senate was  focused on Justice Kavanaugh's confirmation last Friday, our economy  reached a major milestone. According to the latest Department of Labor  report, unemployment in the United States of America has now fallen to  3.7 percent. That is the lowest unemployment rate since 1969. It is now  3.7 percent--the lowest unemployment rate since 1969. The share of  Americans who are seeking work but cannot find it is as low as it has  been in just shy of 50 years.   There was other good news as well. Unlike what happened too often in  the previous decade, this drop in unemployment did not come from  discouraged workers giving up their search altogether; to the contrary,  150,000 more Americans joined the labor force last month, and the  unemployment rate still went down. Now, that is an opportunity economy.  That is exactly what an opportunity economy looks like.   Day after day, my Republican colleagues and I have come to the floor  and outlined all the things we are doing to try to help generate  precisely this kind of economic momentum for the American people. This  unified Republican government has rolled back regulations and cut  redtape at a pace that hasn't been seen for years. We have handed  American families and job creators the most significant Tax Code  overhaul in 30 years, lower tax rates, a bigger child tax credit, more  help with small businesses, and better incentives to invest and create  jobs right here on American soil. Our actions have been clear, and our  economy is sending equally clear signals in response: the highest  consumer confidence we have seen in nearly 18 years, the highest small  business confidence we have seen in 35 years, and now the lowest  unemployment rate we have seen in almost half a century.   I have said it before, and I will say it again: Government itself is  not creating this prosperity. Republicans know that growth starts with  workers and entrepreneurs, not with Washington. Government can either  put the wind in America's faces or at their backs, and there is little  question which way the wind has been blowing these past 2 years. It  certainly is not ``Armageddon'' or ``crumbs,'' as the House Democratic  leader notoriously proclaimed in recent months. It is not a  ``disaster,'' as my friend the Senate Democratic leader has suggested.  No, it is rising wages, more job opportunities, and new investment, and  it is reaching kitchen tables in communities large and small all across  our country. The real winners here are the American people. Republicans  are just proud that our policies are helping them do what they do best.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.
