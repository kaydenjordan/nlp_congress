 Mr. Speaker, as we adopt the third installment of COVID  relief in one month, millions of Americans are counting on Congress to  chart a course forward and lead the nation out of this crisis. Today's  vote delivers significant resources to the American people, our  economy, and our nation's health care delivery system. The hundreds of  billions of dollars included for our health providers, paired with a  massive injection of economic assistance for our small businesses will  give medical professionals and financial institutions the tools they  need to help our nation weather this storm.   Unfortunately, this bill also spends millions of taxpayer dollars on  programs unrelated to combating the coronavirus. Efforts to fund pet  projects and attempts to further a political agenda at a time like this  are completely unacceptable, and I, like so many of my constituents, am  disgusted and appalled with the partisan maneuvering that delayed  passage of this legislation. The important relief included in this bill  is now not only several days overdue, but it saddles future generations  with an even larger federal debt burden they will be forced to grapple  with, in the years to come, all because of ``politics as usual'' in  Washington.   I supported today's relief package because I believe in the resolve  of the American people and the resiliency of the American economy. I  will continue to support the countless men and women working around the  clock to provide lifesaving medical care, and I look forward to working  with our community lenders and small businesses as they remind the  world of just how dynamic they can be. By working together, we will  overcome this crisis and reemerge a stronger and more prosperous  nation.
