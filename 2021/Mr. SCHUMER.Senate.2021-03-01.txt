The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.                            ____________________     Mr. President, we begin this week on a joyful note:  welcoming an outstanding individual to serve as the new Secretary of  the Senate, Ann Berry from the office of one Senator Patrick Leahy.   The position of the Secretary of the Senate dates back to April 8,  1789, just 2 days after the Senate achieved its first quorum. Today, 1  day after the conclusion of Black History Month and on the first day of  Women's History Month, Ann Berry was just sworn in as the first Black  woman to ever serve as Secretary of the Senate--another glass ceiling  broken.   It is a testament to her outstanding career as a public servant of  the highest caliber. Over her 40 years in Washington, Ann has come to  know the ins and outs of the Senate better than just about anyone else  who works in the Capitol Complex. She came to Washington, a proud  native of Birmingham,  [[Page S908]]  AL, and a graduate of the University of North Alabama, to work for  Senator Howell Heflin.   Clearly, word got around about her talents because, over the course  of her career, she went to work for Senators Carper, Edwards, Moynihan,  Jones, and, most recently, as Senator Leahy's deputy chief of staff,  where she was an indispensable resource not only to Senator Leahy's  office but to my team and to countless other Senators.   I want to thank Senator Leahy for parting with Ann and lending her  considerable talents to the full Senate. He told me he regretted her  going, but he was so glad that the Senate had seen her talents.   And thank you, Ann. Thank you for accepting this incredible  responsibility. Congratulations on beginning your historic tenure, and  we all wish you the best as you work to bring this great institution to  life.   As we all welcome Ann to her new role, the Senate bids a fond  farewell to Julie Adams and Mary Jones. Over the last 6 years, Julie  Adams and Mary Jones have served as Secretary and Assistant Secretary  of the U.S. Senate with impeccable skill and unflappable  professionalism.   Both are longtime veterans of Washington. Julie worked for many years  under Leader McConnell and First Lady Laura Bush, while Mary served in  the White House under President George H. W. Bush and, as I remember,  because I was, I guess, chairman or ranking member--I can't recall  which, maybe both--as staff director of the Senate Rules and  Administration Committee, where she did just a great job.   Both of them are friendly and familiar faces around here in the  Senate. Both have earned the respect here in the Senate of just about  everyone who has worked with them.   Of course, Julie and Mary deserve special praise for their leadership  over the last 12 months. As a global pandemic forced the Senate to  adapt to new ways, they kept the Senate functioning in the midst of  this historic crisis. And in the wake of the horrific attacks on  January 6, Julie and Mary were heroic--heroic--in getting the Senate  back on its feet only a few hours after the violence had been quelled.   To Julie and Mary, thank you. Thank you for all you have done. The  entire Senate wishes you and your families the very best, and we look  forward to seeing what the road ahead holds for both of you.                            ____________________     Mr. President pro tempore, now, on Senate business, the  Senate will have a busy week ahead of it. Today and tomorrow, the  Senate will confirm two more members of President Biden's Cabinet: Dr.  Miguel Cardona to serve as Secretary of Education and Governor Gina  Raimondo to serve as Commerce Secretary.   The Senate will also confirm Dr. Cecilia Rouse to serve as the Chair  of the Council of Economic Advisers, another history-making pick who  will be the first Black official to head that Department.   All three nominees are exceptionally well qualified. All have  received bipartisan support in their respective committees, including a  unanimous vote in favor of Dr. Rouse.   As we continue the fight against the pandemic on all fronts--in  particular, the damage it has caused our schools and our economy--these  nominees will have a difficult and important task ahead of them. It  will be very good news once we have them confirmed and on the job.   The Senate will then return to the American Rescue Plan,  comprehensive legislation that will help us crush the virus, recover  our economy, and get life back to normal.   (Ms. HIRONO assumed the Chair.)   Defeating the pandemic is national priority No. 1: getting our  schools to reopen as safely and quickly as possible; helping small  businesses hang on until the economy can come roaring back; keeping  teachers and firefighters and other essential employees on the job;  providing aid to the jobless, food to the hungry, direct cash payments  to millions of Americans struggling--struggling--for the cost of rent,  groceries, medicine, and utilities; speeding the distribution of the  vaccine, which is the cornerstone to ending this awfully dark chapter  in American history.   That is what our country needs, and that is what the American Rescue  Plan will achieve. To paraphrase Franklin Roosevelt, we must do the  first things first.   Last week, the legislation passed in the House of Representatives.  This week, the Senate will take up the measure. Let me say that again.  The Senate will take up the American Rescue Plan this week.   I expect a hearty debate and some late nights, but the American  people sent us here with a job to do: to help the country through this  moment of extraordinary challenge; to end, through action, the greatest  health crisis our country has faced in a century. And that is just what  we are going to do.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter entirely, voting  rights, the story of American democracy is a long and messy one, full  of contradictions and halting progress. It was a century and a half  after our founding before women got the right to vote, another half  century before African Americans could enjoy the full rights of  citizenship. It took mighty movements and decades of fraught political  conflicts to achieve even those basic dignities and establish the  United States as a full democracy worthy of the title.   But any American who thinks that today, in 2021, that fight is over-- that the fight for voting rights is over--is sorely and, unfortunately,  sadly mistaken.   In the wake of the most recent election, an election that the former  President has repeatedly lied about and claimed was stolen, more than  253 bills in 43 States have been introduced to tighten voting rules  under the pernicious, nasty guise of election integrity.   In Iowa, the State legislature voted to cut early voting by 9 days.  Polls will close an hour earlier. And they voted to tighten the rules  on absentee voting, which so many--the elderly, the disabled, the  frail--depend on.   In Wisconsin, Republican lawmakers have proposed limiting ballot drop  boxes to one per municipality--a municipality of hundreds of thousands,  and a tiny one gets the small one. I wonder why. I wonder why.   In Arizona, one Republican legislator wants to pass a law allowing  the State legislators--listen to this--to ignore the results of the  Presidential election and determine their own slate of electors. One  legislator in Arizona wants to pass a law allowing State legislators to  ignore the results of the Presidential election and determine their own  slate of electors. That doesn't sound like democracy. That sounds like  dictatorship.    The most reprehensible of all efforts might be found in Georgia,  where Republicans have introduced a bill to eliminate all early voting  on Sundays, a day when Black churches sponsor get-out-the-vote drives  known as ``souls to the polls.''   We have, supposedly--supposedly--come a long way since African  Americans in the South were forced to guess the number of jelly beans  in a jar in order to be allowed to vote. But it is very difficult to  look at the specific laws proposed by Republican legislatures around  the country, designed to limit voter participation in heavily African- American and Hispanic areas, to lower turnout and frustrate election  administration in urban districts and near college campuses, to  gerrymander districts to limit minority representation ``with almost  surgical precision,'' to specifically target and thwart Black churches  from organizing voting drives--it is difficult, very difficult not to  see the tentacles of America's generations-old caste system, typically  associated with slavery and Jim Crow, stretching into the 21st century  and poisoning the wellspring of any true democracy--free and fair  elections.   We see a lot of despicable things these days, but nothing that seems  to be more despicable than this. When you lose an election in a  democratic society, you update your party platform and appeal to more  voters. You don't change the rules to make it harder for your opponents  to vote, especially not African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans,  and other voters who have  [[Page S909]]  been historically disenfranchised. That response is toxic to democracy  and, indeed, is the very opposite of democracy.   Make no mistake, these despicable, discriminatory, anti-democratic  proposals are on the move in State legislatures throughout America.  They must be opposed by every American--Democrat, Republican,  Independent; liberal, conservative, moderate--who cherishes our  democracy.   This is just incredible what they are trying to do--incredible. We  must do everything we can to stop it.                            ____________________     Madam President, I understand there are two measures at  the desk due for a second reading en bloc.    Madam President, in order to place the bills on the  calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further  proceedings en bloc.    I yield the floor.                            ____________________
