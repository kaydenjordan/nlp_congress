 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support  of H.R. 1.   H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act, is about increasing domestic  production, permitting reform, reversing President Biden's anti-energy  agenda, and streamlining energy exports.   To be perfectly frank, the Biden administration has been putting out  anti-energy policies since his first week in office. He shut down the  Keystone pipeline and halted permits for domestic energy production  that we desperately needed.   He drained our Strategic Petroleum Reserve to try to stop the pain  from his terrible policies instead of coming up with real solutions.   Just last night, he tweeted that electric cars are the future.   I have never seen an administration so out of touch with the American  people, which is exactly why these same people affected by anti-energy  policies elected a Republican majority in the House of Representatives.   In the majority, our first priority is to bring down energy costs and  increase energy production. The Lower Energy Costs Act is just the  first of many crucial energy policies I am looking forward to seeing  over the next 2 years.   One of the pieces of legislation that I am looking forward to seeing  is the completion of the Mountain Valley pipeline. The Mountain Valley  pipeline is a great example of why permitting works and exactly why we  need more of it.   In this project's case, the administration isn't the problem. It is  the leftwing courts--which are more radical than Joe Biden, which  should really tell you something--that are holding up this important  pipeline.   When the pipeline is completed, it will be delivering natural gas  within months, meaning lower energy prices for Americans as supply will  dramatically increase.   There is no time to waste. Remember that energy security is national  security.
