 Madam Speaker, I thank the Biden administration for  meaningfully updating the Thrifty Food Plan as Congress mandated in the  last farm bill.   Before the Biden administration took action, the Thrifty Food Plan  had not been updated in 50 years. That is absurd. Needy families were  having to make purchasing decisions based on data from one-half century  ago.   Nevertheless, thanks to their updates, SNAP recipients now get an  extra $1.40 per day. It is a small increase, but it means more people  can make ends meet.   Guess what, Madam Speaker?   It is something that is real that is already helping families buy  groceries.   I am so sick and tired of hearing my Republican friends play the  inflation blame game, but then, when it comes time to actually do  something to actually help families pay for groceries, Republicans are  floating the idea of rolling back the Thrifty Food Plan update. Really,  that is a rotten thing to do.   As Congress works to complete the 2023 farm bill, I strongly urge all  of my colleagues to join me in rejecting this cruel and cynical  approach.   Enough for God's sake.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, we should reject this resolution for a few  simple reasons: first is protecting this institution. I don't agree  with a lot of what people say around here. I think a lot of what my  Republican friends say is offensive and even racist, but I don't go  around introducing censure resolutions.   If we are going to start censuring anybody who says something we  don't like, all we will do from now on is censure each other all day.   The second reason is freedom of speech. My Republican colleagues go  on and on about cancel culture, and here they are today trying to  cancel someone.   I don't want any lectures from people who are trying to create a  1984-style  [[Page H5500]]  thought police. I don't know what is wrong with them, Mr. Speaker. If  this is not the high point of Republican hypocrisy, I don't know what  is.   Mr. Speaker, I say to my Republican colleagues that they are  unleashing something very bad here. They are setting an awful precedent  for this institution. This is a very slippery slope.   I strongly urge a ``no'' vote on this resolution to protect this  institution, to protect freedom of speech, and to reject this  majority's cynical attempts to divide and distract America.   Mr. Speaker, I would say that if my Republican friends don't like  listening to people they disagree with, they should get a new job.
