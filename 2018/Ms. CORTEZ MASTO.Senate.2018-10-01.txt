 Mr. President, 1 year has passed since 58 lives  were cut short at the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival. Those wounded  and killed that night had come together to have fun, to relax, and to  celebrate their love of country music with their friends and families  in my hometown of Las Vegas. Instead of a celebration, terror rained  down on them that night.   As Nevadans woke up to the news of what happened, many like me were  shocked and heartbroken. We asked, how could this happen?   I will never forget going to the family reunification center, where  families were looking for their loved ones or were waiting for calls  from the coroner, and I will never forget the parents I spoke to  moments before their learning that their daughter, Melissa, didn't make  it.   In the weeks following the 1 October massacre, Las Vegans  demonstrated that we are a tight-knit family who rallies together in  times of need. We heard stories of incredible bravery at the scene of  the attack--a husband who died to protect his wife on the night they  were celebrating their 23rd wedding anniversary; a former marine who  turned a truck into a makeshift ambulance and drove more than two dozen  people to the hospital; a couple who provided CPR to victims as bullets  rained down; a mother who went into mamma bear mode and used her body  as a shield to protect her children; hundreds of concert-goers who  risked their lives while carrying fellow concert-goers to safety.   All of our firefighters and police officers in Southern Nevada,  including the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, the Clark  County School District Police, the Las Vegas Fire Department, and the  Clark County Fire Department, deserve our utmost thanks for their  bravery on the night of the attack. They, along with American Medical  Response, MedicWest Ambulance, Community Ambulance, the University  Medical Center, Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center, the Valley Health  System, Dignity Health, and all of the first responders in Southern  Nevada, went above and beyond the call of duty.   On October 1, many of these brave men and women ran toward the  bullets, putting their lives in grave danger because they knew it was  the only way to save people in need. Nurses and doctors worked all  through the night, not just on October 1 but for months afterward to  care for the wounded.   Before dawn had even broken on October 2, people in Las Vegas, Reno,  and throughout the State had formed lines at blood banks. Many of the  lines were so long they stretched out the door and around the block.  The staff at United Blood Services worked tirelessly to process the  donations and get the blood supply to our area hospitals.   In the weeks that followed, Las Vegans held candlelight vigils. They  donated food, coffee, water, and blankets to help the survivors and the  victims' families. They constructed beautiful memorials that still  stand as a testament to those taken and to provide healing to every  person impacted by events of that night.   The Red Cross and the Department of Veterans Affairs stepped in to  bring mobile units to our hospitals.   The FBI and the Nevada Victims of Crime Program helped grieving  families secure funds to cover funeral and travel costs.   Our military community stepped in to provide critical support as  well. Airmen from Nellis Air Force Base were present at the concert on  the night of the shooting and helped evacuate attendees. Nellis medical  professionals treated victims and helped saved lives while the military  spouse community collected basic necessities for the survivors and the  victims' families.   Providers at the Las Vegas-based Behavioral Bilingual Services were  instrumental in addressing immigration and language barriers for so  many immigrant survivors.   The Clark County staff at the Vegas Strong Resiliency Center has been  there for survivors every step of the way, advocating on their behalf  and helping them find new jobs, getting them compensation for lost  wages, and getting them the mental health care they need.   Airlines like Allegiant and Southwest and medical providers like  Valley Health Systems, Medic West, and American Medical Response helped  defray costs for the victims and their families.   St. Rose Dominican Hospitals said that they would not bill or require  payment from any of the victims they treated, and United Health waived  cost-sharing for victims so that they could get treatment for months  after the tragedy with no out-of-pocket costs.   The generosity didn't end there. People from all over the world  donated more than $31 million to pay for basic necessities, medical  bills, and funeral costs for the victims and their families.   One year has passed since the events of October 1, 2017. I know for  many in our community of Las Vegas, and for the hundreds of survivors,  it feels as though they have been forgotten, but please know--please  know--the survivors and those who were taken will never be forgotten.   We will always hold the names and stories of everyone affected by  this tragedy in our hearts and in our minds. In Las Vegas, we are still  healing. We  [[Page S6409]]  are still grieving for the family members who are no longer with us-- for sisters, brothers, mothers, fathers, cousins, nieces, nephews,  aunts, and children we will never see again. We are still grieving for  the survivors, whose lives will never be the same.   I don't believe perfect healing is possible, but I do believe we can  learn to adjust to the searing pain of tragedy. We do it through  remembrance.   Through remembrance, the people we love are never truly gone, as long  as we are around to say their names or share a memory of them. Through  remembrance, the people and families who are still healing from their  wounds are shown the love and comfort of our community.   Today, in remembrance of that awful night 1 year ago, let's give  thanks for the bravery and dedication of our first responders. Let's  continue to do everything we can to support those who are still  struggling to recover from the emotional and physical wounds they  sustained on October 1.   Fifty-eight innocent lives ended on October 1, but thousands more  were changed forever. We must keep the survivors in our minds and in  our hearts as they heal from their injuries, both visible and  invisible, and get back on their feet.   The Davis family lost their daughter Neysa on the night of the  shooting. Neysa's dream was that her three sons would graduate from  college. They decided that the best way to heal their family and their  community was to start an organization dedicated to fulfilling Neysa's  dream. I thank the Davis family for their resilience and their  generosity.   We must follow the Davis family's example and continue to come  together as a community. We must come together, not just in Las Vegas  but all throughout Nevada to bring healing, peace, and hope to everyone  who was affected.   Tonight, at 6:30 p.m., the city of Las Vegas will host a ceremony at  the Las Vegas Community Healing Garden to dedicate a new remembrance  wall. I encourage everyone back home to try to attend this event or  simply take a moment to pause and reflect in honor of the victims and  their families.   In a few moments, I will read the names of everyone who was killed so  that their names will be reserved in the Congressional Record.   May God bless the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada, and  everyone affected by this strategy.
