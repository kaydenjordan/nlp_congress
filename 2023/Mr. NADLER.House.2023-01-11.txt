 Madam Speaker, what is one of the first things that  Republicans do when they take over the House?   They shaft the taxpayers and increase the budget deficit by $114  billion a year.   By seeking to roll back the 87,000 additional personnel for the IRS,  which is intended to replace a 20 percent reduction in head count in  anticipated retirements, they guarantee that taxpayers will have to  wait weeks for their phone calls to the IRS to be returned.   They guarantee that the budget deficit will be increased by $114  billion for lack of audits of tax-avoiding multimillionaires.   Shaft the taxpayers and increase the budget deficit by $114 billion.  Great work, GOP.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this woefully incomplete  resolution.   I will begin by saying that I condemn violence in all its forms,  including the threats, vandalism, and property destruction described in  H. Con. Res. 3. I would also like to reiterate my condemnation of the  attempted murder of Supreme Court Justice Brett  [[Page H171]]  Kavanaugh. That should go without saying.   I am grateful that no one appears to have been physically injured in  the vandalism incidents described in the resolution, and that law  enforcement took Justice Kavanaugh's would-be assassin into custody  before he could complete an act of violence.   In a democracy, violence is never the answer in a political dispute,  and it should be roundly condemned in all its forms.   This resolution, however, is a transparent partisan ploy that is a  woefully and unacceptably inadequate condemnation of violence. It comes  in the context of extremist MAGA Republicans' effort to enact a total  ban on abortion at both the State and Federal levels. In what appears  to be a glaring omission to H. Con. Res. 3, my Republican colleagues  refused to condemn the long, documented history of violence, murder,  and mayhem perpetrated by anti-abortion extremists against abortion  providers and their patients.   According to the National Abortion Federation, since 1977 anti- abortion extremists have been responsible for 11 murders, 42 bombings,  196 arsons, 491 assaults, and thousands of incidents of criminal  activities directed at patients, providers, and volunteers.    Sadly, these incidents have increased dramatically in recent years.  In 2021, abortion providers faced a 600 percent increase in stalking  incidents, a 450 percent increase in clinic blockades, a 163 percent  increase in reports of hoax devices or suspicious packages, a 129  percent increase in invasions, and a 128 percent increase in assault  and battery compared to previous years.   In some cases, violence against abortion providers has had deadly  consequences. For example, in November 2015 a gunman murdered three  people and injured nine others when he opened fire with an assault- style rifle at a Planned Parenthood health center in Colorado Springs.   In January 2021, a gunman attacked a Planned Parenthood clinic in  Knoxville, Tennessee, and later that year, the same clinic was burned  to the ground by arsonists.   Regardless of your position on abortion rights, Madam Speaker, it is  important that we condemn all acts of violence, regardless of who is  the ultimate target. I am concerned that by refusing to condemn  violence against providers, this resolution will inadvertently send a  signal to anti-abortion extremists that violence against abortion  providers is justified by the vandalism described in the resolution.   If this inadequate resolution could potentially fan the flames of  political discord, what purpose then does it serve?   The only purpose I can infer is that it is intended to placate the  extreme elements of the anti-abortion movement while this Republican  majority figures out how to pass a total nationwide ban on abortion.                                time  1245    Let me be clear: Democrats stand with the majority of the American  public and will oppose such a radical position.   H. Con. Res. 3 is nothing more than a partisan political ploy  designed to advance an extreme anti-abortion agenda and is not a  serious effort to condemn political violence. Indeed, it may have the  opposite effect on the American public because it purposely fails to  condemn the thousands of threats, violent incidents, and attacks that  abortion providers and patients have endured for decades at the hands  of anti-abortion extremists.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, the resolution condemns violence at pro- life clinics but not at pro-choice clinics. That says it all.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen), a member of the Judiciary Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a member of the Judiciary  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the ranking member of the  Appropriations Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez), the ranking member of the  Small Business Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Lois Frankel).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Chu).    I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).                                time  1315     Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Mrs. Fletcher).

Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Frost), for whom I think this is his first  speech on the floor.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DeGette).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Pressley).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Massachusetts.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for  closing.    Madam Speaker, if House Republicans were serious about condemning  violence surrounding the debate on abortion, the resolution would be  clear in condemning all acts of violence, lest we give tacit  acquiescence to extremist anti-abortion violence and against abortion  providers. This resolution does not do that at all.   Undoubtedly, my Republican colleagues will attempt to portray any  opposition to this partisan resolution as proof of Democrats' so-called  extreme position on abortion, but the American public is not so easily  fooled.   They will recognize this resolution for what it is, a transparent  political exercise intended to lay the groundwork for MAGA Republicans'  plans for a total nationwide ban on abortion.   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to vote ``no,'' and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 26, the so-called  Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.   Despite what its supporters would have us believe, this legislation  would do nothing to enhance protections or the quality of healthcare if  an infant is born after an attempted abortion. What it would do,  however, is directly interfere with a doctor's medical judgment and  dictate a medical standard of care that may not be appropriate in all  circumstances, which could, in fact, put infants' lives at greater  risk.   Finally, by beginning this new Congress with a bill to restrict  women's healthcare nationwide, House Republicans have made clear that  they will not stop until they reach their ultimate goal, a nationwide  ban on abortion.   It has always been the law that healthcare providers cannot  deliberately harm newborn infants and that they must exercise  reasonable care in their treatment of such infants. The bill's  implication that providers who perform abortions routinely act in a  callous or a criminal manner that would result in an infant's death, or  that a provider who performs an abortion somehow cannot be trusted to  take adequate measures to save a living baby's life, is insulting and  untrue.   In opposing this bill, I do not oppose, in any way, proper medical  treatment for newborn infants, whatever the circumstances of their  birth, but determining the proper treatment is for medical  professionals to decide, not politicians in Congress.   When I supported the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act in 2002, my  reasoning, and the reasoning of my pro-choice colleagues, was simple:  Killing an infant who is born alive, either by an act of omission or  commission, is infanticide. It was, is, and always should be against  the law, and we saw no harm in reaffirming that fact.   That law passed Congress with bipartisan support precisely because it  was harmless, even if it was also useless since it did not change the  preexisting law in any way because, after all, murder is murder in  every State.   The bill specifically just reiterated existing law in florid language  and did nothing to interfere with doctors' medical judgment or to cause  needless harm.   Unfortunately, the bill before us today puts children's lives and  health at risk. It requires doctors to immediately ensure  transportation and admission of the infant to a hospital in all cases,  with no regard as to whether doing so is actually in the best interest  of the child's health and well-being.   This mandate effectively overrides the careful case-by-case exercise  of professional medical judgment by healthcare providers and replaces  it with a blanket rule enforceable with criminal penalties. It may be,  after all, in a given case, that it is more beneficial to the infant's  health to be treated on the spot and not rushed to a hospital  immediately.   Such a ham-fisted approach fails to consider the fact that, in many  cases, it may be safer and more conducive to the infant's health to  care for the infant where it was born rather than transporting it many  miles away to a hospital.   This bill assumes that Congress knows better, and it imposes a new  obligation on providers that, rather than saving lives, puts infants at  risk.   Perhaps, if this bill had gone through regular order, we could have  avoided this unfortunate situation. There has never been a committee  markup or a hearing on this bill, not in this Congress or in any  previous Congress.   I would have welcomed the opportunity to hear from expert witnesses  on best practices and standards of care for infants. Members could have  offered amendments and perfected the bill to ensure that it achieves  our common goal of providing the best, most medically appropriate care  to infants and their mothers.   I am disappointed, but not surprised, that my colleagues rushed this  bill to the floor when there is no evidence at all that doctors  currently are failing to provide an appropriate level of care and when  a chorus of provider groups oppose this bill.   Sadly, rather than protecting infants, my Republican colleagues are  putting them at greater risk in the service of politics. Indeed, by  bringing this bill straight to the floor as one of the first measures  to be considered by the 118th Congress, Republicans and the most  extreme elements of the anti-abortion movement have signaled their  determination to enact a nationwide ban on abortion.   I cannot support H.R. 26 because it mandates a particular course of  treatment, the immediate transport to a hospital, which may not be  appropriate and may be medically dangerous in certain cases. In doing  so, it abandons the practice of considering the best medical interest  of infants and their mothers.   Republicans have made clear where they stand about a woman's right to  control her body. Make no mistake: This bill is another step in their  plan to criminalize abortion nationwide.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this ill-conceived  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Jeffries), the distinguished minority leader of the House.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean), a member of the Judiciary Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon), a member of the Judiciary  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the ranking member of the  Appropriations Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a member of the Judiciary  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Lois Frankel).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, Mr. Scalise and every other Republican who has spoken  on this bill is simply wrong on the facts. It is illegal and always has  been illegal in every State and then Federal law to kill an infant born  alive. It is illegal and always has been illegal not to provide that  infant with appropriate medical care.   Just to make sure that no one had any doubts of that, we passed the  Born-Alive Infants Protection Act with bipartisan support in 2002.   The problem with this bill is not that it provides any new  protections for infants. The problem with this bill is that it  endangers some infants by stating that that infant must immediately be  brought to the hospital where, depending on the circumstances, that may  be the right thing to do for the health and survival of that infant or  it may not.   That is the problem with this bill.   It directs and mandates a certain medical care which may not be  appropriate, and which may even endanger the life of an infant in  certain circumstances. That is why we oppose this bill. It is not  because we don't think that babies born alive must be saved, but  because we do think that babies born alive must be saved.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentlewoman from  Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Mrs. Fletcher).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Chu.)    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Goldman).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from New York (Mr. Espaillat).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Kamlager-Dove).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Scholten).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DeGette).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1  minute.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I will end this debate by reiterating the point I made at the  beginning: This legislation would do nothing to enhance protections or  the quality of healthcare if an infant is born after an attempted  abortion.   It has always been against the law to intentionally kill or harm a  newborn infant, whatever the circumstances of its birth. It has always  been against the law not to afford such an infant appropriate medical  care. The bill does nothing new to protect infants.   The bill, however, is not harmless. Rather, if enacted, it could  place the lives and health of newborn infants at risk. The bill  directly interferes with a doctor's medical judgment and dictates a  medical standard of care, namely, immediate transport to a hospital,  that may not be appropriate in the particular circumstances.   That is why a broad coalition of healthcare provider groups, joined  by a wide range of additional health, civil rights, and women's rights  groups, strongly opposes this bill.   We should listen to these healthcare professionals. We should support  keeping babies alive, which is what the Republicans say they want to  do, but yet, they have this legislation that would endanger babies'  lives by dictating a standard of care that may not be appropriate in  certain situations. We should listen to these healthcare professionals.   This legislation is just another step in the Republicans' plan to  criminalize abortion nationwide. The House must reject this seriously  flawed bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
