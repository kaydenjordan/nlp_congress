 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the American Rescue  Plan.   Last year, as the COVID-19 pandemic first spread, I worked across the  aisle to pass the CARES Act. Passing that bill required compromise, and  the final legislation omitted key provisions that I wanted us to  deliver on. But the American people got the relief they needed, and  that was what was the most important thing.   One year later, with Democrats in the White House, Republicans won't  help us in this pandemic. Why? Because Donald Trump's name won't be on  the stimulus checks? Is that how easily they will abandon their  constituents?   The American Rescue Plan will deliver $1,400 stimulus checks, cut  child poverty in half, and provide critical support to help our  communities recover and reopen.   The time for action is now, and if Republicans won't help us crush  the coronavirus, we will do it without them.   For the sake of my constituents and all Americans, I am voting  ``yes'' on the American Rescue Plan.
