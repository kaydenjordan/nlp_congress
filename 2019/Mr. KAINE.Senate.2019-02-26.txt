 Mr. President, our Nation's continued economic progress  and the social mobility of our citizens are contingent on the education  and skills of the American workforce and its ability to adjust and  fulfill the needs of the 21st century economy. Career and technical  education (CTE) programs are an essential piece of every student's  education, providing them access to the important knowledge, skills,  and credentials needed to obtain careers in rapidly growing, high- demand fields. Today, approximately 12.2 million students across the  Nation are enrolled in CTE programs offered by thousands of career  academies, comprehensive high schools, CTE high schools, community  colleges, and CTE centers. Through intentionally designed applied  learning, these students gain workplace skills and technical training  that mirror in-demand positions in the workforce.   In the coming decade, a projected 3 million skilled workers will be  needed to fill infrastructure positions in the United States, including  jobs related to designing, building, and operating transportation,  housing, telecommunication, and utilities facilities. CTE programs  intentionally match employability skills with workforce demands,  lowering the probability of students dropping out of high school and  increasing their likelihood of graduating on time. These skills-based  training programs will help fill the estimated 30 million U.S. jobs  available with an average income annual income of $55,000 that do not  require a bachelor's degree yet necessitate some level of postsecondary  education.   Across Virginia, I hear from manufacturers frustrated by the shortage  of qualified skilled production employees--roles that require the  training and instruction provided in CTE classrooms. It is essential  that we elevate the important role of CTE in the country's ability to  meet the interconnected challenges of economic development, student  achievement, and global competitiveness. Last year, Congress affirmed  the importance of CTE by passing the Strengthening Career and Technical  Education for the 21st Century Act which supports CTE programs in  secondary and postsecondary education.   Today, with my Senate CTE Caucus co-chairs Senator Portman, Senator  Baldwin, and Senator Young and 47 colleagues in the Senate, I am  pleased to introduce a bipartisan resolution to designate February as  Career and Technical Education (CTE) month. CTE Month encourages  students, parents, counselors, educators, and school leaders to learn  more about the diverse educational opportunities offered in their  communities, and recognize the valuable role of CTE in developing a  well-educated and highly skilled workforce in the United States.   By formally recognizing CTE Month through this resolution, it is our  aim to raise greater awareness of the importance of improving access to  high-quality CTE for millions of America's students and our nation's  ongoing economic competitiveness.                            ____________________
