 Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, at its core what this amendment says is simple: After an  estimated 30,000 extrajudicial killings in the Philippines between 2016  and today, after the assassinations, arbitrary arrests, torture, and  red tagging of labor organizers and opposition leaders, after former  President Duterte's calls for assassinating politically engaged  bishops, after the Philippines has been named year after year by the  International Trade Union Confederation as one of the world's 10 most  repressive countries for the labor movement and workers, the time is  long overdue to begin putting some basic human rights guardrails in  place in the United States-Philippines relationship.   I believe our policy should be built on a clear principle: Our  constituents' tax dollars should not be used to supply weapons,  training, or any other assistance to state security forces that  violently target political opponents, including a United States  citizen, Brandon Lee, a human rights activist, who was shot by state  security forces in 2019 and remains paralyzed from the chest down today  as a result of that attack. Brandon deserves to know that his  government stands with him, not with his attackers.   I have made this point to the Trump administration, and I am making  it to  [[Page H6586]]  the Biden administration. If we in the United States are going to say  that we stand for human rights around the world, then we need to stand  for human rights around the world, not just when it is politically  convenient and not just when it is easy.   Is it too much to ask that our country put some modest conditions on  arming and assisting the security forces of an authoritarian government  waging war on its own people?   Is it too much to ask that our government side with workers and the  labor movement here at home and around the world? With faith and  religious leaders? With human rights activists and dissidents who are  simply trying to build a free society?   Those who oppose this amendment will claim that providing uncritical,  unconditional assistance to the Philippines, regardless of the war its  government is waging against its own population, is critical for our  national security objective of countering China. But the need to  counter the Chinese regime's authoritarianism on the international  stage is precisely why it is so important that we maintain our  credibility on human rights. It is why it is so vital that we do not  undermine our own case for democracy and open ourselves up to charges  of hypocrisy by supporting brutal regimes out of short-term political  expediency.   Let's pass this amendment and send a resounding signal to the world  that we are prepared to make respect for human rights a cornerstone of  U.S. foreign policy rather than an empty slogan that we yield  arbitrarily.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, my colleague across the aisle is arguing for  the status quo. As I said before, it is critical for our own national  security objectives of countering China that we maintain our  credibility on human rights issues. It is absolutely vital that we do  not undermine our own case for democracy.                                time  1200    If I have one message for all those who defend the status quo on this  issue, all those who claim that we effectively need to choose between  our security and our principles, it is this: It doesn't need to be this  way. Abdicating our values makes us less secure in the long run. That  is why I urge my colleagues to pass this amendment by a resounding  margin and to cosponsor my bill, the Philippines Human Rights Act.   The vote on this amendment is just a first step of what must be a  sustained commitment to standing with the people of the Philippines.  Together, we can finally begin shaping a U.S. policy toward the  Philippines that is anchored in respect for human rights and human  dignity, those of the people of the Philippines as well as those of our  people and all people around the world.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, during Roll Call No. 337 on H.R. 7900, I  mistakenly recorded my vote as no when I should have voted yes.
