 Mr. Speaker, since being sworn in as Michigan's Fifth  Congressional District Representative, I have been fortunate to get to  know so many great people.   From Lake Michigan to Lake Erie, I have been traversing southern  Michigan to meet with my constituents and discuss the many issues that  are important to them.   I have met with Michigan DNR at Warren Dunes State Park to discuss  how we can protect the Great Lakes and our natural resources here in  Michigan.   I have been able to tour several small businesses and manufacturing  facilities across the district, meet with law enforcement from Berrien  County to Monroe, and have meetings with local leaders in Adrian,  Jackson, Marshall, Monroe, New Buffalo, Niles, Stevensville, and Three  Rivers.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to continued meetings with my  constituents and serving the great people of Michigan's Fifth District  that celebrate Michigan's 186th birthday this very week.                            ____________________
