 Mr. Speaker, last night, as we all watched  football, no matter who you rooted for, team sports also still comes  down to individuals. Last night, a young man named Deshaun Watson--the  favorite son of Gainesville, Georgia, my hometown--showed the character  that I have witnessed since he was a young boy, playing with my son in  the 7- and 8-year-old little flag football league.   His athletic ability has never been questioned, and last night it was  on full display for the world to see. I believe that he is the best  college football player in the country. Beyond football playing, he is  a better man. He is looking forward to the leadership of his team, to  the leadership of his classmates, and the leadership he has shown in  his community back in Gainesville is exemplary and will not be  forgotten.   Gainesville is proud of its favorite son, Deshaun Watson, and of the  national championship that he won last night with his team, Clemson,  during the football game. But, as with everything in life, as the game  ended, it reminded us that the games are played by men of character.  Deshaun Watson is a man of character, and I look forward to watching  his career as he goes forward.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, by direction of the House  Republican Conference, I send to the desk a privileged resolution and  ask for its immediate consideration.

Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only,  I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  Polis), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous material on H. Res. 33, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring forward  this rule on behalf of the Rules Committee. The rule provides for the  consideration of H.R. 5, the Regulatory Accountability Act, and H.R.  79, the Helping Angels Lead Our Startups, or HALOS, Act.   The rule provides for 1 hour of debate for each bill, equally divided  between the majority leader and the minority leader and the chairman  and the ranking member of the Financial Services Committee,  respectively. The rule also provides for a motion to recommit for both  pieces of underlying legislation.   Yesterday, the Rules Committee had the opportunity to hear from  Congressman Tom Marino and Congressman Hank Johnson, on behalf of the  Judiciary Committee, and from Congressman Huizenga, on behalf of the  Financial Services Committee. We also heard from several Members on  both sides of the aisle who testified on their amendments. The Rules  Committee made in order both amendments submitted for the HALOS Act and  16 amendments from Members on both sides of the aisle for the  Regulatory Accountability Act.   Mr. Speaker, I spoke from this podium last week about the positive,  pro-growth agenda we in the majority are advancing. The bills before us  today are additional pieces of that puzzle, and they help us to return  to commonsense governance that fosters economic success.   H.R. 79, the HALOS Act, was introduced by my friend from Ohio, the  chairman of the Small Business Committee, Mr. Steve Chabot. Last  Congress, very similar legislation passed the House with my support and  by an overwhelming bipartisan majority. The HALOS Act ensures that so- called angel investors, who serve as the largest funding source for  startups in the United States, are able to effectively hold educational  economic development events, like ``demo days.'' The bill also helps to  ensure that startups can connect with angel investors who can serve as  funding sources, mentors, or outside directors.   In plain English, the HALOS Act helps to ensure that small,  innovative companies and startups have access to the necessary capital.  This, in turn, enables these companies to expand and generate jobs that  put Americans back to work while fueling our economy as a global hub of  innovation.   Mr. Speaker, in order to keep America's market competitive, we must  relieve American job creators and employees from suffocating  regulations. We can move toward this by helping government function as  our Founders intended. Our Constitution lays out a system of three  coequal branches of government, which is meant to fulfill unique roles  and to provide checks and balances for one another.   Over time, we have allowed cracks to form in that system, and we have  gradually seen executive agencies usurp power from the elected  officials of the legislative branch--to the detriment of hardworking  Americans and the separation of powers. We, too often, see unelected  bureaucrats handing down regulations that have enormous impacts on  small businesses, family farmers, individuals, and families. In an  unfortunate irony, these bureaucrats are isolated from the very  entities they are trying to regulate.   Congress must stop ceding authority to the executive and reassert the  power of the legislative branch to write law. The Regulatory  Accountability Act helps us do just that. It helps us to ensure that  burdensome rules that handcuff American business with red tape aren't  crushing our economy, our competitiveness, or our future. It also  restores common sense to the rulemaking process.   H.R. 5, the Regulatory Accountability Act, combines six bills that  have previously passed the House. I am a proud cosponsor of this  legislation.   I thank Chairman Chabot, Chairman Goodlatte, and Chairman Marino for  their thoughtful and diligent work on this legislation. Additionally,  Congressman Ratcliffe and Congressman Luetkemeyer contributed important  provisions to this package.   The bill reforms the process by which Federal agencies analyze and  formulate new regulations and guidance documents, clarifies the nature  of judicial review of agency interpretation, and calls for more  complete analysis of the potential impact of rules on small entities.   H.R. 5 includes the text of the Separation of Powers Act, which  amends the Administrative Procedures Act to overturn two doctrines that  call for judicial deference to agency interpretations of statutory and  regulatory provisions: the Chevron and Auer doctrines.   In plain English, the Separation of Powers Restoration Act prevents  Federal bureaucrats from interpreting the legality of their own  regulations at the expense of hardworking Americans and the  constitutional separation of powers.   Title I of the Regulatory Accountability Act requires agencies, when  establishing new rules, to consider the lowest cost option that meets  statutory requirements. The bill also provides for more public input in  the rulemaking process. Title IV of the bill, the Providing  Accountability through Transparency Act, requires agencies to publish  plain-language summaries of new proposed rules online. These proposals  are not farfetched. Instead, they provide more information and a voice  to the American people while reining in agencies that have gotten drunk  on their rulemaking power.   Mr. Speaker, our current administration issued over 600 major  regulations with an economic impact of over $740 billion. These numbers  show the staggering number of rules put forth by the executive branch,  but nowhere are the true costs of regulations highlighted better than  in the stories that I hear from my constituents. I know other Members  hear similar stories, and all across the Nation, we are seeing the toll  that overregulation has taken on growth and competitiveness.   Back home in northeast Georgia, Elbert County is known as the granite  [[Page H251]]  capital of the world, but a rule put forth by OSHA that is related to  silica levels threatens to jeopardize that industry; and, of course,  there is the waters of the United States rule, which could negatively  impact everyone from farmers to ranchers to Realtors. The menu labeling  rule is yet another example of a misguided regulation that the  administration has put forth without impunity. That rule would raise  costs for businesses, from restaurants to convenience stores, leading  to higher costs for consumers--in actuality, hurting the very ones that  it proclaims to help.   This is the irony of many of these regulations. Sadly, they are borne  out in the costs to the American people.   Last year, the EPA finalized a rule that established Federal  standards for residential wood heaters. In rural districts like mine,  many individuals may count on wood heaters to keep their families warm.  This EPA rule will raise costs for consumers and undermine families'  decisions about what type of heater may work the best for them.   Mr. Speaker, is this really where we want to go, having the Federal  Government decide things like this, away from the scrutiny of the  elected body? I think not.   The examples from this administration are numerous, but, importantly,  this problem of overregulation is not unique to this administration.  This is not a Republican or a Democratic problem. This is a balance of  power problem; this is a problem between branches not doing what they  are supposed to be doing and staying within that.                                time  1245    The Regulatory Accountability Act helps ensure that this  administration and future administrations do not ignore Congress by  writing law through regulation. It returns transparency to the process.  It restores Congress' rightful place as the legislative branch and  reins in the unelected fourth branch that regulators have become.   Mr. Speaker, many of the bills in this package have previously passed  with bipartisan support. I hope my colleagues can continue to agree  that Congress should make the laws and that we should do so in such a  way that encourages growth, innovation, and American ingenuity.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I think there is no better way to start this Congress  fresh but with some understanding. It is very clear, and it has become  obvious to Members here on the floor, that there is a discussion going  on. And, Mr. Speaker, if Members would like to see the difference that  is being portrayed here on the floor today, it is very obvious. There  is one party that is really concerned about tying the hands of  bureaucrats; and there is one party, the majority, that is looking to  untie the hands of the American people. I think I will side on the side  of the American people and job creators and job promoters, and those  who go out every day and earn a living.   We worked on this last Congress, and I will talk about it again here.  Let's not start the strongman that Republicans are wanting to do away  with all regulations. We do not. We want government to operate in the  most efficient manner possible and do what it needs to do, but also get  out of the way.   The problem with government, many times the government has  overstepped where it needs to be, and it needs to be out of the way to  start with.   Also, I would like to at least clear the record and make something  understood. At the beginning of the year, we are bringing a rule. We  had a full Rules Committee hearing yesterday, and Members were able to  offer amendments. Not all amendments were made in order. Sixteen  amendments were made in order on both sides of the aisle. I would like  to remind Members, Mr. Speaker, as we go back in history, we are  promoting discussion here in the Rules Committee and bringing to the  floor and allowing Members to talk about amendments and give them the  opportunity.   I will just remind Members, Mr. Speaker, in the 111th Congress, which  was controlled by my friends on the other side of the aisle, in the  very first rule bill they brought, the rules for the House, they put  two major bills in the rules package that did not even get a rules  hearing, that did not get anything except just pushed to the floor. I  think we will stand firm that we are pushing to the floor stuff that  Americans care about, and also doing it in a way that Members can  participate.   Speaking of that, the American people, especially the good folks of  Nebraska, have sent to us a new Member, and I have gotten the chance to  know him.   Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Nebraska (Mr. Bacon), and I welcome him to the floor.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, are there any more speakers the  gentleman from Colorado has?    I am prepared for the gentleman to close. I  reserve the balance of time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I serve a wonderful part of the world. With all due respect to all  the other Members of Congress, I do believe it is one of the fairest in  the country.   As I go around and travel, one of the things I have not heard, Mr.  Speaker--and I am not sure if you have or other Members sitting here--I  have never been hit, when I run into something saying the fact that  government is efficient, and I am really wanting it to be efficient in  a sense that it is working for me.   It is a very obvious statement here, and what we see time after time  after time after time is rules and regulations that most of the  American folks are saying: Government, do what you are supposed to be  doing. Get us back on a fiscal financial path that is solid, that  balances, that gets us back in understanding that we can't spend more  than what we make or bring in, and that we have to have a strong  national defense. Let's get back to the things that make America the  shining light all around the world.   One of the things I do not hear them asking me to do, Mr. Speaker, is  make it easier on bureaucrats in Washington. I have not had them beg  and bring petitions to my table and say: Please make it easier on  bureaucrats to run our lives.   That is not what we do. What we are trying to do is simply say: Let's  get up, go out to work, do the regulations that matter. Make sure that  government does what it is supposed to do. Make sure that the balance  of power is honored and not looked upon with disgrace. It is looked  upon as something that should be taken care of. Let the legislative  body be the legislative body. Let the executive be the executive, and  let the judicial be the judicial.   I have no problem putting before the American people the choice: Do  you want a party that will defend a bureaucracy that stifles them? Or a  party of the majority, like we are, that are putting forward regulation  reform that says, We want to help you; we are concerned about you?   Obvious choice, Mr. Speaker. Today we have two opportunities to this  rule. They both look at our economic engines in the country and  reviving it again.   The HALOS Act helps us ensure that small businesses have access to  the capital necessary to grow and succeed. Small business is the  backbone of our economy, and it makes sense to enact policies that  promote the viability and growth.   The Regulatory Accountability Act restores simple checks and balances  so that Congress, once again, makes laws so they work better for those  who elected us.   It is time we demand the voice of the American people be heard rather  than letting the others up here, separated in cubicles, decide what is  best. When we look at that, the obvious choice is clear. You pass this  rule, you vote ``yes'' on these bills, and you say to the American  people: I agree with the majority.   We are looking after those that get up every day and have the  American Dream in front of them and get up and say: I want to be better  and I want my government to be out of the way.   When we understand that, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support  this rule and the underlying bill.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:        An Amendment to H. Res. 33 Offered by Mr. Polis of Colorado         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2        (b) of rule XVIII, declare the House resolved into the       Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for       consideration of the bill (H.R. 356) to establish the       National Commission on Foreign Interference in the 2016       Election. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed       with. All points of order against consideration of the bill       are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and       shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by       the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Foreign Affairs. After general debate the bill shall be       considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At       the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the       Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with       such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and       amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit with or without       instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports       that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the       next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the       third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV,       resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 356.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous  [[Page H257]]       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time and I move the previous question on the resolution.
