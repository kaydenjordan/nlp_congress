 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, the Safe Drinking Water Act already makes special  priority for what is termed ``disadvantaged communities'' which is  based on affordability criteria.   I wish my colleagues who offered this amendment would have been here  last night when we passed an amendment to support rich communities who  have already funded their cleanup and are allowing them then to dip  back into Federal funds to make the payment.   So they may have, if they had a chance to be here for that amendment,  voted against communities that have already been able to afford to  clean up, but we are going to dip into this money at the expense of  poor communities. So that is kind of what occurred last night.    This covers a range of low-income communities that may have trouble  paying for infrastructure needs and has been widely supported as an  appropriate function of taxpayer support. This amendment creates a  broad new category that disproportionately exposes, and which would  appear to expand coverage beyond economic factors which may actually  undermine the straightforward support for the poor and the  disadvantaged already in statute.   I respect the desire to ensure prioritization to communities that may  be particularly hard hit with other economic and environmental issues,  but the workability of the new definition has not been closely examined  and may complicate the provisions of resources to those communities  that need it. A better way to do this would be to require a rulemaking  to sort out the best approach to prioritize funding to disadvantaged  people.   In a letter written by the water communities, one paragraph says--and  I would hope my colleagues would listen to this--because in every  community we have water companies that are supposed to provide safe  drinking water to our citizens. So the water companies have written to  us about this bill. And that is the American Water Works Association,  the Metropolitan Water Agencies, the National Association of Water  Companies, the National Water Resources Association, the National Rural  Water Association, and Water Environment Federation.   These are the people who are going to provide clean drinking water to  our constituents, and this is what they say about this bill:   ``Unfortunately, H.R. 535 would leave municipal water and wastewater  system customers subject to financial liability for PFAS cleanup under  CERCLA,'' i.e., the Superfund, ``even in cases where the system  followed all applicable laws and regulations related to  [[Page H155]]  PFAS disposal. This is in direct contrast to the objective of holding  polluters responsible.''   I include their letter in the Record.                                                    January 8, 2020.      Re Opposition to H.R. 535, the PFAS Action Act.         Dear Representative:  The undersigned organizations       representing the nation's drinking water and wastewater       utilities are writing to express our opposition to H.R. 535,       the PFAS Action Act of 2019. Unfortunately, the legislation       fails to protect water system customers from liability for       PFAS cleanup costs.        We believe that per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)       should be kept out of our nation's water supplies, and that       PFAS polluters should be held responsible. The fundamental       mission of water and wastewater utilities is to protect       public health and the environment, and in doing so they must       also be mindful of affordability and the financial burden       borne by their customers and the communities they serve.       Utilities are tremendously concerned about what PFAS is doing       in their communities and, as they have done with all previous       public health and environmental challenges, are committed       partners in finding a solution to this problem.        However, Congress must make a distinction between entities       that introduced PFAS into the environment, and water and       wastewater systems that are on the front lines of cleaning up       the contamination. Utilities are not the producers of PFAS,       but the receivers of PFAS and must dispose of water and       wastewater treatment byproducts containing traces of the       chemicals. A water system that follows all applicable laws in       its disposal of water treatment byproducts containing PFAS       should not be held liable under the Comprehensive       Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act       (CERCLA) for any further environmental cleanup costs related       to these chemicals. Doing so would penalize customers twice:       once when they make investments to remove PFAS from their       waters, and again when they are forced to pay to cleanup PFAS       contamination elsewhere.        Unfortunately, H.R. 535 would leave municipal water and       wastewater systems customers subject to financial liability       for PFAS cleanup under CERCLA--even in cases where the system       followed all applicable laws and regulations related to PFAS       disposal. This is in direct contrast to the objective of       holding polluters responsible.        It is particularly disappointing that the manager's       amendment proposed for H.R. 535 would offer a CERCLA       liability shield to airports that are required to use       firefighting foam containing PFAS, but fails to extend that       same protection to water and wastewater systems who may be       required to remove and dispose of PFAS. As receivers of PFAS,       water utilities should be afforded the same liability       protections that airports are being awarded in the       legislation.        Again, we share the goal of keeping the nation's waters       free of PFAS and holding accountable those entities that are       responsible for environmental contamination. But because H.R.       535 would leave water system customers unprotected against       liability for environmental cleanup of PFAS, we have no       choice but to oppose the legislation in its current form.            Sincerely,      American Water Works Association.      Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies.      National Association of Clean Water Agencies.      National Association of Water Companies.      National Water Resources Association.      National Rural Water Association.      Water Environment Federation.     Mr. Chair, it is just amazing that last night, the  National Journal published an article called: ``PFAS Bill Could Spark  Tort `Bonanza'.''                                time  0930    I will read from that: ``An association of U.S. trial lawyers with  deep lobbying pockets and the ear of influential Democrats is helping  to push a sweeping chemical-regulation package that could pave the way  for a prolific legal bumper crop.''   This is not just a forever chemical debate. This is a forever  litigation debate, litigation after litigation as Superfund sites get  established. They are there for decades, as I quoted last night  numerous times. We have Superfund sites that have been identified that  are still unremediated 30 to 40 years after they were established.   This bill attempts to use the Superfund as the silver bullet to  address this concern. I mentioned last night, but it is a new day: This  is the first time in the history of the Superfund legislation that, in  the Clean Water Act, we are legislatively identifying a chemical as  hazardous not using the scientific process.   For that and all the other reasons, I ask for a ``no'' vote on this  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, we addressed an amendment like this last night from the  gentlewoman from Maine (Ms. Pingree). Very similar, and I will raise  the same objections.   I have been here a long time, and I actually remember the Alar scare.  I also remember BPA, bisphenol A. That is the plastic--it was a kind of  the same type--that was going to kill everybody, and we ought to ban  it. We went through the scientific process and found out that it  wasn't.   In the meantime, did we need the government to offer labeling a ``- free'' product? The answer in the example of BPA is no.   Bisphenol A was used in baby bottles. Company retailers that made  bottles with other substances had no problems. In fact, it was a great  marketing attempt for them to say that it was BPA-free.   They didn't need government to do that. They did it because of the  advertising and the consumer potential to do that.   There will be, and there are, companies trying to do the right thing.  They should take advantage of that opportunity, especially in this  environment when we are dealing with 7,866 per- and polyfluorinated  compounds. The debate is that every one of those 7,866 compounds is  hazardous and destructive to individuals. If you are making a product,  this is a perfect time to be able to do that and say that it is PFAS- free.   Why would we have the government do that? Some could argue that this  is a corporate perk, that we are incentivizing and rewarding companies  through government action to do something that if they are good  stewards, they should be able to do on their own. That is why I have  some concerns with this.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record another letter from numerous of  these companies--some you would label bad actors; some you would label  good actors--as they submitted a letter in opposition to this overall  bill.                                                    January 8, 2020.        To the Members of the U.S. House of Representatives: PFAS       are a large and diverse group of chemicals with unique       properties that have been used in a broad number of       beneficial applications for years. Heightened attention to       potential health effects of certain PFAS has led to an       increased public concern and interest in new regulatory       protections in this area.        We understand these concerns and are committed to working       with legislators, regulators, and all stakeholders to       establish risk-based standards that protect human health and       the environment. We also support the development of a       consistent approach and clear timelines for assessing and       regulating specific PFAS across all relevant federal agencies       to ensure that government regulations, actions, and       communications are coordinated for maximum effectiveness.        Any federal action should not address PFAS as a class or       with predetermined outcomes, but rather should be based on       sound science and the weight of the scientific evidence.       Further, Congress should not circumvent existing regulatory       authorities. The Environmental Protection Agency, as well as       other relevant agencies, should retain their traditional       power to study PFAS and determine whether to regulate certain       PFAS. Many provisions included in the National Defense       Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020, signed into law at       the end of last year, took important steps towards meeting       those goals.        We look forward to working with you on this important       matter as the legislative process continues. We oppose H.R.       535, the ``PFAS Action Act of 2019.''            Sincerely,        U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Advamed, Airlines for America,       American Chemistry Council, American Coatings Association,       American Forest & Paper Association, American Fuel &       Petrochemical Manufacturers, American Petroleum Institute,       Associated General Contractors of America, Flexible Packaging       Association, Foodservice Packaging Institute.        International Liquid Terminals Association, National       Association of Chemical Distributors, National Association of       Manufacturers, National Cattlemen's Beef Association,       Plastics Industry Association (PLASTICS), Single Ply Roofing       Industry, Society of Chemical Manufacturers and Affiliates,       Specialty Graphic Imaging Association, TRSA--The Linen,       Uniform and Facility Services Association.     They say in this letter: ``Any Federal action should not  address PFAS as a class or with predetermined outcomes, but rather  should be based on sound science and the weight of the scientific  evidence.''   As I said before, this is the first time in the history of the  country that we are labeling a chemical formulation as toxic  politically using political science, not science.   They go on to say: ``Further, Congress should not circumvent existing  regulatory authorities. The Environmental Protection Agency, as well as  other relevant agencies, should retain their traditional power to study  PFAS and determine whether to regulate certain PFAS. Many provisions  included in the National Defense Authorization Act''--we talked about  that a lot last night--``for Fiscal Year 2020, signed into law at the  end of last year, took important steps toward meeting those goals.''  There is a list of 30 or 40 organizations. I am not going to read them  all this morning.   I appreciate my colleague's amendment. We actually were close when we  were thinking about getting a bipartisan bill to bring to the floor.  This was one of the provisions that was on the table. My friends, I  believe, couldn't say yes, so here we are, fighting this bill that the  Senate will not take up, and the President will not sign, and you will  have to wait for the next Congress to address this issue.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I am happy to follow the Speaker, and I do have great respect for  her. It gets me in trouble in my district every now and then when I  talk about our relationship, but it has to be said that I can't allow a  revisionist history to report on what occurred, especially on the Safe  Drinking Water Act and in the final negotiations.   It is well-reported that there was a three-corner agreement. One  corner couldn't get there, and that is why we didn't have it. I won't  name names. I won't point fingers. But to point this over at our  friends in the other side of the building where they had come to an  agreement, that is just not accurate.   I would also point out that, in this bill, we are exempting airports  from Superfund liability. We are not exempting medical devices. We are  not exempting military contractors. We are not exempting water  companies. We are exempting airports who use, probably the most toxic  of all these chemicals: firefighter foam. Somehow, they were able to  get a carve-out where other companies, industries, could not.   The only other organization that benefited was the Trial Lawyer  Association. I want to mention that again. It is amazing, the article  came out last night. I am not sure how that happened, but it states in  the article:         An association of U.S. trial lawyers with deep lobbying       pockets and an ear of influential Democrats is helping to       push a sweeping chemical regulation package that could pave       the way for a prolific legal bumper crop.    Now, where would that happen in this bill? Well, it would happen in  the Kildee amendment that we passed last night, which would federalize  information publication that States should handle. We can get that at  the Federal level, then the trial bar could go through this  information. The Pappas amendment had unrealistic deadlines, so they  had this litigation based upon not being able to meet a deadline.   Then you have section 2 of the Superfund designation without science  and unrealistic review deadlines.   Section 4, toxic labeling of unrealistic risks without a review.   Section 15, Clean Air Act designation without science and unrealistic  review deadlines.   And the Brindisi amendment, we passed, that makes it marginally  better, but, of course, not good enough for us to be able to accept  that--or at least me--in the vote on the floor.   So, if this colleague of mine would amend this amendment and say  let's have transparency on the class action lawsuits, then the  litigation and the legal costs of doing this--we know that Superfund  designation is not a silver bullet to cleanup, and I used this numerous  times last night.   Old Springfield, Vermont, was added on the Superfund list, September  8, 1983. Guess where it is 36 years later? Still on the Superfund list.   Colbert Landfill, Spokane, Washington, added September 8, 1983. Guess  what it is? Still a Superfund site 36 years later.   We should do a transparency look at how much litigation and money has  been spent, both by the government and lawyers, on these Superfund  sites. And, if we want to talk about transparency, I think that would  also be a good way. Maybe we could have a bipartisan agreement on  timelines and remediation, but also follow the money. Where is the  money going?   So this amendment does not require informing Congress of private- sector actions to clean up PFAS under Superfund and is unclear how much  cleanup is being done by other Federal agencies. Plus, this is  something that the Government Accountability Office or the  congressional committees could do without such expense to the Federal  Government.   Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment,  although I do not believe I will oppose the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, the gentlewoman brings up an issue about firefighter  foam. She talks about military installations. She does not talk about  commercial aviation and waterway issues which are exempted in this  bill.   Again, I am not sure why we are wanting to clean up all PFAS  contamination, the world is ending, but we exempt airports. We don't  exempt medical devices.   Let me hold up this. This was used last night. This is a medical  device that is inserted into a child, maybe an unborn child, to close a  hole in the heart. FDA said this is safe to insert into a heart. You  want to talk about daily exposure? Here is daily exposure in an infant  child.   So the nexus between the gentlewoman's amendment and this debate is  that maybe when we are investigating firefighter foam for alternatives,  maybe we are going to investigate alternatives for this type.   FDA has approved this. So why are we going to possibly ban chemicals?   We also mentioned last night that the Food and Drug Administration  has claimed PFAS lining for food packages is safe. So we already have  government entities that have investigated portions of the PFAS world.   Remember, we are talking about 7,866 different permutations; not one  chemical, not two chemicals, but 7,866. And this is the first time in  the history of our Nation that, without science and due diligence, we  are going to label a chemical as toxic. That is part of the objection.   Let's use real science. I get beat up all the time, being a science- denier, climate change.   Here, my friends on the Democrat side aren't ready to rely on science  to address each of these 7,866 different applications. In fact, they  are trying to, in this legislation, cause a rush to judgment, create an  inability for the EPA to make a decision. So then, the companies can be  sued because there is no way they can meet the timelines based upon  this bill.   I would like to also read from the American Council of Engineering  Companies letter, a letter that I will ask, at the appropriate time, to  submit to the Record; and it says this: ``By designating certain PFAS  chemicals as hazardous substances under CERCLA,'' which is the  Superfund, ``as called for in H.R. 535, we are concerned that such  action could upset the progress already made to address this challenge,  divert resources away from more pressing threats to water quality, and  impose significant costs and liability on our water utility clients and  the ratepayers they serve.''   Mr. Chairman, I include the letter I just referenced in the Record.                                                 American Council of                                           Engineering Companies,                                    Washington, DC, January 9, 2020.      Hon. Frank Pallone,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Pallone and Ranking Member Walden: On behalf       of the American Council of Engineering Companies (ACEC)--the       business association of the nation's engineering industry--we       wish to express our concerns over H.R. 535, the PFAS Action       Act. While we agree that aggressive steps are needed to       protect water resources from per- and polyfluoroalkyl       substances (PFAS) contamination, we believe that ongoing       efforts at the federal level to develop risk-based       regulations offer a more effective approach to address this       problem.        ACEC represents over 5,500 engineering companies and       thousands of engineering professionals who work on a daily       basis to improve the nation's water infrastructure and       protect human health and the environment. While PFAS       chemicals have been in wide use for many decades, concerns       have emerged in recent years regarding the health effects of       certain types of PFAS. In response to this, federal and state       regulators, as well as water supply, wastewater and other       stakeholders are working together to define the public health       risks of the PFAS chemicals as well as consideration of       technologies to cost-effectively mitigate those risks.        The Council supports this deliberative, consistent and       data-driven approach to developing risk-based PFAS standards.       By designating certain PFAS chemicals as hazardous substances       under CERCLA (Superfund), as called for in H.R. 535, we are       concerned that such action could upset the progress already       made to address this challenge, divert resources away from       more pressing threats to water quality, and impose       significant costs and liability on our water utility clients       and the ratepayers they serve.        We would respectfully urge the House to reconsider this       approach, and instead work to support and where necessary       enhance the existing regulatory framework and action plan.            Sincerely,                                                  Linda Bauer Darr,                                                   President & CEO.     Mr. Chairman, I already asked for inclusion in the  Record a letter from the local municipal water plants, or the rural  water associations, or the for-profit-owned water companies who said  this makes it more difficult for us to clean up the water. We are going  to be held to Superfund liability. We have to pay the court costs.   Now we have exempted airports. We haven't exempted the water  companies. That is really just a pass-through. They are receiving, they  are cleaning up, and then they are disposing, but we are not going to  exempt them. We are going to exempt airports.   We are not going to exempt medical device manufacturers who are  saving  [[Page H160]]  the lives of unborn children who have daily exposure of PFAS; and this  is a lifesaving application.   This is just one of many. I could pull up heart stents. Last night we  also talked about F-16s and our defense industry.   Maybe, with this amendment, we will do due diligence and find a  suitable chemical formula that will replace this. So I applaud it. I  think it is well thought of. It is meaningful.   I would also like to, in the end, because this will probably be my  last time to be able to talk on this. We, on both sides of the aisle,  really need to thank legislative counsel, because of the short  timeframe they had in the amendment offerings, their response to the  majority's concerns and writing. And actually, obviously, we are  probably more difficult because we are trying to really dig in and find  the fallacies of the coming amendments.   So my personal thanks to legislative counsel and professional staff  who worked tirelessly on behalf of both sides.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
