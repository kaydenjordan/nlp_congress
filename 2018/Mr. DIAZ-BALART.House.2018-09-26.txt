 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill.   Mr. Speaker, for nearly a decade, the town of Miami Lakes has  attempted to receive a unique ZIP Code. This would help with auto  insurance rates, branding, economic development, and, frankly, lead to  less election confusion and census confusion. Despite this, the Postal  Service has yet to take action, unfortunately.   I will tell you this is an important priority for my constituents  back home in Miami Lakes. In fact, just last week, Mr. Speaker, I  received a call from a constituent asking about what was going on with  this issue. He was asking for an update and was relaying his  frustration because of his rising auto insurance rates. Thankfully,  this legislation solves that problem. It grants Miami Lakes and others  their own ZIP Codes.   I would like to give credit and thanks to Miami Lakes Mayor Manny  Cid. It has been a privilege to work with him. He has shown great  perseverance and dedication, and I am glad that, together, we are able  to make this happen.   However, as everyone knows, the work is not finished. Last Congress,  [[Page H9081]]  the House passed a nearly identical bill like this one today.  Unfortunately, the Senate did not take it up. There is ample time to  get this passed before the end of this Congress.   So I implore my colleagues on the other side and the Senate to get  this bill to the President for his signature. We will not rest until  this bill gets to the President's desk and it is signed into law.   I want to again thank Chairman Gowdy for his help, and his committee  staff as well. Also, I thank Speaker Ryan, Majority Leader McCarthy,  and the whip, Mr. Scalise, for their help.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this legislation.
