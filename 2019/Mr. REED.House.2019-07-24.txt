 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, first, I rise to thank my colleague, Ms. Chu, on the  other side of the aisle for her efforts on this legislation.   As we are proposing this legislation, Madam Speaker, we recognize  that discrimination in any form is never acceptable and that also the  PRIDE Act would remove that gender language in our Tax Code of  ``husband and wife,'' consistent with that of the U.S. Supreme Court  and now as recognized as the law of the land.   As we have expressed previously in some of our hearings on this  matter, there are some administrative concerns that we still hold on  our side of the aisle in regard to this legislation, in regard to the  audit function, the look-back opportunities that are there in regard to  the removal of IRS tax records after 6 years, and some issues technical  in nature that deal with compliance with this legislation.   We hope that those concerns can be dealt with administratively, but  at its heart, I personally stand here and join with my colleague from  California in support of this legislation and look forward to the  adoption of it, as I anticipate the passage of it here on the floor.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Schweikert), one of the members of the Ways and Means  Committee, who does great work.  [[Page H7317]]         Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I would be remiss if I did not take a moment to  recognize my colleague from Michigan, Mr. Levin, and his efforts on  this matter, as well to recognize the service of our fellow member of  the Ways and Means Committee, his father, Sandy Levin.   Sandy Levin was an individual who, even though we passionately  disagreed ideologically and philosophically often, was a gentleman I  enjoyed getting to know. I appreciate his commitment to this issue, as  well as now his son carrying on that legacy. That, to me, is a shining  example of this institution, where people can believe passionately in  their ideology and still work together in order to deal in a positive  way for the American people.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, in closing, I would just echo as we started.  I thank my colleague from California (Ms. Judy Chu) for her efforts on  this issue. I thank our chairman, Mr. Neal, who has artfully indicated  his words on the Record in regard to this issue.   Madam Speaker, what I would encourage Members to do is to consider  passage of this legislation--I know I personally will be supporting  this legislation--to make sure that our Tax Code is reflective of the  law of the land as it has been declared by the Supreme Court.   We recognize the administrative problems that have been raised  through the hearing process and the colloquy with the chairman of the  Ways and Means Committee, and we hope that those issues can be  administratively resolved.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1700
