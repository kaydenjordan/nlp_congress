 Madam Speaker, it is with great honor that I rise today to  anchor tonight's CBC Special Order hour.   I first want to thank the coanchors, Representative Veasey and  Delegate Stacey Plaskett, for their work on coanchoring the Special  Order hour for the caucus.   Our thoughts and our prayers are with those in the Virgin Islands,  Puerto Rico, the Caribbean, as well as those in Louisiana, Texas, and  Florida, and others who have been impacted by the devastating  hurricanes. We also pray for our brothers and sisters in Mexico, who  are recovering and rehabilitating after the devastating earthquake that  rocked their country. We encourage all to do what they can do to help  our brothers and our sisters.   Tonight, we are here to talk about how we must continue to root out  racism. We are here to talk about how we should bring our  neighborhoods, our Nation, together and not drive Americans apart.   What took place in Charlottesville, and the dialogue with the NFL  players, the NBA players, President Trump continues to highlight how  our President does not seem to understand what is at stake and how his  actions are undermining the strength and the stability of our  neighborhoods.   You have heard me say, as I have said it again and again two summers  ago when speaking to members of an African-American community at a  rally in Philadelphia, President Trump says: ``What do you have to  lose?''   He actually said: ``What the hell do you have to lose?''   That is right. What do you have to lose? Everything, Mr. President.  We have everything to lose: good schools for our children, safe  neighborhoods, reliable healthcare, quality jobs, peace of mind, and  that the next generation will be better off.   President Trump has been in office for almost 250 days, and all we  have to show for it is division, division, division. He has divided our  country in ways we didn't even think we wanted to acknowledge are still  happening in 2017.   For the next 60 minutes, we have a chance to speak directly to the  American people on issues of great importance to the Congressional  Black Caucus, the Congress, and the constituents we represent.   Madam Speaker, I would like to yield to the chairman of the  Congressional Black Caucus, the Honorable Cedric Richmond from the  Second Congressional District of Louisiana.    Madam Speaker, I would like to associate myself with the  remarks of the distinguished chairman of the Congressional Black  Caucus, who, under his leadership, has clearly demonstrated that he  understands and gets it.   Look at the President's actions just this past week. He is involved  in an incredible, misguided, thoughtless, careless Twitter fight with  the NFL, the NBA, and other athletes, while people in Texas, Florida,  Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands need emergency housing,  electricity, clean water, and other Federal aid.   When Americans think of big things, they think of the Office of the  President of the United States. Let me repeat that. When Americans  think of big things, they think of the Office of the President of the  United States.   In these times, Americans--and the rest of the world, for that  matter--think of the U.S. President as a person who takes time to think  over the great ideas of the day, works to fix the biggest problems and  find ways to make the world come together, no matter the party, no  matter the person.   Madam Speaker, I want to yield to a gentleman whom I have known for a  long period of time, and I knew his father, who was a real leader, and  he has definitely come along and carried that. As a matter of fact, we  are neighbors. He is from the great Garden State, the honorable Donald  Payne, Jr., of the Tenth Congressional District.    Madam Speaker, the gentleman from New Jersey is spot on,  as usual. He has a very quiet demeanor, but he is someone who, when he  speaks, is very clear and concise with his thoughts and his comments.  In the short period of time that I have been here, I have watched him  in action; and I think when you just heard his comments, you heard that  he really understands, as he said, that we all do believe in America,  but we know there is an awful lot of work to do, and he has certainly  expressed that.   Madam Speaker, professional sports is a system built on unity and  bringing people together. As civic leaders, we should take our cue from  them. Teams, coaches, players, spectators, football, basketball, ice  hockey, tennis, they are all great unifiers in our country. It is  disappointing to see players attacked in their effort to shed light on  inequality in our neighborhoods.                                time  1945    We know division and inequality exists in our neighborhoods. We  should be shining a light, as the gentleman from New Jersey just did,  on how to change this and make it better.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the great State of  Illinois (Ms. Kelly), someone who I have watched a great deal, and she  just did a fantastic job over the weekend. I watched her in action.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Illinois, who  was very succinct, and added points that she needed to. She was very  potent in what she just said.   Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New Jersey  (Mrs. Watson Coleman). She and I had the chance to travel together  during the summer, and she has been a fantastic friend.    Mr. Speaker, as usual, I am speechless as the gentlewoman  gives her comments because she definitely lets people know where she  stands, and I thank her for her comments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore),  another person who also is what I consider a wordsmith.    Mr. Speaker, as usual, Congresswoman Moore really gets to  the point, and I have watched in the short period of time and knew her  on the State level as we dealt in the legislature.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson),  someone who is very sharp and quick with his tongue.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman because he speaks truth  to power. He does not bite his tongue.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks, and to include  any extraneous material in the Record on the subject of this Special  Order.    Mr. Speaker, the next person is a rare blend of poise,  grace, and elegance. In the short period of time I have had the  pleasure working with her, she has been a gentlewoman, but she has been  a very powerful voice.   Those who watched her in the last month, she has fought for Hurricane  Harvey funding, but she has also done her job. She has been extremely  sophisticated.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the great State of Texas  and city of Houston (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 28 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Tuesday, September 26, 2017, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
