 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the importance of  the Surfside-Sunset Beach Nourishment Project to the residents of  Orange County, California.   Due to flood control measures and other shore protection and harbor  works made by the Federal Government, the 17-mile-long shoreline  between Anaheim Bay and Newport Bay no longer receives a natural supply  of sand.   As a result, Congress authorized the Surfside-Sunset project in 1962  to provide for artificial beach nourishment to stabilize affected  shoreline. Stage 13 of this project will combat continued coastline  erosion and protect coastal property.   Unfortunately, the Federal Government has neglected the Surfside- Sunset project in recent years, which has prevented stage 13 from  moving forward. This project has not been funded by the Federal  Government for 11 years. Let me repeat--11 years.   As the Surfside-Sunset project is one of many more Army Corps  projects for the people of Orange County, I will continue to advocate  for its prioritization by the Army Corps and Congress.                            ____________________
