 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Takano and Ranking Member  Roe and my Michigan colleague, Jack Bergman, with whom I worked on this  legislation, for bringing this bill to the floor, which includes  my legislation, the Transparency For Wounded Warriors Act.    This legislation will improve the Traumatic Servicemembers' Group  Life Insurance program, known as TSGLI, which provides financial  support to help servicemembers recover from severe injuries.   This issue came to me 7 years ago as a result of an injury suffered  by Sergeant First Class Cameron Corder from Clio, Michigan, my neighbor  just a few miles away from where I live, who sustained a severe back  injury while on Active Duty serving as a flight medic in Afghanistan.   Despite his traumatic injury, the Army repeatedly denied his TSGLI  claims, and for years my staff and I fought all the way to the top  rungs of the military to try to get Cameron his benefits. Finally, in  November of 2017, after years of denials, Cameron received those  benefits.   His experience, though, was a clear case of bureaucratic harm  suffered by a Wounded Warrior. His treatment was unacceptable. This  legislation will, hopefully, ensure that it won't happen to other  servicemembers.   I am pleased that the House has included this bill in this bipartisan  package. When it comes to my constituents and veterans, I don't give up  until I win.   I thank my friend Chairman Takano, and I especially thank Dr. Roe. I  very much enjoyed serving with you and look forward to staying  connected to you in some fashion.
