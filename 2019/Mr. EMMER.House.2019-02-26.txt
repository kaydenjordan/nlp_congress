 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the legacy of  Mathew Hall Lumber, which has been operating in downtown St. Cloud,  Minnesota, for 130 years.   Mathew Hall Lumber has been a fixture in the community and a backbone  of the local economy.   Maintaining a business is not an easy task. It involves blood, sweat,  and tears to sustain the test of time. However, with that comes joy and  fulfillment, something that generation after generation of the Hall  family knows all about.   One of the reasons why St. Cloud and the great State of Minnesota are  so incredible is because of hardworking people like the Hall family. By  maintaining their business in St. Cloud, they brought commerce, jobs,  and a great product to our community.   As Simonson Lumber purchases this historic company and the Hall  family transitions into a new chapter, I speak for all of central  Minnesota when I say thank you to the Hall family for your great  contribution to our State and our community.           Honoring Steve Taylor, A Great Minnesota Public Servant     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Sherburne County  Administrator Steve Taylor.   As Steve prepares to retire from his 30-year career, he leaves with  the reputation for providing the highest level of customer service.   During his time with Sherburne County and Carver County before that,  Steve has served Minnesota's Sixth District with distinction.   As a fellow public servant, I commend Steve for committing his life's  work to serving others. His dedication and leadership will be hard to  replace.   The employees who had the pleasure of working with and learning from  Steve will keep the good work going, but, certainly, his dependable  presence will be missed.   His efforts toward expanding Sherburne County's government center by  adding extra courtrooms, more security, and much-needed space will be  enjoyed by generations to come.   Thank you, Steve, and congratulations on an amazing career in public  service. I wish you a long and happy retirement.                     Honoring the Legacy of Steve Gilmer     Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of Steve Gilmer, who  has retired after serving 45 years as the CEO of the State Bank of  Delano, Minnesota.   Steve retired leaving an incredible legacy. He cultivated a family  out of his employees and built an environment based on humor, trust,  and excellence, inspiring all those around him to be the best they  could possibly be.   As a resident of Delano, I can say from experience that Steve led by  example and took the time to know and care for the customers who walked  through the door of his bank.   Most in the community knew Steve through his role as a volunteer, the  volunteer treasurer of the Fourth of July Celebration Committee for  over 40 years.   Delano is home to Minnesota's largest Fourth of July parade, and  Steve's service to that committee displayed his dedication to our  community.   Thank you for all you have done for the Delano community, Steve.  Enjoy your retirement with your family and friends. You deserve it.     Celebrating the Minnesota Central Region Small Business Development                                   Center     Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the Minnesota  Central Region Small Business Development Center for being named the  Minnesota Small Business Development Center of Excellence.   Located at St. Cloud State University, the Central Small Business  Development Center provides free consulting services and assistance to  those starting a small business.   The center services the majority of my district, counties such as  Benton, Sherburne, Stearns, and Wright. My constituents have benefited  greatly from the services provided and the numerous business workshops  focusing on educating local businesses and entrepreneurs on how to  improve their new business.   Special recognition goes to the current director, Barry Kirchoff, who  came to the center in 2006 with an extensive background in business and  economic development.   Today, their success continues because of Barry's commitment to  helping address the needs of the local small business community. His  hard work is evident.   Congratulations and thank you to Barry and the staff of the Minnesota  Central Region Small Business Development Center. Central Minnesota is  lucky to have you.          Recognizing the Achievements of the Waconia HERO Coalition     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the achievements  of the Waconia HERO Coalition. ``HERO'' stands for their mission, which  is to ``Help, Empower, and Respect Others.''   This community task force based in my district undertook the mission  in 2010 to reduce and prevent the use of alcohol, tobacco, and other  drugs by youth through education, engagement, and policy change.   What started as a group of parents, educators, and community leaders  joining forces to address bullying in  [[Page H2108]]  schools quickly became a task force tackling substance abuse.   In 2014, the Waconia HERO Coalition was awarded the Drug Free  Community Support Grant, providing $625,000 of funding over 5 years.  Today I want to congratulate them for receiving a continuation to that  grant, which reaffirms the incredible work this task force has already  done and will be doing and serves as encouragement to keep working  towards solutions to youth substance abuse.                            ____________________
