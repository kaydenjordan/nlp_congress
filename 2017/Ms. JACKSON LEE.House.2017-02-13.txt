 Mr. Speaker, on a warm Sunday morning, yesterday,  six men in a blue truck and six men in a black truck began shooting  along Griggs Road. Women and children fled. Families fled in fear of  their lives. Because of the gunshot noise, police were able to come,  and those who were hovering and sheltering could dial 911 on their cell  phones.   So today I want to join with the law enforcement coalition who are  working with former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords and Mark Kelly, who  are standing up against legislation that would deregulate and allow  civilians to buy silencers.   It indicates that the gun lobby applauds introduction of the Hearing  Protection Act. A quote in an article says many gun owners and  sportsmen suffer severe hearing loss after years of shooting. Yet, the  tool necessary to reduce such loss is onerously neglected and taxed.   What about the law enforcement officers who will suffer at the hands  of those who want to do us harm with silencers on their guns? What will  happen to those who will be murdered in the streets? What about them  and their families?   This is a legislation misdirected. This is a legislation that is  unfortunate. I join with my fellow Americans and law enforcement  officers, first responders, in standing up against a nonsensical and  misdirected initiative.   Let's stand with those who are to protect us and let's protect our  families and not support this legislation.                            ____________________     Let me thank my friends and distinguished leaders of  this Special Order, Congressman Veasey of Texas and Congresswoman  Plaskett of the Virgin Islands.   As I begin today, I want to pose a question that was posed by Eddie  Chambers. Chambers is a professor of art and art history at the  University of Texas in Austin.   As I say that, let me respond to Congressman Veasey and indicate that  we do have a lot of history in Harris County, but also in the State of  Texas. Also, I had the privilege of working for the Southern Christian  Leadership Conference during the leadership of, then, Ralph David  Abernathy and met Hosea Williams and many of the foot soldiers that  worked with Dr. King. I can see the historic perspective that they were  able to garner by their experience and association with this great  modern-day profit, a man who understood that injustice anywhere is  injustice everywhere.   As I answer the question, I want to cite from Eddie Chambers' article  that appeared in the Chronicle today. He said in one of his sentences:  ``Is there an important place for a celebration that might well appear  in some respects as anachronistic?   ``In a word,'' he said, ``yes.''   He went on to say: ``As a professor whose classes invariably deal  with aspects of African-American history and African Diaspora history,  any moment of doubt I might have about the validity of Black History  Month are dispelled once classes begin each semester. I am still  shocked and saddened at the level of ignorance among students of  important events and personalities that are part of African-American  history, and consequently, American history. I don't, of course, blame  my students, and this ignorance is by no means restricted to students  of a particular ethnicity or cultural background.''   In other words, he said: ``Widespread ignorance of Black American  history leads to an insufficient grasp of American history.''   So my few words tonight will explain or highlight the fact that this  is a need for not only African-American History Month, which is  February, but it needs to be taught throughout the year and integrated  into the education of all students, no matter where they live; and it  is shameful testimony that the books that children are learning from,  the curriculum, is so missing, so lacking in the history that is  American history--African-American history.   My challenge tonight is for those of my colleagues who are listening,  those educators in primary and secondary education, in colleges, Ivy  League and otherwise, what is your answer to the question: Is it now  still time to celebrate and commemorate Black History Month? What are  you doing about it?   I know that Texas is certainly full and rich with history, although  our schoolbooks do not denote that. In fact, there was a vigorous fight  with the Texas education board on their lack of responsibility in terms  of insisting on textbooks that had an accurate recounting of Black  history.   Certainly, we know--I hope that we know--the names of Congresswoman  Shirley Chisolm, the first woman African American to run for President;  my colleague and former predecessor, the Honorable Barbara Jordan, who  in the Judiciary Committee said, ``We, the people,'' and repeated a  statement of the importance of the Constitution; activists like Harriet  Tubman, Rosa Parks, and Sojourner Truth.   Secretary Hillary Clinton and myself introduced legislation to put  the first American bust, that of Sojourner Truth, in the United States  Capitol, where she sits today. Who would have known her name, had it  not been for the celebration through that legislation of over 2,500  women who came to celebrate the placing of this bust?   Astronaut Mae Jemison still remains the first African-American woman  to go into space. We have mathematicians Catherine G. Johnson, Dorothy  Vaughn, and Mary Jackson, who I believe are evidenced in the film  ``Hidden Figures.'' ``Fences'' is another great movie of great history.  We have Maya Angelou, Toni Morrison, and Gwendolyn Brooks. All of these  are evidence of great people.   Or the likes of Ruby Mosley, who started with the city of Houston but  was an activist and is an activist in Acres Homes. Not one thing of  good news happened in Acres Homes and around the city without Ruby  Mosley's great leadership. She is still going.   Barbara Jordan, Mickey Leland, Craig Washington, and myself, who  served in this seat in the 18th Congressional District, fought to make  sure that seniors had housing, make sure their Social Security and city  services were there, and standing up to fight for civil rights. There  were so many like Ruby Mosley. All of them should be placed in  literature to announce their greatness.   And then, of course, let me say how proud I am to have a father by  the name of Ezra C. Jackson, one of the first African-American  cartoonists working in New York City in the media of comic books. He  was a strange figure there. Tragically and unfortunately, as the White  men begin to return after World War II, the African Americans who  worked during that time, since he was the youngest of four sons--three  went to World War II--were displaced. Racism. But yet I am so proud of  him for being such an astute and brilliant artist. So much of his work  still remains, shown in the Smithsonian in its early stages of putting  together the  [[Page H1120]]  National Museum of African American History and Culture.   Also, my father-in-law, Phillip Ferguson Lee, one of the Tuskegee  Airmen. Clearly, it began as an experiment to determine whether colored  soldiers were capable of operating expensive and complex combat  aircraft but ended as an unqualified success, based on the experience  of the Tuskegee Airmen, whose record included 261 aircraft destroyed,  141 aircraft damaged, 15,553 combat sorties, and 1,578 missions over  Italy and north Africa.   This past weekend, we buried a church member of mine, Clyde  Alexander, who was also a Tuskegee Airman. To both of those men, we pay  tribute, and I ask the question: How many textbooks in America, in  school districts, rural and urban, have the story about the Tuskegee  Airmen?   Is the question: Do we need to celebrate and commemorate Black  history? If that is the question, then the answer is not only a  resounding yes, but what are you doing in the academic institutions  across America to ensure that we tell the story not of African American  history or Black history, but of American history?   Let me finish my remarks by adding a challenge evidenced in the Los  Angeles Times.   One of the things that comes out of the commemoration of African- American history is a connection to the diaspora. The Congressional  Black Caucus has been the singular connecting force to the diaspora,  whether it is to the Caribbean; whether it is to the African Brazilians  in Brazil who happen to be of Nigerian heritage; whether it is, as I  indicated, in the Caribbean, where my parents and grandparents came  from, from Jamaica; from Panama, where my grandfather worked on the  Panama Canal. All of this is part of the portfolio of the Congressional  Black Caucus, and I thank our chairman, Mr. Richmond.                                time  2000    We have been the strongest voices on these issues. Mickey Leland, who  was my predecessor, died on the side of an Ethiopian mountain because  he cared about the horrible and devastating drought that was killing  those in the region and he continued to want to take them food and to  hold dying babies in his hands.   Now we have a new challenge, and that is of Somalia, a new hunger  emergency. Millions are going to die if this President does not  recognize that his responsibilities include not only being the  Commander in Chief, but many times the chief humanitarian of the world.   In the last drought, some 350,000 children died in this region  because of starvation. Right now they are expecting that starvation is  going to impact hundreds of thousands of women and children. This is a  picture of a woman and her child walking by the dead goats that would  be the source of their livelihood because there is no water.   As I close my remarks, I call upon this Congress and I call upon this  President to get the wheels back on the White House and begin to  recognize that America has always been the comforter in receiving  refugees, and it has always been a friend of the continent of Africa.  There are Members of Congress who have gone to Africa in times of need,  but we have also worked with the administration, from George Bush to  Bill Clinton, to Barack Obama and many others, who recognized that we  are connected to the continent of Africa by the very slaves who were  brought here.   Let us fight for Somalia to survive. I call upon my fellow colleagues  to join me in legislation dealing with the starvation here, that we can  raise up humanitarian dollars and efforts to save the lives of hundreds  of thousands who are now on the brink of starving. That is what this  month commemorates, not only the African American history, but the  diaspora of which we are so connected.
