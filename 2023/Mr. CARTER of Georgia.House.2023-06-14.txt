 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  of Mr. Samuel Barnard Adams, a veteran, a banker, and a businessman  from Savannah, Georgia.   Sam was a graduate of Roanoke College and a member of Kappa Alpha  Fraternity. Sam served in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam war.  Afterwards, he worked as a banking officer with Citizens & Southern  National Bank before beginning his own company, Intermodal Shipping  Maintenance.   Sam was committed to community throughout his life, serving on the  vestry of Christ Church, as chairman of the Tybee Island Beach Task  Force, and a board member of both Hospice Savannah and Savannah Little  Theater.   His contributions to the culture and vitality of Savannah will be  felt for years, and his presence will be dearly missed.              Recognizing the Accomplishments of Michael Holton     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  accomplishments of one of my constituents, Michael Holton.   Michael was recently recognized as the Most Fab School Support Staff  member of 2023 by Effingham Living Magazine for his work at South  Effingham Elementary School.   He is an alumnus of South Effingham Elementary where he currently  works as instructional support staff in the technology department.   Outside of work, Mike was vice president of the Lowcountry Down  Syndrome Society, and he was selected to be 1 of 10 participants on  Treasure Maps: The Georgia Storytelling Roadshow. Treasure Maps is a  collection of short films that provide a personal viewpoint on living  with a disability.   He also was an avid moviegoer, current event guru, and a very  impressive equestrian.   I have had the opportunity to meet with Michael and I know personally  that he is deserving of this award.   Madam Speaker, I congratulate Michael again, and I look forward to  seeing what the future holds for him.                Honoring the Life and Legacy of Tommy Dubberly     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  and the legacy of Mr. Tommy Dubberly, a committed and heroic volunteer  firefighter from Glennville, Georgia.   Dedicated to public service, Tommy spent 40 years fighting fires in  addition to his work at the Department of Corrections where he retired  as a sergeant.   At Tattnall County EMS, he served as deputy director, always leading  by example and demonstrating unwavering care and support for his  community.   Even when he was off the clock, Tommy still found ways to build  community. As the vice president of his county's Shriners Club, he  helped build fraternity and camaraderie among his peers.   Mr. Dubberly's devotion to serving others is emblematic of the  virtues we should all strive to live by, and I mourn his loss dearly.                      Honoring the Life of Connor Mathis     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  of Connor Mathis, a 16-year-old whose tragic passing has impacted our  entire community.   Set to enter his junior year at Glynn Academy, Connor was a joyous,  young boy, always seen with a large smile on his face. His smile lit up  every room he entered, and Connor's infectious energy and love,  especially for sports, was constantly felt by those closest to him.   I mourn the loss of such a caring young man, and I give my most  sincere prayers to Connor's family. His family now wears shirts with  hearts colored green--Connor's favorite color--to honor him.   Madam Speaker, to those listening, next time someone wears green, I  encourage them to think of and remember Connor, a life we lost far too  early.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Griff Lynch on his induction into the International Maritime Hall of  Fame.
