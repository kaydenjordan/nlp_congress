 Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to my  constituent and friend, John Falkenbury who is retiring this month as  president and COO of the USO of North Carolina. John has served the USO  in North Carolina successfully since March 2009.   In this role, John has been responsible for planning, organizing, and  directing the operations of the Sate headquarters, five USO fixed  centers, and a mobile center in the areas in and surrounding  Jacksonville, Charlotte, Fayetteville, and Raleigh-Durham, NC. These  base and airport centers provide a full range of important services  including critical resiliency, transition assistance, financial  literacy, and children's educational programs; travel assistance at  Charlotte Douglas International, Raleigh-Durham, and Fayetteville  airports; deployment and homecoming operations; internet and video link  access; military and civilian community outreach programs; fallen and  Wounded Warrior escort services; holiday feasts; and extensive morale- boosting activities.   Remarkably, in the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew, the USO of North  Carolina was able to quickly arrange for nearly 1,000 care packages  that were airlifted by Blackhawk helicopters to soldiers and civilians  in the stricken areas. For 5 days, the mobile center deployed within 24  hours to establish a center in the Guard's primary and austere ``tent  city'' near Lumberton and provided basic necessity items, a BBQ dinner,  satellite, and internet services to over 400 soldiers.   I also rise today to thank Mr. Falkenbury for his 20 years of service  in the U.S. Army prior to his work for the USO. His military experience  included assignments throughout the United States and in Germany,  including battalion executive officer, 2nd Armored Division, Fort Hood,  TX; chief of operations and later director of public affairs, 56th  Field Artillery Command, Germany; director of public affairs, U.S. Army  War College and Carlisle Barracks at Carlisle Barracks, PA.   I am honored to congratulate John Falkenbury on his retirement from a  career of distinguished public service and to thank him for his  commitment to this great Nation.                            ____________________
