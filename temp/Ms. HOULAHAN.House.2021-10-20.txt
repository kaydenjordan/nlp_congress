 Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Speier for  yielding. It is a pleasure to be standing by her side and on the  shoulders of so many powerful women who have gone before me and who  have had this important conversation over and over and over again.   It is time that I have the opportunity to rise next to them in this  Chamber for a couple of reasons. One, we do have the opportunity to  celebrate some strides that we have recently made in securing the  historic paid family and medical leave for some people. My part of this  conversation will talk about that.   We also need to recognize where our Nation falls woefully short on  delivering that promise to support all workers and families in  Pennsylvania and beyond in this matter.   Like many of you all, I have pictures of my family in my office. For  me, seeing the faces of my husband of almost 32 years and our beautiful  daughters always buoys my spirit and is a constant reminder of the  story I bring to Congress.   As a parent, my own story begins with the birth of my first child  while on Active Duty serving in the Air Force. This chapter of my story  is important, and it drives my commitment to this critical issue of  work and paid family leave. In part because of the lack of affordable  childcare and limited time for my own maternity leave, I separated from  the service 30 or so years ago.   Sadly, my story is not unique. In fact, still to this day, we know  that there are problems, particularly with childcare issues on bases  that have wait lists as much as 6 months to a year. It is that story  that continues to play out in households, not just military households,  but all households across our country.   Too many people are faced with the impossible choice of caring for  their family or caring about their employment. The people in my  district and all of our districts deserve better.   As an empathetic, compassionate country, we need to be able to  understand and act on the repeated calls from the American people to  help one another. In this great Nation, people should not be forced to  choose between their kids and work or their aging parents and work.   It may be that you have not heard from any of those most affected, so  I will share a couple of stories from my own community.   Susan, in Pennsylvania, told us that not having access to paid leave  forced her to liquidate her retirement assets so she could care for her  newborn.   Lynn, also from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, is a home care  health worker, and she shared with us that without a single day's sick  leave, that meant that she is stuck with the choice between protecting  her own clients and having a short paycheck and unpaid bills as a  result.   When I think about the hardships of people like Susan and Lynn, I  know that is not who we are as a Nation. We can't allow mothers and  fathers to go into debt to raise their newborn babies and children. We  cannot accept a system that forces those who are sick to choose between  paying their rent or exposing their coworkers and clients to illness,  especially as COVID continues to wreak havoc on our country.   We cannot ignore the crystal-clear research that confirms what we  already know to be true, that paid leave is an overwhelmingly  bipartisan and popular idea. Democrats, independents, and Republicans  agree that family-centered policy strengthens our economy and small  businesses; it does not weaken them. We can, in fact, be both pro- business and pro-family.                                time  1815    So while my story is deeply personal, I am also an engineer, so I  would like very quickly to share some data and facts with you, Madam  Speaker, in addition to these stories. And here they are: Policies like  paid family leave will lift up the middle class. Sixty-two percent of  workers earning less than $30,000 a year received no pay during leave  for family caregiving or personal health issues compared to only 26  percent of those earning more than $75,000 a year. These policies will  bring more equity to our workforce. Over a 2-year period, 26 percent of  Black workers reported needing to take time for family or personal  health, but not being able to take that time, and 13 percent of White  workers reported the same.  [[Page H5719]]    These policies like paid family leave and paid medical leave will  strengthen our economy. Research shows that women have a greater  attachment to the labor force if they are allowed paid leave, and with  an economy that needs every single worker, we cannot neglect 51 percent  of our workforce.   These policies will also help small businesses. Over 60 percent of  the executives in a recent Bipartisan Policy Center survey believe that  paid family leave has a positive impact on employee morale, employee  retention, and their company's ability to attract new employees.   Lastly, these policies will modernize our U.S. economy. As many of my  colleagues have mentioned, we rank dead last--number 35 out of 35-- amongst advanced economies offering competitive paid leave for mothers  and others.   We simply cannot delay any longer, and the time is now to invest in  paid family and medical leave.   I would like to say that we are making progress. In 2019 I worked  with Chairs Maloney and Smith to successfully pass into law 12 weeks of  paid family leave for 2.1 million Federal workers, and I led  legislation through the Foreign Affairs Committee to harmonize parental  leave policies for State Department employees around our country and  around the world. This year, I helped to write a bill through the Armed  Services Committee that codifies 12 weeks of parental leave for all of  our uniformed servicemembers regardless of their branch of service.   This summer I championed an effort with over 100 of my colleagues  urging House leadership to include paid family leave in Build Back  Better, and, just yesterday, I co-authored this letter to President  Biden, again, with more than 100 of our colleagues asking him to do  everything in his power to protect these critical investments in our  Build Back Better Act.   This comes at a time when we are making progress for the people. As  House Democrats we are centering on you, the hardworking, sensible  families of Pennsylvania, as we deliberately invest in our shared  future.   As a member of the Democratic Women's Caucus, whom I am very grateful  to stand here with today, I stand united with my colleagues tonight,  and I assure you that we are ensuring that our economy is robust.   So when I see that picture of my family in my office and I remember  what is at stake for my family and for yours, I will continue to work  hard, along with all of my colleagues, to make sure that we are  protecting these interests and these dreams for our American future and  our people.
