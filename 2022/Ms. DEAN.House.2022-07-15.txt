 Madam Speaker, we all feel horror, sadness, and anger as we  learn more about the horrific shooting in Uvalde, Texas, and the police  officers' lack of response.   I wondered, what were they afraid of? One part of the answer is  clear: semiautomatic weapons.   For the sake of us all, we must pass the assault weapons ban, just as  we did in 1994.   Let us remember, the ban was backed by three former Presidents:  Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan. And it was supported by  police leadership then as it is today.   Republicans in 1994 had the courage to stand up to the gun lobby, and  yet Republicans in 2022 cannot find such courage. I don't know why.  Instead, they blame DAs and mayors and really anyone but themselves,  ourselves.   We are Members of Congress with the power to ban weapons that  civilians are using to murder neighbors, strangers, children, and even  police officers.   No more decapitated children.   No more slaughtered shoppers or parade goers.   Let us find the courage to act. Tikkun olam, as the Jewish tradition  teaches. Let us repair the world.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, Roe became law when I was 13. For my entire  adult life, the right to abortion care--to privacy and the freedom to  make my own family planning and healthcare decisions--was guaranteed in  all 50 States. It sickens me that it is not the case today. My  daughters-in-law, my  [[Page H6643]]  granddaughters, and all women and girls have been stripped of human  rights and relegated to second-class citizens.   After a decades-long effort, Republicans have fixed the Supreme Court  with a few Justices corruptly seated by an autocratic President, and  they now behave not as constitutional lawyers but as theocrats.   In overturning Roe and sending a woman's reproductive freedom to  State politicians--largely White, male--these Justices have decided  their faith should determine everyone else's rights, not the  Constitution.   This is a call to the Chamber, to this Chamber, to the Senate, to the  administration. We must restore, expand, and protect rights. We must  pass laws that combat this regressive, shrinking Court. No excuses.   That is why we are here, yet again, with legislation to codify the  right to abortion care.   Last September, the House passed the Women's Health Protection Act,  and the Senate sat on its hands. Today, we must pass it again.   I will return to the floor every session, with Representative Chu and  many others, until we protect and expand rights. I ask my colleagues to  do the same.
