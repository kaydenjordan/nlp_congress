 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Miami  Bridge organization located in my congressional district.   I would also like to highlight my friend and constituent, Judy  Reinach, also known as the barefoot hostess, for her tireless efforts  on behalf of this organization for decades.   Founded by Catholic Charities in the 1970s, Miami Bridge has been  helping young people in crisis who have run away, are truant, homeless,  or are having issues and problems in their homes.   From its humble beginnings in a city of Miami motorcycle repair shop  underneath the Metrorail Bridge, this incredible organization has been  a guiding light for our youth throughout Miami-Dade County who are in  need of assistance and do not know where else to turn. In fact, its  name, Miami Bridge, is homage to its humble location. Today, it has two  campuses--one in Miami and the other one in Homestead--that serve our  south Florida community.   Using its efficient intake process, Miami Bridge successfully matches  young people or family members with the services that best meet their  needs. Victims of abuse, of neglect, or worse seek refuge in the  comprehensive services provided by Miami Bridge in order to help turn  their lives around.   This organization's professional staff and its board of directors  provide counseling, case management, a formal academic education  program, mental health services, substance abuse prevention services,  youth development activities, life skills education, recreation, and so  much more.   Miami Bridge also offers First Stop for Families, a crisis  intervention service that helps head off conflicts and links families  to resources to help them open lines of communication, teach effective  parenting skills, reduce antisocial behaviors, and link families with  any other available resources.   As a former Florida certified teacher, I applaud its truancy  diversion services because I know that education, staying in school, is  the key to a successful life and future.   Madam Speaker, the statistics demonstrating the success of this  organization speak for themselves. Between 2015 and 2016, 890 families  were served by Miami Bridge: 93 percent of youth served were placed  back in their home or an appropriate placement after leaving the  shelter; 85 percent of youth remained in school after completing their  shelter stays.   However, the development of this incredible organization has not  occurred in a vacuum. The Key Biscayne Islander News has given Miami  Bridge events substantial coverage, and the Rotary Club of Key Biscayne  has helped raise funds for programs that help the neediest young men  and women in our community.   Many south Florida individuals and businesses have aided and  supported the mission of Miami Bridge over the past decades.   I congratulate its leadership: CEO Dorcas Wilcox, CFO Steve Hope,  Chief Operations and Technology Officer David Sharfman, Chief  Administrative and Compliance Officer Baldwin Davis, and Chief Program  Officer Mary Behr, in addition to its board members--Marlene Quintana,  Alfred Karram, Jr., Joseph Cantrell, Beatriz Martin, Judy Reinach,  Darren Campbell, Todd Giardina, Jahan S. Islami, Johane Domersant,  Julie Harris Nelson, Mayling Exposito, Michael Alvarez, Patrick Murphy,  Peggy Fucci, and Province ``Boo'' Zamek--on their tremendous work.   So Miami Bridge, here is to many more years of success and services  on behalf of south Florida's troubled youth. Thank you for all the work  that you do.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the decades  of service of my congressional community liaison and my friend, Harriet  V. Carter.   Harriet, a graduate of Tulane University, who participated in study  abroad programs, served as a congressional aide for many years in my  district office and, during her semi-retirement, has been a goodwill  ambassador to our community on my behalf.   Harriet Carter is a graduate of Leadership Miami, the Cuban American  National Council's Hispanic Leadership Training Program, and has been  active in the Greater Miami Jewish Federation, the Jewish Community  Relations Council, and a bevy of groups that help Floridians.   Harriet's tireless work in my office and throughout our community  demonstrates the positive impact that one person can have. Harriet  Carter's dedication to the service of others is an inspiration, and I  am sure that she will continue to work diligently on behalf of our  South Florida community for many years to come.                            ____________________
