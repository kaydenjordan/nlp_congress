 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Before the Senate adjourned for Memorial Day, I laid  out seven more nominations for our consideration when we returned--four  to fill important vacancies in the administration and three to the  Federal bench. So this week, the Senate will continue our work to  confirm more well-qualified nominees and finally let the American  people's President have more of his team on the job.   Yesterday we began by voting to advance the nomination of Andrew  Saul, of New York, to be Commissioner of Social Security. Mr. Saul is a  graduate of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and  has spent decades building a successful career in business and in  public administration. In addition to his experience in financial  management, Mr. Saul has previously served as vice chairman of the New  York Metropolitan Transportation Authority and as Chairman of the  Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, where he oversaw programs  relied upon by literally millions of Americans.   It is no surprise that our colleagues on the Finance Committee voted  unanimously to favorably report Mr. Saul's nomination to the full  Senate. I hope Members will reach the same conclusion and support his  confirmation.  [[Page S3172]]    Later, we will turn to the consideration of David Schenker, of New  Jersey, to be Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs;  Heath Tarbert, of Maryland, to be Chairman of the Commodity Futures  Trading Commission; Susan Combs, of Texas, to be Assistant Secretary of  the Interior; and three nominees to preside in a district court and the  Court of Federal Claims.   In each case, the President has put forward impressive and  uncontroversial individuals who, I might add, in a previous era, would  have been candidates for a voice vote. They are thoroughly qualified  for public service. Their nominations should not have been delayed even  this long.   In the case of Mr. Schenker, for example, our colleagues have forced  the top Middle East job at the State Department to remain open for 1  year. This is the top job at the State Department for the Middle East,  and they have kept it open for 1 year--a year that brought no shortage  of crises in that region.   So I am glad we are continuing to get things back on track. I hope  our colleagues will join me in voting to put each of these public  servants to work for the American people.                   100th Anniversary of the 19th Amendment    Madam President, on another matter, today, June 4, 2019, marks a  historic anniversary for the U.S. Senate. It was 100 years ago today  that this body passed the 19th Amendment to the Constitution and sent  it on to the States for ratification. It was 100 years ago today that  this institution finally recognized that American women deserved the  right to vote just the same as men.   Of course, this victory for equality and fairness had been a long  time in the making. The very same text that would become the 19th  Amendment was first introduced in the Senate more than 40 years before,  back in 1878. It was 40 years between the first introduction and the  final passage. It was introduced by Senator Aaron Sargent of  California, who, with his wife, was a close friend of Susan B.  Anthony's. When it finally received a vote nearly a decade later, there  were twice as many votes against it as for it. By 1914, there had been  progress. When it received another vote that year, it failed by only 11  votes. By February 1919, there was more progress, losing by just one  vote. The old justifications were eroding. Our Nation's true principles  and clear logic were chipping away at this old mistake.   Then, precisely one century ago today, the right thing to do became  undeniable. Women's suffrage cleared the Senate floor. The rollcall  vote was 56 to 25--2 more than two-thirds. Newspaper accounts tell us  that several minutes of sustained applause and cheers filled the  Gallery. Then the 39 words that would become the 19th Amendment were on  their way to the States, on their way to concluding a 42-year journey  and becoming enshrined in our Constitution.   Of course, this chapter of Senate history is just a tiny slice of the  incredible uphill battle that the broader women's rights and suffrage  movement waged in American politics and in culture. There were the  pioneering thinkers of the Seneca Falls Convention, such as Elizabeth  Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott, and their famous Declaration of  Sentiments. There was the incredible, history-changing intellectual and  strategic partnership between Stanton and Susan B. Anthony and the  prolific writing, coalition-building, and grassroots activism it  produced.   There were devoted organizers, such as Carrie Chapman Catt, Ida B.  Wells, and Mary Church Terrell, and so many more--both the dynamic  leaders whom history remembers and the millions more women and men who  lent their support to the cause and who made quiet contributions of  their own.   Some of them lived to see the fruits of their work become part of our  Constitution, and many did not, but the progress we celebrate would not  have been possible--it would have been literally unimaginable--without  them.   So this milestone brought one chapter of hard work to an end, but it  really started a new chapter in our history as American women became  more and more integrated into our democracy. It was just 6 years after  the 19th Amendment was ratified that my own State of Kentucky elected  our first female Member of Congress, Katherine Langley, to the House of  Representatives.   I could not be more glad that the Senate will spend today  commemorating this historic milestone. This afternoon, I know a number  of our colleagues plan to come to the floor to describe the history and  significance of this day in much more depth. Later, we will vote on a  resolution to officially mark the centennial of our predecessors'  historic vote.   Several more Senators have been working on additional legislation to  help our Nation mark the whole year of commemoration that begins this  spring and will continue through the anniversary of final ratification.   I want to thank a number of our colleagues who helped lead the  preparation for this. In particular, thanks to Senator Collins for her  leadership in coordinating today and focusing the Senate's attention on  this milestone. Thanks to Senator Murkowski, the lead sponsor for the  resolution we will be voting on this afternoon. Thanks to our  colleagues Senators Blackburn, Feinstein, Ernst, and others for their  hard work.   I would also like to thank the members of the Women's Suffrage  Centennial Commission, led by Chairwoman Kay Coles James and former  Senator Barbara Mikulski, the Vice Chair, and their staff, including  executive director Rebecca Kleefisch and Anna Laymon.   Madam President, 100 years ago today, American women's right to vote  was up for debate in this Chamber for the last time. As one Member of  this body remarked on June 4, 1919, ``The advocates of the Susan B.  Anthony amendment have won a great victory and are justly entitled to  all the praise and honor which comes with the winning of a battle which  has been fought for so long a time . . . the right of suffrage [for]  those noble, patriotic, and splendid women of our country who have so  long fought for this right and who so richly deserve [it].''   Today we reflect on our gratitude for that work, and we rejoice in  that victory.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 98, S. Res. 135.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the committee-reported amendment to the preamble be agreed to, the  preamble, as amended, be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 229, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  remaining votes be 10 minutes in length.
