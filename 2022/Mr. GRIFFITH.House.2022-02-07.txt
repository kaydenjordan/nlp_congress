 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4445,  the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment  Act.   I believe pre-dispute arbitration agreements are useful in some  circumstances. They can allow common, foreseeable disagreements to be  resolved quickly and efficiently, but we must acknowledge in the case  of sexual assault and sexual harassment, nobody signs on to an  employment agreement thinking that oh, I am going to be sexually  harassed or I am going to risk sexual abuse. They don't sign up for  that. And most of these contracts, Madam Speaker, are what we call  adhesion contracts. You have to accept it.   And what often happens is there will be a couple of pages that have  all the big items: Terms of the employment, salary, promotion,  vacation. And then they will incorporate a handbook. The handbook will  then have buried in it language that says all disputes must go to  mandatory arbitration. And oftentimes the people who are doing the  arbitrating aren't lawyers. The rules of evidence aren't applied. The  rules of law are not applied. It is just how they feel after they hear  everything.   This has created a situation that, related to sexual assault and  sexual harassment, is unconscionable. It shocks  [[Page H987]]  the conscience. And in fairness, it is a violation of public policy, in  my opinion, and should be eliminated as part of a contract.   I am surprised courts haven't already come to that conclusion, but  instead of having each court in each of the States and territories make  that decision, this act will do it once and for all, and we will have  done our jobs to make sure that in these egregious situations the  individual who is making the claim and who has probably been assaulted  or has been harassed or has some kind of a valid claim will have an  opportunity to go to court or have an opportunity to go to binding  arbitration, if that is what they choose, but they will have a choice  instead of having to go in front of company-picked arbiters who will  make a decision for them that will affect them the rest of their lives.   Now, I will tell you that it is important that we move forward with  this bill, and it looks like things are going well, but you never know.  But I will also tell you that there has been an allegation that it is  retroactive--and that is not accurate--as to cases currently pending.  It is accurate as to contracts currently signed.    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the amendment.   As we just heard, this was the majority party taking into account the  views of the minority party, which is why we have support on both sides  of the aisle for this amendment.   This amendment will bring more Members of the minority party onto the  bill. As one of the cosponsors of the bill, I think that is a good  thing.   I think this is an appropriate amendment. I think it does clarify.   I commend Mrs. Bustos and Mr. Buck for their hard work on this  amendment. I ask that everyone vote for the amendment.                                time  1800
