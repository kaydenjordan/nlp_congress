 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize Ken Starr of Clearfield, Pennsylvania, who was recently named  as the Western Pennsylvania Veteran-Owned Small Businessperson of the  Year by the Small Business Administration.   Ken Starr got his start as an entrepreneur in 2005 making wine from  just 12 grapevines on his Allegheny mountain property, aptly named  Starr Hill. His winery, the 100th licensed winery in Pennsylvania, soon  had over 3,000 grapevines making up 40 varieties of wine.   All his fruit and grapes are sourced from Pennsylvania farms and are  now carried by major grocery and convenience stores across the State.   Beyond wine, Ken Starr is known for his support for local charities,  giving regularly to the Pennsylvania Wilds and the State National Guard  Foundation, among many more. However, his lifetime of service began  long ago when he completed a tour of duty in the United States Air  Force. Now at the age of 82, many have pointed out, like fine wine, Ken  Starr seems to be improving with age.   I commend Ken Starr for being named the Veteran-Owned Small  Businessperson of the Year, and for his many contributions to  communities and grocery stores across Pennsylvania.                            ____________________
