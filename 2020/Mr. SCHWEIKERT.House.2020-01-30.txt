 Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana  (Mr. Hollingsworth).                      Honoring the Life of Lorilee Ward     Madam Speaker, I am going to come down to the lower  microphone because we are going to be using a number of slides, and I  want to apologize right now, this one is going to be a little thick. We  are actually going to do some information in regard to what CBO put out  this week and some other economic data and try to put it in  perspective. So let me come on down.   I get teased all the time about the charts and the fact that I can't  even get my wife to now watch me do these because she says I am boring,  but it is important.   Madam Speaker, what I am going to try to do today--and let's see if I  can do it as well as possible. I want to walk through what is a little  bit of sort of the political folklore that we engage in here about the  math when we talk about the deficits and the debt and the economic  future and when you hear people say things like the debt as compared to  the size of the economy and what is driving it, because, if we don't  actually sort of get our act together here and start to become honest  about just the math and what is driving it, we can't put together  policy.   I am incredibly optimistic that there is a path where we can digest  the realities of these costs that happen from our demographics, because  we are a society that is getting old really fast, but we do politics  now.   The other day, I am home and I am watching a little bit of one of the  Presidential forums. It is a candidate on the Democrat side running for  President from the Midwest, and his first comment was: These deficits,  this trillion-dollar deficit we are going to have next year, that is  because of tax reform.    It just breaks your heart because you know these individuals are  smart, and have we hit this world where, as Republicans--and please  understand, I beat up both sides--as Republicans, we had this history  of saying: Well, the debt and deficit comes from waste and fraud.   The left often said: We don't tax rich people enough.   All that is lunacy, and the investment in a calculator here would  really go a long way.   First, I brought a number of boards because, heaven knows, I am  incapable of speaking without my charts.   This, right here, is the change in receipts to the Federal  Government. Revenues are up, and they are up fairly substantially since  tax reform.   Do you understand last fiscal year revenues were up over 4 percent?  With the size of our economy, that is actually a big deal. Our problem  is we increased spending just shy of 8 percent.   Does anyone see a small math problem there?   Our projection is we will take in over $3.6 trillion in the fiscal  year we are in right now. Last year, revenues were about $3.462  trillion. That is a fairly substantial increase in these revenues, but  how can we keep running these massive deficits?   Well, it turns out it is spending, but it is spending on what we call  the mandatory side, the formulas that we don't get to vote on and we  are terrified as elected officials to talk about.   I am going to walk us through part of this math. First, let's do some  of the positive stuff, and then let's get to the really difficult  policy issues.   So, revenues are up, and they are going up fairly substantially. A  lot of this economic growth and receipts is payroll taxes. It is  because we are having a remarkable period here of employment.   When you look at what we call the U-6 data put out by the Bureau of  Labor Statistics, the number of our brothers and sisters who weren't  even looking for work that are moving into the labor force and all the  sudden now are paying payroll taxes, Social Security, Medicare, these  things, is remarkable.   We should actually, as a society, be joyful, both those on the left  and those on the right. We should be joyful because, if I had come into  this room 3 years ago and said we are living in a time where we have  more jobs than people, we are going to live in a time where it actually  turns out to be our brothers and sisters who are functionally defined  as the working poor have the fastest growing wages, double what the  mean is--this has been our goal around here for years, and it is not a  Democratic goal or a Republican goal. It just should be a goal of  lifting people up, and it is happening. So let's take some joy in that.  And it turns out it is also helping the receipts here to the Federal  Government.   There are other things that we should be joyful about.   When you actually look at this enhanced period of economic stability,  what happens when what we call the real net worth--the value of your  homes, the value of your savings, the value of your investments, the  value of things you hold--well, it turns out the bottom 50 percent,  their real net worth has gone up fairly substantially, over 15 percent  in these last 3 years. That is a big deal.   But then I will get folks who will just make up stuff. Well, the rich  are the ones. Well, it turns out that is not true.                                time  1330    The top 1 percent aren't having most of that growth in their personal  wealth. It is the bottom 50 percent is where most of the growth is.   Can we take some joy in that? This is one of the most unique economic  cycles because it has been so stable for so long. You also have the GDP  numbers that came out today basically saying:  [[Page H743]]  Hey, looks like we are just going to be in a steady, healthy  environment.   We really need this because you get really positive math when you hit  this type of economic stability.   All right, last one on this. When you look at what we call real wage  growth, who are seeing their incomes go up? I know this is thick, but  the politics--and I accept that we are in an election year, but we have  to stop--what do you call that? Oh, yeah--lying.   The fact of the matter is it isn't the top income earners who are  seeing the most actual movement in their wages.   Take a look at this red line. That is what is really going on right  now. The blue is what we thought was going to happen. You see that  inflection point.   I have been on the Joint Economic Committee for years now, and it was  only about 3 years ago we were having some of the smartest economists,  the experts, coming in and saying: Well, you have to understand, Joint  Economic Committee, those who don't have a high school education, those  who have moderate skill sets, you need to prepare, because they will be  part of the permanently poor, the permanent underclass of your country  forever.   Then, all of a sudden, something has happened the last couple of  years where their labor now has some of the most value in this economy.  Look at the wage growth for our brothers and sisters who didn't  graduate high school, who have moderate skill sets. That is where the  substantial, almost double the growth of the mean is.   We should be joyful about this because all of those fancy economists  who were in front of us just a couple of years ago said that it  couldn't happen, that we should be planning for this to be a population  that will have to live in a subsidized world for the rest of their  lives. It turns out they were wrong.   We have sort of a family saying: Figure out what you do right and do  more of it; figure out what you have done wrong and do less of it.   Maybe we should stop inviting those particular economists to come to  testify in front of us.   Where is the trillion-dollar deficit coming from? Well, it is a  combination of a bunch of things. This is one of the things that will  frustrate you, particularly about Congress. We seem incapable of  dealing with complexity because the solution to this is also really  complex. We will sort of close on that.   This chart, it is almost impossible to read this chart, so I stole  some notes from myself.   The point I am trying to make here is this is 2017, before tax  reform, and where we are at today. The top one is net interest. It  looks like our projection of what we are going to spend in interest  costs has gone down and gone down fairly substantially.   The argument here is one of the things that happened in tax reform  that we didn't expect is that savings rates are much better than we  expected and what they call repatriation, cash that has been coming in  from overseas--remember, we had that cycle for almost 20 years where  businesses would move their headquarters out of the country and then  keep their profits there because if they brought them in, they were  substantially taxed in the United States. We made a deal with sort of  the world and those businesses saying: Here will be the new tax rates.  Bring your money in.   That money, I think, in our reports we had last summer, we were  seeing about $400 billion more than we had modeled for. I have not seen  a more recent number, but there is an argument that we are afloat with  cash in North America, in the United States, and that drives interest  rates down.   Is that a first- or second-degree effect? Let's not geek out too much  on that.   But take a look here. Let's use, like, 72 percent of the budget, of  our spending here. It is what we call mandatory. It is on autopilot.   The other portion is what we call discretionary. About half of that  is defense, and about half of that is everything else you think of as  government, from the Park Service to the FDA to this and that. That is  the other, let's call it 14, 15 percent of government. That is what we  vote on, the discretionary side.   Take a look at this. Where you see that little orange bar, you see  that big piece of growth. Those are things we have voted on in just the  last 2 years, and it is up substantially.   We have some other charts I am going to show you that if you look at  the growth in deficit--not debt, the deficits from this year, even the  next couple of years--a big driver of it is our own votes. It is the  discretionary side.   This here is the growth in mandatory, and there is something  wonderful about this. Do you notice that it is getting smaller? I know  these look like tiny, little increments, but when you are talking about  a trillion dollars, that is a lot of money.   It turns out, because of the economic expansion, we are seeing a  reduction in some of the demands for entitlements.   We always have to be careful when we talk about this because this is  sort of the--what is the term?--third rail for a lot of us who are  elected officials to explain this.   There are earned entitlements. You earned your Social Security; you  earned your Medicare; you earned your military pension. Those are  earned entitlements. You paid for those. You earned them with your  service and your contributions.   There are other types of entitlements that are part of this mandatory  formula. It is a treaty obligation. You are part of a certain Native  American population, other things. They are obligations we took on. Or  you fell under a certain income. You know, you are having really rough  times in your life, so there is certain income support or access to  certain healthcare or housing allowances and those things.    We haven't done all the analysis yet, but we think that is where part  of this drop all of a sudden in mandatory spending has come from. As  the economy is growing and we are seeing our brothers and sisters who  were--the term is often marginally detached or detached from the  workforce--are coming back in, all of a sudden, they are leaving  certain programs. So that is another benefit we are seeing  mathematically and budgetarily in the growth of the economy.   Is that a first-degree effect or second-degree effect from tax  reform? Okay, fine.   Other spending, these are other types of programs that may have their  own individual trust funds or those things, and you will take a look  and notice that their spending is up just a little bit.   Here is where, when we talk about the tax reform, we see lower  corporate taxes; we see substantially higher payroll taxes because  people are working; and we see lower individual taxes.   When you have someone walk up behind one of these microphones and  say, ``Well, it was the tax reform. That is why we are''--no, it is  not. Tax reform is part of it. I mean, we always modeled that tax  reform was going to cost about $1.4 trillion over 10 years.   If we could get the economic expansion and employment statistics,  that number would come down. You all saw now--because I know everyone  immediately grabbed their CBO update report--that from August to the  report this week, there is a $705 billion reduction in the deficit  projection over the 10 years.   A lot of that, I think, are these first- and second-degree effects.  Some of that was interest rates are lower, like you see up here in this  top line, because people are saving more, and payroll taxes, which you  see down over here, because more people are working.   I don't want to sound whiny up here and frustrated, but these numbers  are complex. I will go through this three or four times with a  highlighter to get my head around the numbers, and then I will turn to  the freaky smart staff of the Joint Economic Committee and others to  make sure we are understanding it correctly.   But I beg of my brothers and sisters who are elected or policymakers,  stop spouting off in political terms, because if we can start to get an  honest understanding of the math, maybe we can come up with some honest  approaches on how to deal with the crushing level of debt that is  coming at us.   Let's start walking through what is driving the deficits and the  debt. One of the comments I heard the other day from an economist on I  think it was CNBC--now, it was ideological. It was a politically  liberal economist from a university: Well, if we could have some  substantial cuts in defense, we would see all these changes in these  deficits.  [[Page H744]]    That is lunacy. Look, the model on defense is pretty flat and stable.   Here is a number I am going to give you two or three times, and I beg  of you, I know a number of people don't want to hear this, but it is  math: Just the growth of Social Security, Medicare, and healthcare  entitlements over the next 5 years equals the entire Defense  Department.   Is that Republican or Democrat? It is neither. It is demographics.   There are--what?--74 million of us who are baby boomers. We are about  halfway moving into our retirement cycle, turning 65, qualifying for  certain benefits. It is like Congress only just recently discovered  there were baby boomers. But when you hear someone start to say  something like, ``Well, if we would just cut defense, all of a sudden  the numbers are better,'' it is lunacy.   You could get rid of all of defense tomorrow, and it only gives you 5  years of the growth in Social Security, Medicare, healthcare  entitlements. Why is it so hard to tell the truth?   Here is another one. This is sort of building a chart right out of  CBO, Congressional Budget Office. CBO projects budget deficit rise is  entirely--this is CBO--driven by soaring Social Security and Medicare  shortfalls.   I know it is the third rail. I know we are not supposed to talk about  it. But if you believe like I do, I believe it is a moral obligation to  protect Social Security and Medicare. How can you step up to that  ethical obligation and then not tell the truth about the math? You  know, you can't fix a problem unless you are willing to accept it.   Look, the chart is the chart is the chart. This is from the  nonpartisan arbiters of what is going on. It is demographics. And the  sizes of these numbers are just devastatingly large.   Let's take a look at another one. There is a bunch of the tax reform  that expires in the next couple of years, and we go back to other sort  of tax rates and those things, but this one, we just pretend everything  is permanent, that those revenue gains that are coming in a couple of  years don't happen, assuming they would create multipliers in the  economy, which they won't. They probably won't pay for themselves, but  that is a completely different chart and models. This also misses a  bunch of the expanded spending that happened late last year when we  lifted some of the budgetary restriction caps.   But once again, 90 percent of the budgetary shortfall is Social  Security, Medicare, healthcare entitlements, but mostly Medicare, yet  this body is terrified to talk about that. It is the math.   One more on this, just to sort of get our head around it because I am  frustrated, because for those of us who do believe there is a policy  set, and I have been behind this microphone--and the poor folks who  have to try to keep up with me. Tell me if I am starting to speak too  quickly. I have had a lot of coffee today.   There is a way to get there. Now, when I say ``get there,'' that  means to sort of stay about 95 percent of debt to GDP and hold it as we  wait for those of us who are baby boomers to meet our reward and go  back to more normal population demographic numbers. This is hard, but  it is the reality. Then we put this together.   And, I am sorry, we don't typically try to do something that is this  blatant, but it is. This is one of the things that comes into our  office, saying: ``Well, if you would tax rich people more, you would be  fine.'' It is lunacy. It only covers about 4.7 percent of--8.3 percent  of GDP. It doesn't even cover close to half of the total shortfall when  you put everything together.                                time  1345    The entire defense budget, if you get rid of that, we have already  talked about that, it only covers 5 years of the growth in spending.   We actually have an entire chart list if anyone ever wants it. You  are welcome to call our office where we actually have been laying out  all of these proposals.   If we tax this bunch more, or Republicans, if we do this in waste and  fraud, or this and that, and you start to see, we are talking about  slivers that functionally have almost no impact. Because if you do them  solo and not tie it in with lots of other economic growth dynamics, you  don't get anywhere.   The last column is just things that are being proposed in the  Presidential race. So we are talking about trillion-dollar deficits,  and then you look at that last bar on this chart and those trillion- dollar deficits don't even have these things in it. That is about  another 25.6 percent of GDP going to debt.   You can't get there. The fact of the matter is, the economy blows up  a long time before that.   So, can we move back a little bit from the lunacy and actually sort  of say: Okay, how do you get there? Schweikert, you keep coming to the  microphone. You keep begging your Democrat colleagues and Republican  colleagues to open up their minds and think more creatively--think with  a calculator--actually, in some way optimistically. We joke in my  office that I am 57 with a 4-year old. I am optimistic.   But first off, you have to grow. We have to grow like crazy. You do  tax policy that maximizes economic growth. And we saw that in some of  the earlier boards here when you see what is happening in the labor  force participation and payroll taxes.   You will have to fix the immigration system. The economic modelers  keep coming to us saying: A talent-based immigration system will give  you much more economic lift.   We are going to have to also come up with policies that encourage  family formation. Birth rates are collapsing in our country. And it  turns out that that has a really devastating effect over the coming  decades in what happens in economic growth and we just need to be  honest about that. But there are other things. So that is population  stability.   There are other things you can do in economic growth. I am not happy  with the term ``deregulating.'' I argue that you need to move to a type  of smart regulation. We all walk around with these super computers in  our pocket, and we don't stop for a second to think what would happen  if we actually started to use technology as part of our regulations.   There are arguments, like in financial markets, the ability to use  technology to find bad actors, instead of the lunacy of the model used  today, which is almost like a 1938 model where people fill out pieces  of paper. They may email them in, but they are still filling out pieces  of paper instead of using technology to watch the markets.   It turns out you could crowdsource data for water, for air, and so  many of these things, and have instantaneous information if there is a  bad actor in your environment. And it turns out it is dramatically less  expensive because you don't have to be crushing each little business  with regulations. If one of them screws up, you catch them immediately  because you are using technology.   There are lots of ideas like this. They are not Republican. They are  not Democrat. They are technology. But, yet, you have to be willing to  take on the bureaucracy. And as a lot of us are learning around here,  it is the bureaucracy now that basically runs Washington, D.C.   Technology disruptions. We need to have an honest discussion. You saw  in the charts; Medicare is the primary driver of our debt. You have to  be honest with it. How do you have a disruption in healthcare prices?  And there are lots and lots of ideas that you are going to have to put  together.   We had a meeting in our office earlier today. We were walking through  the math on pharmaceuticals. Did you know the misuse or lack of use-- which is misuse--of pharmaceuticals is over half a trillion dollars a  year? Sixteen percent of all healthcare spending is because of the fact  that people didn't take, or took too much, or screwed up taking their  hypertension medicine, or other things.   But there is a simple technology solution. It turns out it is not in  the pharmaceutical pricing. It is actually in the cap of the  pharmaceutical bottle that says: ``Hey, Bob, we calculate you did not  take your hypertension medicine,'' and you ping the phone. You can do  that for a couple of dollars. Or the thing that distributes pills to  grandma who has to take two in the morning and one in the afternoon-- this and that--and when she screws up, she ends up in the hospital. It  is efficacy of when you take your pharmaceuticals.   What would happen if I could walk up and say, just changing this  technology  [[Page H745]]  platform is 16 percent of all U.S. healthcare spending? We have to be  willing to think creatively and disruptively.   There is the thing you can blow into. It looks like a large kazoo and  instantly tells you you have the flu; instantly can bang off your  medical records; and instantly order your antivirals.   Would that make us healthier, more productive, less time getting  sick? Of course, it would. Is that Republican or Democrat? It is just  technology, except it is illegal. That type of technology today, the  way our laws are set up, is illegal.   How do we actually drag in the willingness to engage in those  disruptions? It is one of my running arguments. Should we have  protected Blockbuster Video from Netflix? We love it when it comes into  our home and makes our lives easier. But what happens when it makes  many of our constituencies that are filling up the halls here lobbying  us really nervous?   There are technology disruptions out there that could crash the price  of healthcare and raise productivity and raise GDP. We know what they  are. But the arrogance of this place often thinks we know what the  future is, and we keep getting it wrong. So we need to legalize  technology.    Employment. We still have a problem with millennial men. We have lots  and lots of people who have gotten older who want to stay in the  workforce. What do you do in programs to incentivize as many people as  possible to be in the labor force?   It turns out to be simple ideas that I can't believe we can't come to  an agreement on and we have been working on it for years; things like  Social Security disability. Should someone say: ``Oh, I got a job,''  boom, they hit the cliff and their benefits, and that sort of safety  net goes away.   How do you actually smooth the off-ramp on these programs so it  incentivizes people getting attached into the labor force? Because  labor force attachment is one of the most powerful things you can ever  do for someone's future and for the economy. That is true for lots of  programs, even the earned entitlement.   Should we give you a spiff on Social Security and Medicare if you  will stay in the labor force? Because as it turns out, you lower our  costs. You lower society's costs.   So we really, really need to think about that. And that ties into the  earned and unearned benefits of how do you build incentives in there to  be part of the labor force to actually use the technologies that make  your healthcare much less expensive but keep you healthier. How do we  do those things? We know the policy, but this place seems to think  about them in silos of: ``Well, I have this piece of legislation that  does this,'' instead of understanding it will be dozens of pieces of  legislation that are complex. They are politically difficult and have  to be put together.   And the reason those are so important--I have been working on this  model now for years saying, if we do everything here and do it right,  the future is actually really bright. If we don't do it, we are  crushing my little girl. We are crushing our country to just a time of  anemic growth and crushing debt. At some point, Members of Congress and  the armies of lobbyists in these hallways will have to step up and  admit that we squandered the opportunity when we were in this time of  just almost a miracle Goldilocks economy where things are stable.   If we are going to do this, this is the time to step up and make it  work. But, yet, this has been a couple of years that I have come behind  this microphone, and I will get one or two offices that will reach out  and want some of the slides and some of the backup information.   I will have--probably next week--certain associations, lobbyists come  marching into my office and saying: ``David, you can't talk about  technology that way. Don't you understand, you are going to screw up  our business model?''   We have got to get honest. We know the math. We know how devastating  it gets. And just to make a point, before tax reform, CBO was still  predicting in these next couple of years we are going to have trillion- dollar deficits. We have known this is coming. The game here is to find  someone or something to blame.   How about actually starting to expect us to start offering solutions?  That is why I am behind this microphone. There is a path. It will be  hard. It will be complex, but there is a path where it works.   Let's try it.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 1 o'clock and 55 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until Monday,  February 3, 2020, at 1:30 p.m.                            ____________________
