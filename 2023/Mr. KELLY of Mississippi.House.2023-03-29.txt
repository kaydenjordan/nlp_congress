 The Mississippi delegation mourns those who  lost their lives in the recent tornadoes that devastated our beloved  State of Mississippi.   We also come together to honor the bravery and heroism of our first  responders and county and city leadership, who worked tirelessly to  save lives and restore order in the midst of chaos.   In Rolling Fork, Silver City, Winona, Amory, Wren, Egypt, Smithville,  and all the other communities affected from the Mississippi River Delta  to the north Mississippi hills, we know that the pain of loss and  destruction is still fresh in your hearts.   We offer our deepest condolences to the families and friends of those  who lost their loved ones. We cannot imagine the depth of your grief,  but we stand with you in solidarity.   As we mourn the loss of life, we must also acknowledge the strength  and resilience of our communities.   In times of disaster, we come together to support one another and  rebuild. We have seen this time and time again, and we know that  Mississippi will come back stronger.   In the face of such devastation, we find comfort in the words of the  Bible. In Psalms 34:18, it says: ``The Lord is close to the  brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.''   We know that in times of trial, we can turn to God for strength and  comfort. May God bless Mississippi, and may God bless the United States  of America.    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from  Mississippi (Mr. Thompson).    Mr. Chair, on behalf of the Mississippi  delegation, I ask for a moment of silence.                   Amendment No. 16 Offered by Mrs. Boebert
