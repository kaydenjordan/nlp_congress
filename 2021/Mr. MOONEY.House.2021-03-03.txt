 Madam Speaker, let's not attempt to steal knowledge of  our Nation's history from our children, like the Grinch attempted to  steal Christmas.   I rise to honor the legendary Dr. Seuss for Read Across America Day.  Yesterday would also have been his 117th birthday.   Before he became a world-famous writer, Seuss attended Dartmouth  College, my alma mater. He was also a member of the New Hampshire Alpha  Chapter of the fraternity Sigma Phi Epsilon, of which I was also a  member. We used to love showing Theodore Geisel's class photo on the  wall to visitors.   But in the spirit of cancel culture, publishers have discontinued six  of his books. Dr. Seuss was known as a progressive for his time. His  famous story ``The Lorax'' was about protecting the environment.   My favorite, ``Marvin K. Mooney Will You Please Go Now!'' my 6-year- old daughter thinks was written just for her. Children grow up dreaming  about ``Oh, the Places You'll Go!'' a Dr. Seuss book with the lessons  we find throughout our life's journey.   Madam Speaker, we should all respect and honor Dr. Seuss and forget  this cancel culture nonsense.                            ____________________
