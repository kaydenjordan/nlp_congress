 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   I rise in support of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care  Enhancement Act, which builds upon the achievements of the ACA,  including its coverage of an additional 20 million people.   I am glad to see that the bill includes the tenets of H.R. 3,  allowing the HHS to negotiate prescription drug prices rather than  continuing to pay the outrageous prices set by companies that  [[Page H2636]]  have long blocked competitors from the market.   With the limited time I have to speak, though, I would like to  highlight my appreciation that it includes my bill, the Family Health  Care Affordability Act, which fixes the family glitch in the ACA.   Under the Affordable Care Act, workers are to have access to  affordable healthcare plans, defined as healthcare plans that cost no  more than 9.56 percent of the employee's monthly household income. But  the interpretation of ``affordable'' only looks at whether coverage is  affordable to cover the employee, not whether it is affordable to cover  spouses and dependents.   When factoring in the family unit, coverage can easily surpass 25  percent of household income and still be deemed affordable and block  the family from marketplace subsidies. This bill fixes that and makes  sure that hardworking families have access to coverage without risk of  financial ruin.   I call on my colleagues to pass this important bill.
