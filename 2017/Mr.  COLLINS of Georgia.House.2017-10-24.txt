 For example, the Department of Justice  negotiated settlement agreements to the tune of millions of  dollars with major banks for misleading investors over mortgage- backed securities.      The online version has been corrected to read: For example, the  Department of Justice negotiated settlement agreements to the tune  of millions of dollars with major banks for misleading investors  over mortgage-backed securities.    ========================= END NOTE =========================     Then the Department of Justice said that banks or other parties that  it settled with could meet some of their settlement obligations by  making, again, donations to certain groups. The money went to these  groups partially under the guise that those groups would provide  services to the aggrieved parties.   In reality, this practice directs funds away from the victims and  allows the Department of Justice to steer money to nonvictim third- party groups, usually politically motivated organizations.   Additionally, the parties that receive the funds, these nonvictim  third-party organizations, aren't a part of the case at all. This means  that they don't represent the victims and aren't subject to  congressional oversight for the funds they receive. Even if most of  these groups weren't activist groups, which many were, this scenario  should concern everyone, Mr. Speaker. In fact, many of these groups are  political or ideological in nature.   Under the previous administration, in the mortgage settlement cases,  groups like the National Council of La Raza received more than $1  million in Department of Housing and Urban Development grants under  these settlements.   I don't know about you, but I think when the DOJ requires a  settlement, the funds should go to the victims involved in the case,  including victims back home in northeast Georgia. If the victims cannot  be found or if the problem cannot be directly rectified, then the  settlement funds should go to the Treasury so that Congress, elected by  individual Americans, can appropriately decide how to use them.   I don't think it is acceptable to shortchange victims to benefit  special interest and politically friendly third-party organizations.   It is time to reassert congressional authority over this process so  that hardworking folks are protected from more executive overreach and  so that we can restore the separation of powers outlined in the  Constitution.   I am here fighting to make sure that the Federal Government puts the  hardworking Georgians whom I represent and the rest of the citizens of  the United States--not special interests--first.   These bills help ensure that the American citizens have their voices  heard, that they regain input into the system, and that the Federal  Government is more transparent, accountable, and responsive to their  needs.   I would encourage others who share that goal to support this rule and  the underlying bills.   Again, as you look ahead for this, the thing that hopefully came out  in this is that this is an Article I issue. This is simply about, over  time, that has given a way from us in this body that we have done, that  it is now time to reassess that, especially in light of the needs of  the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
