 Mr. President, it has been 34 days since the President  fulfilled his promise to shut down the government, and the American  people are not happy about it.   Poll after poll shows that people are not OK with the way the  President of the United States is handling his job, and it is getting  worse by the day, because to any reasonable person, this shutdown has  been stupid and useless and cruel.   There are so many failures to talk about, but I want to talk about  four specific failures that, if it were any other President, if it were  any other time in modern history, would bring a President and a  Congress to its senses and end the shutdown.   The first failure is this. Federal workers are in food lines. Federal  workers are in food lines. People with jobs are now in food lines.  Hundreds of thousands of people who work for the government are either  furloughed or working without pay, and, tomorrow, these American public  servants will miss their second paycheck.   There is a big difference between missing the first paycheck and the  second paycheck. Some people can absorb missing the first paycheck, but  this second paycheck is going to be really, really challenging for tens  of thousands of American public servants because the rent is due, the  mortgage is due, the car registration is due, the insurance is due, and  the utilities are due at the beginning of the month.   This brings the amount of money that American public servants are  owed by their government for work already performed to $4.7 billion.  Remember that about a third of all Federal workers are veterans.   It may be hard for billionaires in the Cabinet to understand, but for  the middle class, missing two paychecks in a row is a total disaster.   I have met people working in airport security who can't concentrate.  They can't sleep because they can't stop worrying about how they are  going to pay their bills. I have met government workers in the midst of  applying for food stamps and asking local charities for help. I met a  single mom who spent her career working hard to build a life for her  family, and she told me that without these paychecks, it is all going  backward.   As one Washington Post columnist put it, under the Republican  leadership, the United States is starting to look like the failed  Soviet system, with middle-class workers literally waiting in bread  lines.   I am grateful that for every story I have heard of someone suffering,  there is also a story of people stepping up to help. In Hawaii, in  particular, local utility companies, financial institutions, and others  have decided that they will not penalize Federal workers hurt by the  shutdown if they miss a payment. I want to thank our local banks for  allowing unpaid Federal workers to make a late payment on their  mortgage without a penalty, and I want to thank our credit unions for  extending very cheap credit. I want to thank people who are organizing  in local communities, not just in Hawaii but across the country, so  that middle-class families can make it through this.   Federal workers want paychecks, not food banks. They want paychecks.  They don't want charity. They want to be compensated for the work that  they do. They shouldn't rely on pop-up kitchens for furloughed workers  or online fundraising campaigns or the kindness of families, friends,  and strangers--as great as all of that is. They should just get paid,  and that starts with opening the government.   Here is the second failure that should end this shutdown right away,  and that is that economic growth is already slowing. This week, a White  House adviser said that the Nation's economic growth could be zero if  the shutdown goes on. Economists and business leaders were already  worried about the potential for a recession, and this shutdown is  fanning those unfortunate flames.   Small businesses can't get loans. Companies can't go public. This  administration has stopped some of the core functions of our market  economy, but there is one thing that will not stop, and that is the  corruption in this administration.   If you have money, this administration takes care of you, and if you  don't, then they will not. Federal workers have been called back to the  office to take care of oil and gas leases--to take care of oil and gas  leases--and to help financial institutions. They are working unpaid so  that special interests can keep making money.   This is the third failure. While people who are fortunate financially  are protected, this shutdown leaves the people most vulnerable to fend  for themselves.   Food pantries and health clinics that rely on Federal funds are out  of supplies, which means that Americans are going to start to go hungry  and without medicine for everything from diabetes to addiction.   Landlords who provide housing for 4 million people--mostly seniors  and people with disabilities and kids--will soon stop receiving rent  payments. They will have to decide how long they can hold out before  being forced to evict these people or lose the properties themselves.   Housing authorities are delaying the release of section 8 vouchers.   Domestic violence shelters that rely on Federal funds are furloughing  their own workers and cutting back services that save lives. So men,  women, and children who need to get out of a dangerous situation at  home have fewer options to get to safety.   That brings me to the fourth failure, which is that public safety is  gravely at risk. This is a serious matter. This isn't about whether  Donald Trump can save face or whether the Republicans can vanquish the  Democrats or Nancy Pelosi makes Mitch McConnell look  [[Page S576]]  bad. It is none of that. Public safety is at risk.   Air traffic controllers and TSA workers are working without pay. They  are stressed out, and they are becoming increasingly understaffed and  undersupported, and there is no ability to train new employees, and  they are sounding the alarm.   This isn't my rhetoric. I want you to listen to what the National Air  Traffic Controllers Association said yesterday:         We cannot even calculate the level of risk currently at       play, nor predict the point at which the entire system will       break. It is unprecedented.    The National Transportation Safety Board is being forced to choose  which crashes to investigate and which not to, leaving us with  unanswered questions and risking lives in the future. As of this week,  the NTSB has been unable to investigate 87 crashes, including some with  fatalities.   This is a pattern. It is a pattern of recklessly endangering the  safety of Americans. We are just 2 months out from a wildfire that  destroyed 18,000 homes and buildings and killed 86 people. Yet the  shutdown has stopped us from training firefighters. It has cancelled  controlled burns. It has led to dead trees piling up in places that we  know pose a fire risk. This is what happens when you shut down the  government to try to get your way. You put real people at risk.   The safety of Americans abroad and at home is threatened by this  shutdown. The State Department cancelled a border security summit. This  fight is supposed to be about border security. Yet we are not paying  TSA, we are not paying FBI agents, we are about to close some of our  Federal courts, and the State Department itself just cancelled a border  security summit. FBI agents are working without pay. Field offices are  operating in fiscal uncertainty. That means investigations into street  gangs and drug dealers are on hold, training on child abductions and  counterterrorism has been cancelled, and communications with sources  about gangs, such as MS-13, have stopped. As one agent put it, ``Our  enemies know they can run freely.'' Our enemies know they can run  freely.   I ask all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, why would we  put public safety at risk? Why can't we reopen the government and  negotiate our differences?   The truth is, as it relates to border security--I am in my seventh  year in the Senate, and every year, we do a bipartisan bill that  includes border security in the Homeland Security Appropriations  Subcommittee. We always do this.   By the way, every Republican and every Democrat will quietly say: We  are not doing a cement wall from sea to shining sea. That makes no  sense, and nobody at the Department of Homeland Security thinks that is  a good idea.   So we quietly appropriate money--some for personnel, some for beds,  some for courts so they can adjudicate some of these cases, and some  for physical barriers where it is appropriate, to put up a wall where  it makes sense. You don't put up a wall where it doesn't make sense. We  do this all the time. So the idea that we are going to shut down the  government and shut down portions of the Department of Homeland  Security itself in order to get to a place where the President of the  United States can save face is just absurd.   We have to be the grownups here, and that is going to require some  Republicans to craft a border security package with Democrats, as we  have over the last 6 or 7 years, and we have to do that after we open  the government. The reason that is so essential is that this  President--certainly this President especially, but no President,  Democratic or Republican, now or 30 years from now, should ever inflict  pain on the American people in order to generate leverage in a policy  discussion. When somebody does that--and if it is one of my friends in  the Senate and they do this 10 years from now, I want them to read this  speech back to me. The answer to the offer, which is, ``I am going to  hurt Americans unless you do X,'' should be ``You get nothing in  exchange for not hurting Americans.'' That is not a cookie for us.   Barack Obama learned that lesson the hard way. Only when he finally  said ``You guys want to screw with the American economy; you want to  mess with the debt ceiling; you get nothing'' did they back off, and  all that brinksmanship stopped.   Every time we reward hostage taking, we will get more hostage taking.  As painful as all of this is, we have to stand firm. We are absolutely  willing to negotiate a package related to border security, which will  no doubt include some physical barrier, because we do that every year,  actually, but I am not doing any of that until the government is  opened. That is not just a political position; that is a matter of  principle because we can't live like this as a country. We cannot  function like this. If we do this, if we cut a deal now and we give $2  billion for the wall, the debt ceiling is coming up in March or April,  and here we go again. The fiscal year expires in September, and here we  go again. We will never govern. I know the Presiding Officer was a  Governor. That is no way to run a country. Let this be the last  shutdown.   I know the two leaders of the Senate are in what appear to be  constructive conversations. I know there are plenty of adults who want  to get us out of this. For the first time in several weeks, I have  actually felt somewhat hopeful about the trajectory. I don't think we  are going to fix this in the next hour or so, but at least we are  talking, and at least there seems to be a desire to structure an off- ramp. But we have to do one simple thing first: We have to reopen the  government. People are about to miss their paychecks for the second  time tomorrow. It is our obligation to reopen the government.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
