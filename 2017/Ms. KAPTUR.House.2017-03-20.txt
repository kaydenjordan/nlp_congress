 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to defend public broadcasting  and honor the late Fred Rogers, whose birthday is today, March 20.  Known fondly by millions simply as Mr. Rogers, his wonderful, beloved  presence has reached millions of homes across our Nation captivating  generations of children, and even adults.   The Corporation for Public Broadcasting is a vital part of America,  including cities, but small towns as well. NPR and PBS stations will be  disproportionately impacted by President Trump's proposed budget  zeroing out public broadcasting. It is not right.   President Trump's travel bill to Mar-a-Lago and the growing security  that the American people are paying for over at his Trump Tower in New  York, which reports show to already be in the tens of millions of  dollars, will soon swamp the $200 million America dedicates to public  broadcasting annually.   We have been here before. In 1969, President Richard Nixon threatened  to slash funding for PBS. Mr. Rogers went before the Senate to defend  public broadcasting and its value to our children, especially for  learning. I know I am not alone in wishing Mr. Rogers were with us once  again to make the case for America's children and public broadcasting.   I hope President Trump and my colleagues will join me in supporting  programming that boosts kids' confidence and helps children enjoy  learning and the wonder of math, science, and books.                            ____________________
