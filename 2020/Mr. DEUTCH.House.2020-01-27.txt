 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend, Congressman Norcross,  for yielding. I am thankful for Congresswoman Maloney's leadership and  commitment to Holocaust education. I appreciate Chairman Scott's  leadership in helping to bring this bill to the floor.   I am thankful to all of my colleagues, Democratic and Republican  alike; the Education and Labor Committee; the U.S. Holocaust Memorial  Museum; and the Jewish community organizations, which all worked  together to promote Holocaust education.   Last week, I was honored to participate in a bipartisan delegation  led by Speaker Pelosi that visited Auschwitz-Birkenau. It was my first  time there, and I walked through the gates where more than 1 million  people perished.   The magnitude of the effort of the Nazis to try to eradicate the  Jewish people was shocking. I was shaken by the sight of the  crematorium, the gas chambers, and the piles of hair, glasses, personal  effects, and everything gathered in a way to dehumanize the Jews before  they were even slaughtered.   It has been 75 years since Auschwitz was liberated, and today, there  are few remaining survivors who can share their stories firsthand. Six  million Jews were killed in the Holocaust. We must carry on and honor  their memories as a stark and enduring warning to future generations,  but recent polls show that we are failing to live up to that solemn  responsibility. Less than half of Americans know how many Jews died in  the Holocaust. Among teenagers, it is barely one-third.   We must do better. Some States like my home State of Florida mandate  Holocaust education as part of the public school curriculum.  [[Page H546]]    I am proud to represent Holocaust survivors living in south Florida.  In my district, those survivors, their children, their grandchildren,  and all of us who work to elevate their stories work so hard to make  sure that this education is a part of every student's education.   But not every State has the resources, whether textbooks or survivors  and their powerful testimony. That is why this legislation is so  important. It will empower the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum  to promote Holocaust education around the country. It will do the vital  work of bringing Americans together to say ``never again.''   When we visited Yad Vashem, almost 50 countries in the world sent  their leaders to speak up to remember the Holocaust and to speak out  against anti-Semitism. President Macron pointed out that anti-Semitism  is a poison.    There are deadly attacks in America and anti-Semitic  violence that is almost regular in occurrence, but with all of this  poison of anti-Semitism, education is our antidote.   Today, on International Holocaust Remembrance Day, I am proud the  House of Representatives is working to give the words ``never again''  real meaning and real purpose by educating American students about the  horrors of the Holocaust and the responsibility that all of us have to  fight anti-Semitism and hatred.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I am so honored to be here on International Holocaust  Remembrance Day with colleagues, Democratic and Republican alike, who  understand the importance of giving real meaning to the words ``never  again.''   Standing at Auschwitz-Birkenau as we did with a bipartisan delegation  last week, what you can't help but be struck by is the effort, the  enormous effort that the Nazis went to, to try to destroy the Jewish  people, to wipe them from the face of the Earth. Yet, they failed.   The State of Israel is strong, the strong homeland of the Jewish  people. In a world that Adolf Hitler could never have imagined, that  the Nazis could never have imagined, Jewish Members of the House, like  myself, have the opportunity like the one now to remind America why  this is so important.   Like my colleague from Florida, Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz, I  represent a lot of survivors. Twice a year, our local Jewish family  service organization has a program called Cafe Europa. They bring  together the survivors from our community for lunch and the opportunity  to socialize, to enjoy music, and to be with one another.   They sit the survivors at tables based on the communities in Europe  that they came from, communities where the Nazis tried to eradicate all  the Jews. Here they are now, most in their nineties, coming together,  in this case in south Florida, with the opportunity to be with one  another.   What is so remarkable is that at virtually every one of these  meetings, there is a moment when a survivor from a community in Europe  is able to reunite with another survivor from that community that he or  she has not seen since before World War II. They have the chance to  share their stories not just with each other, but they get to share  their stories with all of us.   Some, like Norman Frajman, a dear friend of mine who lost 126 family  members in the Holocaust, was clear when he said, in speaking about  Cafe Europa: ``We are disappearing, but when I see faces here, it does  my heart good. There are still witnesses to this tragedy, and younger  generations must learn of these atrocities that occur when hatred  toward one another occurs. We must replace hate with love.''   Norman is right.                                time  2030    Sylvia Richter, also from south Florida, was at Cafe Europa and said  this in describing what happened to her, she said:         My sisters and I were chosen by Dr. Mengele. I was forced       to lie about my age and say I was 17 instead of 14. A female       Nazi officer wiped black soot off her arm and told me it was       my mother, father and siblings that she was wiping away and       if I didn't keep lying, this would be me too. As she wiped       away those ashes, she wiped away my smile. I never smiled       again until 1946.    There are people in America, there are people in the world who deny  the Holocaust. There are far too many people who don't know the details  of what happened during the Holocaust, and, sadly, these voices, these  survivors will not be with us for too many more years.   That is why this is so important today. That is why it is so  important for all of us to come together, to pledge  [[Page H563]]  ``Never again'' and to make it mean something.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the opportunity to be here today with  my colleagues from both sides of the aisle. There is nothing partisan  about standing up to hatred and bigotry and fighting anti-Semitism.  That is what we are showing here tonight.
