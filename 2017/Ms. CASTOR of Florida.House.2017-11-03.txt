 Mr. Speaker, for decades now in America we  have worked together to make sure that kids can see a doctor and get  the care that they need. Working with pediatricians, families, and  advocates back home, we have reached a historic point where almost all  kids across the country have health insurance coverage.   The Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, or known in Florida  as Florida KidCare, or Healthy Kids, has been an important piece of  this historic coverage level. CHIP simply is vital for families,  millions of hardworking families, so that their kids can get the  checkups, the immunizations, sometimes the critical care that they need  so they can be healthy and well.   Now, I chair the bipartisan Children's Healthcare Caucus. We educate  and advocate so that kids across America are healthy and well. So it is  especially disappointing this year that my Republican colleagues failed  to act before CHIP expired.   See, they were consumed all year long with ripping health coverage  away, decimating the Affordable Care Act, and radically changing health  services provided under Medicaid. In doing so, they let our kids down;  they let our families down. And then, at the 11th hour, after the  program expired, they come up with a very partisan bill rather than the  bipartisan bill that has been the historic backbone of Children's  Health Insurance.   Don't take it from me. A lot of the advocates across the country,  like pediatricians, obstetricians, gynecologists, March of Dimes, say:  Please don't fund CHIP based upon harmful cuts; don't have cuts  negatively impact the health of women, children, and families.  Pediatricians say: Don't jeopardize other important child health  policies in the process.    Let's go back to the drawing board as soon as possible, over the  weekend, next week; bring it back to the floor next week, so that  families and kids get the care that they need.   This bill today, unfortunately, is simply a delay.
