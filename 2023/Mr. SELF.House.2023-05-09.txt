 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the victims who lost their  lives during the Allen, Texas, shooting on Saturday: Christian LaCour;  Aishwarya Thatikonda; Elio Cumana-Rivas; Daniela and Sofia Mendoza; and  Kyu, Cindy, and James Cho.   I also commend first responders for their swift actions that  undoubtedly saved countless lives.   Finally, we acknowledge the friends and families whose hearts are  breaking this evening. The flag atop this building flies at Halfstaff  tonight as a symbol of a nation that grieves with you.   Not far from here, in Arlington National Cemetery, is a quote  inscribed on the memorial for Robert Kennedy: ``And even in our sleep,  pain that cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart, and in our  own despair, against our will, comes wisdom to us by the awful grace of  God.''   Let us pray that those impacted by this awful tragedy can receive  comfort through God's grace.   Mr. Speaker, I ask the House to observe a moment of silence.                            ____________________
