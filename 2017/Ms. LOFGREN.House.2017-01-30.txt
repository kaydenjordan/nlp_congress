 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up and  consider H.R. 724, the Statue of Liberty Values Act of 2017.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under guidelines consistently issued by  successive Speakers, as recorded in section 956 of the House Rules and  Manual, the Chair is constrained not to entertain the request unless it  has been cleared by the bipartisan floor and committee leaderships.                            ____________________
