 BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I was struck about  15 minutes ago when one of the speakers on the other side made the  claim that the Democratic agenda was rejected by the American people in  November. It was so rejected, Democrats won the House, the Senate, and  the White House for the first time in a dozen years. That is rejection  I can take.   The reality is, the American people put us in charge because the  previous administration's response to COVID was so weak and so  ineffective.   It is a sad fact that more than 400,000 Americans have died from  COVID. This is now one of the four most deadly events in American  history. We have 20 percent of the COVID deaths and 20 percent of the  COVID cases worldwide.   To deal with the enormity of the crisis, we need a big, bold plan,  such as the Biden 1.9 plan.   Mr. Speaker, economists are famous for not agreeing. Because  economists were so famous for saying, ``Well, on the one hand, or on  the other hand,'' Harry Truman, when asked, said the one thing he  wanted was a one-handed economist. So it is striking that economists  all across the ideological spectrum--liberal, centrist, conservative-- all favor going big in this moment. That is what this plan does.   I am also struck by the fact that there must be a Democrat in the  White House because the other side is suddenly talking about the  deficit and the debt again. When there is a Republican in the White  House, it is not a big concern.   Again, Mr. Speaker, economists agree: This is not a moment that we  should be concerned about the deficit and the debt. This is a moment  when, once and for all, we need to finally tackle this pandemic.
