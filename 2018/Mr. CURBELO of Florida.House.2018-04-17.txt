 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 2901) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of  1986 to make permanent Volunteer Income Tax Assistance matching grant  program, as amended.

Return preparation programs for low-income taxpayers.''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 2901, currently under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2901, the Volunteer  Income Tax Assistance Permanence Act, that I am grateful to see brought  before the House today.   The Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program is a matching grant  program administered by the IRS where the Federal Government partners  with the local community to provide free professional tax preparation  services to individuals with an annual income of less than $54,000 and  for those with a limited proficiency in English.   Today, April 17, is tax day, the deadline for filing returns. As  Americans all across the country work to complete their returns, we are  reminded of the dangers associated with tax return preparer fraud.  Filing your return can be confusing, and unscrupulous preparers seek to  take advantage of this confusion for their own profit.   They bring in business by promising larger refunds, refunds they are  able to obtain by claiming inflated expenses, false deductions, or  unreliable credits on their clients' returns. Some fraudulent preparers  even siphon off refunds to their own accounts. However, when the IRS  detects the false return, it is the taxpayer, and not the return  preparer, who is then liable for any additional taxes and/or penalties.   Unfortunately, it is low-income and underserved populations, such as  those with limited English, who are the primary targets of fraudulent  preparers. It is a threat that my district in south Florida is all too  familiar with.   Thankfully, the VITA program allows taxpayers to fill out and submit  their returns accurately without the fear of being scammed--all free of  charge. The VITA preparers are IRS certified, and at 94 percent, have  among the highest accuracy rates of all preparers.   This program has enjoyed strong support in the past, regardless of  administration or the party in the majority. H.R. 2901 would  permanently authorize the VITA grant program while ensuring that VITA  preparers continue to maintain their high-accuracy rates.   I want to thank Representative  Danny Davis for partnering with me on  this legislation. I am appreciative of the work and leadership Chairman  Brady and Subcommittee Chairwoman Lynn Jenkins, as well as the staff of  the Oversight Subcommittee and the other House Committees on Ways and  Means staff for their efforts on this important legislation.   Madam Speaker, this will help some of the most vulnerable people in  our country, people who want to comply with the Tax Code. It will make  sure that individuals who are eligible for certain benefits under the  Tax Code are able to obtain them.   In short, this will improve quality of life for lower- and middle- income people in our country, especially in my south Florida district.   I encourage all of my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 2901, the  Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Permanence Act, and support the VITA  program, which helps our constituents file their taxes confidently and  accurately.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, having no other speakers, I am  prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I want to first thank my colleague, the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis), for his hard work on this bill. Dr.  Davis is someone who has committed his career to Americans who are  struggling the most, and he is willing to work with anyone in this  Congress who wants to help our communities get ahead, especially those  who are struggling and who most need our help. It has been a true honor  to collaborate with him on this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I want to remind my colleagues once again what the  VITA program is all about.   Every tax filing season, unscrupulous preparers try to take advantage  of underserved populations by filing fraudulent returns on their  behalf.                                time  1615    The taxpayer and not the preparer is then liable for the fraudulent  return. This happens way too often, Madam Speaker, in south Florida and  throughout the country.   The VITA program goes a long way to mitigate the threat preparer  fraud poses to vulnerable communities by providing free tax preparation  services administered by IRS-certified preparers.   Taxpayers who just want to comply with the Tax Code should not have  to fear additional taxes or penalties because of a fraudulently  repaired return. The VITA program gives these taxpayers a place to go  where they can rest assured their tax returns will be filed accurately  and at no cost.   I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this commonsense  program and vote to permanently reauthorize the VITA grant program.   I want to thank, Madam Speaker, so many volunteers at the United Way,  at branches in South Dade, who every tax season help hundreds and  hundreds of lower and middle-income Americans get through this  difficult process.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution  830, I call up the bill (H.R. 5192) to authorize the Commissioner of  Social Security to provide confirmation of fraud protection data to  certain permitted entities, and for other purposes, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 5192, currently  under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5192, the  Protecting Children from Identity Theft Act, and I am grateful that it  is being brought before the House today.   This bill aims to combat synthetic identity fraud by directing the  Social Security Administration to accept electronic signatures when  financial institutions want to verify their customers' information.   Synthetic identity fraud accounts for 80 percent of all credit card  fraud losses today. It has been reported that a record $355 million in  outstanding credit card balances was owed by people who it suspects  didn't exist in 2017, up more than eightfold from 2012.   The Government Accountability Office describes this type of fraud as  involving the creation of a fictitious identity using a combination of  real data, like a Social Security number or date of birth, from  multiple individuals, along with fabricated information.   H.R. 5192 is an important step in reducing fraud, while also ensuring  that the Social Security Administration is able to continue providing  important services and benefits.   The SSA Commissioner is not allowed to begin development of the new  verification system until the Commissioner determines that at least 50  percent of the program's startup costs have been covered by users.  After initial development, users of the verification system are  obligated to pay for the ongoing costs associated with this new  workload by way of advances, reimbursements, user fees, or other  recoveries, as determined by the Commissioner.   My south Florida district is far too familiar with fraudulent  activity affecting the community, and sadly, children and immigrants  are particularly vulnerable to these schemes. Over 1 million children  have their identity stolen annually, and they are 50 times more likely  than adults to be victims of identity theft.   I am proud to partner with Representatives Sinema, Hultgren, and  Marchant on this important effort. I would also like to thank Chairman  Brady and subcommittee Chairman Johnson for their leadership and hard  work, as well as the staff of the Social Security Subcommittee and the  rest of the House Committee on Ways and Means staff who have worked on  this legislation.   I encourage all my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 5192, the  Protecting Children from Identity Theft Act, to help modernize identity  protections for our children.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 3  minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sam Johnson), the  distinguished chairman of the Social Security Subcommittee.     Mr. Speaker, first, let me thank my  colleague, Ms. Sinema. It is a pleasure to work with her and to team  up, in a bipartisan manner, to fight fraud and to help the most  vulnerable, in this case, the children. I am very grateful to her, for  all her work on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Hultgren).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments of my colleague, Mr. Davis,  and I agree with him. This is certainly something to celebrate. The  American people oftentimes see us arguing. It is less often that they  see us collaborating, working together to advance policies that will  improve quality of life in our country.   That is why I want to again urge all of my colleagues to support H.R.  5192, the Protecting Children from Identity Theft Act. We need to do  everything we can to safeguard our communities from these fraud  schemes. This problem has worsened significantly over the past few  years and is leaving families with debt they did not accrue and a  weaker credit history.   H.R. 5192 will help root out synthetic identity fraud through  modernized verification of customer information, and I hope my  colleagues will join me in voting to help protect individuals across  the country from this illegal activity.   Once again, Mr. Speaker, my appreciation to Chairman Brady, to  Ranking Member Neal, to Mr. Davis, to Mr. Hultgren, to Ms. Sinema, and  to everyone who has been a part of making this happen, so that, after  we pass this legislation, children in our country won't have to worry  about having their identities stolen at such a young age.   This kind of fraud can really ruin people's lives, and today, we are  working together, as one united House, Republicans and Democrats, to  fight fraud and to protect children, some of the most vulnerable people  in our society.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 420,  nays 1, not voting 8, as follows:                               [Roll No. 142]                                 YEAS--420       Abraham      Adams      Aderholt      Aguilar      Allen      Amash      Amodei      Arrington      Babin      Bacon      Banks (IN)      Barletta      Barr      Barragan      Barton      Bass      Beatty      Bera      Bergman      Beyer      Biggs      Bilirakis      Bishop (GA)      Bishop (MI)      Bishop (UT)      Blackburn      Blum      Blumenauer      Blunt Rochester      Bonamici      Bost      Boyle, Brendan F.
