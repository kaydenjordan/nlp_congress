 Mr. Speaker, healthcare is important, and no  one knows that better than our country's nurses. As the first  registered nurse elected to Congress, I know how the Affordable Care  Act has improved our country's healthcare, especially for the 133  million Americans living with preexisting conditions, including 11.5  million who live in my home State of Texas, the most uninsured State in  the Nation.   Today, we are bringing a resolution to the floor which will empower  the House of Representatives, the people's House, to intervene in a  lawsuit that Republicans have brought solely to throw the American  healthcare system into chaos. I urge my colleagues to support the  Allred resolution and vote to protect the healthcare of millions of our  fellow Americans.                            ____________________
