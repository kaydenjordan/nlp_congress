 Mr. Speaker, Deb Detmers Fansler, Steve Tomaszewski, and  Rodney Davis were all with me politically and governmentally for 24  years. It is now my time to thank them.   All three have been great public servants. All three are political  addicts.   Deb is another Western Illinois grad with a political science degree.  A farm girl from Petersburg, she rapidly moved up in Illinois  Republican circles. After I got elected in 1996, I asked her to run my  district office.   In the Army, the commander is responsible for all their unit does or  fails to do. This was Deb's job: running the district office. I have  represented the 20th Congressional District, the 19th Congressional  District, and the 15th Congressional District. In total, I have  represented 52 of the State's 102 counties.   I have had district offices in Collinsville, Maryville, Springfield,  Danville, Effingham, Centralia, Olney, and Harrisburg. Deb was  responsible for all of them.   District offices permit drop-by access to constituents. For me, the  district staff also handles all the casework. They are the jumping-off  sites for congressional stops throughout the year. I will cover the  incredible success story of my caseworkers in the future. Someone has  to lead, encourage, and support the caseworkers, and Deb has done that.   Deb also has had the difficult task of organizing my schedule back in  the district. Getting from point A to point B on time is difficult.  Getting from A to B to C to D to E in the same day and on time is  nearly impossible, but we did it almost always. We shocked people with  our punctuality and sometimes even arriving early.   Deb was also my mother, confessor and counselor. No one knows the  playing field better than Deb, and she quickly and briefly and  succinctly got me up to speed. She knows everything from the courthouse  to the statehouse. She was given the tough individual cases to handle.  You really didn't want to tangle with her.   Steve worked on my 1996 campaign and was my press secretary and then  joined as my congressional press secretary.   Steve graduated from the University of Illinois, majoring in  journalism. His parents owned and operated the local Nashville,  Illinois, newspaper.   Steve was the perfect guy in the early days because, at that time in  rural America, local print was still king. Steve understood that. Steve  helped us adjust to the changing media dynamics. As local media started  to decline, the St. Louis media became more important.   With the advent of social media, the turnaround time had to be  instantaneous if you were going to respond at all. I believe much of my  early reelection success was the extra tender loving care that Steve  provided to the media outlets, both big and small. Steve then moved to  the economic development role once Rodney left.   As my districts became larger, traveling with me consumed a lot of  time. Deb's planning made this travel efficient but still long. I was  only comfortable traveling with Deb and Steve. I trusted them to get me  where I needed to go and keep me on time.   These long car rides allowed me to talk to them about everything.  They would hear me on phone calls, and I could debrief them on what was  on my mind. They could also use the time to see what was on my mind.  Being captured in the car, they had to listen to my ranting and raving.   My drive-through meal is a McDonald's number 1. They always had Diet  Cokes and chocolates strategically placed in the car for when we did  not have time for lunch, or I needed chocolate for my mental health.   One day, Rodney will finish his own story, so I will not end it here.  A Taylorville boy, Rodney was my Christian County coordinator in 1992.  We were both candidates in 1996. I won, and Rodney lost his race for  State representative.   He joined our team as our economic development coordinator. He rode  that  [[Page H3986]]  success into a successful run for Congress. I am extremely proud of  him.   Deb, Steve, and Rodney gave their blood, sweat, and tears to me for  24 years. Some say that they still do. I want to thank them here today.                            ____________________
