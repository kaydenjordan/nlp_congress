 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding me the customary 30  minutes.   Mr. Speaker, this rule represents many of the failures of the 115th  Congress. To put it succinctly, the legislation before us is a bill  which has absolutely no chance of passing into law and a bill that will  add billions--billions--of dollars to our national debt.   I guess this is a Merry Christmas to those who hold our national  debt, but this is not what our constituents sent us to do here. They  sent us here to work together and find compromise in order to make our  communities, their lives, better.   This rule makes in order the Senate amendment to H.R. 88, Shiloh  National Military Park Boundary Adjustment and Parker's Crossroads  Battlefield Designation Act.   But it is more accurate to say this is the GOP's second tax scam.  Instead of taking this opportunity to use our remaining time here to  actually accomplish something, our vote today on this rule will prove  to be meaningless. The Senate is leaving town and has left us just a  few items that we can accomplish, and this isn't one of them.   However, one item that is ready for passage is Savanna's Act.   Mr. Speaker, Native American women face a murder rate 10 times higher  than the national average, with 84 percent experiencing some form of  violence in their lifetime.   The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 and the Tribal  Law and Order Act have helped bring attention to the high rates of  violence against Native women. However, there is still no reliable way  of knowing how many Native women go missing each year because the  databases that hold statistics of these cases are extremely outdated  and in need of reform.   Congress hasn't paid attention to the lives of Native American women.  That is why I joined Senator Heitkamp in introducing Savanna's Act  earlier this year, named after Savanna Greywind, a pregnant, 22-year- old North Dakota woman and member of the Spirit Lake Nation, who was  murdered in 2017.   Savanna's Act would require the Department of Justice to finally keep  a nationwide database of missing and murdered Native women.   This is common sense. It passed the Senate unanimously last month.                                time  0930    One Member--one Member of this body--has decided to prevent us from  passing Savanna's Act, and the rest have capitulated, one Member  standing in the way of finally doing the right thing for Native women,  American women, women who are victims of crime. Shameful, and shame on  this body for allowing this and not taking this last week of the 115th  Congress to finally bring about some justice to these cases.   Now, one thing that this body, the 115th Congress, has been really  good for in the face of tragedy has been moments of silence, and that  is why, today, I want to take some time that we have left to have a  moment of silence. Mr. Speaker, I would like my colleagues to join me  in a moment of silence for Savanna.   Mr. Speaker, instead of taking action on Savanna's Act, we are asked  to vote on this rule to pass a tax bill which has been crafted in  secret and has no chance of becoming law, when we could be doing  something for justice, for truth, for victims of crime.   This is the 115th Congress. Good riddance.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, does the gentleman from Texas have any more  speakers?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, it is just about time to finish up here and return home  for the holidays, time to see our loved ones and give them a hug. But  for Savanna's family and the countless other Native American families  destroyed because of this violence, there will be no return home for  them, and we will have failed these families by not passing Savanna's  Act today.   Instead, we are here because of a wall--not the wall that you are  assuming, not talking about our southern wall. I am talking about the  wall of debt, a massive wall of debt that this Republican Congress has  built, trillions--trillions--of dollars of debt towering over our  children and grandchildren's future. This rule will build it even  higher. That is why I urge my colleagues to oppose the previous  question and the rule.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
