 Mr. Speaker, in just a few months, the United States is  on track to default on its debt for the first time in history. This is  because Speaker McCarthy has unveiled a bill that he claims will  fulfill our debt obligations, but in reality it will cut access to  critical social programs supporting education, food assistance,  healthcare, and housing. It would devastate our economy, and we all  know it is a dead-on-arrival bill. It will crash our global financial  markets.   According to Moody's, under McCarthy's legislation, 780,000 Americans  will lose their jobs, and our Nation's unemployment rate will surge. We  all know that this pain will be borne disproportionately by people of  color.   Republicans must put an end to this needless political theater and  raise the debt limit, as they did three times with no problem under the  twice-impeached and newly indicted former President Donald Trump, who  signed $4.7 trillion in new deficits into law. Not only that, but they  must do so without any cuts or reductions to housing funds given the  terrible state of affordability in America.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my Republican colleagues who care about our  economy--or who say they care about our economy--and the American Dream  to get serious and work with Democrats to avert a catastrophic default  by supporting a clean bill to raise the debt limit.   Mr. Speaker, this should not be about politics. This should be about  whether or not you love this country and whether or not you believe  that we should pay our bills, whether or not you think it would be  horrible if this government is to shut down.   If we don't pay our bills and the government shuts down, employees  will not be able to put food on their tables. They will not be able to  pay their mortgage or their rent. They will not be able to support  their children in the ways that they should be supported. This is  serious business.   Now, this business of Mr. McCarthy trying to negotiate with the  President of the United States to say: Well, if you do what I want you  to do, then I will support debt limits.   Mr. Speaker, we cannot do what the majority wants us to do because,  first of all, they don't know what they are doing. They are putting  this country at great risk.  [[Page H1939]]                                     time  2015    What you are saying is you don't care about the debt. You don't care  about the fact that there are people waiting to be paid that we owe.   You don't care whether or not there is a government shutdown. You  don't care whether or not these jobs are lost.   I am saying to you: We will not support that kind of so-called  negotiation. We will not support your putting this country at risk in  the way that you are doing.   You need to come to grips with the fact that we have to raise the  debt limit, and it has been done historically when it has needed to be  done, and we expect you to do it.   I leave this moment by saying to you: We are waiting on you, Mr.  McCarthy, to do the responsible thing, get with our President, and  let's support our country.
