 Mr. Speaker, let it be known, just 90 miles off the coast  of our State of Florida is a murderous, socialist dictatorship that is  murdering and crushing its people. Let it also be known across this  Nation that Democrats and Republicans are coming together today to  express solidarity with Cuban citizens demonstrating peacefully for  fundamental freedoms and democracy.   We saw it this summer when they took to the streets on the island as  well as across our country including in Orlando. I was proud to stand  in solidarity. Resolutions expressing support are important, but so is  action, which is why, after this is done, we need to pursue other, more  substantive policies like: stopping enslavement of Cuban doctors,  putting more pressure for internet access on the island; addressing  Havana syndrome and the attack on our diplomats, sanctions and U.N.  action to stop even some of our own U.N. European allies from  continuing to prop up this dictatorship. That will make a big  difference.
