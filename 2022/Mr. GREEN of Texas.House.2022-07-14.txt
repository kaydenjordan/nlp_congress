 Madam Speaker, and still I rise. And I rise today  to call upon the Governor of the State of Texas to denounce the coverup  by the pusillanimous peace officers at Robb Elementary.   If you have seen that video and it does not tug at your heart, you  need help. I stand with those parents who are suffering. It is time for  us to get to the bottom of what happened at that elementary school. The  Governor laid the foundation at his initial press conference for the  coverup that has taken place.   Governor, we are going to hold you accountable. You can't allow such  things to happen without denouncing them, at minimum, and there may be  more that you can do. Use all of your powers, Governor, to bring  justice to the families who are suffering.
