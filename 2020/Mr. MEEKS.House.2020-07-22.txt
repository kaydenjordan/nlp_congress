 Mr. Speaker, John Robert Lewis was short in height, yet he  was a giant. John Robert Lewis was a humble man but fierce for justice.   John Robert Lewis talked softly, but roared like a lion when it was  time to fight for freedom, justice, and equality for all humankind. He  said there was one race--the human race.   He is an individual that compelled a Nation to change, to make it  better. His voice will echo in this Chamber forever.   It was my honor and pleasure for 22 years to serve with the Honorable  John Robert Lewis.   May he rest in peace and rise in power.
