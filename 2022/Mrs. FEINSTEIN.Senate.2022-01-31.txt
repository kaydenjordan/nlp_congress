 Mr. President, today I honor the memory and steadfast  service of CDR Kristin Driscoll, a beloved mother, wife, daughter,  sister, and Active-Duty Coast Guard Officer.   To use a maritime metaphor from Lord Alfred Tennyson, Commander  Driscoll ``crossed the bar'' on October 26, 2021, following a brave  battle with a brain tumor. Kristin underwent brain surgery on November  13, 2017, 1 week after her 35th birthday. Although the surgeons were  able to remove 97 percent of the tumor, the remaining 3 percent was  rooted too deeply to reach.   True to form, Kristin rebounded from her surgery with energy and  renewed purpose. Despite her prognosis, she ran a half marathon in  April 2018, reported to work every day, and planned family outings.   Stanford Medical Center quickly took note of Kristin's energy and  optimism and asked her to participate in a patient education video  project, saying they had been looking for someone like her for nearly 2  years. She filmed the video the very next week.   Commander Driscoll served in the U.S. Coast Guard for 20 years and  was the first in her family to serve. For the majority of that time,  she was stationed in California, from San Diego to Alameda, and had a  clear passion for Coast Guard operations. Specifically, she focused on  emergency management supporting natural disasters, oil and pollution  response, and search and rescue.   She was a leader on a diverse list of operational teams that ranged  from the National Contingency Plan ``Special Teams'' that monitored  Federal Marine Environmental Response operations across the southwest  border to a Command Center that conducted search and rescue efforts  across 3.3 million square miles of offshore waters from California to  the Panama Canal.   In reviewing the achievements of Commander Driscoll, I am struck by  her unwavering dedication and poise in confronting terrific challenges.  She contributed to the response to the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill,  led a security deployment to Guantanamo Bay, and oversaw the first-ever  deployment of a U.S. Coast Guard standard boat from a foreign naval  vessel in support of counter-drug smuggling operations in the  Caribbean. She deployed in the wake of Hurricanes Irma and Maria as  deputy incident commander to lead search and rescue and recovery  efforts, took a leading role in supporting COVID-19 response efforts as  planning section chief, and took the lead role as incident commander  for the USS Bonhomme Richard fire.   Commander Driscoll's ability was well-noted throughout her life, and  her record of success is etched in Coast Guard history. After  graduating cum laude from Baker University in 2005, Commander Driscoll  earned a master's degree in Homeland Security Leadership from the  University of Connecticut. Her personal awards include an Advanced Boat  Force Operations Insignia, six Coast Guard Commendation Medals, two  Coast Guard Achievement Medals, two Letters of Commendation, a NOAA  Corps Directors Ribbon, and various service and unit awards. She was a  leader in every sense, and I take some solace in the fact that her  inspiration will live on in the thousands of officers she taught at the  Coast Guard's Leadership Development Center.   Today, I thank CDR Kristin Driscoll for her devotion, as well as her  husband PJ, daughters Averie and Cameron, and son Nolan. Her service  was an honor to us all.                            ____________________
