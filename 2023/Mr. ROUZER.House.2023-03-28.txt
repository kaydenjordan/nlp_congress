 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs  Act, which includes the Water Quality Certification and Energy Project  Improvement Act. That bill is the one that I introduced alongside my  friend and colleague from Louisiana, Mr. Garret Graves.   One of many key components in this package, this specific part of the  bill helps ensure development of our Nation's energy infrastructure at  a time when it is most necessary. This is accomplished by clarifying  that projects subject to section 401 of the Clean Water Act are  approved or denied based on water quality alone.   Unlike what my colleagues have been saying on the other side of the  aisle that we are going to permit dirty water, et cetera, et cetera, if  it is related to water, guess what, section 401 still applies.   The water quality certification process has been and continues to be  weaponized by certain States to stifle important energy projects they  oppose, particularly pipelines, for political reasons completely  unrelated to water quality and outside the scope and the intent of the  Clean Water Act. That is all this particular provision addresses.   Instead of fairly analyzing a project based on the Federal standards  set forth by Congress, what has happened is States on the East and West  Coast have increasingly weaponized section 401 for their own  ideological purposes, again totally and completely unrelated to water  quality.   Here are some examples: In my home State of North Carolina, the  Mountain Valley Southgate project was denied, not because of water  quality but because the deciding bureaucrats hold an inherent  opposition to the project as a whole.   Projects in Washington and New York have been denied due to noise and  cultural resources. Nothing to do with water quality.   These are just a few examples of the weaponization of section 401 of  the Clean Water Act statute.   The language that is included here in this package quite simply will  end this abuse.   At a time when American energy production and distribution is under  tremendous assault from some in this country, ensuring that America can  build the energy infrastructure necessary to responsibly utilize our  natural resources, unleash American energy independence, and lower  costs for American families is a top priority that this broader bill  achieves.   Let me put it this way: Low cost, reliable energy is fundamental to  prosperity. It isn't the only critical aspect necessary for a nation  and her people to be prosperous, but it is awfully hard for a nation to  be prosperous without it.   Low cost and reliable energy helps America to produce more goods and  therefore put downward pressure on inflation, and, boy, do we need all  the help we can get. It will enable America to be energy dominant  again, increasing American strength abroad. Put another way, it is  critical to our economy, our food security, and our national security.  That is why this legislation is so badly needed at this critical time  in American history.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the Lower Energy Costs  Act, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining?    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I have listened to some comments from my friends on the  other side, and I am just going to share some examples of how section  401 of the Clean Water Act has been weaponized. Some of these I touched  on a little earlier, and some of these have yet to be stated, as far as  I know.   In Oregon, a proposed liquified natural gas pipeline and export  terminal, which would have had the capability to liquefy over 1 billion  cubic feet of natural gas per day, was blocked by that State. The  reason? After giving the project applicants the runaround, Oregon  denied the certification, citing incomplete information given to the  State.   Once again, that was a project that was estimated to have generated  up to $100 million in revenue annually, blocked, just like that.   Despite FERC finding that the project's plan for environmental  mitigation and impact minimization was satisfactory, Oregon denied  certification based on reasons outside the scope of the CWA, the Clean  Water Act.   My second example here comes from a proposed natural gas pipeline's  37-mile extension that New York denied. The project would have added  enough additional natural gas per day to meet the needs of  approximately 2.3 million homes in a region where demand for natural  gas is at an all-time high. Additionally, the project would add an  estimated $327.2 million to the region's economy.   Again, in this case, FERC concluded that any long-term effects would  be limited to air quality and noise and that all project effects would  be reduced to less than significant levels.   Once again, the State forced the project applicants to come back  multiple times with more documents, continuing to move the goalposts  each time.   When the State finally gave a straight reason for denying the  project, they nominally cited ``indirect effects on water resources,''  but none of these were provisions of the Clean Water Act section 401.   Those are just a couple of examples of how water quality wasn't even  an issue. It was other aspects. They were just using the loopholes in  the statute to achieve their end.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, passage of H.R. 1 is critical for boosting  our domestic energy production and lowering energy costs for all  Americans.   I thank Majority Leader Scalise for his leadership on this bill, as  well as the chairman of the Energy and Commerce and Natural Resources  Committees and our own chairman, Sam Graves, of Transportation and  Infrastructure.   As has been stated, this bill contains many provisions to help  streamline the permitting process for energy projects, allowing America  to unleash its domestic energy potential.   I am particularly proud of division C of H.R. 1, which passed out of  the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, that will stop States  from using section 401 of the Clean Water Act as an excuse to block  critical energy projects.   Mr. Chairman, I urge support of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  [[Page H1516]]  LaMalfa) having assumed the chair, Mr. Lawler, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1) to  lower energy costs by increasing American energy production, exports,  infrastructure, and critical minerals processing, by promoting  transparency, accountability, permitting, and production of American  resources, and by improving water quality certification and energy  projects, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
