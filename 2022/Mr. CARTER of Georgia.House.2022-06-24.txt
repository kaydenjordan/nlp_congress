 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Mashama  Bailey for her achievement of receiving the prestigious James Beard  Award for Outstanding Chef.   Mashama is a renowned chef at The Grey in Savannah, Georgia, where  she has served Southern cuisine since 2014.   She traveled to many locations around the world, perfecting her  culinary craft, and uses what she has learned to showcase the amazing  taste of Southern cuisine.   The James Beard Award was established to highlight the exceptional  talent and achievements in the culinary  [[Page H5882]]  arts. Mashama also received the James Beard Award for Best Chef:  Southeast back in 2019.   Throughout her career, she has taken the fine dining world by storm  through her exceptional dishes that have helped put Savannah among some  of the best culinary spots in the Nation.   Mashama's commitment to her passion has fed many Savannahians some of  the best food in the world, and she is an inspiration to the First  Congressional District.   Congratulations, Mashama, and good luck in your future endeavors.                            ____________________
