 Mr. Speaker, in 2015, President Obama's EPA implemented  the waters of the U.S., or the WOTUS rule, which arbitrarily and  unilaterally expanded which kinds of waterways could be regulated under  the Clean Water Act.   This rule turned every irrigation ditch, pond, and puddle on a farm  into a new target for Washington regulators. In addition, this rule  circumvented the Congress and the investigative process.   As a Representative for one of the largest agricultural districts in  the country, I have heard time and again from farmers about the costs  of these renewed regulations, not to mention the headaches caused by  trying to comply.   By the EPA's own estimates, the rule would cost farmers and small  businesses up to $460 million a year. It is not only bad policy, but  also a bad idea to arbitrarily make it more difficult for farmers to do  their jobs and provide our food and fuel for our economy.   That is why I was relieved to see that President Trump rescinded this  rule last month. By rescinding this rule, the President sent a strong  message that Washington must put farmers ahead of bureaucrats.                            ____________________
