 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on the topic of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, it is a great honor for me to come before  the House and be on the floor tonight to commemorate National Bible  Week. This is an opportunity to celebrate the tremendous influence of  the Bible on the freedoms we enjoy today in America.   We are truly blessed to live in a nation where we are free to worship  and read the Holy Scriptures without fear of persecution. There are  many places throughout the world where such freedoms do not exist.   Americans have the right, under our wonderful system of government,  to respect and study the Bible or any other system of belief if they so  choose, or even none at all. That is the beauty of the American way,  and I believe it all does go back to the Bible.   In 1941, as it says on the poster here, President Franklin Delano  Roosevelt declared the week of Thanksgiving to be National Bible Week.   The National Bible Association and the U.S. Conference of Bishops  have designated the specific days of November 18-24, this year, as  National Bible Week. This is the week set aside to recognize the Bible  as a foundational building block of American and Western civilization,  the Judeo-Christian heritage, and the legacy that motivated and shaped  the founding of the United States.   In this hour, we will hear from some of my colleagues here in  Congress from various faith traditions and denominations speak about  what the Bible means to them. We are here in keeping with tradition to  recognize National Bible Week.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).    Mr. Speaker, my friend from Michigan mentioned a few  things about the founding of our country, and so I would like to  mention this: Many of the early American settlers came to the New World  with the express purpose of following the Bible according to the  convictions of their own consciences.                                time  1730    One of the first acts of Congress during the tumultuous beginning of  our Nation was the authorization of an American-published Bible.   The war with the British had cut off any supply of Bibles from  England. Our Founding Fathers understood how important it was for the  American people to have Bibles.   Robert Aitken, a private citizen, brought this need to the attention  of Congress. He wrote a letter and he said: `` . . . this work is an  object worthy the attention of the Congress of the United States of  America, who will not neglect spiritual security, while they are  virtuously contending for temporal blessings.''   In 1782, Congress reviewed, approved, and authorized the first known  English language Bible to be printed in America, and that Congressional  Resolution read: ``RESOLVED, THAT the United States in Congress  assembled, highly approve the pious and laudable undertaking of Mr.  Aitken, as subservient to the interest of religion, as well as an  instance of the progress of arts in this country, and being satisfied  from the above report, of his care and accuracy in the execution of the  work, they recommend this edition of the Bible to the inhabitants of  the United States, and hereby authorize him to publish this  Recommendation in the manner he shall think proper.''   Boy, what a great thing for Congress to do back in the 1700s. I  wonder if the incoming Congress will recommend a Bible to the American  people.   But it was certainly an important part of the founding of our  country, and I am so glad we have that heritage as a country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield time to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Bergman), my colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for being here tonight  and for all of his work in Congress. We are honored to have him as one  of our colleagues. I appreciate his service as a veteran for many years  in the U.S. Marine Corps.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to talk for a few minutes about an experience  I had when I was younger, and then turn it over to another one of my  colleagues.   When I was 18 years old and a freshman at the University of Kansas,  someone asked me if I knew what the Bible was about, and I said, yeah,  I know what it was about. But then I thought about it and I realized  that my answer was really pretty presumptuous, because I had never  actually read any of it.   So, Mr. Speaker, I wonder if this might be true for anyone who is  listening today. The only honest thing I could do at that point was to  read the Bible for myself. So I started by reading for myself in the  Gospel of John in the New Testament. When I read it, I discovered that  I hadn't known at all what the Bible was about.   In that Gospel, Jesus says: ``I am the way, the truth, and the life.  No one comes to the Father except through Me.''   And I ended up discovering a personal relationship with Jesus Christ,  who became my Lord and savior.    So, Mr. Speaker, this is what I know from personal experience: it is  better to read the Bible for oneself, and not just take someone else's  word for what is in it, or something they might read on the Internet.   For me, it made all of the difference in the world. My life has been  totally different since then as a result.   As King David says in Psalms: ``The unfolding of Your words gives  light, it gives understanding to the simple.''   As we celebrate National Bible Week, we remember the importance of  faith in both our private and public lives; we recognize its powerful  message of hope; and we cherish the wisdom of the Bible and we thank  God for providing this Holy book that has truly been, as has been said  already tonight, a lamp unto our feet and a light unto our path.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for his  contribution to tonight's Special Order.   He mentioned a passage that was also referenced by Ronald Reagan, and  let me highlight that with you, because throughout American history,  many of our great leaders have turned to the Bible for guidance, hope,  and faith.   For instance, President Abraham Lincoln once said of the Bible, ``I  have but to say, it is the best gift God has given to man. All the good  the savior gave to the world was communicated through this book. But  for it, we could not know right from wrong. All things most desirable  for man's welfare here and hereafter are found portrayed in it.''   And another one of our greatest presidents, in my opinion, President  Ronald Reagan, in his own National Bible Week declaration, which we are  celebrating, wrote when he was in office: ``When I took the oath of  office, I requested the Bible be opened to II Chronicles 7:14 . . . ''  and we just heard  [[Page H9681]]  from that. And President Reagan went on: `` . . . which reads, `If my  people, which are called by my Name shall humble themselves and pray  and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from  heaven and forgive their sin and will heal their land.'''   The President also said: ``This passage expresses my hopes for the  future of this Nation and the world.''                                time  1745    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Conaway),  chairman of the Agriculture Committee and a colleague of mine on the  Armed Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his words and for  his service to our country.   The gentleman mentioned: How do we know this book is true? People put  a lot of faith in it, sometimes to the point of death, but how do they  know it is really true?   One reason many people respect the Bible and believe it is that it  has prophesied and told future events which came true exactly as  foretold. In the Old Testament, there are many predictions that were  given to prove that the speaker, who claimed to be a prophet, was  divinely inspired so, if and when those predictions came true, it would  validate the words of that prophet; if they did not come true, it  showed him to be a false prophet.   The Book of Daniel, for instance, contains scores of detailed  prophecies that were literally fulfilled. Skeptics have fallen back to  the position that Daniel must have written after the fact because those  prophecies were so amazingly precise and did come true.   But we know, later, through history and archeology, that the Book of  Daniel was found in its entirety in the Greek's Septuagint version and  partially in the Dead Sea Scrolls. Both of those predated the events  that were prophesied, so those prophecies were made in advance of the  historical events which came true.   The rise and fall of empires, the capture and destruction of cities,  and the destiny of kings all were prophesied about in minute detail.  This is an example where archeology and history have literally  confirmed those and hundreds of other such prophecies as having come  true, which is a validation of the truth of the Bible.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Johnson),  the incoming chairman of the Republican Study Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for those remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King).     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his work on that  important and vital piece of legislation.   I would now like to yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his remarks and  his words.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for his  words.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin for  his remarks on Deuteronomy which contains, among others, the passages,  the reciting of the Ten Commandments.   I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Budd).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Jody B.  Hice).    Mr. Speaker, I would like to inquire from the Speaker  how much time is remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank everyone who came here. I  appreciate their great comments.   Thousands of years ago, Isaiah said: ``The grass withers, the flower  fades, but the word of our God stands forever.''   Civilizations have come and gone; people have come and gone; and  generations have come and gone. Here we are in the year 2018 still  celebrating, commemorating, and depending on the Bible, the Word of  God.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
