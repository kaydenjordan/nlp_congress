 Mr. Chairman, I am so proud today to stand here to  support H.R. 4, the Voting Rights Advancement  [[Page H9322]]  Act. And I want to congratulate my incredible colleague Congresswoman  Sewell for her leadership.   When Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965, it was a  recognition that systemic discrimination based on race continued to  deny people the right to vote. And as an organizer, I understand the  Voting Rights Act as a victory that was hard fought by Black activists  like Fannie Lou Hamer and Ella Baker and, of course, our esteemed  colleague Representative Lewis, who devoted their lives to fighting for  the right to vote. And it was a victory of the movement that recognized  that this right to vote is absolutely fundamental to our concept and  our actualization of democracy.   Unfortunately, we have not followed with the same courage. Instead,  since 2013, States have enacted laws that have suppressed voting rights  across the country, and today, half of the country faces stricter  voting regulations than they did 9 years ago.   If we want a true democracy, Mr. Speaker, we must protect the right  to vote for all, and this bill is critical to doing that.
