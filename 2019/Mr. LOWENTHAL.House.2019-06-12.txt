 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues,  especially led by Representative Katie Porter in support of her  constituent Michael Nguyen.   I have stayed involved in this case for just about a year, just  slightly less than a year, and I want to thank Representative Porter  for keeping the Members of Congress involved in this by having  periodic, almost monthly, calls with the U.S. Consul office in Vietnam.   I want to thank Ambassador Kritenbrink for making this a high  priority of the U.S. mission in Vietnam to attend to the case of  Michael, to visit Michael Nguyen in jail.   And what am I talking about?   Michael Nguyen, who was a citizen of the city of Orange, was on a  trip in July of 2018, as he frequently did during the past, to visit  relatives in Vietnam. On his way from the city of Da Nang to Ho Chi  Minh City, or what was known as Saigon, government security officials  removed him from his bus and took him into custody. He was detained; he  was imprisoned, repeatedly interrogated; and when the U.S. Consul and  Members of Congress asked why he was being charged, they were told,  almost a year ago: He is under investigation. When we complete the  investigation, we will tell you what the charge is.    Michael's family was not notified about his detention, even for 10  days after he was arrested. This violated the agreement between the  United States and Vietnam, which said that the Vietnamese Government  must notify the United States and our consul within 96 hours whenever  there is an arrest of an American citizen.   When he did not return home, Michael's family began to contact U.S.  Representatives, including myself from Orange County, asking for help,  but we learned very little in this past year about why Michael was  arrested and detained.   Some thought that the Vietnamese Government said that he had posted  something on Facebook about a plot to overthrow the government, but  they have not provided any evidence or any proof of this posting, just  what has been said.   As was pointed out earlier, he was arrested for violating article 109  of the Vietnamese penal code, which accuses people of conspiring to  overthrow the government. The penalty for just posting is from 14 years  to life imprisonment.   While he has received the indictment--he knows exactly why he is  being charged, what the issues are--neither his family, the U.S.  mission in Vietnam, or Members of Congress who have talked about this  over the past year have been told what are the specifics of the case or  what he has done.   He hasn't had contact with his family while he is in jail. He doesn't  have an attorney; he is not allowed to have an attorney; and most  likely, later this month, just before the case comes to court, he will  be assigned an attorney.   His wife works for UC Irvine Medical Center. They have four young  children. They don't know what is going on.   It is just another example of the egregious actions by the Government  of Vietnam.   I call upon the Government of Vietnam to close this case; return  Michael to his family. No American citizen should be charged because  they publicly criticize a government or fear that, when they visit  Vietnam, especially because of speaking out in the past, they are going  to be arrested, detained, and tried.   Mr. Speaker, it is time for the Members of Congress to have a serious  reevaluation of our economic and diplomatic relationships with Vietnam.  Vietnam should know that the U.S. Congress is watching its actions and  we expect Michael Nguyen to be freed and returned to his family.                            ____________________
