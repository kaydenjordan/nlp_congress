 Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my concern for the  unprecedented crisis at our southern border because of the Biden  administration's reckless open-border policy and failure to enforce our  Nation's immigration laws.   We are seeing thousands of illegal immigrants crossing the border  every single day, and there is no sign of letting up. The President and  the Vice President are nowhere to be found.   That is not leadership. We need leadership. We have a crisis at the  border, and leadership, we are making a call for help, please.   The Vice President was appointed as the border czar weeks ago and has  yet to take a single trip to the southern border. That is unacceptable.   We must have strong border protection for the health, safety, and  security of American citizens. It is time for this administration and  the far left to put America first by enforcing our immigration laws and  putting an end to this horrific crisis at our southern border.
