 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this legislation, H.R. 31,  the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act of 2019. I am a proud original  cosponsor of this legislation.   Over 7 years, nearly half a million Syrians killed, 6 million Syrians  driven from their country, over 10 million Syrians displaced and forced  from their homes, and countless acts of atrocities from the Assad  regime.   Clearly, it is time for this Congress to act, and this bill would do  that. It would bring much-needed accountability to the Assad regime,  which is responsible for horrific crimes, crimes against its own  people. It would do so by allowing sanctions to be imposed on people  who contribute to these coldhearted and merciless acts.   It would require the Treasury Department to determine whether to  target Syria's Central Bank with money laundering countermeasures.   Quite simply, I agree with Chairman Engel. We need a political  solution that ends Assad's crimes, removes him from power, and allows  the Syrian people to develop their own future for their own country.   Assad must be held accountable for the massacre of his own people,  and this bill will begin to do just that.   Additionally, Russia and Assad must stop standing by and  systematically allowing ISIS to attack minority populations in Syria,  including the Druze people.   We cannot expect much from these actors, but it is incumbent upon  them to protect minority populations in Syria in the territory that  they control. Further, it is also the responsibility of the President  of the United States and his national security team to speak with one  voice regarding our policy in Syria and the region.    The President has, time and time again, illustrated that  our allies and our adversaries simply cannot trust what the President  says. The administration needs to articulate a cohesive strategy for  the region and for Syria, particularly after the President, with no  warning to our partners, announced the U.S. withdrawal.                                time  1645    Finally, Mr. Speaker, like Chairman Engel, I thank all of those who  have advocated for this bill, for their tenacity, for their engagement,  and I urge my colleagues to join with them and stand up for them and  immediately pass this critical legislation to hold Assad accountable.
