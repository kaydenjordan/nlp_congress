 Mr. Speaker, today, the House will vote to decide  whether to overturn another bad decision by President Biden.   His veto of H.J. Res. 27, which overturned the EPA's and Army Corps  of Engineers' overreaching definition of  [[Page H1766]]  ``waters of the United States,'' in yet another rule change to that  law, keeps the new expanded definition of WOTUS in place.   This change to one of most abused and litigated Federal statutes on  the books allows the EPA to regulate every single ditch, every little  puddle, every ephemeral stream in America, as if they were somehow the  Mississippi River or the Sacramento River, in my home State.   Of course, this is ludicrous, as our Nation's commerce, agriculture,  and natural beauty are not dependent on a farmer's self-made ditch or  irrigation canal or these ephemeral streams.   With the expanded WOTUS rule, the Federal Government can now regulate  almost any activity, from farming to landscaping, which occurs on  private property.   Treating Americans' private property as sacrosanct has been a core  principle of this Nation for over two centuries.   Our Founders would be horrified to see a United States Government  agency, headquartered here in Washington, D.C., granting itself broad  power to regulate every single American on their own land.   We have seen the EPA abuse WOTUS before to regulate everything from  farming to home building. Ridiculous interpretations on whether you can  even plant a fallow field back to a wheat crop that previously had one  without a permit can often take 3 years because there is no motivation  from the Army Corps or other regulators to get the job done and tell  the farmer: Yes, you may farm your ground the way you did it once  before. They sued them for it, they fined them, and basically put them  out of business over a farming activity that has occurred.   Another example is the couple that are being sued over WOTUS, and it  is being used as a weapon to prevent a married couple from building  their dream home near the shore of a lake, all within the rules.   I guarantee you, when the Clean Water Act and the Environmental  Protection Act were passed in the early seventies by this Congress,  they did not have the intent, nor would they have gotten away with,  passing legislation that would have been so far-reaching as this.   These are about, yes, clean water. They are about protecting species  and some of the habitat for them, not every possible piece of ground in  the world that might host one, even though they don't currently.   They would not have been able to pass that through Congress because  people would have run them out of here on a rail. Yet, through court  interpretations over time, rulemaking, and guidance, this is where we  have gotten to. The administration, and the previous Democratic  administration, have been hyperaggressive in putting waters of the  United States rules in place that have little to do with what the  measurement used to be, that it was a navigable stream.   Well, ``navigable'' used to mean you could actually drive a boat up  and down that particular river or what have you. Now, if you can float  a rubber duck in it for a half hour after a rain in a pond or a stream  or what have you, then they seem to believe that should be a good  enough definition for ``navigable waterways.''   It is ridiculous. With the increasing cost of food to Americans and  fewer food choices on our shelves, and even empty shelves in this  country, this is the move they make, to restore to previous aggressive  limits of waters of the United States and take away the ability to farm  our products, already safely, already reliably, already ecologically  sound.   This is not needed under the Biden interpretation or the previous  Obama interpretation. These are property rights, and these are land  rights that are a cornerstone of our country's founding. Indeed, it is  a way to take more control and put Washington, D.C., and put  bureaucrats in greater charge of things that used to be good rural  issues, rural values, which are keeping food on the table for  Americans, thereby positioning us to be independent of having to import  food, which keeps us strong.   Food is strategic. Food is a security issue. We are seeing our  security dissipate rapidly under the weight of crazy regulations like  this and others that are so negatively affecting our ability to produce  energy in this country. WOTUS is used to stop that, too. If we don't  produce our own energy, are we going to import more from the Saudis or  other areas?   We have seen these embargoes twice in our past. It doesn't work very  well. Energy is the core for everything in a civilized society. As we  see our energy dissipating along domestic production, we are seeing the  high cost of everything.   WOTUS needs to be repealed, and I hope the House does that today.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, today, I honor the memory of Miles Isbell.  Today would have been Miles' 12th birthday.   At the age of 9, Miles was diagnosed with brain cancer. While  undergoing treatment, he refused to stop living his life to the fullest  extent possible. He stayed active in school while undergoing treatment.  He became a real-life trouper and outspoken candidate for cancer  research while, in one night, raising $3 million for a brain cancer  research facility.   Last September, the players on the San Francisco Giants baseball team  wore pediatric cancer bracelets in Miles' honor. They brought him to  several games, and he was able to meet several of the team's star  players.   Miles had a tenacity that few of us could match. Despite the  difficulty of his diagnosis and treatments, he never once uttered the  word ``cancer.'' Indeed, this hat says: ``Smiles for Miles.''   Sadly, he passed away on October 21, 2022. The mark he left behind is  indelible. He touched many lives. He showed everyone around him what  courage and strength in the face of darkness looks like. May we honor  his memory and remember his bravery.   Miles is now resting peacefully in the arms of the Lord. We in  northern California mourn his passing. He will be missed every day. I  can think of no better person to honor on this floor.                            ____________________
