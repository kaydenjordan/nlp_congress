 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember and  honor the life of beloved Savannah architect Eric Meyerhoff, who passed  away at the age of 91.   Eric was a gift to the Savannah community, who blessed it with his  gift of imagination. Eric helped create the Savannah Riverfront and  more than 74 projects in the historic district, including the World War  II monument titled, ``A World Apart,'' which is located on River  Street.   Eric played a large part in making the beautiful city what it is  today, and he spent over 50 years bringing his vision for Savannah to  life. Although Eric was extremely committed to Savannah's architecture,  he was even more committed to his people.   Eric and his family escaped Nazi Germany in the 1930s, so he had many  impactful stories that touched countless lives.   Eric was also a veteran. Eric served as a translator in the United  States Army.   Eric was a graduate of the University of Florida and was a huge  Florida Gators fan.   Although most in the Savannah community knew Eric as a renowned  architect, he was also a devoted teacher, provider, husband, and  father.   I am thankful for the life Eric lived, and he will leave a lasting  impact on Savannah with his architectural creations. My thoughts and  prayers are with his family and friends during this most difficult  time.                            ____________________
