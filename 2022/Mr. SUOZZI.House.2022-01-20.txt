 Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the award of a  Congressional Gold Medal to the 52 hostages of the Iran hostage crisis  that were released, after 444 days of captivity, 41 years ago today.   On November 4, 1979, Iranian student militants stormed the U.S.  Embassy in Tehran and took Embassy employees captive. Despite mock  firing squads, beatings, solitary confinement, lack of food, and  psychological torture, the American hostages maintained their strength  and resilience.   Back at home, Americans remained united in their support for the  hostages, many tying yellow ribbons around trees as a sign of  solidarity. The former hostages have never received proper recognition  from their government for their sacrifices.   This bipartisan bill is a symbol of our Nation's ability to come  together to honor these American heroes. As of today, the bill has over  166 cosponsors.   Special thanks to Commission 52 and Chairman Brock Pierce for helping  to gather support for the bill. It is a true public service.                            ____________________
