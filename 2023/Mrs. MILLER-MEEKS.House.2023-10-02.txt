 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Fire  Chief Steve Knorrek on his retirement.   His four-decade long career of extraordinary dedication, commitment,  [[Page H4938]]  and service to the Bettendorf Fire Department began on September 6,  1983.   In less than a decade, he rose through the ranks, becoming a captain  and a fire marshal. His commitment didn't go unnoticed as he was named  the Bettendorf Fire Department Officer of the Year in 1991. He received  accolades such as the 2015 Governor's Fire Prevention Officer of the  Year award and actively contributed to organizations like the American  Burn Association's International Outreach Committee and the St. Florian  Burn Foundation Board of Directors.   Chief Knorrek's service extended beyond the call of duty,  representing the highest ideals and integrity, and he is leaving an  indelible mark on the Bettendorf community and the broader region.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Chief Knorrek on his retirement and thank  him for his dedicated service.                  Recognizing Breast Cancer Awareness Month     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Breast  Cancer Awareness Month. October can feel different for everyone who has  been affected by breast cancer.   Some people wear pink and others may be grieving, but we can all  agree on the importance of community support. Breast cancer knows no  age, gender, or race, but it predominantly affects women.   As the single most diagnosed cancer among American women, we must  remember to get screened, learn more about the risks and factors, and  support families and caregivers impacted by this disease. This Breast  Cancer Awareness Month, let us continue to put up a fight against  breast cancer and, most importantly, let us remain united as we work to  find a cure.                       Honoring Dustin Michael Cackley     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  extraordinary life of Dustin Michael Cackley of Keokuk, Iowa, who  passed away at the age of 51 after suffering a heart attack in  September.   Dustin's life was marked by selfless service and unwavering  dedication to his country. He graduated from Keokuk Senior High School  in 1991 and joined the U.S. Army later that year, beginning a 20-year  career as a military police officer. His exemplary service earned him  numerous accolades, including the Iraq Campaign Medal, Bronze Star  Medal, and the Army Commendation Medal, among others. He served two  deployments in Operation Iraqi Freedom from 2003 to 2004 and 2008 to  2009.   After retiring from the military in 2011, Dustin faced personal  challenges, including PTSD. Yet, with the support of his loyal military  brother, Paul Schroeder, he found his way back to faith and a new  purpose in life.   He dedicated himself to helping veterans cope with PTSD through  faith-based initiatives, cofounding the Armatus Reintegration Program  in 2017.   Returning to Keokuk in 2019, Dustin became an integral part of his  community. He served as commander of Keokuk American Legion Post 41,  promoting military appreciation night and advocating for veterans'  causes. He worked tirelessly on the Veterans Memorial Commission,  promoting the Agent Orange Memorial and the Road of Honor.   Dustin Michael Cackley's legacy is one of bravery, service, and  unwavering dedication to his country and community. His impact on the  lives of veterans and the city of Keokuk will be felt for generations  to come.                   Recognizing Police Officer Jared Alcorn     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  extraordinary efforts of Norwalk Police Officer Jared Alcorn, who saved  a couple from a house fire while on patrol in August. At 3:50 a.m.,  Officer Alcorn smelled smoke and conducted a thorough search of the  neighborhood he was patrolling, leading him to a small house where he  witnessed flames engulfing the back deck.   The fire, although not yet extensive, posed a grave threat to the  unsuspecting couple sound asleep inside. Without hesitation, Alcorn  dialed the fire department, swiftly woke and evacuated the occupants,  along with their pets, and called for backup.   Then displaying remarkable bravery and resourcefulness, Officer  Alcorn and his partner took on the roles of impromptu firefighters.  They grabbed garden hoses from both sides of the house and commenced a  valiant battle against the encroaching flames. Their relentless efforts  held the fire at bay until professional firefighters arrived on the  scene.   Thanks to the swift and selfless actions of Officer Jared Alcorn, the  fire's damage was contained primarily to the home's exterior. The  couple and their pets were spared from harm and the heart of the  residence remained intact.   Mr. Speaker, in the darkest hours of that morning, Officer Alcorn's  courage shone brightly, embodying the true spirit of a dedicated and  heroic public servant.                      Motion to Vacate Speaker McCarthy     Mr. Speaker, I would like to address comments I  recently heard on the floor, and that is a motion to vacate Speaker  McCarthy.   A motion to vacate is going to continue to derail our appropriations  bills process and bringing those bills to the floor. It will upset and  further erode our ability to investigate the Biden family corruption,  in which we have made significant progress.                            ____________________
