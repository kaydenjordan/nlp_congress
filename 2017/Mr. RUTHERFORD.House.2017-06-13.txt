 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S.  1094, the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and  Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017.   As we have all seen from various reports and news stories, increased  accountability at the VA is long, long overdue. For far too long, the  leadership in the Department of Veterans Affairs has been unable to  make firing decisions that would be common sense in any other setting.   The VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act gives the  Secretary the authority to fire the bad actors and creates a removal  process that is more in line with the private sector. It also gives the  Secretary the ability to punish poor performers by recouping bonuses  and relocation expenses. We must ensure that employees who fail to do  their jobs are not rewarded but are, instead, held accountable.   Another part of this legislation is the enhanced protection for  whistleblowers. These are employees who are doing the right thing and  advocating for our veterans. They should not be faced with retribution  by their leadership.   One of the most important jobs of this Congress is working to improve  the lives of our Nation's veterans. When our fellow Americans bravely  put on the uniform and serve, we must ensure that that sacrifice does  not go unnoticed.   In my time serving on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I have seen  how Congress and the leadership of the VA, in partnership with veterans  service organizations, are working to create the culture of service and  accountability that our veterans truly deserve.   As Secretary Shulkin has often said, the VA needs changing, and I  believe this bill is a huge step in that direction.   I would like to thank Chairman Roe for his leadership, and Senator  Rubio. This issue is crucial to the 150,000 veteran men and women of  northeast Florida, and I thank them for their leadership, and I urge my  colleagues to support the bill.
