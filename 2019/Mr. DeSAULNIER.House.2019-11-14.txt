 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules,  I call up House Resolution 695 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 695         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 4863) to promote the competitiveness of the       United States, to reform and reauthorize the United States       Export Finance Agency, and for other purposes. The first       reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of       order against consideration of the bill are waived. General       debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one       hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Financial Services. After       general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment       under the five-minute rule. In lieu of the amendment in the       nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on       Financial Services now printed in the bill, an amendment in       the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules       Committee Print 116-36 shall be considered as adopted in the       House and in the Committee of the Whole. The bill, as       amended, shall be considered as the original bill for the       purpose of further amendment under the five-minute rule and       shall be considered as read. All points of order against       provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived. No further       amendment to the bill, as amended, shall be in order except       those printed in the report of the Committee on Rules       accompanying this resolution. Each such further amendment may       be offered only in the order printed in the report, may be       offered only by a Member designated in the report, shall be       considered as read, shall be debatable for the time specified       in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent       and an opponent, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall       not be subject to a demand for division of the question in       the House or in the Committee of the Whole. All points of       order against such further amendments are waived. At the       conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the       Committee shall rise and report the bill, as amended, to the       House with such further amendments as may have been adopted.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       bill, as amended, and on any further amendment thereto to       final passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit with or without instructions.        Sec. 2.

(a) At any time on the legislative day of Thursday,       November 21, 2019, it shall be in order without intervention       of any point of order to consider in the House a motion to       discharge the Committee on Foreign Affairs from further       consideration of the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 70)       directing the President pursuant to section 5(c) of the War       Powers Resolution to remove United States Armed Forces from       hostilities in the Syrian Arab Republic that have not been       authorized by Congress, if offered by Representative Gabbard       of Hawaii. The motion shall be considered as read. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       motion to its adoption without intervening motion except 20       minutes of debate equally divided and controlled by       Representative Gabbard of Hawaii and an opponent. The       question of adoption of the motion may be subject to       postponement as though under clause 8 of rule XX.        (b) The provisions of section 7 of the War Powers       Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1546) shall not apply during the       remainder of the One Hundred Sixteenth Congress to House       Concurrent Resolution 70.    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall),  pending which I yield myself such time  [[Page H8839]]  as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time  yielded is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 695, providing for the consideration  of H.R. 4863, the United States Export Finance Agency Act, under a  structured rule.   The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by  the chair and ranking member on the Committee on Financial Services,  makes in order 21 amendments, and provides for a motion to recommit. It  also provides that, upon passage of the rule, H. Res. 661 and H. Res.  693 will be hereby adopted. Additionally, it makes the motion to  discharge H. Con. Res. 70 in order on November 21 if offered by  Representative Gabbard, debatable for 20 minutes. Lastly, the rule  extends the positive work of the Select Committee on the Modernization  of Congress to the conclusion of the 116th Congress.   Mr. Speaker, given that the United States is the third largest  exporter of goods in the world, maintaining and supporting this  industry is imperative for our economic well-being and for good-paying  jobs across the country. In 2018, we shipped over $2.5 trillion worth  of commercial aircraft, machinery, industrial supplies, consumer goods,  and agricultural products overseas.   The Export-Import Bank, or Ex-Im Bank, plays a large role in  supporting that business. Through direct loans, medium- and long-term  loan guarantees, working capital, and insurance, the Ex-Im Bank steps  in where private financing is unavailable and has been supporting  American exporters for nearly a century. Because of work like this, in  the last 10 years, Ex-Im has created 1.7 million American jobs.   Over the last several years, we have seen the Bank go through a lot  of unnecessary political turmoil. After successfully reauthorizing the  Bank in 2015, the Senate has failed to confirm board members. Under  current law, without Senate action, the Bank was left almost  inoperable.   The effects were felt across the Nation, and in my own district, it  was affected there. In the past 5 years, my district in northern  California has been home to nine exporters, of which seven are small  businesses and five are owned by women and minorities. After Senate  negligence left the Bank unable to do its work, today there are only  three exporters remaining in my district.   In today's bill to reauthorize the Bank, we make substantial  improvements that not only address the political problems displayed in  the Senate, but also improve and diversify the Bank's activities. In  short, the United States Export Finance Agency Act will help support  even more jobs, with new emphasis on small business, women- and  minority-owned businesses.   As a former small business owner, I am encouraged by this effort. To  stay on top, the United States must stay competitive. This bill gives  us that chance to help workers, help businesses, and help our economy.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I first want to recognize my colleague from Oklahoma and  his passion, his history on this bill, and his argument. I also want to  thank him for the bull analogy, although I am not sure how the chair of  the committee might take that.   Having said that, I do want to say to my friend from Georgia a little  bit about his comments. I find myself in agreement whenever I come down  here on much of what Mr. Woodall says in terms of the aspiration of  working more together and still keeping our unique perspectives on  things.   Mr. Speaker, I would hope that he would admit that the chair of the  Rules Committee, Mr. McGovern, and the ranking member--certainly, two  of the Members I respect the most, in addition to my colleague. We have  had these debates in the committee, and I think that there is an  earnest effort of both parties to do better. As you said, we can do  better.   So I would like to thank my colleague for mentioning and referring to  the instances when we did agree. I would like to remind us all that Mr.  McGovern has been very insistent on the 72-hour rule, which has been  helpful. We have done a higher percentage of structured rules to date,  and fewer closed rules to date, under his leadership than we did under  the previous Congress. Just 2 weeks ago, not that this is a baseball  game, there were three times as many Republican amendments in the  natural resources bill as there were Democratic.   Having said that, I think we can do better.   I do want to note to my colleague that I am a cosponsor of the  Adoptee Citizen Act, a great piece of legislation with great authors.  As we continue to try to do more together and better together, I think  you know I yearn to serve in a body like that, where we have legitimate  differences of opinion from our perspective, from what our constituents  expect, and there is honest respect for both sides, that we create a  work product that is probably more reflective of both. I have said that  before. We have had this discussion.   In this instance, I think we are trying to do better all the time.  For me, and I know for the chair and our staff, we want to continue to  work with the gentleman to do better.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   It is always a pleasure to be down here or on the Rules Committee  with my friend from Georgia. I appreciate what we agree with, and I  appreciate the passion that the gentleman brings when he disagrees with  us.   I do want to say, as we fight for these things, there was a famous  Frenchman who President Reagan used to quote, the quote was: ``Don't  let the perfect be the enemy of the good.''   So somewhere in there, in this process I think we try to find the  best product we can. I believe what we have in front of us is that  product. And I do also think and commit to this that we can always do  better.   Mr. Speaker, a vote for this rule and this bill is a vote to promote  American-made jobs, goods, and the American economy.   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous question.   The text of the material previously referred to by Mr. Woodall is as  follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 695         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 6. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 2207) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986       to repeal the excise tax on medical devices. All points of       order against consideration of the bill are waived. The bill       shall be considered as read. All points of order against       provisions in the bill are waived. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and on any       amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion       except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled       by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Ways and Means; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 7. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 2207.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time and  move the previous question on the resolution.
