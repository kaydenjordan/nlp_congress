 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the Indiana Area High School math team, which recently  attended the 36th Annual Benjamin Freed High School Mathematics  Competition at PennWest University Clarion on November 3.   Out of the 213 students who attended, Indiana High School won first  place overall in the team category, and five students from Indiana High  School individually placed in the statewide competition: Chloe  Williams, Luca Cosentino, Gabe Kenning, Ethan Coleman, and James Mill.   The math team is coached by Dr. Scott Layden and consists of advanced  math students from the Indiana junior and senior high schools.   The team plans to continue training and attend future competitions at  universities across the State and across the country.   Madam Speaker, please join me in congratulating these fine young  students on their outstanding accomplishment and their commitment to  science and mathematics.   As a senior member of the House Education and Labor Committee and a  longtime advocate for young people in STEM, I take pride in seeing our  students adopt a love of math that will take them far in their careers  and their lives.                            ____________________
