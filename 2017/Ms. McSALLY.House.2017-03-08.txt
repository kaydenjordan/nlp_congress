 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Wyoming, and I  appreciate the hard work of Chairman Frelinghuysen and Chairman Granger  on this very important bill.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the FY17 Department of  Defense Appropriations bill, and I urge voting and adoption of this  bill.   I served 26 years in uniform, and I can say, firsthand, that  continuing resolutions are bad for our troops. It is urgent that we  pass this bill. One reason is that we are in a military readiness  crisis like I have not seen in my lifetime.   This bill provides over $215 billion for readiness, an increase of  $5.2 billion above the FY16 enacted budget. This increase includes  funding for flight time for our pilots, maintenance for our aircraft,  and base operations, among other things. It also provides more than  $6.8 billion for procurement of aircraft, ships, and helicopters for  our troops.   The bill fully funds the mighty A-10 Warthog, and it has continued  funding for upgrades for this critical plane, extending its service  life by starting the re-winging of the remaining 110 aircraft in the  fleet. It also increases funding to maintain our asymmetric electronic  warfare advantage, developed and tested at Fort Huachuca, in my  district.   Finally, it provides funding for important missile programs, from  air-to-air missiles to missile defense.   Our troops are counting on us. Let's stop the bickering, and let's  pass this bill.
