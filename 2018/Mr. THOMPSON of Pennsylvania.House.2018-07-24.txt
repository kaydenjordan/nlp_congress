 Mr. Speaker, tomorrow the House  Education and the Workforce Committee will host innovators from across  the country for the bipartisan Innovation Forum and Showcase. The  Innovation Forum will begin at 10 a.m. in room 2175 of the Rayburn  House Office Building. Five panels of innovators will speak and answer  questions from committee members about their work. From 10 a.m. to 1  p.m., members of the public are invited to tour the Innovation Showcase  in the Rayburn foyer, where the innovators will be available to share  information about their work.   As a senior member of the committee, I am so proud of the bipartisan  Innovation Forum and Showcase. This event will certainly highlight  hardworking American innovators from all walks of life. Tomorrow, there  will be 24 innovators who have traveled to  [[Page H7090]]  Washington to discuss how they run career and technical education and  workforce development programs in their communities.   I am incredibly honored to have Joe Luther, from the Central  Pennsylvania Institute of Science and Technology located in Pleasant  Gap, Centre County, Pennsylvania, be there. Mr. Luther is the  horticulture and landscaping instructor at CPI. He is well loved by his  students and has received numerous accolades for his performance in the  classroom.   In 2014, Mr. Luther was named the ACTE New Career and Technical  Education Teacher of the Year for Pennsylvania. In December, he was  awarded the National Career and Technical Education Teacher of the Year  from NOCTI, which is presented annually to recognize career and  technical education teachers for their outstanding service.   I visited Mr. Luther in his classroom at CPI and out in the  community, where his students routinely work on projects or participate  in competitions. In January, Mr. Luther's landscaping students secured  their fourth consecutive first place win at the Pennsylvania Farm Show  as a part of the agricultural education landscape exhibits.   Mr. Speaker, the Pennsylvania Farm Show is the Nation's largest  indoor agriculture event, and the CPI students beat a total of seven  other schools to take the top prize for their exhibit. I know these  students are talented, and it is their teacher, Mr. Luther, who truly  inspires them to reach great heights. Through his hands-on instruction,  Mr. Luther affords students in his classroom the ability to design,  build, and maintain their landscaping projects. He lets them interact  with customers and discuss real transactions. He brings real-life  scenarios into the classroom at every opportunity to show students what  their futures can be like in the workforce.   I look forward to having Mr. Luther here in Washington for tomorrow's  Innovation Forum and Showcase. I know that, because of dedicated  teachers like him, scores of students will be set on a path to success  in life through career and technical education programs.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to all the innovators who will participate  tomorrow to share with Congress and the public how they are addressing  the Nation's education and workforce development challenges. As co- chair of the bipartisan House Career and Technical Education Caucus and  a consistent advocate for high-quality career and technical education,  I know these programs not only shape the future of our Nation's youth,  but will be the foundation for a new era of economic growth in the  United States. And the future looks bright.   Mr. Speaker, on a related note, I was thankful to the Senate last  evening, which passed my legislation which already passed out of this  body almost a year ago, H.R. 2353, the Strengthening Career and  Technical Education for the 21st Century Act. I look forward to ironing  out just a few minor differences, some good refinements that the Senate  made, and we will see about getting that to the President's desk, quite  frankly, providing greater access to more effective, skills-based  education for all Americans seeking the American Dream of opportunity.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, today at 12:30, the U.S.  Institute of Peace will offer an educational briefing for Members and  staff on the Institute's role in reducing violent conflict abroad. As a  strong supporter of the U.S. Institute of Peace, I am pleased to  welcome President Nancy Lindborg to the Hill today. She will explain  the history and relevance of the Institute's congressional mission and  how it helps our country find nonviolent solutions to international  conflicts.   President Lindborg will provide an update on the Institute's programs  and how its training and educational functions are building long-term  capacities for nonviolent conflict resolution that help countries solve  their own problems. She will be joined by colleagues, who will provide  policy updates and explain how the Institute's efforts are having an  impact in both Africa and the Middle East.   In 1984, the U.S. Institute of Peace was created by Congress as an  independent, nonpartisan institute to prevent, mitigate, and resolve  violent international conflict.   Mr. Speaker, conflict management and resolution skills are essential  in today's volatile international security environment, and I am  grateful for the Institute's work.                            ____________________
