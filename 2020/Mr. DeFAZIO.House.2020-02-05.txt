 Mr. Speaker, last night in this Chamber, we heard a  bloviating, self-congratulatory speech full of exaggerations, half- truths, and outright falsehoods. The President pretended to have  addressed, or was going to address, concerns of the American people.   He said he is taking care of prescription drugs. Yeah. Really. They  haven't done a damn thing. We sent a bill to the Senate and it is  sitting there.   Second, he said, oh, we are going to protect preexisting conditions.  Funny thing, his Attorney General is in court arguing that those  preexisting conditions should no longer be protected. But, hey, what  the heck.   And then he did devote one sentence--one sentence--to infrastructure.  What happened to the $2 trillion plan he campaigned on and carries on  about all the time? Well, so far, he has only proposed cuts.   But one issue of vital concern to the American people that is the  focus this week--this is National Gun Violence Survivors Week--did not  receive a single mention by the President, despite the fact that  several commonsense bipartisan reforms and programs have passed this  House and have received no action in the Senate in a year.   H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Comprehensive Background Checks Act, passed on  February 27. No action in the Senate.   The Enhanced Background Checks Act passed February 28--bipartisan.  Again, no action in the Senate.   Every year, guns are sold to people who aren't supposed to have  them--including at that horrible church shooting a couple of years  ago--because of a mandate that, if there is confusion over a background  check, they have to get the gun within 3 days.   Over the last 10 years, 35,000 guns, because of that provision, were  sold to people who were not qualified under Federal law to have the  guns. And guess what. Then the Feds contact the FBI who screwed up the  background check, contacts the local law enforcement and says, ``Hey,  go get the gun  [[Page H768]]  from that felon,'' endangering our local law enforcement.   This would plug that loophole.   The Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization passed April 4. No  action in the Senate. And, for the first time in 20 years, we are going  to do some research on gun violence. There are other bills we should be  doing.    In my State, we have adopted red flag laws. And over here, they say,  well, we can't have red flag laws for abusers because of their  constitutional rights.   Well, we have set it up in a way that we have had 160 petitions for  red flag restrictions. Most of them--actually, the majority--were for  people at risk of suicide; and then a minority were for abusive  relationships, and 32 of those were denied by a judge.   Due process was followed, but lives were saved. But, no, we can't  take that.   Bump stocks, we banned fully automatic weapons decades ago. Bump  stocks, essentially, turn a semiautomatic into a very inaccurate,  nearly full automatic in terms of ready to fire. But if you are  shooting at a stadium full of people, it doesn't matter how inaccurate  it is; you are going to hit a lot of people.   We can't even bring up legislation--or, well, the Republicans won't  support legislation to ban bump stocks, hate crimes legislation, the  list goes on.   Just one other quick issue. You can go online to armslist.com, and if  you are not eligible to buy a gun, you can get one. It is very evident  that, in study after study done, that many of the people selling guns  on armslist.com are felons and not allowed to own firearms, and they  will sell to other felons. It will say: No background check necessary.  Will cross State lines--all sorts of things like that.   All those things need to be banned. Those are commonsense gun  violence reforms.   And, in this week, just, really, this week, National Gun Violence  Survivors Week, let's do something to end the bloodshed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman.   Mr. Speaker, in a Christmas Eve bill with no legislative  consideration, an otherwise noncontroversial bill, a provision was  stuck in to say that the Postal Service should prefund 75 years of  health benefits for retirees.   Now, think about that. That means people who have not yet been born,  who have not yet gone to work for the Postal Service for a career and  then might retire, we are paying for their healthcare now. Name one  other entity in the United States of America, corporate or government,  that does anything like this. It is nuts. And it is a piggybank.   The money isn't being put into a trust fund to pay for their health  insurance. It is going into the maw of the Treasury. Who knows where it  goes. It maybe makes the debt look a little smaller. That was why  President Bush pushed for it. But it is accounting for the majority of  the losses at the Postal Service.                                time  1515    So, yes, this will help relieve pressure on the Postal Service and on  rates. And I think there are a lot of Americans who would like not to  see the postal rates keep going up.   Now, there are 300 bipartisan cosponsors. There aren't too many  things around here these days like that because I think many people  realize this doesn't make much sense.   And the Postal Service is a critical service. It is not a government- run business to make a profit. It is the U.S. Postal Service.   Star routes don't make money. If you represent a rural area, you  can't make money out there. FedEx and UPS won't go out there. They get  the Postal Service to take the stuff out there. If we dismantle the  Postal Service, then everybody in rural America is out of luck.   And there are a whole heck of a lot of other people who are dependent  upon this: newspapers, rural newspapers, small businesses.   Many years ago, when I first started working on this, I posted  something on the website: Tell me if you need the Postal Service.   People from all the small towns all around my very large district  said: I sell on eBay. That is how I make a living out here in Powers,  Oregon, or in  [[Page H812]]  other little places around my district. I couldn't afford UPS or FedEx.  I get the one package price.   So this is critical.   And, every day, hundreds of thousands of our veterans get their drugs  delivered by the United States Postal Service, many of them in rural  areas, hard to serve, and, sure as heck, hard for them to get to the VA  hospital or get into town.   So we need to stop burdening the Postal Service with something that  makes no sense. Are there other things that need to be reformed? Yes.   But once we take this $5 billion a year burden off them--they have  already put $50 billion into a theoretical account to pay for  healthcare for future postal employees who haven't been born yet, who  might work there, might retire some day, and might get health benefits.  That is more than enough.   And, by the way, this doesn't score in any way. So that is why we  have 300 bipartisan sponsors.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues at long last to undo this  stupidity.
