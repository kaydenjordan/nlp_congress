 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Nadler and Ranking  Member Collins for moving this bill through the Judiciary Committee.  Similarly, I thank all the committee members for supporting the bill on  a unanimous voice vote.   This legislation has the bipartisan and bicameral support of the  Arizona delegation.   This simple, commonsense legislation allows current Federal judges to  sit in existing courthouses or magistrates' chambers in Yuma and  Flagstaff, two rapidly growing communities where constituents do not  have full access to the Federal judicial system.   By allowing existing judges to sit in Yuma and Flagstaff, residents  of rural Arizona will not have to travel the significant distances they  currently do to Phoenix or Tucson to be heard by a judge.   This will mean that police officers can spend more time on patrol and  that individuals won't have to travel to serve on juries or participate  in matters that require a judge.                                time  1530    Easier access to courthouses will help Tribal nations that are under  significant Federal jurisdiction. This will only further support Tribal  sovereignty.   This legislation is a simple way to improve life for residents of  rural America, and I encourage all of my colleagues to support H.R.  1569.
