 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R.  3003, the Promoting United States Wireless Leadership Act of 2021.   The policy choices of today will have lasting effects on the global  5G technology development of tomorrow.   This bipartisan bill, which I co-led with my fellow 5G Caucus co- chairs, Representatives Walberg, Kuster, and Johnson, would solidify  United States leadership in 5G technology by encouraging interagency  coordination, technical assistance, and stakeholder participation in  international standard setting bodies.   We must take concrete steps to lower barriers to entry for U.S.  companies and promote American competitiveness in this space.   This legislation will ensure the United States remains at the  forefront of innovation in this evolving frontier by playing a central  role in setting international wireless standards in emerging  technologies. This approach has dramatic ramifications for our global  competitiveness, 5G deployment, and our national security.   I strongly urge all my colleagues to support this important bill.
