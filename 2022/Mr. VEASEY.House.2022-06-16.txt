 Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life of  Mike Smith, who was truly a pillar in the Fort Worth community. At 78  years old, Mike was a loving husband, father, grandfather, and was  known as the unofficial mayor of Magnolia Avenue in Fort Worth.   Throughout his 55-year tenure, Mike baked over half a million pies,  which put his restaurant, the Paris Coffee Shop, on the map. His pies  were listed in USA Today, Bon Appetit magazine, and really known all  around the world, but what really made Mike so special was the warmth  and love that he showed everyone that walked into his coffee shop.   It didn't matter if you were from Rivercrest or Riverside. It didn't  matter if you were from Whitehall Street in Eastwood in Fort Worth or  if you were from Westover Hills, Mike made everyone feel welcome any  time you came into the Paris Coffee Shop. His firm handshake, his hugs,  his conversations were just absolutely unforgettable, and he will be  deeply missed.   Just in addition to everything that he has done for the food  community, the restaurant community in Fort Worth, we send prayers out  to his entire network of friends and family.                            ____________________
