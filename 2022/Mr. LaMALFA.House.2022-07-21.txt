 Madam Speaker, while President Biden is fist-bumping  with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Americans are still facing  record-high prices at the gas pump.   When he was campaigning, President Biden claimed he would crack down  on Saudi leaders, and then he turns and shares a warm greeting with one  before begging them to sell us their oil.   President Biden showed weakness on the world stage, and he showed the  American people he cares more about keeping up friendly appearances  with OPEC than the well-being of the American people.   Let's be clear: The Biden administration halted the Keystone XL  pipeline on day one and destroyed 11,000 American jobs to line the  pockets of OPEC oligarchs.   Why else would President Biden be begging Saudi Arabia and other OPEC  countries to increase oil production when producers and refiners right  here on U.S. soil have struggled for months thanks to the Green New  Deal agenda?   Whatever happened to making America self-sufficient in energy? We are  a country that can depend on ourselves for our energy, but the Biden  administration is continuously doing whatever they can to block this  from happening.   Instead of traveling 8,000 miles across the ocean to beg for oil from  others, he should continue the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline  and the rest of our American infrastructure, support American workers,  and maybe fist-bump them for a change.                            ____________________
