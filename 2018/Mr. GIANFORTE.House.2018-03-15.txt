 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the  University of Montana men's basketball team for an outstanding season  and to wish them success in the 2018 NCAA Tournament.   The Grizzlies were regular season champions of the Big Sky  Conference, going 16 to 2 in conference play.   Last weekend, the squad won the Big Sky Tournament.   They begin their journey in the NCAA Tournament tonight with a first- round game in Wichita, Kansas.   The Grizzlies will be strong contenders. Their defense is relentless,  leading the Big Sky Conference this year. Every player on the floor  contributes to their offense. They represent the spirit of Montana.   Congratulations also to Montana head coach Travis DeCuire, who was  named Coach of the Year in the Big Sky Conference. In his fourth season  at the helm, he guided the Grizzlies to a 26-7 record and their first  NCAA Tournament appearance since 2013.   I know the folks in the Treasure State will join me in saying: ``Up  With Montana.''                            ____________________
