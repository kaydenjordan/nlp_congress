 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in acknowledgment of Long  Island's own David Friedman, former U.S. Ambassador to Israel.   In a few days, there will be a dedication ceremony to rename a local  street in his honor, but I would be remiss if I did not state for the  Record Ambassador Friedman's tremendous accomplishments in support of  our ally, Israel, during his tenure.   Whether it be countering the anti-Semitic Boycott, Divestment and  Sanctions campaign against Israel or recognizing Israel's sovereignty  over the Golan Heights, he has been a leading example on how best to  represent our Nation abroad.   Most notable, of course, was his leadership in advancing the Abraham  Accords, the greatest development in normalized relations between  Israel and its Arab neighbors in over 40 years, and the movement of the  U.S. embassy to its rightful and lawful place, Jerusalem.   I implore my colleagues to stand with me in a commitment to affirming  and building upon the advancements that Ambassador Friedman made to  strengthen U.S.-Israeli relations, and I congratulate him once again on  his achievements.                            ____________________
