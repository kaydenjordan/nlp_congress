 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak on the ongoing  crisis at our southern border.   Recently, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas stated that  the border is secure. No one, including the Border Patrol agents he is  tasked with leading, believes that assertion.   The truth is, in the last month, border agents reported over 70,000  apprehensions at the southern border, the highest month on record.   Now, you may ask yourself: Why is a Member of Congress from Idaho  concerned about what is happening 700 miles away?   The truth is, the Biden administration's dereliction of duty at the  border has consequences for millions of Americans across the country,  including my constituents in Idaho.   Idaho Sheriff Kieran Donahue raised the alarm on how our porous  border and drug cartels are creating the fentanyl crisis in so many  communities, warning that due to these policies, fentanyl is at  everyone's doorstep.   In 26 days, Republicans will take control of this Chamber, and the  Biden administration should be prepared to take account for their  complete failure to address this border crisis.                            ____________________
