 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman DeLauro for  her persistent leadership for so many years, as well as Chairman Scott  and the Speaker.   We must put an end to the wage gap and pay discrimination. Let me  tell you, as you have heard, the wage gap for women of color is so much  worse.   I am reminded today of our heroine, Fannie Lou Hamer. She said, ``I  am sick and tired of being sick and tired.''   Black women earn 63 cents, indigenous women earn 60 cents, Latinas  earn 55 cents, White women earn 82 cents, and AAPI women are paid as  little as 52 cents on every dollar paid to the White man. That is  outrageous.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the Equal Pay  Today! campaign urging Members to support the bill.                                                 Equal Pay Today,                                                     April 14, 2021.      Re Pass the Paycheck Fairness Act (H.R. 7) and vote no on           harmful amendments.         Dear Representative(s): As the House votes on the Paycheck       Fairness Act (H.R. 7), we strongly urge you to pass the       Paycheck Fairness Act, H.R. 7, without amendments that would       limit its scope or undermine its critical protections.        As members of the Equal Pay Today Campaign, we represent a       broad coalition consisting of both national and state based       organizations from all across the country, that are dedicated       to challenging the legal, policy, and cultural barriers at       the local, state, and national level that keep women from       being paid equally. Launched on the 50th anniversary of the       signing of the federal Equal Pay Act, we are committed to       fighting and advocating for legislation that will ultimately       close the gender wage gap.        With our nation now entering into year two of this global       pandemic, we can no longer ignore the disparities that have       existed long before our nation's shutdown, and  [[Page H1812]]       despite federal and state equal pay laws, the gender pay gap       persists, and earnings lost to these gaps are widened due to       the financial impacts of the pandemic, with a heavier burden       bared by women of color and the families and communities who       depend on them and their income.        Women are increasingly becoming the primary or co-      breadwinner in their families, with Black mothers being far       more likely than other mothers to be the primary or sole       breadwinners for their families and more than half of Latina       mothers being the breadwinner in families with children under       18. Women across this country, working full-time, year-round,       are typically being paid only .82 cents for every dollar paid       out to men, adding up to a loss of more than $400,000 dollars       over a lifetime. And the wage gap gets even wider as race is       factored in. Black women working full time, year round       typically make only .63 cents, Native American women only .60       cents, and Latinas only .55 cents, for every dollar paid to       their white, non-Hispanic male counterparts. Latinas stand to       lose more than $1 million over a 40-year career due to the       wage gap, and while Asian American and Pacific Islander       (AAPI) women make .85 cents for every dollar paid to white,       non-Hispanic men, many AAPI communities experience       drastically wider pay gaps. And even when controlling for       factors, such as education and experience, the pay gaps still       persist, start early in women's careers and contribute to a       wealth gap that follows them throughout their lifetimes.        These pay gaps can be addressed and rectified through       legislation that offers workers the legal tools and       safeguards needed to challenge discrimination. The Paycheck       Fairness Act, which has already been passed by the House of       Representatives three times before and most recently by the       116th Congress, would offer the much needed updates to the       Equal Pay Act of 1963 by making these tools available while       also providing new ones, that would help to combat and       challenge discrimination and the pay gap.        The Paycheck Fairness Act updates and strengthens the Equal       Pay Act of 1963 to ensure that it provides robust protection       against sex-based pay discrimination. Among other provisions,       this comprehensive bill:        ends secrecy around pay by barring retaliation against       workers who voluntarily discuss or disclose their wages, and       requiring employers to report pay data to the EEOC        prohibits employers from relying on salary history in       determining future pay, so that pay discrimination does not       follow women from job to job        closes loopholes that have allowed employers to pay women       less than men for the same work without any important       business justification related to the job        ensures women can receive the same robust remedies for sex-      based pay discrimination that are currently available to       those subjected to discrimination based on race and ethnicity        provides much needed training and technical assistance, as       well as data collection and research        This past year has undoubtedly been a challenging one. The       pandemic has shone a light on how the work performed by       women, specifically Black and brown women, has continuously       been undervalued, underpaid, and gone unnoticed. We cannot       continue to use the word ``essential'' to describe the nature       of this work, if there is no commitment to ensuring that all       women can work with safety and with dignity, and the first       step to making this happen, starts with pay equity, and the       catalyst for this would be the passing of the Paycheck       Fairness Act.        We urge you to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act without       harmful amendments that weaken its critical protections.        Thank you for your time and consideration.            Sincerely,                                                   Equal Pay Today.     Mr. Speaker, let me finally say: Remember,  because of this discrimination, women's Social Security benefits during  their senior years are much lower than men. This injustice follows  women throughout their lives. This issue impacts women, regardless of  industry, education level or political party. It is past time--it is so  past time for Congress to take action on this.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
