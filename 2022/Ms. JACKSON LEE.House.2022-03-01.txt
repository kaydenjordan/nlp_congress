 Madam Speaker, I rise with a very heavy heart and an  overwhelming sense of sadness, anguish, and anger that should, however,  be utilized to save lives.   I traveled with the Organization of Security and Cooperation in  Europe with my colleagues, Congressmen Cohen, Hudson, Wilson, Aderholt,  and Veasey. We started out, most of us, on Sunday with the intent to go  into the Ukraine region, and we did, all with optimism that this war  would not be, that we could engage in discussions with parliamentarians  and heads of state and that Putin would listen to reason of the 21st  century.   Upon arriving, we unfortunately heard the distorted, confused, and  absolutely rejected message of the Soviet Union, and how the history  suggests that countries like Ukraine were not independent, they were  simply part of the old Soviet Union.   Madam Speaker, you are aware of the fact that generations now living  in democratic countries like Lithuania have no knowledge of the old  Soviet Union. Congratulations to leaders like Gorbachev and Yeltsin who  believed that their duty was to bring Russia into the 21st century.   We remember the words of Ronald Reagan: Mr. Gorbachev, tear down that  wall. How in the world can Putin now come to represent that he, riding  in on a fancy horse, maybe even shirtless, is going to now dominate  violently, bringing these countries to their knees and for them to  reject what they have come to love, and that is democracy?   We continued in discussions--the Lithuanian Prime Minister, the  Lithuanian President, the Lithuanian Foreign Minister, and many  others--that country, right in the eye of the storm, right in the  potential of being one of those victims, yet Lithuania is a member of  NATO protected by Article 5. But we thought because of their fears and  their concerns, because of their sensitivity of the reckless and  uncontrolled posture of Putin, who knows where he would go, Estonia,  Latvia, Moldova, countries that are standing separately.   He has already, as we were fully briefed, dominated and taken over-- it doesn't exist. I want the President of Belarus to understand that. I  hope that he could stand up, but there were already 30,000 to 40,000  Russia troops in his country bordering on Lithuania.                                time  1030    Even with that, we wanted to, as we have heard, give peace a chance  and continue to press for peace even to the point where we went to the  meeting where Finland, Sweden, France, Great Britain, Russia, and  Ukraine were all there. We went to sit down at the peace table to try  and argue. We arrived on Wednesday, and as everyone knows, in the late  hours, early morning, from Wednesday to Thursday, Putin designed his  own war. No vote by the Russian people. He designed a purposeless,  senseless, and immoral war.   I began to articulate how we should move quickly, financial sanctions  that should immediately bring them to their knees, the SWIFT account  being denied. On Friday and Saturday I asked for that. But I think the  real issue is they should be brought to their knees. And then last  Saturday I said that he should be charged as a war criminal. I am glad  that the world criminal court, The Hague, is now opening an  investigation on this desperate terrorizer, this killer.   We cannot tolerate this kind of behavior. He indicated to the world  that this was an operational war: I am going to be selective, I am not  going after civilians.   Madam Speaker, to the Nation and to the world: this is a face of a  destroyed building reminiscent of World War II when civilian places  were bombed and when thousands were lost. There is a person standing  here. And this is dead children.   Mr. Putin is a killer and a terrorist. And these are terrorists that  are in Ukraine. We ask the world to continue to stand united, NATO and  others, to be able to bring Putin to his needs financially and  economically and as well on the world stage. He should be tried as a  criminal. We need this war to end in a cease-fire.   Madam Speaker, President Zelensky said: We are here.   We stand with him. Ukraine is here. Glory to Ukraine.                            ____________________
