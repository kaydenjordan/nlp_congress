 Mr. Speaker, I have a constituent named Martha. She goes by  Marty.   Marty was studying to earn her bachelor's degree in nursing at  Pacific Lutheran University when she was diagnosed with rectal cancer.  Not good.   Without medical insurance, as we all know, that is a certain death  sentence. There is no other way about it. But it wasn't for Marty.  Frankly, less than a year before she had finally found affordable  healthcare insurance for herself through the Washington State Health  Benefit Exchange.   Every family, every person in this Chamber, has been affected by it.  Cancer has a way of ripping bodies apart, ripping families apart, and  ripping communities apart.   It didn't rip Marty apart. Through her strength, courage, and health  insurance, she persevered. She has conviction that God used her  community of friends and her family and the Affordable Care Act to help  her through treatment and into recovery.   Not only could Marty share that story with me back in 2015, but she  graduated cum laude from PLU in nursing just this last December. I am  sharing her remarkable story with you--it could be replicated millions  of times--to urge you to set aside and rise above partisan politics and  not repeal the lifesaving Affordable Care Act. I ask you to do this not  just for the sake of Marty, but because there, my friends, but for the  grace of God, go each and every one of us.                            ____________________
