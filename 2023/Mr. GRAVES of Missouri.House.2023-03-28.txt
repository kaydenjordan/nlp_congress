 Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs  Act, which will unlock United States energy potential, benefiting  Missourians and Americans nationwide.   Broadly speaking, this bill is important for so many reasons, from  increasing domestic energy production to encouraging the production of  critical minerals to modernizing the NEPA process for energy and other  infrastructure projects. This bill does exactly what the title says.   Division C of the bill was produced by the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee, and it focuses on streamlining and clarifying  the scope of section 401 of the Clean Water Act to prevent its  continued abuse in blocking energy infrastructure projects.   Many projects that require water quality certifications under section  401 are critical to our Nation's energy production, such as natural gas  pipelines, LNG, and coal export terminals.   Division C of the bill makes clear that States cannot block important  energy projects on grounds outside of the Clean Water Act quality  standards, consistent with the intent of the original law.   Last month, H.R. 1152, which is encompassed within division C, was  marked up and passed out of the Transportation and Infrastructure  Committee.                                time  1745    As included in H.R. 1, division C is incredibly important to lowering  energy costs and boosting energy production while still ensuring water  quality.   Mr. Chair, I thank two of my subcommittee chairmen,   David Rouzer  and Garret Graves, for their leadership in sponsoring this piece of  legislation.   Mr. Chair, I would urge support of the bill. By passing H.R. 1, the  House would support moving critical energy projects forward and support  lowering costs for Americans through greater energy independence.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from North Carolina (Mr. Edwards), a member of the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman  from Tennessee (Mr. Burchett), a member of the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Oregon (Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer), who is a member of the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.   Mrs. CHAVEZ-DeREMER. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the  Lower Energy Costs Act, a comprehensive and commonsense proposal that  would lower costs for Oregon families by unleashing American energy.   The Lower Energy Costs Act paves the way for projects that would  directly benefit Oregon.   H.R. 1 would prevent the environmental permitting process for  critical minerals, making it more efficient for Oregon businesses to  manufacture scarce and valuable products like semiconductors.   From the smartphone in your pocket, Mr. Chairman, to batteries needed  for storing renewable energy, it is unacceptable that the United States  is currently so reliant on China for critical products. The pragmatic  permitting changes in this bill protect our national security by  reducing our reliance on the Chinese Communist Party.   These changes also create opportunities for public-private  partnerships on energy construction projects.   Instead of doing business with China, H.R. 1 presents an opportunity  for my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support good-paying  union jobs right here at home.   The Lower Energy Costs Act would streamline initiatives like the  Jordan Cove energy project, which would have been a $10 billion  investment in a natural gas project in Oregon.   As we work toward a carbon-neutral future, we must also recognize  that the United States produces cleaner energy than any other country,  including natural gas. A Department of Energy report found that natural  gas produced in America is 40 percent cleaner than natural gas produced  in Russia.   Energy prices and the cost of living have remained elevated for far  too long.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1, which would  help restore our energy independence, support jobs, and lower costs for  hardworking families.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves), who is the chairman of the  Aviation Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 5 minutes  to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Chairman, one of the things I like to do in the Capitol is learn  about the individuals who came before us and the wisdom and the  knowledge that they possessed.     Daniel Webster served in the U.S. House of Representatives from  1823-1827. He is considered one of the great orators in the U.S. House.  He actually also served in the other Chamber. A very good quote of his  went on to say, ``Let us develope the resources of our land, call forth  our powers, build up its institutions, promote all its great interests,  and see whether we also, in our day and generation, may not perform  something worthy to be remembered.''   That individual is the only individual that is quoted here in this  Chamber,   Daniel Webster, right up there on the wall above the dais.  That first part is what says it all, ``Let us develope the resources of  our land.'' That is exactly what we are trying to do so that we can be  energy dependent on ourselves.   Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Rouzer) will  manage the remainder of the time for the majority.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my  time.
