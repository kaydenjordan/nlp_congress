 Madam Speaker, yesterday, Jessica  Holdman with The Post and Courier reported that wages in South Carolina  rose faster than expected this year and will continue to rise. I was  alerted to this by Gary David and Christopher Thompson on WVOC by  iHeartRadio. I am grateful for President Donald Trump's actions to  increase wages by reducing taxes and regulations.   According to Doug Woodward, economist with the University of South  Carolina's Darla Moore School of Business, this is the best job market  we have seen in a generation. USC economist Joey Von Nessen says,  ``workers are in high demand right now, and we are seeing strong wage  growth as a result. This includes wage growth for workers across the  pay scale, with those on the lower end benefiting the most.''   By creating jobs, raising wages, and consistently working to promote  opportunities, President Trump is continuing his record of keeping his  promises. I am grateful that President Trump is focused to work for  American families and jobs, despite the failed Russian hoax and today  the impeachment hoax.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
