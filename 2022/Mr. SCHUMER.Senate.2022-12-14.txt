 Mr. President, first, I understand that there is a bill  at the desk that is due for a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceedings.    Mr. President, last night, Chairman Leahy, Ranking  Member Shelby, and Chairman DeLauro announced that the appropriators  have agreed to a framework for an omnibus agreement that will fully  fund the Federal Government in fiscal year 2023. This is welcome and  important news. Congress now has a roadmap for funding the government  before the conclusion of the 117th Congress--something the large  majority of us want to see. We still have a long way to go, but a  framework is a big step in the right direction.   A yearlong omnibus is by far the best option we have for making sure  our kids, our senior citizens, our veterans, our small businesses, our  military members, our defense, and all of the families who benefit from  this don't  [[Page S7154]]  see vital government services lapse or shrink. It means we can fully  implement the investments secured. We fought so hard for the PACT Act;  we have to fund it. We fought so hard for the CHIPS and Science Act; we  have to fund it. A CR will not fund these bills, but an omnibus  agreement will. And they were all bipartisan, with large support from  both sides of the aisle.   An omnibus bill is also a balanced approach because it will contain  wins that both sides want to see, like the Electoral Count Act and  funding for our friends in Ukraine. If we can come to an agreement on  an omnibus, I am optimistic that these bills, which are so important to  Democrats and Republicans alike--the ECA and funding for Ukraine--can  become law.   But before we pass a funding bill, we also must ensure the government  doesn't first shut down, so we are going to have to pass a 1-week  continuing resolution ASAP. The House is set to act on a 1-week CR as  soon as tonight, and when that bill comes to the Senate, we should be  ready to act quickly, as soon as tomorrow if we can.   The appropriations process, of course, is not over. So the  responsible and prudent thing to do right now is to pass a 1-week CR  quickly, without the unwelcome brouhaha that has provoked shutdowns in  the past.   And, remember, as we go through this appropriations process, the  experiences of the last decades show that those who risk shutdowns in  order to make political points always lose in the end.                                 Nancy Pelosi    Mr. President, now, on Speaker Pelosi, later this afternoon, I will  have the honor--the bittersweet honor--of joining with congressional  leaders, past and present, to unveil the official portrait of my dear  friend and a great leader, Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Every year, millions  come to the Capitol to learn about our democracy and to put a face to  the names of history. They walk these halls and see the portraits of  Speakers from ages past--Sam Rayburn, Tip O'Neill, and so many others.  But after today--after today--the faces of those male leaders will  forever be joined by Madam Speaker.   So today is a happy day to celebrate an amazing public servant who  had an amazing career. But it is also a chance to say thank you to a  dear friend and a beloved colleague.   Leader to leader, I will always admire Speaker Pelosi for an  important quality that has set her apart: She always keeps her caucus  united behind a common goal. She keeps repeating over and over again,  and has for 20 years: Our unity is our strength. That is what she  always has said. I have and will continue to repeat the same to my  caucus.   I yield the floor.                      Recognition of the Minority Leader     Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.  [[Page S7185]]     Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum calls for the cloture motions filed today, December  14, be waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to  be determined by the majority leader in consultation with the  Republican leader, the Senate proceed to executive session to consider  calendar No. 861, Musetta Tia Johnson, of Virginia, to be a Judge of  the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces for a term of  fifteen years to expire on the date prescribed by law; that there be 10  minutes for debate equally divided in the usual form on the nomination;  that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote on the  nomination without intervening action or debate; that if confirmed, the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that  any statements related to the nomination be printed in the Record, and  that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action and  the Senate resume legislative session.    Mr. President, I ask that the Chair lay before the  Senate the message to accompany S. 3846.   The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message  from the House of Representatives:         Resolved, That the bill from the Senate (S. 3846) entitled       ``An Act to reauthorize the Justice and Mental Health       Collaboration Program, and for other purposes'', do pass with       an amendment.

In keeping with the Senate's practice under its rules, this  resolution would authorize the Secretary and the Sergeant at Arms to  provide these personnel records to the Homeland Security Department for  use in this matter.

Both the Secretary and the Sergeant at Arms would like to       cooperate with these  [[Page S7186]]       records requests of the Homeland Security Department.        In accordance with Senate Rule XI and the Senate's       practice, the accompanying resolution would provide the       Secretary and the Sergeant at Arms with authority to provide       these personnel records to the Homeland Security Department.
