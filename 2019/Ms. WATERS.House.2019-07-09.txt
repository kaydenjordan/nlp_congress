 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1988) to clarify seasoning requirements for certain  refinanced mortgage loans, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1988         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Affordable       Mortgages for Veterans Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. SEASONING REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTAIN REFINANCED                     MORTGAGE LOANS.         (a) Ginnie Mae.--Paragraph (1) of section 306(g) of the       National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1721(g)(1)) is amended by       striking the second sentence (as added by section 309(b) of       Public Law 115-174).        (b) Veterans Loans.--Section 3709 of title 38, United       States Code, is amended by striking subsection (c) and       inserting the following:        ``(c) Loan Seasoning.--Except as provided in subsection (d)       and notwithstanding section 3703 of this title or any other       provision of law, a loan to a veteran for a purpose specified       in section 3710 of this title that is a refinance may not be       guaranteed or insured under this chapter until the date that       is the later of--        ``(1) the date on which the borrower has made at least six       consecutive monthly payments on the loan being refinanced;       and        ``(2) the date that is 210 days after the first payment due       date of the loan being refinanced.''.        (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act may be       construed to restrict or otherwise modify the authorities of       the Government National Mortgage Association.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on  this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, last year, when Congress passed S. 2155, it included as  section 309 a bill sponsored by Senators Tillis and Warren titled  Protecting Veterans from Predatory Lending Act of 2018.   That provision put new requirements in place to protect veteran  borrowers from the aggressive and deceptive marketing practices of  lenders pushing mortgage refinance deals.   However, the drafting of this provision caused some unintended  consequences; specifically, an estimated 2,500 loans that were in full  compliance with all requirements at the time were later denied Ginnie  securitization simply because they were in the process of being  refinanced or securitized when the law became effective.   Senators Warren and Tillis weighed in with Ginnie Mae, stating that  it was not their intention to orphan those loans and have urged Ginnie  Mae to address the issue.   However, Ginnie believes legislation is needed to grandfather these  orphaned loans and address other administrative issues that have  resulted from the slight differences between the new requirements in S.  2155 and Ginnie's prior requirements.   That is why we are here today with the bill from the gentleman from  Georgia, H.R. 1988, which is a reasonable step to address what were  clearly unintended consequences of the previous legislation. I am  pleased to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Scott and Mr. Zeldin for introducing this  bill, urge Members to vote ``yes,'' and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr.   David Scott), a senior member of the  Committee on Financial Services and sponsor of H.R. 1988.    Mr. Speaker, I would inquire, through the Chair, if my  colleague has any remaining speakers on his side.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   H.R. 1988 will address some unintended administrative complications  that resulted from implementing laws that were put in place to help  protect veterans from unscrupulous lenders.   I thank Mr. Scott and Mr. Zeldin for working in a bipartisan manner  to bring H.R. 1988 before the House. I urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2515) to amend the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 to  amend the definition of whistleblower, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2515         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Whistleblower Protection       Reform Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. WHISTLEBLOWER.         Section 21F of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15       U.S.C. 78u-6) is amended--        (1) in subsection (a)(6)--        (A) by striking ``(6) Whistleblower.--The term'' and       inserting the following:        ``(6) Whistleblower.--        ``(A) In general.--The term''; and        (B) by adding the following new subparagraph at the end:        ``(B) Special rule.--Solely for the purposes of subsection       (h)(1), the term `whistleblower' shall also include any       individual who takes an action described in subsection       (h)(1)(A), or 2 or more individuals acting jointly who take       an action described in subsection (h)(1)(A).''; and        (2) in subsection (h)(1)(A)--        (A) in clause (ii), by striking ``or'' at the end;        (B) in clause (iii), by striking the period at the end and       inserting ``; or''; and        (C) by adding at the end the following:        ``(iv) in providing information regarding any conduct that       the whistleblower reasonably believes constitutes a violation       of any law, rule, or regulation subject to the jurisdiction       of the Commission to--         ``(I) a person with supervisory authority over the       whistleblower at the whistleblower's employer, where such       employer is an entity registered with or required to be       registered with the Commission, a self-regulatory       organization, or a State securities commission or office       performing like functions; or        ``(II) such other person working for the employer described       under subclause (I) who has the authority to investigate,       discover, or terminate misconduct.''.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank Representative Green, the chairman of the Subcommittee on  Oversight and Investigations, for working with the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Huizenga) to craft this timely piece of legislation to  ensure that all whistleblowers reporting suspected securities law  violations are protected from retaliation by their employers.   In the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress provided the Securities and Exchange  Commission the authority to reward whistleblowers who voluntarily  provide the SEC with original information that leads to a successful  enforcement action with monetary sanctions exceeding $1 million.                                time  1700    Realizing that these whistleblowers may be deterred by their  employers, Congress also required the SEC to issue regulations to  protect them from retaliatory efforts, such as firing or demotion; but  in 2018, the Supreme Court held that whistleblowers who report alleged  misconduct internally but not to the SEC are not protected by the  antiretaliation provisions of Dodd-Frank. This is not what Congress  intended. Indeed, requiring whistleblowers to race to the SEC in order  to be protected discourages them from reporting their suspicions to  their superiors.   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce highlighted the importance of internal  reporting in its 2010 letter to the SEC, stating: ``The experience of  the many companies with robust internal reporting programs, as well as  the empirical evidence, demonstrate that all stakeholders benefit when  those with knowledge of potential securities law violations report  internally, thus enabling management to promptly investigate and take  remedial action.''   By clarifying that whistleblowers who only report alleged misconduct  to the employers are also protected by the antiretaliation provisions  in the Dodd-Frank Act, this bill would encourage employees to  communicate potential securities law violations to their employers  without fear of being fired before they are able to report to the SEC.   Again, I thank Chairman Green and Mr. Huizenga for pushing this  important bill, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green), the chairman of the Subcommittee on  Oversight and Investigations and the sponsor of H.R. 2515.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, this is a very important measure that will increase  corporate accountability and help those companies committed to  ferreting out wrongdoing to take action without government involvement  and protects those workers who help them to do so.   I commend the gentleman from Texas and the gentleman from Michigan  for working in a bipartisan manner to bring this bill before the House.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  important piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2162) to require the Secretary of Housing and Urban  Development to discount FHA single-family mortgage insurance premium  payments for first-time homebuyers who complete a financial literacy  housing counseling program, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2162         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Housing Financial Literacy       Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. DISCOUNT ON MORTGAGE INSURANCE PREMIUM PAYMENTS FOR                     FIRST-TIME HOMEBUYERS WHO COMPLETE FINANCIAL                     LITERACY HOUSING COUNSELING PROGRAMS.         The second sentence of subparagraph (A) of section       203(c)(2) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C.       1709(c)(2)(A)) is amended--        (1) by inserting before the comma the following: ``and such       program is completed before the mortgagor has signed an       application for a mortgage to be insured under this title or       a sales agreement''; and        (2) by striking ``not exceed 2.75 percent of the amount of       the original insured principal obligation of the mortgage''       and inserting ``be 25 basis points lower than the premium       payment amount established by the Secretary under the first       sentence of this subparagraph''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 2162, the Housing Financial  Literacy Act, a bipartisan bill authored by Representative Beatty, the  chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Diversity and Inclusion, and  cosponsored by Representative Stivers. This bill will make  homeownership more affordable for FHA borrowers who complete a housing  counseling program from a HUD-approved housing counseling agency.   While HUD currently has the authority to provide premium discounts to  incentivize housing counseling, HUD is not taking advantage of this  opportunity to help borrowers and strengthen the FHA. Research has  consistently demonstrated that loans made to borrowers who have  received prepurchase counseling perform better than loans made to  comparable borrowers who did not receive prepurchase counseling.   And when borrowers avoid delinquencies, lenders save money, too. A  2013 study by Freddie Mac found that, when 90-day delinquencies were  lowered by 29 percent, lenders saved an average of $1,000 per loan.                                time  1715    So this bill would not only benefit consumers; it would also help  increase the financial health of FHA.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Beatty and Representative Stivers  for their work on this commonsense, data-driven bill, and I urge my  colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 2162.  [[Page H5279]]    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty), the chair of the Subcommittee  on Diversity and Inclusion and the sponsor of H.R. 2162.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman and gentleman from Ohio for  pushing this bill forward. This bill incentivizes financial literacy  that will help avoid delinquencies and may have an impact well beyond  the housing area.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting  this important piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 456) emphasizing the importance of grassroots  investor protection and the investor education missions of State and  Federal securities regulators, calling on the Securities and Exchange  Commission to collaborate with State securities regulators in the  protection of investors, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 456         Whereas State securities regulators are the original       pioneers of regulating the United States capital markets and       have protected investors during times of boom and bust, from       ticker tape to the block-chain;        Whereas State securities regulators founded the North       American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) as a       voluntary association in 1919, 8 years after the first       securities laws were enacted in Kansas in 1911;        Whereas NASAA's membership in 2019 includes securities       administrators in the 50 States, the District of Columbia,       Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Canada, and Mexico;        Whereas the fundamental mission of the State securities       regulators is protecting investors who transact in securities       and receive investment advice, and their jurisdiction extends       to a wide variety of issuers and intermediaries who offer and       sell securities to the public;        Whereas State securities regulators are leaders in civil       and administrative enforcement actions, as well as criminal       prosecutions of securities violators;        Whereas State securities regulators have led efforts       resulting in landmark settlements to stop unfair practices in       the securities industry, the return of billions of dollars to       harmed investors, and thousands of bad actors sitting in jail       as the result of their work in investigating and uncovering       fraud;        Whereas State securities regulators independently and       within the framework of NASAA have also devised innovative       ways for small companies to raise investment capital;        Whereas State securities regulators independently and       within the framework of NASAA conduct investor education       programs throughout the United States, providing important       information to main street Americans on investing for a       secure future and avoiding scams; and        Whereas State securities regulators are known for their       accessibility and accountability to the investing public and       have been willing to push the envelope when it comes to       protecting investors: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) emphasizes the longstanding role of State securities       regulators in maintaining investor protection and vibrant       capital markets in the United States;        (2) supports the efforts of State securities regulators to       educate investors throughout the United States;        (3) supports the efforts of State securities regulators to       promote responsible and efficient capital formation for the       benefit of small businesses and investors throughout the       United States;        (4) urges State securities regulators to continue working       independently and within the voluntary framework of NASAA to       protect and educate investors and promote capital formation;       and        (5) urges the Securities and Exchange Commission to       maintain and expand voluntary collaboration with State       securities regulators in the interest of the investing       public.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on  this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Representative Pressley and  Representative Huizenga for bringing H. Res. 456 to the floor, a  bipartisan resolution that highlights the importance of our State  securities regulators to protecting investors. This year commemorates  the 100th anniversary of the North American Securities Administrators  Association, the oldest international investor protection organization  with a membership consisting of 67 State, provincial, and territorial  securities regulators in the 50 States, the District of Columbia, the  U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Canada, and Mexico.   The primary mission of both State securities regulators and NASAA is  to protect and advocate for the protection of investors, especially the  most vulnerable investors, like our Nation's seniors, who may lack the  expertise, experience, and resources to protect their own interests.   These grassroots regulators are often the first line of defense  against investment fraud and often respond to emerging frauds and  investment scams before they are detected at the Federal level.   In 2017 alone, State securities regulators conducted nearly 4,790  investigations, leading to more than 2,100 enforcement actions,  including 255 criminal prosecutions. These actions have  [[Page H5281]]  resulted in approximately $486 million in restitution for harmed  investors, nearly $79 million in fines and/or penalties, and 1,985  years in incarceration or probation being ordered.   In addition, in 2017, NASAA's U.S. member jurisdictions reported  bringing formal enforcement actions involving more than 1,100 senior  victims, illustrating their unwavering commitment to protecting senior  investors.   NASAA also engages and collaborates with Congress to promote Federal  laws to improve protections for senior investors. For example, in 2018,  we worked with NASAA to pass the Senior Safe Act, which was inspired by  a training program developed by NASAA in partnership with the Maine  Council for Elder Abuse Prevention. The Senior Safe Act addresses  barriers that financial professionals face in reporting suspected  senior financial exploitation or abuse to authorities.   NASAA also collaborated with us on the Senior Security Act, which  passed the House with broad, bipartisan support in April. That bill  would, among other things, require the SEC to work across divisions and  with the State securities regulators to ensure that seniors are not  subject to financial exploitation.   I strongly support our State securities regulators, and I urge my  colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Pressley), the sponsor of H.  Res. 456.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, this important resolution demonstrates that our Federal  form of government serves us well. Both Federal and State authorities  have important roles to play, and this is certainly true in the  securities arena.   I congratulate my colleagues from Massachusetts and Michigan for  bringing this bipartisan bill before the House.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  important piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2919) to require the Securities and Exchange Commission to  carry out a study to evaluate the issues affecting the provision of and  reliance upon investment research into small issuers.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2919         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Improving Investment       Research for Small and Emerging Issuers Act''.       SEC. 2. RESEARCH STUDY.         (a) Study Required.--The Securities and Exchange Commission       shall conduct a study to evaluate the issues affecting the       provision of and reliance upon investment research into small       issuers, including emerging growth companies and companies       considering initial public offerings.        (b) Contents of Study.--The study required under subsection       (a) shall consider--        (1) factors related to the demand for such research by       institutional and retail investors;        (2) the availability of such research, including--        (A) the number and types of firms who provide such       research;        (B) the volume of such research over time; and        (C) competition in the research market;        (3) conflicts of interest relating to the production and       distribution of investment research;        (4) the costs of such research;        (5) the impacts of different payment mechanisms for       investment research into small issuers, including whether       such research is paid for by--        (A) hard-dollar payments from research clients;        (B) payments directed from the client's commission income       (i.e., ``soft dollars''); or        (C) payments from the issuer that is the subject of such       research;        (6) any unique challenges faced by minority-owned, women-      owned, and veteran-owned small issuers in obtaining research       coverage; and        (7) the impact on the availability of research coverage for       small issuers due to--        (A) investment adviser concentration and consolidation,       including any potential impacts of fund-size on demand for       investment research of small issuers;        (B) broker and dealer concentration and consolidation,       including any relationships between the size of the firm and       allocation of resources for investment research into small       issuers;        (C) Securities and Exchange Commission rules;        (D) registered national securities association rules;        (E) State and Federal liability concerns;        (F) the settlement agreements referenced in Securities and       Exchange Commission Litigation Release No. 18438 (i.e., the       ``Global Research Analyst Settlement''); and        (G) Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of       the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial       instruments and amending Directive 2002/92/EC and Directive       2011/61/EU, as implemented by the European Union (``EU'')       member states (``MiFID II'').        (c) Report Required.--Not later than 180 days after the       date of the enactment of this Act, the Securities and       Exchange Commission shall submit to Congress a report that       includes--        (1) the results of the study required by subsection (a);       and        (2) recommendations to increase the demand for, volume of,       and quality of investment research into small issuers,       including emerging growth companies and companies considering       initial public offerings.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on  this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member of our Investor Protection,  Entrepreneurship, and Capital Markets Subcommittee, Representative  Huizenga, and Representative McAdams, for working across the aisle on  this bipartisan bill to improve investment research coverage for small  issuers.   Investment research helps to raise investor awareness, understanding,  and interest about a company, which in turn can promote informed  investment and overall trading in a company's securities.   However, reports indicate significant declines in analyst research on  small public companies. In fact, it appears that most exchange-listed  companies with less than $100 million in market capitalization have no  research coverage at all.   To address this concerning trend, H.R. 2919 would direct the SEC to  conduct a study on the issues that are affecting the availability of  research coverage for small issuers, including emerging growth  companies, companies considering an initial public offering, and  minority-, women-, and veteran-owned businesses. It also directs the  SEC to report back recommendations to improve the quality and  availability of investment research for small issuers.   I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill to enable us to  identify some of the barriers small businesses face when attempting to  get their story out to investors in our public capital markets.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that Mr. Huizenga and Mr. McAdams worked in  a bipartisan manner to bring forth H.R. 2919. Markets work best when  there is adequate public information, and the study on additional  research provided for in this bill will help ensure that this is the  case.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3050) to require the Securities and Exchange Commission to  carry out a study of the 10 per centum threshold limitation applicable  to the definition of a diversified company under the Investment Company  Act of 1940, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3050         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Expanding Investment in       Small Businesses Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. SEC STUDY.         (a) In General.--The Securities and Exchange Commission       shall carry out a study of the 10 per centum threshold       limitation applicable to the definition of a diversified       company under section 5(b)(1) of the Investment Company Act       of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-5(b)(1)) and determine the impacts of       such threshold limits upon the protection of investors,       efficiency, competition, and capital formation.        (b) Considerations.--In carrying out the study required       under subsection (a), the Commission shall consider the       following:        (1) The size and number of diversified companies that are       currently restricted in their ability to own more than 10       percent of the voting shares in an individual company.        (2) How the investing preferences of diversified companies       have shifted over time with respect to companies with smaller       market capitalizations and companies in industries where       competition may be limited.        (3) The expected impact to small and emerging growth       companies regarding the availability of capital, related       impacts on investor confidence and risk, and impacts on       competition, if the threshold is increased or otherwise       changed.        (4) The ability of registered funds to manage liquidity       risk.        (5) Any other consideration that the Commission considers       necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors.        (c) Solicitation of Public Comments.--In carrying out the       study required under subsection (a), the Commission may       solicit public comments.        (d) Report.--Not later than the end of the 180-day period       beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, the       Commission shall issue a report to the Congress, and make       such report publicly available on the website of the       Commission, containing--        (1) all findings and determinations made in carrying out       the study required under subsection (a); and  [[Page H5284]]         (2) any legislative recommendations of the Commission.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks on this  legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Our capital markets are the envy of the world. This is due, in part,  to the fact that once a company goes public, it can efficiently raise  money for mom-and-pop investors who, in turn, can easily buy and sell  shares.   However, there is some evidence that initial public offerings, or  IPOs, of smaller companies, known as microcap companies, have declined  since the dot-com bubble in 2001. This decline accounts for the main  reason that the total number of stocks has declined.   I think it is important that we look into why this is the case and  find out what policies we should be working on in Congress to ensure  that our Nation's small businesses are able to access the public  markets.   I support the gentleman from Wisconsin's bill, the Expanding  Investment in Small Business Act of 2019, for doing just that. This  bill would require the Securities and Exchange Commission to study and  solicit public comment on the existing rules restricting a diversified  mutual fund's exposure to a single company. It would also require the  SEC to determine whether that requirement limits capital formation  considering current investing trends and other factors the SEC  determines are necessary and appropriate to protect investors.   The SEC would have to issue a report to Congress with its findings  and determinations made in carrying out the study and any legislative  recommendations, including any recommendation to update the current  thresholds.   This bill helps ensure that we have the facts and data necessary to  make an informed decision on whether we should change the current  diversification limits for mutual funds and whether doing so will  provide additional investment in small company IPOs.   I thank Representative Steil for working with me this Congress to  ensure that the revised text of the bill also seeks to promote  competition in our capital markets, and Mr. Gonzalez for cosponsoring  this bill.   I urge all Members to vote ``yes,'' and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I  want to, again, thank the sponsors of H.R. 3050 and the gentleman from  Wisconsin for working with my side on the text of this legislation. I  think it is a good bill and will, along with other measures that we are  considering today, improve the access of small businesses to U.S.  capital markets.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  important piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2409) to amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to expand  access to capital for rural-area small businesses, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2409         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Expanding Access to Capital       for Rural Job Creators Act''.       SEC. 2. ACCESS TO CAPITAL FOR RURAL-AREA SMALL BUSINESSES.         Section 4(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15       U.S.C. 78d(j)) is amended--        (1) in paragraph (4)(C), by inserting ``rural-area small       businesses,'' after ``women-owned small businesses,''; and        (2) in paragraph (6)(B)(iii), by inserting ``rural-area       small businesses,'' after ``women-owned small businesses,''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Representatives Axne and Mooney  for working together to put forth this bipartisan piece of legislation  to require the Advocate for Small Business Capital Formation at the  Securities and Exchange Commission to pay particular attention to the  unique challenges rural-area small businesses face in accessing the  funds they need to grow and thrive.   This important bill has gained broad bipartisan support because it is  aimed at understanding and addressing real problems faced by Americans  all across our country: the capital needs of rural startups and  entrepreneurs.   When we created the Advocate for Small Business Capital Formation we  recognized that our Nation's small businesses are proven job creators  which require special attention from the SEC. However, it is also  important for the advocate to recognize that different types of small  businesses face unique challenges. For example, as a result of my  amendment to the legislation creating the position, the advocate is  required to specifically consider the challenges facing minority-owned  and women-owned small businesses.   H.R. 2409 would recognize another important category: small  businesses in rural areas and require the advocate to pay special  attention to and report to Congress on the unique challenges and issues  they face.   According to a recent survey by the Small Business Majority, roughly  one in five rural small businesses rated access to capital as one of  the top three challenges to maintaining or growing their business in  their community. What is more, these businesses largely get their funds  from personal savings, and only 13 percent said that they received  investments or gifts from friends or family. So I think it is time for  the SEC to look into why that is and see what, if anything, we can be  doing to encourage capital formation for our Nation's rural small  businesses.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this important  bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. Axne), who is the sponsor of H.R. 2409.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I inquire through the Chair if my colleague  has any remaining speakers on his side.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. Axne)  and the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Mooney) for introducing this  important legislation.   This bipartisan bill passed the House by a near unanimous vote last  Congress. It is time for it to become law to help rural businesses  across this country become even more important job creators.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  important piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
