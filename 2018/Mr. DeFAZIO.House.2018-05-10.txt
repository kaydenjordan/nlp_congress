 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   I think we can agree on one thing. The status quo is not acceptable.  Dispersed around the country in wet pools, in insecure casks--right. We  need to deal with that. This is not the perfect solution, and it is  destined to fail in the Senate.   Why do we commission blue ribbon commissions of experts--are we the  experts?--and then ignore their advice? They made four major points:  the solution must be adaptive, it must be staged, it must be consent- based, and it must be transparent.   This bill assumes we are going into Yucca Mountain, which has been  proven to be geologically unstable and unsuitable. Therefore, this  amendment should be adopted. The bill should fail.
