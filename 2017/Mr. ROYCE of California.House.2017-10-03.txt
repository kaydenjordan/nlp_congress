 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 2408) to enhance the transparency, improve the  coordination, and intensify the impact of assistance to support access  to primary and secondary education for displaced children and persons,  including women and girls, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2408         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Girls' Access to       Education in Vulnerable Settings Act'' or the ``Protecting       Girls' Access to Education Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) At the start of 2017, more than 65,000,000 people have       been displaced by disasters and conflicts around the world,       the highest number recorded since the end of World War II, of       which more than 21,000,000 people are refugees.        (2) More than half of the population of displaced people       are children and, according to the United Nations High       Commissioner for Refugees, nearly 4,000,000 school-aged       displaced children lack access to primary education.        (3) Education offers socioeconomic opportunities,       psychological stability, and physical protection for       displaced people, particularly for women and girls, who might       otherwise be vulnerable to severe forms of trafficking in       persons (as such term is defined in section 103(9) of the       Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C.       7103(9))), child marriage, sexual exploitation, or economic       disenfranchisement, and contributes to long-term recovery and       economic opportunities for displaced people and for the       communities hosting them.        (4) Displaced children face considerable barriers to       accessing educational services and, because the duration of       such displacement is, on average, 20 years, such children may       spend the entirety of their childhood without access to such       services.        (5) Despite the rising need for such services, less than       two percent of global emergency aid was directed toward       educational services in 2016.       SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) it is critical to ensure that children, particularly       girls, displaced by conflicts overseas are able to access       educational services because such access can combat extremism       and reduce exploitation and poverty; and        (2) the educational needs of vulnerable women and girls       should be considered in the design, implementation, and       evaluation of related United States foreign assistance       policies and programs.       SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It is the policy of the United States to--        (1) partner with and encourage other countries, public and       private multilateral institutions, and nongovernmental and       civil society organizations, including faith-based       organizations and organizations representing parents and       children, to support efforts to ensure that displaced       children have access to safe primary and secondary education;        (2) work with donors to enhance training and capacity-      building for the governments of countries hosting significant       numbers of displaced people to design, implement, and monitor       programs to effectively address barriers to such education;        (3) incorporate into the design and implementation of such       programs measures to evaluate the impact of the programs on       girls, with respect to the reduction of child marriage,       gender-based violence, and severe forms of trafficking in       persons (as such term is defined in section 103(9) of the       Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C.       7103(9))); and        (4) coordinate with the governments of countries hosting       significant numbers of displaced people to--        (A) promote the inclusion of displaced children into the       educational systems of such countries; and        (B) develop innovative approaches to providing safe primary       and secondary educational opportunities in circumstances in       which such inclusion is not possible or appropriate, such as       schools that permit more children to be educated by extending       the hours of schooling and expanding the number of teachers.       SEC. 5. UNITED STATES ASSISTANCE TO SUPPORT EDUCATIONAL                     SERVICES FOR DISPLACED CHILDREN.         (a) In General.--The Secretary of State and the       Administrator of the United States Agency for International       Development are authorized to prioritize and advance ongoing       efforts to support programs that--        (1) provide safe primary and secondary education for       displaced children;        (2) build the capacity of institutions in countries hosting       displaced people to prevent discrimination against displaced       children, especially displaced girls, who seek access to such       education; and        (3) help increase the access of displaced children,       especially displaced girls, to educational, economic, and       entrepreneurial opportunities, including through the       governmental authorities responsible for educational or youth       services in such host countries.        (b) Coordination With Multilateral Organizations.--The       Secretary and the Administrator are authorized to coordinate       with the World Bank, appropriate agencies of the United       Nations, and other relevant multilateral organizations to       work with governments in other countries to collect relevant       data, disaggregated by age and gender, on the ability of       displaced people to access education and participate in       economic activity, in order to improve the targeting,       monitoring, and evaluation of related assistance efforts.        (c) Coordination With Private Sector and Civil Society       Organizations.--The Secretary and the Administrator are       authorized to work with private sector and civil society       organizations to promote safe primary and secondary education       for displaced children.       SEC. 6. REPORT.         During the five-year period beginning on the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Secretary and the Administrator       shall include in any report or evaluation submitted to       Congress relating to a foreign assistance program for natural       or manmade disaster relief or response the following       information (to the extent practicable and appropriate):        (1) A breakdown of the beneficiaries of such program by       location, age, gender, marital status, and school enrollment       status.        (2) A description of how such program benefits displaced       people.        (3) A description of any primary or secondary educational       services supported by such program that specifically address       the needs of displaced girls.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Sires)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.                                General Leave     I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include any extraneous material in the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include any extraneous material in the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, first, I would like to recognize Congressman Steve  Chabot and Congresswoman Robin Kelly on the Foreign Affairs Committee  for their work on this important issue of protecting girls and  protecting their access to education, especially in vulnerable  settings.   We all know that education is a critical driver of upward social  mobility for these young girls, for economic growth, for overall  stability in terms of a society. As we confront an increasing number of  conflicts around this globe, education has got to remain a very key  component of U.S. foreign assistance.   Around the world today, there are 27 million children who are out of  school in conflict zones. Half of all children in refugee camps do not  have access to primary education.   With many recent conflicts that have lasted, now, a decade, we are  now seeing entire generations of children that fail to receive even the  most basic education; and even if they are eventually able to return  home, they carry back those deficits in terms of what they have not  learned, and those deficits can last a lifetime. So this is a  humanitarian crisis with real strategic implications.   In Syria, for example, an estimated 4 million children are out of  school in an environment warped by constant violence. Refugee children  outside of Syria are placing tremendous strains on the educational  systems, and I have seen this in countries like Jordan, in Lebanon, in  Turkey.   As we have seen in crisis situations around the world, the lack of  stable educational opportunities make these children more vulnerable:  more vulnerable, especially for girls, to exploitation; more  vulnerable, especially for boys, to radicalization.   Girls face unique barriers to education in conflict zones. In these  afflicted countries, girls are 2\1/2\ times more likely than young boys  to be out of school. They frequently encounter cultural barriers that  prevent them from seeking an education, and they often lack safe routes  to that little school and back home from that school.  [[Page H7699]]    Promoting girls' access to education reduces their risk of falling  victim to gender-based violence or to early marriage or to human  trafficking. It is also the just thing to do.   H.R. 2408, the Protecting Girls' Access to Education in Vulnerable  Settings Act, authorizes the State Department and authorizes USAID to  enhance existing education programs for displaced children and to  especially be engaged with girls.   The bill calls on the State Department and USAID to coordinate  efforts with the private sector as well, with civil society groups,  with multilateral organizations, to collect relevant data to improve  the effectiveness of these programs that we are engaged in.   Finally, the bill would require that the State Department and the  USAID include data on education programs for displaced children in any  report to Congress on disaster relief and recovery efforts so that we  are aware that they are engaged in addressing this issue.   We must strengthen the role of education in humanitarian assistance.  Refugees and other displaced persons live on a knife edge of despair.  Without access to education, children in conflict zones, especially  girls, are more exposed to violence, to exploitation, and even to  radicalization.   By helping to realize their innate potential, education gives these  children hope, hope for today, and it gives them critical skills for  tomorrow so that they can contribute to their homes, their communities,  and so that they can contribute to the next generation. Mr. Speaker, I  urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot), who is on the Committee on Foreign  Affairs, and is the author of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), who chairs the Foreign  Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa.   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Royce; Ranking Member  Engel; and, in this case, especially Congressman Albio Sires, the  ranking member of the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, for once  again helping to bring another important bipartisan Foreign Affairs  measure to the House floor.    Mr. Speaker, I am a proud cosponsor of the Protecting Girls' Access  to Education in Vulnerable Settings Act. My good friend, Steve Chabot,  has been a real leader in Congress when it comes to ensuring that girls  around the world have the opportunity to achieve a better future for  themselves through access to education.   Mr. Speaker, I am a former Florida certified teacher. I understand  the value of education. Mr. Sires from New Jersey is also a former  teacher. We heard from Mr. Chabot, who is also a former teacher. We  understand how important education is to future success.   Right now, sadly, Mr. Speaker, there are 65 million displaced people  around the world, and about half of that population is under 18. This  bill before us prioritizes State and USAID efforts to support access to  primary and secondary education for displaced children, with a  specificity to helping displaced girls.   Unfortunately, sometimes young girls fall victim to exploitation, to  trafficking, or they get married off, sold off, without having the  opportunity to determine their own future; something that we might take  for granted in this glorious country. That is why Mr. Chabot's bill is  so important. We need to reach out to those young girls. We need to  have them have access to primary and secondary education so that they  can increase their own chances for a prosperous future, Mr. Speaker.   Access to education, I know, empowers young people, and it will  especially empower young girls. It will offer them a chance at  socioeconomic opportunities that heretofore have been closed to them.  It offers them stability. It offers them empowerment.   Mr. Speaker, we have got to pass Mr. Chabot's bill. We have got to do  more to ensure that displaced people, especially young girls, have  access to education. I urge my colleagues to support this important  measure. I urge our partners in responsible nations around the world to  join us in prioritizing our efforts toward access to education for all.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Royce and Mr. Engel, and I especially thank  my good friend from New Jersey (Mr. Sires).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we are surrounded here by former teachers today who have  brought this bill, who have worked with us to bring this bill to the  House floor, and we understand their impulse to reach out to these  young children and try to see to it that they have an equal chance out  in the world.   This is something that teachers do, and this focus on young girls,  especially young girls in the most vulnerable situation, as a result of  conflict in those regions making them at risk for trafficking, for  exploitation or being child brides, these former teachers understand  the importance of having a program directed specifically to this  problem.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot); the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Kelly.); certainly, Albio Sires, our  ranking member on the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee; and Ms. Ros- Lehtinen, of course, as chairman, for helping to ensure that  international humanitarian efforts are prioritizing this issue of  access to education for girls.   By improving coordination between the State Department, USAID, the  private sector, and multilateral organizations, what this bill is going  to do is to improve the chances that these young lives will be able to  blossom above the ashes of war, above these conflicts that rage in  these spots around the world, so that they might reach their full  potential. If they do, they will be able to help the next generation.   Mr. Speaker, I ask every Member for their support, and I yield back  the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 2408.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 1918) to oppose loans at international financial  institutions for the Government of Nicaragua unless the Government of  Nicaragua is taking effective steps to hold free, fair, and transparent  elections, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1918         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Nicaraguan Investment       Conditionality Act (NICA) of 2017''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) The House Committee on Foreign Affairs convened a       congressional hearing on December 1, 2011, entitled       ``Democracy Held Hostage in Nicaragua: Part 1'' where former       United States Ambassador to Nicaragua Robert Callahan       testified, ``First, that Daniel Ortega's candidacy was       illegal, illegitimate, and unconstitutional; second, that the       period leading to the elections and the elections themselves       were marred by serious fraud; third, that Daniel Ortega and       his Sandinista party have systematically undermined the       country's fragile governmental institutions.''.        (2) According to the Organization of American States (OAS)       report on the Nicaraguan  [[Page H7701]]       2011 Presidential elections, the OAS recommended that the       Government of Nicaragua take a number of steps to improve its       electoral systems, including accrediting poll watchers to       ensure political parties and civil society are represented to       observe elections, and redesigning the structure of the       Nicaraguan electoral council to allow proper registration of       the electorate.        (3) On January 25, 2012, a press statement from Secretary       of State Hillary Clinton said: ``As noted by international       observers and Nicaraguan civil society groups, Nicaragua's       recent elections were not conducted in a transparent and       impartial manner, and the entire electoral process was marred       by significant irregularities. The elections marked a setback       to democracy in Nicaragua and undermined the ability of       Nicaraguans to hold their government accountable.''.        (4) According to the Department of State's 2015 Fiscal       Transparency Report: ``Nicaragua's fiscal transparency would       be improved by including all off-budget revenue and       expenditure in the budget, auditing state-owned enterprises,       and conducting a full audit of the government's annual       financial statements and making audit reports publicly       available within a reasonable period of time.''.        (5) According to the Department of State's Country Reports       on Human Rights Practices for 2015: ``In 2011 the Supreme       Electoral Council (CSE) announced the re-election of       President Daniel Ortega Saavedra of the Sandinista National       Liberation Front (FSLN) in elections that international and       domestic observers characterized as seriously flawed.       International and domestic organizations raised concerns       regarding the constitutional legitimacy of Ortega's re-      election. The 2011 elections also provided the ruling party       with a supermajority in the National Assembly, allowing for       changes in the constitution, including extending the reach of       executive branch power and the elimination of restrictions on       re-election for executive branch officials and mayors.       Observers noted serious flaws during the 2012 municipal       elections and March 2014 regional elections.''.        (6) According to the Department of State's Country Reports       on Human Rights Practices for 2015 in Nicaragua: ``The       principal human rights abuses were restrictions on citizens'       right to vote; obstacles to freedom of speech and press,       including government intimidation and harassment of       journalists and independent media, as well as increased       restriction of access to public information, including       national statistics from public offices; and increased       government harassment and intimidation of nongovernmental       organizations (NGOs) and civil society organizations.''.        (7) The same 2015 report stated: ``Additional significant       human rights abuses included considerably biased policies to       promote single-party dominance; arbitrary police arrest and       detention of suspects, including abuse during detention;       harsh and life-threatening prison conditions with arbitrary       and lengthy pretrial detention; discrimination against ethnic       minorities and indigenous persons and communities.''.        (8) On June 7, 2016, the Department of State's Bureau of       Democracy, Human Rights and Labor posted on social media:       ``Disappointed government of Nicaragua said it will deny       electoral observers requested by Nicaraguan citizens, church,       and private sector . . . We continue to encourage the       government of Nicaragua to allow electoral observers as       requested by Nicaraguans.''.        (9) On June 14, 2016, President Ortega expelled three       United States Government officials (two officials from U.S.       Customs and Border Protection and one professor from the       National Defense University) from Nicaragua.        (10) On August 1, 2016, the Department of State issued a       press release to express grave concern over the Nicaraguan       government limiting democratic space leading up to the       elections in November and stated that ``[o]n June 8, the       Nicaraguan Supreme Court stripped the opposition Independent       Liberal Party (PLI) from its long recognized leader. The       Supreme Court took similar action on June 17 when it       invalidated the leadership of the Citizen Action Party, the       only remaining opposition party with the legal standing to       present a presidential candidate. Most recently, on July 29,       the Supreme Electoral Council removed 28 PLI national       assembly members (16 seated and 12 alternates) from their       popularly-elected positions.''.        (11) On November 7, 2016, the Department of State issued a       press release stating: ``The United States is deeply       concerned by the flawed presidential and legislative       electoral process in Nicaragua, which precluded the       possibility of a free and fair election on November 6. In       advance of the elections, the Nicaraguan government sidelined       opposition candidates for president, limited domestic       observation at the polls and access to voting credentials,       and took other actions to deny democratic space in the       process. The decision by the Nicaraguan government not to       invite independent international electoral observers further       degraded the legitimacy of the election.''.        (12) In November and December of 2016, the Board of       Executive Directors of the Inter-American Development Bank       postponed consideration of a policy based loan of $65 million       to the Government of Nicaragua due to the efforts of the       United States mission that expressed serious concerns of the       absence of transparency, systemic corruption, and the lack of       free and fair elections in Nicaragua.        (13) According to the Department of State's Country Reports       on Human Rights Practices for 2016: ``[A]ctions by the ruling       Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) party resulted in       de facto concentration of power in a single party, with an       authoritarian executive branch exercising significant control       over the legislative, judicial, and electoral functions.''.        (14) According to the Department of State's Country Reports       on Human Rights Practices for 2016 in Nicaragua, ``The       November 6 elections for president, vice president, national       assembly members, and representatives for the Central       American parliament did not meet the conditions of being free       and fair . . . The November 6 presidential and legislative       elections were marred by allegations of institutional fraud       and the absence of independent opposition political parties.       National observers and opposition leaders claimed rates of       abstention from 60 to 70 percent.''.        (15) According to the Department of State's Country Reports       on Human Rights Practices for 2016: ``Companies reported that       bribery of public officials, unlawful seizures, and arbitrary       assessments by customs and tax authorities were common . . .       The courts remained particularly susceptible to bribes,       manipulation, and other forms of corruption, especially by       the FSLN, giving the sense that the FSLN heavily influenced       CSJ and lower-level court actions.''.       SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It is the policy of the United States to support--        (1) the rule of law and an independent judiciary and       electoral council in Nicaragua;        (2) independent pro-democracy organizations in Nicaragua;        (3) free, fair, and transparent elections under       international and domestic observers in Nicaragua; and        (4) anti-corruption and transparency efforts in Nicaragua.       SEC. 4. INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.         (a) In General.--The President shall instruct the United       States Executive Director at each international financial       institution to use the voice, vote, and influence of the       United States to oppose any loan for the benefit of the       Government of Nicaragua, other than to address basic human       needs or promote democracy, unless the Secretary of State       certifies and reports to the appropriate congressional       committees that the Government of Nicaragua is taking       effective steps to--        (1) hold free, fair, and transparent elections overseen by       credible domestic and international electoral observers;        (2) promote democracy, as well as an independent judicial       system and electoral council;        (3) strengthen the rule of law;        (4) respect the right to freedom of association and       expression;        (5) combat corruption, including investigating and       prosecuting government officials that are credibly alleged to       be corrupt; and        (6) protect the right of political opposition parties,       journalists, trade unionists, human rights defenders, and       other civil society activists to operate without       interference.        (b) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall       submit to the appropriate congressional committees a written       report assessing--        (1) the effectiveness of the international financial       institutions in enforcing applicable program safeguards in       Nicaragua; and        (2) the effects of the matters described in section 2 on       long-term prospects for positive development outcomes in       Nicaragua.        (c) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term       ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--        (A) the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Committee on       Appropriations, and the Committee on Financial Services of       the House of Representatives; and        (B) the Committee on Foreign Relations, the Committee on       Appropriations, and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and       Urban Affairs of the Senate.        (2) International financial institution.--The term       ``international financial institution'' means the       International Monetary Fund, International Bank for       Reconstruction and Development, European Bank for       Reconstruction and Development, International Development       Association, International Finance Corporation, Multilateral       Investment Guarantee Agency, African Development Bank,       African Development Fund, Asian Development Bank, Inter-      American Development Bank, Bank for Economic Cooperation and       Development in the Middle East and North Africa, and Inter-      American Investment Corporation.        (d) Termination.--This section shall terminate on the day       after the earlier of--        (1) the date on which the Secretary of State certifies and       reports to the appropriate congressional committees that the       requirements of subsection (a) are met; or        (2) 5 years after the date of the enactment of this Act.        (e) Waiver.--The President may waive this section if the       President determines that such a waiver is in the national       interest of the United States.       SEC. 5. ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES.         The President shall direct the United States Permanent       Representative to the OAS to use the voice, vote, and       influence of  [[Page H7702]]       the United States at the OAS to strongly advocate for an       Electoral Observation Mission to be sent to Nicaragua in 2017       to observe the possibility of credible elections.       SEC. 6. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         The Department of State and the United States Agency for       International Development should prioritize foreign       assistance to the people of Nicaragua to assist civil society       in democracy and governance programs, including human rights       documentation.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this measure.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the world has watched with great concern, with mounting  horror, actually, as Venezuela suffers economic ruin amid a potential  crisis that has eroded democracy, and that threatens to destabilize the  region. Meanwhile, less noticed, Nicaragua continues to violate the  region's democratic values by failing to conduct fair and transparent  elections and by denying Nicaraguans freedom of expression and freedom  of association.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the leadership of chairman emeritus of  the Foreign Affairs Committee, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen; and the chairman and  ranking member of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, Mr. Duncan; and  the ranking member, Mr. Sires, in bringing this measure to the floor.                                time  1445    This legislation will require U.S. representatives at international  financial institutions to use the vote and influence of the United  States to oppose any loans to Nicaragua unless the country has shown a  willingness to respect the human and democratic rights of its citizens.   Nicaragua's authoritarian President Daniel Ortega, and that's the  same Daniel Ortega who lost the Presidency in 1990, has tightened his  grip on power by weakening government institutions and the opposition  and ensuring power for himself and his family by excluding  international election observers.   By requiring that the Secretary of State certify that Nicaragua has  taken steps to provide election transparency and combat corruption  before the United States votes to provide the Government of Nicaragua  with loans, we help ensure that taxpayer money is not used to line the  pockets of corrupt authoritarians, or to derail the legitimate  democratic rights of the Nicaraguan citizens.   We need only to look to Venezuela to see that the consolidation of  state power and organized crime and corruption actually go hand in  hand. As a region, we must stand in strong opposition to  authoritarianism and corruption in Nicaragua, while not punishing the  people of Nicaragua. And it is this point of not punishing the people  of Nicaragua that also we have to include in this measure; and for that  reason, and because of this, the authors of the bill have insured a  carve-out, and that carve-out exempts all loans that are for  humanitarian purposes.   So this bill stands squarely with the people of Nicaragua and their  hopes for freedom and democracy and the rule of law. Its passage is  just one way that we can demonstrate this support. I urge my colleagues  to join me in supporting the measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                 Committee on Financial Services,                                    Washington, DC, October 3, 2017.      Hon. Ed Royce,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Royce: I am writing concerning H.R. 1918, the       Nicaraguan Investment Conditionality Act (NICA) of 2017, as       amended.        As a result of your having consulted with the Committee on       Financial Services concerning provisions in the bill that       fall within our Rule X jurisdiction, I agree to forgo action       on the bill so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House       Floor. The Committee on Financial Services takes this action       with our mutual understanding that, by foregoing       consideration of H.R. 1918, as amended, at this time, we do       not waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained       in this or similar legislation, and that our Committee will       be appropriately consulted and involved as this or similar       legislation moves forward so that we may address any       remaining issues that fall within our Rule X jurisdiction.       Our Committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of       an appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate       conference involving this or similar legislation, and       requests your support for any such request.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding with respect to H.R. 1918, as       amended, and would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters       on this matter be included in the Congressional Record during       floor consideration thereof.            Sincerely,                                                    Jeb Hensarling,      Chairman, Committee on Financial Services.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                    Washington, DC, October 3, 2017.      Hon. Jeb Hensarling,      Chairman, Committee on Financial Services,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Hensarling: Thank you for consulting with the       Foreign Affairs Committee and agreeing to be discharged from       further consideration of H.R. 1918, the Nicaragua Investment       Conditionality Act, so that the bill may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this resolution or similar legislation in the future. I       would support your effort to seek appointment of an       appropriate number of conferees from your committee to any       House-Senate conference on this legislation.        I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 1918 into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work together as this measure       moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                   Edward R. Royce,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) who chairs the Foreign  Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa, and is the  author of this legislation.   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill,  H.R. 1918, the Nicaraguan Investment Conditionality Act, also known as  the NICA Act, and I want to thank Chairman Royce and Ranking Member  Engel for working with my office to bring this important measure to the  floor today.   I also want to thank my legislative ``brother,'' ``mi hermano,'' the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Sires), who is the Democratic lead on  this legislation, because his leadership on all things related to human  rights is admirable, and his steadfast support for the people of  Nicaragua has been unwavering.   I also want to thank the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee Chairman  Jeff Duncan. He has been helping us in leading the effort and bringing  attention to the human rights abuses that are sadly occurring in  Nicaragua.   This legislation before us, Mr. Speaker, is straightforward, and it  is simple. There have been a lot of exaggerations about what this bill  does and what this bill doesn't do.   Our bill is aimed at leveraging America's influence and conditioning  our vote at any of the international financial institutions for  Nicaragua until the leadership in that country takes significant steps  to restore democratic order.   I think that we would all agree, as Members of the United States  Congress, that to have democracies in our region is beneficial; and to  have strong governance and strong rule of law and a strong independent  judiciary, these are all values that we share and that the people  throughout the hemisphere would like to have that in their countries as  well.   So let's go over, just briefly, what are some of the conditions in  this bill. And please, as I go through them, ask yourself: Is that a  damaging condition, or is that something that would help the people?  Not whether it helps the ruling class, the rich guys, the fat-cat  bankers, not whether it helps the regime or the government in power,  whether it helps the people of those countries.   So let me go through the list, Mr. Speaker. This bill has as  conditions:   To promote democracy. Promoting democracy, promoting an independent  judicial system. Those are wonderful values. Promoting an independent  electoral council, so that the ruling party doesn't steal elections;   Strengthen the rule of law so that you don't have corrupt judges  deciding in favor of the rich guys and against the poor of the country;   Fighting corruption, including investigating and prosecuting  government officials who are credibly alleged to be corrupt, who go  against the people of Nicaragua and further enrich those who wish to do  damage to the country.   What else does the bill do? Well, one of the conditions is that it  protects the right of political opposition parties. Don't we want that,  political opposition parties; journalists who are trying to get the  truth to the Nicaraguan people just as they do here to the American  people; trade unionists; human rights defenders and other civil rights  advocates to operate without interference. Isn't that what we want for  all countries to have?    These conditions, Mr. Speaker, they are not unheard of; in fact, they  are similar to what this country has already passed, what this Congress  has already passed for the Northern Triangle countries of Honduras, of  Guatemala, and of El Salvador. And now we want to do that for  Nicaragua, so it is intended to help the people of Nicaragua.   This bill has safeguards in place to ensure that humanitarian  assistance continues to be provided to address basic human needs.  Humanitarian assistance will continue.   Some of those basic needs that we talked about, such as free and fair  elections, they are not being met today due to the failed leadership in  Nicaragua. And who does that help? Well, it helps the leaders, and it  hurts the people when you don't have free and fair elections. We want  to help the people of Nicaragua.   Now, reports have surfaced that the Nicaraguan electoral council is  giving away identity cards, so that minors, underage individuals can be  allowed to vote. Nicaraguans who are not on the electoral rolls are  also being allowed to vote.   What does that mean, Mr. Speaker? It means that there will be no way  to determine if the individual voted more than once, and that is  exactly how the status quo wants it; the fat-cats, they like it so that  they can stay there and they can manipulate the results of the  elections.   We are also seeing civil society leaders publicly expressing their  concern regarding the deterioration of human rights in Nicaragua. As a  result of speaking out against the government, they have been targeted  for persecution. You speak out against the government, you are going to  have some false charges thrown at you.   And what about the indigenous communities? They have also expressed  their concern regarding land grabs by the government. Violence is  breaking out as the Nicaraguan military is being dispatched to squash  the peaceful protests by these indigenous communities.   So let us not forget, Mr. Speaker, just what kind of leadership  structure we are dealing with in Nicaragua. The Russians have set up  operations in Managua, they are proud of it, they put it in the front  pages, and that poses a threat to U.S. national security interests.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    I yield the gentlewoman an additional 2  minutes.   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, Nicaragua continues to offer its  unconditional support to Nicolas Maduro and his dictatorial regime in  Venezuela. And according to congressional testimony, Venezuela's  entity, PDVSA, has also used its subsidiary in Nicaragua, which is  called Albanisa--and I will give the exact letters of those names--to  launder money.   So, Mr. Speaker, if Venezuela's Maduro is using Nicaragua in order to  evade U.S. sanctions, we need to take a closer look at these ties. We  need to hold people accountable because all of that hurts the people of  Venezuela and the people of Nicaragua. It helps the government, but it  doesn't help the people.   That is what this bill does. We want to hold the Nicaraguan  Government accountable, just like we have done in other countries, as I  said, in Central America. This is not something new, out of whole  cloth, that we have invented. It has worked, and it has truly helped  the people.   Now, earlier this year, Mr. Sires and I, we traveled to Honduras, we  traveled to Guatemala, and we saw firsthand how conditioning our  support for these countries works and has been extremely effective.   Has it hurt those countries? It has not. It has worked. It has  strengthened their democracy. It has strengthened the rule of law, the  independent judiciary.   So placing conditions incentivizes countries to do the right thing,  and it makes institutional reforms, as needed, to improve the  livelihood of their citizens.   So I know that the Nicaraguan Government does not like this bill, but  I tell you, Mr. Speaker, the people of Nicaragua would like to know  that the United States Congress stands with them as they call for  reforms that promote democracy, that strengthen the  [[Page H7704]]  rule of law, that fight corruption, and that protect the rights of all  political opposition parties, and that is exactly what this bill does.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I think it is important, when we consider the challenge  that we have here, the Carter Center was involved in Nicaragua trying  to oversee the election there. They came to the conclusion that the  election was not transparent. The elections were not fair in Nicaragua.   The European Union was engaged in trying to monitor those elections.  Again, the same conclusion.   The Organization of American States, it is the standard or it is the  organization representing all of the governments in this hemisphere,  they again raised the same issue.   When we think what we are trying to do here, the goal is, first, any  loans that go to the benefit of the people of Nicaragua, that is exempt  anyway. From the humanitarian standpoint, we want them to have the  loans. But if we are going to make a loan that benefits the head of  state or the government and, as part of that, we put the same  conditions that the OAS puts on member loans, the same conditions that  we put on other countries with respect to the rule of law or with  respect to transparency and free and fair elections, I don't think that  that is unusual in the least. As a matter of fact, those are the  conditions we apply.   The attempt to focus on this and our frustration with it is to give  that added boost, just as the Carter Center is trying to do, just as  the European Union is trying to weigh in, just as the OAS is suggesting  as we go forward that there be these reforms and transparency. I think  it is proper that this institution does the same. I think the carve-out  we put in the bill for humanitarian aid addresses the other issues.   So from that standpoint, I think it is necessary for us to do what we  can at this time to nudge this back toward free and fair elections.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   In summing up here, the focus of this legislation is clearly to seek  to end a practice which many in the international community find a  vexing one, and that is it tries to ensure that the loans that are  given to the Government of Nicaragua meet certain democratic benchmarks  before issuing any loans that would specifically benefit those in the  government. There is a carve-out, as I shared, for any humanitarian  loans.   I think the reason this approach has gained bipartisan support is  because the United States, in this instance, will be engaged still, but  engaged in a way where we are not encouraging corruption. I say that  because it pushes Nicaragua to allow for free and transparent  elections, and that should be our goal. That is the goal of other  election observers who have been involved in the past and have  expressed their concerns about the state of play there.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the authors, and I yield back the balance of my  time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 1918, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
