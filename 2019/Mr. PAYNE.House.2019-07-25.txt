 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Donald M. Payne,  Sr., International Development Graduate Fellowship Program.   My father, the late Donald M. Payne, was committed to human rights at  home, in Africa, and around the world. I am honored by the Payne  Fellows' commitment to my father's legacy, and I have developed a deep  appreciation for everything they have done to uplift humanity.   I am proud that the fellowship named for my father helps talented  young people enter the USAID Foreign Service program. Today, the Payne  Fellows are leading the charge on some of the greatest global  challenges of our time.   Since its inception in 2013, the program has trained 50 talented  young individuals who come from diverse backgrounds to enrich and  enhance the USAID Foreign Service.   This year, I hosted one of the Payne Fellows in my office. Her name  is Meklit Gebru.   Meklit's intellect, work ethic, humor, and, most of all, her positive  attitude will truly be missed in my office. The day after her arrival,  she was writing questions for me to use in Committee on Homeland  Security subcommittee hearings.   Again, I thank the USAID and the Payne Fellows for their commitment  to providing humanitarian efforts while in support of America's foreign  policy.                            ____________________
