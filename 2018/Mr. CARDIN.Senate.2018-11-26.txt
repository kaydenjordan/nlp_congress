 Mr. President, this Wednesday, November 28, 2018,  the Sisters of Mercy will be celebrating 50 years of service to Mercy  Health Services provided by one of my longest and dearest friends,  Richard O. Berndt. That is right: half a century of service.   Rick is a senior partner at Gallagher, Evelius & Jones, LLP, a firm  he joined after he assisted the firm's founder, Francis X. Gallagher,  at the Maryland Constitutional Convention in 1967. That was the year  Rick earned his law degree from the University of Maryland School of  Law. That was where we met, and he has remained one of my closest and  most trusted advisers ever since. He earned his bachelor's degree from  Villanova University in 1964 and went on to earn a master's degree from  Johns Hopkins University in 1970. His continued devotion to all three  institutions--but, perhaps, especially his beloved ``Nova''--knows no  bounds.   Rick, the son of German immigrant bakers, is actively and  productively engaged in Maryland's business community, and he currently  serves on the boards of Mercy Health Services, Inc., and Johns Hopkins  Medicine. Over the last five decades, Rick has served on the boards of  Associated Catholic Charities, Inc., Baltimore Community Foundation,  Baltimore Development Corporation, Baltimore Equitable Society  Insurance Company, Center Stage, Inc., Maryland Academy of Sciences  (Maryland Science Center), Goucher College, Good Samaritan Hospital,  and the Board of Regents of the University of Maryland Higher Education  System, and for-profit companies such as Mercantile Bankshares Corp.   Rick has never sought the spotlight. Perhaps that is one of the  reasons he has been so influential over the course of his career. As  the Baltimore Sun reported in 2001, ``Without making headlines, Berndt  played an important role in moving the Baltimore Archdiocese into the  foreground on civil rights, rebuilding the Inner Harbor in the 1970s,  shaping the campaigns and policies of leading Democrats, pushing a  major statewide gun control measure and negotiating the huge Inner  Harbor East waterfront development.'' Then-Delegate Howard P. ``Pete''  Rawlings referred to Rick as ``the political pope of Baltimore.'' That  was nearly 20 years ago; I can assure you Rick hasn't slowed down  since.   Winston Churchill said, ``We make a living by what we get; we make a  life by what we give.'' Rick has been successful as an attorney and in  life because his ethical compass has always been pointed to true north.  He may be modest about his service, but it hasn't gone unnoticed. Rick  is the recipient of numerous public service awards including not one,  but two, papal medals from Pope John Paul II; the Pro Bono Service  Award from the University of Maryland School of Law Alumni Association;  the Frances Morton Froelicher Civic Statesmanship Award from the  Citizens Planning and Housing Association; and the Greater Baltimore  Committee Award for Outstanding Service. In 1994, then-Cardinal William  Keeler bestowed on Rick one of the highest honors the Roman Catholic  Church can give to a layperson: the rank of Knight Commander in the  Papal Order of St. Gregory the Great.   One of the blessings of my life is to count Rick Berndt as a mentor,  adviser, and friend. I hope my Senate colleagues will join me, along  with the Sisters of Mercy, Rick's innumerable other friends, and his  family in celebrating his career and his legacy of selfless devotion to  the service of others.                            ____________________
