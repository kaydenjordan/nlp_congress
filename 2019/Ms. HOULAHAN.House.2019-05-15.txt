 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  on the subject of my Special Order.    Madam Speaker, there are over a dozen caucuses in  Congress today that address issues facing servicemembers and/or  veterans, but none of these are geared towards addressing the issues  faced by the fastest growing cohort in our Nation's military: women.   Today, that changes.   My name is Chrissy Houlahan, and I represent Pennsylvania's Sixth  Congressional District. Today I am announcing the launch of the first  ever Servicewomen and Women Veterans Congressional Caucus.   When the draft ended in 1973, women represented just 2 percent of the  enlisted force and 8 percent of the officer corps. Today, those numbers  have grown to 16 percent and 18 percent, respectively. Currently, there  are 2 million living women veterans in the United States, and in the  next 25 years, women veterans are projected to nearly double their  population and will account for one in five living veterans.   We cannot afford to wait, and the time to act is now.   Twenty-seven years ago, I gave birth to my first child, my daughter  Molly. I was Active Duty at the time, and I was given 6 weeks of  maternity leave. When I returned, I intended to enroll my daughter in  the on-base childcare but discovered that there was a 6-month-long  waiting list. I looked for private care in Boston where I was serving,  but the cost was too high. In fact, my entire paycheck would have gone  to childcare.   I was a lieutenant in the Air Force, stationed at Hanscom Air Force  Base at the time, and my assignment, my job, was to determine what kind  of information people needed and in what order and in what visual  display when ballistic missiles were raining down on them and the end  of the world was coming.   I am a very well-educated engineer. I became an engineer in the Air  Force, and yet I couldn't, with my skills and my education, figure out  how I was supposed to make ends meet and make childcare work to fulfill  my military responsibilities and serve our country.   I was going against the system in many ways, a new mother serving in  the military with a working civilian husband. That is not what most  people picture when they picture a traditional military family. It  wasn't even what I saw as a young girl when I was growing up.   I was the daughter and granddaughter of career Naval officers and  career Navy wives, and I watched as my mother and my grandmother moved  us all around the country and cared for us while my father and my  grandfather served. My mother's job was to create a sense of home in  every new place that we moved. Her job was my brother and I.   So there I was with a new baby of my own and a mission to deal with  ballistic missile defense, no viable options for childcare, and working  within a system that had not yet caught up with me and my career. So I  decided to make a very difficult choice, and I separated from the Air  Force.   You see, at that time, I didn't really have any role models, anyone  that I knew or could look up to who had walked in my boots, so to  speak, and had navigated being a new mother while simultaneously  serving our country. So few women were really high up in the Air  Force's ranks at the time, so there were very few I knew who could show  me what Active Duty looked like as a mother.   But that is changing. In 2019, women represent the fastest growing  cohort in America's military. More and more women are hearing that same  call that I and my friends here heard--the call to serve.   What is upsetting, though, is 27 years later, despite women's  increased presence across all branches of the military, we all still  struggle with many of the same issues, including access to quality and  affordable childcare, and I find this unacceptable.   In this 116th Congress, we set a record. For the first time in  history, there are more than two women veterans serving in the House of  Representatives. There are now four. It was the realization that I was  surrounded by three other women who served our country that inspired me  to start this caucus.   Now is the time to address these issues that have been plaguing our  servicewomen and women veterans for years, and that is what today is  about. That is what the Servicewomen and Women Veterans Congressional  Caucus is about.   We four women are here to enact change to better support the brave  women who have also answered the call to serve. We four are here as  four women veterans who will lead this caucus with our lived  experiences in the Armed Forces and who will evaluate the unique issues  that our women face and who will work towards enacting legislation that  better serves them and better serves their families.   This is not a Democratic issue nor is it a Republican issue. It is  neither a man's issue nor a woman's issue. It is an intrinsically  American and human issue, and that is why this caucus has members from  both sides of the aisle, and that is why we have veterans and  nonveterans as participants, men and women.   This caucus is comprised of people who are held together by a shared  understanding that, when Congress neglects its duty to support the men  and women who serve, it hasn't done its job. It undermines our  country's national security and our military's readiness.   I remember thinking to myself when I got here that I was just one  person. Then when I got here, I met Representative Tulsi Gabbard,  Representative Elaine Luria, Representative Mikie Sherrill, and the one  became four. And now, today, I am launching that Servicewomen and Women  Veterans Congressional Caucus, the very first caucus in our country's  history to specifically address the issues facing servicewomen and  women veterans.   We are more than 50 strong in number now; 1 became 4, and 4 became  more than 50. We have a mission. We have our marching orders. And  speaking as an Air Force veteran, I can promise I won't stop fighting  until our mission has been accomplished.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
