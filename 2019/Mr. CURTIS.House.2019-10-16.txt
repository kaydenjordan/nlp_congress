 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill to designate the  United States Postal Service in Orem, Utah, as the Jerry C. Washburn  Post Office Building.   This is a great honor for me, Madam Speaker, as I had an opportunity  to serve with Mayor Washburn as a newly elected mayor. Not only was  Jerry Washburn the longest serving mayor in Orem's history, he was the  type of leader that is exactly what is needed today among elected  officials.   He knew that, as much as he loved his city, it wasn't enough for his  city to be successful; all of the surrounding cities in the community  must also be successful. He knew it wasn't enough for him to be a great  mayor; he needed the other mayors to be great, as well.   His message was one of optimism, of unity, and of working together as  public servants. He was humble and often  [[Page H8177]]  soft-spoken. But when he walked into a room, everybody stopped to  listen to what Mayor Washburn would have to say, and all of us were  edified by his message and knew that we were better off.   He was a personal mentor to me. I found myself often saying: What  would Jerry Washburn do? Inevitably, that led me to a better decision.   In addition to being mayor, he served as a board member for the Parks  Council of the Boy Scouts of America. He started Washburn Motors in  Orem with his father and was dedicated to his family, church, and  community.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this bill  to name the post office in his honor.
