 Madam Speaker, it is about time we ge something real  done for the American people. The people of Missouri's Second District  sent me to Washington to secure their jobs and to keep a little more of  their hard-earned money, and at long last we are finally doing just  that.    I vote ``yes'' to fix our broken tax system. I vote ``yes'' to help  reignite the American economy. I vote ``yes'' to make it a little bit  easier for that single mother of two, that firefighter, that teacher,  that shopowner, that family of four, that veteran. I vote ``yes'' for  bigger paychecks, better savings, and a more secure future.   I ran for Congress to fight for the people of Missouri and to ensure  that every hardworking American can realize their own American Dream.
