 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules,  I call up House Resolution 466 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 466         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R.       3401) making emergency supplemental appropriations for the       fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, and for other       purposes, with the Senate amendment thereto, and to consider       in the House, without intervention of any point of order, a       motion offered by the chair of the Committee on       Appropriations or her designee that the House concur in the       Senate amendment with an amendment consisting of the text of       Rules Committee Print 116-21. The Senate amendment and the       motion shall be considered as read. The motion shall be       debatable for one hour equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Appropriations. The previous question shall be considered as       ordered on the motion to its adoption without intervening       motion.                                Point of Order     Madam Speaker, I claim time in opposition to the point  of order.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, what we are trying to do here is bring a bill to the  floor to help alleviate the suffering of children who, in my opinion,  have been abused under U.S. custody at our border. Everybody has read  the news articles and everybody has seen the pictures. We have a moral  obligation to move forward. To try to delay consideration of a bill to  help these children I think is a mistake.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I am surprised that my colleagues on the Republican  side hold this institution in such low esteem. We are the House of  Representatives. Our voice matters.   On this issue, the House voted first on a measure to try to help  provide some assistance to these children at the border. Then the  Senate passed a different version. The way it is supposed to work is we  have a negotiation and we try to come to agreement and come up with a  compromise bill. So the idea that somehow we don't matter in the House,  that we shouldn't matter in the House, that we should just accept  whatever the Senate does, to me, I find  [[Page H5224]]  that disrespectful of the House of Representatives.   What we are doing is we are sending the Senate basically all that  they want, plus we are adding things to help protect children and to  provide for more transparency. We are strengthening requirements for  children's health. We are tightening restrictions for children's  safety. We are supporting nonprofits in communities caring for  children's well-being. I mean, we are embracing compassionate  processing for children's comfort. Again, we are enhancing  accountability in transparency and mandating fiscal responsibility.   Who can possibly be opposed to those things? That is what we are  trying to do. We are trying to insist that the House's voice matters,  and we are trying to make the Senate bill even better.   Again, what motivates us here is the well-being of these children. We  are here because we are for the children. We are here because we are  outraged at the way they have been mistreated by this administration.  We are tired of excuses as to why we can't protect the children. We are  moving forward with legislation that will protect the children against  any abuse at our border.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1045     Madam Speaker, I am a little confused. My Republican  friends say they want to delay things to have a CBO score, then they  say they want to get something to the President's desk right away. They  can talk all they want about a CBO score; we are going to talk about  the children.   It is an emergency, and what is happening to these children on the  border is unconscionable. It should weigh heavily on the hearts of  every single person in this Chamber--Democrats and Republicans, alike.   Enough is enough. We need to make sure that we not only provide the  necessary resources to alleviate this crisis, but we need to make sure  that those resources we provide are provided in such a way that they do  go to the purposes that we want them to go to.   And as far as the Department of Defense money, I mean, the bottom  line is this administration has been diverting funds from the  Department of Defense for this stupid wall, and they have created that  crisis.   The bottom line is we are here for the children, and, again, I urge  my colleagues to stop the bickering and get down to business. Let us  pass this rule; let us go on to pass the legislation; and let us get a  deal with the Senate that is better than what is on the table right  now.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am really puzzled here. Why is it that  the Senate can say no, but the House can't say no to something? Why is  it that we always have to do what the Senate wants?   If the gentleman is so enamored with the Senate, maybe he should work  over in the Senate.  [[Page H5225]]    But the bottom line is, those of us in the House deserve to have our  voices heard, and what we are saying here is that we want to provide a  bill that will alleviate this crisis, that will help the children.    I will not yield. I do not have enough time to yield.    Madam Speaker, I would like us to make sure we provide  resources to the border that actually alleviate the crisis.   I do not want to be part of an effort to send money to the border to  be diverted for whatever this President wants. He has shown us where he  is on this issue of the children and on the issue of immigration. And,  quite frankly, many of us on this side of the aisle--and, I think, some  on the other side of the aisle--are offended by that.   So we want to make sure, when we say we are providing relief to this  crisis that is affecting so many children, that, in fact, we are  providing relief to those children. And that is all we are saying here.   Madam Speaker, strengthening requirements for children's health, why  would anybody in the Senate want to be opposed to that?   Tightening restrictions for children's safety, people are dying in  our custody. We should want to prevent that from ever occurring again  by supporting nonprofits and community caring for children's well- being.   Madam Speaker, this stuff is something that should not be  controversial no matter how you look at it, and yet it is for my  Republican friends, and I regret that very much.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, let me remind my colleagues, this is not  the House bill that passed. This is a compromise that we have moved  forward.   And, again, here is what my friends are saying is partisan: that we  put into this bill that for children's health we must ensure a higher  standard for medical care, nutrition, and hygiene. That is what they  are calling partisan. That is what they are saying, oh, it is awful, we  can't move forward on that.   The bill we are putting forward, this compromise bill, will meet the  needs of the children. That is all that it does. So I don't know why we  in the House can't, in a bipartisan way, stand together and say: Look,  we want to improve on what the Senate did, and we want to guarantee  that the moneys we send actually go to help the children and not get  diverted to other things like we know this administration has a habit  of doing.   Madam Speaker, anybody who has seen the pictures in the newspapers  recently, anybody who has read the news articles, again, our hearts  should ache.   This is not America. This is not what our country is about. We can do  much, much better, and that is why we should move forward with  consideration.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, my colleagues have seen the pictures and they have  heard the stories. And if that is not convincing to them to move  forward, to increase protections for children who are held in our  custody, then I don't know what else to say.   What we are asking for here in this compromise bill that we are  moving forward is to make sure that there are stronger protections in  here, to make sure that the abuse that we have all read about and that  we have all seen stops and never, ever happens again. That is what this  is all about.   So I am at a loss because, to me, the evidence is overwhelming that  we need to provide stronger protections for these children. If my  colleagues disagree, then they can vote against the bill and against  consideration, but I would urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' so  that we can move forward with this rule in consideration of this bill  and get this passed as soon as possible and get on to either urging the  Senate to pass it or to continue in negotiation, but we can do better  than the Senate bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), the  ranking member of the Rules Committee, pending which I yield myself  such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution,  all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Mr. Speaker, today the Rules Committee met and reported  a rule, House Resolution 466, providing for consideration of the Senate  amendment to H.R. 3401. One hour of general debate has been provided,  controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on  Appropriations.   Mr. Speaker, I think, by now, we all have seen the horrific images  showing the bodies of Oscar Alberto Martinez Ramirez and his nearly 2- year-old daughter, Valeria. They were taken on Monday as these  Salvadoran migrants tried to cross the Rio Grande after leaving a  Mexican migrant camp. Like so many others, they were exercising their  legal right to seek asylum here in the United States. They wanted to be  free from the violence, gangs, poverty, and inequality that is rampant  in El Salvador, just as it is all across Central America.   I visited El Salvador and I visited Honduras recently, and, Mr.  Speaker, I saw the unbearable conditions with my own eyes. It is no  wonder that organizations like the United Nations Office on Drugs and  Crime have said this and other Central American countries are more  dangerous than Afghanistan and only slightly better than Syria.   Syria, Mr. Speaker, is the site of an ongoing civil war. Let that  sink in for a moment.   But, unfortunately, Alberto and Valeria didn't survive their journey.  Alberto's wife, Tania, was forced to watch in horror as a current  washed her family away.   I am telling their story today because this is what migrants face as  they risk their lives to come to this country--not to transport drugs,  not to commit crimes, as the President suggests, but to find refuge, to  raise their daughter in a safe place, and to have a chance at building  a better life, a life that they could only find in America.   Isn't this what each of us wants for our own families?   They came to present themselves at a legal port of entry and to seek  legal asylum, as is their right under U.S. law.   And they weren't the only ones to die. Just this past weekend, Border  Patrol agents found four more bodies in the river west of Brownsville,  Texas: three more young children and a young woman in her twenties.   Every single week, people drown in the river and perish in the  deserts, invisible and unknown.   It wasn't too long ago that we celebrated how immigration made our  country stronger, whether it was a Democratic or a Republican  administration.   I am reminded of President Reagan's final speech in office, where he  said:         Anybody, from any corner of the world, can come to America       to live and become an American. This, I believe, is one of       the most important sources of America's greatness.    But, Mr. Speaker, the Trump administration apparently has the  complete opposite view of immigration. They don't celebrate it; they  demonize it.   Consider what may have happened to Oscar and his family if they did  make it to our border, forced to sleep on concrete floors with the  lights on 24 hours a day, with no soap, no medicine, maybe not even a  toothbrush, Valeria separated from her parents, because that is what  migrants are forced to endure at border facilities under this  President.  [[Page H5227]]    A physician who visited one recently said: ``The conditions within  which they are held could be compared to torture facilities.''   Mr. Speaker, when Lady Liberty encourages us to give her our poor,  huddled masses, I don't think she means so the administration can turn  around and throw them in a cage. I don't think she lifts her torch so  their legal plight could be criminalized and crying children could be  ripped from the arms of their parents.   But that is what is happening under this President, and, Mr. Speaker,  it is sickening. It should tear at the hearts of every single Member of  this House, whether they are Democrats or Republicans.   This week, the House passed bipartisan emergency legislation to  address this humanitarian crisis at the border. The Senate had its own  ideas. So, today, we are back with a compromise to get a bill quickly  signed into law.   This is a compromise that lives up to our core values and protects  children and families. It adds critical protections for children who  were included in the House version of the bill. It includes language to  improve care for children by forcing influx facilities to comply with  the Flores settlement and capping, at 90 days, the amount of time a  child can spend in such a facility.   We are also reducing funding for ICE, while rejecting additional and  unnecessary dollars for the Pentagon.   This is a crisis, Mr. Speaker. We cannot treat compromise as though  it is a dirty word, not when migrants are literally losing their lives  in unsafe, unhealthy, and unsanitary conditions and children are being  torn apart from their families. That is what is at stake here.   The horrors at detention centers shouldn't get lost in the latest  tweet-a-thon by the President, just as the plight of migrants shouldn't  go unseen by the American people. This should shake our conscience and  make clear the urgent need to act.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the  underlying bill, and let's send a message to the President and to the  world that America is better than this. This is not who we are, what is  happening at our border.   Mr. Speaker, I would just say one final thing. In the compromise  package today that seems to bother so many people are merely items that  would protect the well-being of these children, that would provide more  transparency. For the life of me, I don't understand the controversy. I  don't understand why we can't make the Senate bill better, why we can't  do more for these children.   I know my colleagues on the other side of the aisle feel as we do,  that what is happening is unacceptable. Let us strengthen that bill.  Let us actually give a bill to the President that we all know will help  these children.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I do not yield for that purpose. All  time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I want to assure the distinguished minority leader that I am not  asking Members of Congress to vote for what we are bringing before the  House today based on their party. I am asking Members to vote their  conscience.   And to be totally frank, we want to make sure there are protections  built in this legislation so that funds are not misused as they have  been in the past; so we don't see any more children being abused; so we  don't see the mismanagement that we have witnessed.   With all due respect to the Senate majority leader, and to many of my  friends on the other side of the aisle, when children were being ripped  apart from their parents, we heard silence. When we read about the  terrible conditions that these children were in, being denied soap, and  toothpaste, and toothbrushes, and not being cared for, we heard  silence.   When we saw the picture of Oscar and Valeria dead, trying to seek  asylum in this country, there is nothing.   So the bottom line is, we want to get this done, and we will stay  here as long as it takes, I assure the minority leader. We are not  going anywhere.   But we are going to stand for the children, and that is what our  purpose is here today.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania  (Ms. Scanlon), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    I yield the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania an additional  30 seconds.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record two articles,  one from The New York Times entitled: `` `There is a Stench': Soiled  Clothes and No Baths for Migrant Children at a Texas Center''; the  other, `` `The Taliban Gave Me Toothpaste': Former Captives Contrast  U.S. Treatment of Child Migrants.''                  [From the New York Times, June 21, 2019]  `There Is a Stench': Soiled Clothes and No Baths for Migrant Chidren at                               a Texas Center                           (By Caitlin Dickerson)         A chaotic scene of sickness and filth is unfolding in an       overcrowded border station in Clint, Tex., where hundreds of       young people who have recently crossed the border are being       held, according to lawyers who visited the facility this       week. Some of the children have been there for nearly a       month.        Children as young as 7 and 8, many of them wearing clothes       caked with snot and tears, are caring for infants they've       just met, the lawyers said. Toddlers without diapers are       relieving themselves in their pants. Teenage mothers are       wearing clothes stained with breast milk.        Most of the young detainees have not been able to shower or       wash their clothes since they arrived at the facility, those       who visited said. They have no access to toothbrushes,       toothpaste or soap.        [Hundreds of migrant children have now been transferred out       of the facility.]        ``There is a stench,'' said Elora Mukherjee, director of       the Immigrants' Rights Clinic at Columbia Law School, one of       the lawyers who visited the facility. ``The overwhelming       majority of children have not bathed since they crossed the       border.''        Conditions at Customs and Border Protection facilities       along the border have been an issue of increasing concern as       officials warn that the recent large influx of migrant       families has driven many of the facilities well past their       capacities. The border station in Clint is only one of those       with problems.        In May, the inspector general for the Department of       Homeland Security warned of ``dangerous overcrowding'' among       adult migrants housed at the border processing center in El       Paso, with up to 900 migrants being held at a facility       designed for 125. In some cases, cells designed for 35 people       were holding 155 people.        ``Border Patrol agents told us some of the detainees had       been held in standing-room-only conditions for days or       weeks,'' the inspector general's office said in its report,       which noted that some detainees were observed standing on       toilets in the cells ``to make room and gain breathing space,       thus limiting access to the toilets.''        Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas on Friday announced the       deployment of 1,000 new National Guard troops to the border       to help respond to the continuing new arrivals, which the       governor said have amounted to more than 45,000 people from       52 countries over the past three weeks.        ``The crisis at our southern border is unlike anything       we've witnessed before and has put an enormous strain on the       existing resources we have in place,'' Mr. Abbott said,       adding, ``Congress is a group of reprobates for not       addressing the crisis on our border.''        The number of border crossings appears to have slowed in       recent weeks, possibly as a result of a crackdown by the       Mexican government under pressure from President Trump, but       the numbers remain high compared to recent years. The       overcrowding crisis has been unfolding invisibly, with       journalists and lawyers offered little access to fenced-off       border facilities.        The reports of unsafe and unsanitary conditions at Clint       and elsewhere came days after government lawyers in court       argued that they should not have to provide soap or       toothbrushes to children under the legal settlement that gave       Ms. Mukherjee and her colleagues access to the facility in       Clint. The result of a lawsuit that was first settled in       1997, the settlement set the standards for the detention,       treatment and release of migrant minors taken into federal       immigration custody.        Ms. Mukherjee is part of a team of lawyers who has for       years under the settlement been allowed to inspect government       facilities where migrant children are detained. She and her       colleagues traveled to Clint this week after learning that       border officials had begun detaining minors who had recently       crossed the border there.        She said the conditions in Clint were the worst she had       seen in any facility in her 12-year career. ``So many       children are sick, they have the flu, and they're not being       properly treated,'' she said. The Associated Press, which       first reported on conditions at the facility earlier this       week, found that it was housing three infants, all with teen       mothers, along with a 1-year-old, two 2-year-olds and a 3-      year-old. It said there were dozens more children under the       age of 12.        Ms. Mukherjee said children were being overseen by guards       for Customs and Border Protection, which declined to comment       for this story. She and her colleagues observed the guards       wearing full uniforms--including weapons--as well as face       masks to protect themselves from the unsanitary conditions.        Together, the group of six lawyers met with 60 children in       Clint this week who ranged from 5 months to 17 years old. The       infants were either children of minor parents, who were also       detained, or had been separated from adult family members       with whom they had crossed the border. The separated children       were now alone, being cared for by other young detainees.        ``The children are locked in their cells and cages nearly       all day long,'' Ms. Mukherjee said. ``A few of the kids said       they had some opportunities to go outside and play, but they       said they can't bring themselves to play because they are       trying to stay alive in there.''        When the lawyers arrived, federal officials said that more       than 350 children were detained at the facility. The       officials did not disclose the facility's capacity but said       the population had exceeded it. By the time the lawyers left       on Wednesday night, border officials told them that about 200       of the children had been transferred elsewhere but did not       say where they had been sent.        ``That's what's keeping me up at night,'' Ms. Mukherjee       said.        Some sick children were being quarantined in the facility.       The lawyers were allowed to speak to the children by phone,       but their requests to meet with them in person and observe       the conditions they were being held in were denied.        The children told the lawyers they were given the same       meals every day--instant oats for breakfast, instant noodles       for lunch, a frozen burrito for dinner, along with a few       cookies and juice packets--which many said was not enough.       ``Nearly every child I spoke with said that they were       hungry,'' Ms. Mukherjee said.  [[Page H5232]]         Another group of lawyers conducting inspections under the       same federal court settlement said they discovered similar       conditions earlier this month at six other facilities in       Texas. At the Border Patrol's Central Processing Center in       McAllen, Tex.--often known as ``Ursula''--the lawyers       encountered a 17-year-old mother from Guatemala who couldn't       stand because of complications from an emergency C-section,       and who was caring for a sick and dirty premature baby.        ``When we encountered the baby and her mom, the baby was       filthy. They wouldn't give her any water to wash her. And I       took a Kleenex and I washed around her neck black dirt,''       said Hope Frye, who was leading the group, adding, ``Not a       little stuff--dirt.''        After government lawyers argued in the Ninth Circuit Court       of Appeals in San Francisco this week that amenities such as       soap and toothbrushes should not be mandated under the legal       settlement originally agreed to between the government and       migrant families in 1997 and amended several times since       then, all three judges voiced dismay.        Among the guidelines set under the legal settlement are       that facilities for children must be ``safe and sanitary.''        The Justice Department's lawyer, Sarah Fabian, argued that       the settlement agreement did not specify the need to supply       hygienic items and that, therefore, the government did not       need to do so.        ``Are you arguing seriously that you do not read the       agreement as requiring you to do anything other than what I       just described: cold all night long, lights on all night       long, sleeping on concrete and you've got an aluminum foil       blanket?'' Judge William Fletcher asked Ms. Fabian. ``I find       that inconceivable that the government would say that is safe       and sanitary.''                                   ____       `The Taliban Gave me Toothpaste': Former Captives Contrast U.S.                        Treatment of Child Migrants                              (By Deanna Paul)                              [June 25, 2019]         The federal government told a panel of Ninth Circuit       appellate judges last week that U.S. border detention       facilities are ``safe and sanitary,'' as required by law,       even though migrant children are denied soap, toothbrushes       and dark places to sleep.        Judge William A. Fletcher called the position of Sarah       Fabian, a senior attorney from the Office of Immigration       Litigation, ``inconceivable.''        Senior U.S. Circuit Judge A. Wallace Tashima told the       government attorney, ``If you don't have a toothbrush, if you       don't have soap, if you don't have a blanket, it's not safe       and sanitary.''        Fabian's argument spread rapidly across the Internet--and       so did several tweets supporting the notion that the United       States treats migrant detainees less humanely than foreign       pirates and the Taliban treat their captives.        American journalist Michael Scott Moore, abducted in 2012       while reporting in Somalia, watched Fabian argue that minimal       necessities, like toiletries and sleeping conditions, were       not essential to meet minimum ``safe and sanitary''       standards.        ``That was--let's say--below my experience in Somalia,'' he       told The Washington Post Tuesday of his more than two years       in captivity.        ``The conditions were about as miserable as you could       imagine,'' he said, describing a barren and concrete prison       house. Often there was no electricity, he said, ``but we had       certain minimum things that kept it from being completely       wretched.''        He said he was given toothpaste, soap, a daily shower and a       foam mattress.        Recent reports have surfaced describing U.S. border       detainees held in cages of chain-link fencing, sleeping on       concrete and covered with blankets made of aluminum foil,       allegations that Customs and Border Protection officials       dispute.        On Tuesday, the agency said that children in custody       receive ``continuous access to hygiene products and adequate       food'' while awaiting shelter placement.        Somali pirates gave me toothpaste & soap. https:// twitter.com/nowthisnews/status/1142151178177978368 . . .        An executive editor at newyorker.com, David Rohde,       contributed to the online conversation, too.        ``The Taliban gave me toothpaste & soap,'' he wrote on       Twitter, drawing from the seven months he spent as a hostage       of the Taliban. Rohde said he was not abused in their       custody, though the group is known for abusing its captives.        The online thread with former prisoners has been liked       nearly half a million times. Washington Post Global opinions       writer Jason Rezaian, who was held in Iranian custody for a       year and a half and has an ongoing lawsuit against the       Iranian government, also responded on Twitter.        ``I felt if I didn't chime in, it would be the height of       hypocrisy,'' Rezaian told The Post on Tuesday, calling U.S.       treatment of children at the border misaligned with ``what       this country stands for.'' ``The government is treating them       like they're statistics, `the other' and not deserving of       basic humanity.''        From the first day in captivity, Rezaian was permitted to       shower regularly. He was also given a toothbrush and       toothpaste. Rezaian asked, ``If we're going to treat the most       vulnerable people this way, what does that say about our       actual values?''        I had a toothbrush and toothpaste--not exactly Aquafresh or       Tom's--from the first night. Actually, I had almost nothing       else in my cell while I was in solitary confinement. I was       allowed to shower every couple of days. https://twitter.com/  yashar/status/1142546005688311808 . . .        The case heard on Tuesday stems from a motion filed under       the Obama administration. In part, it argued that Customs and       Border Protection was holding children in detention       facilities that were not ``safe and sanitary,'' in violation       of a 1997 precedent.        The Trump administration, however, opted to bring the       appeal, asking the panel of three judges to condone current       custody conditions.     Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Escobar).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume. What we just witnessed was really interesting. In the amount  of time that it took my friends on the other side of the aisle to get  through those antics, we could have passed this bill. That is what  urgency looks like. Not political theater. These kids that we are here  to try to protect deserve more than grandstanding. They deserve things  like medicine. They deserve things like soap and clothing.   And my Republican friends say they don't want to waste time, but they  wasted a hell of a lot of time with what we just saw happen.   And just one other observation. In all the other editorial comments  that were made, I didn't hear the word ``children'' mentioned once. I  mean, it is telling, because that is what this debate is all about. It  is not about grandstanding, and it is not about more money for cages to  put kids in. It is about the children. And I am sorry that the children  who are suffering under U.S. custody are such an afterthought.   And to the gentleman from Michigan, I am outraged, too. I am outraged  that the terrible conditions that these kids have been forced to  experience happened under U.S. custody. I am outraged that that would  happen in the United States of America.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut  (Ms. DeLauro), the distinguished chairwoman of the Appropriations  Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and  Related Agencies.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Connecticut  an additional 1 minute.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record two articles:  One from Vox, entitled, ``The Horrifying Conditions Facing Kids in  Border Detention, Explained,'' and another from Time magazine,  entitled, ``Lawyers Say Migrant Children Are Living in `Traumatic and  Dangerous' Conditions at Border Detention Site.''                         [From Vox, June 25, 2019]    The Horrifying Conditions Facing Kids in Border Detention, Explained                               (By Dara Lind)         On any given day, 2,000 children are in Border Patrol       custody, and the problems are hardly confined to one       facility.        At any given time, for the past several weeks, more than       2,000 children have been held in the custody of US Border       Patrol without their parents. Legally, they're not supposed       to be held by border agents for more than 72 hours before       being sent to the Department of Health and Human Services,       which is responsible for finding their nearest relative in       the US to house them while their immigration cases are       adjudicated.        In practice, they're being held for days, sometimes weeks,       in facilities without enough food or toothbrushes--going days       without showering, overcrowded and undercared for.        Late last week, the conditions of that detention in one       facility in Clint, Texas, became public when investigators,       checking on the US government's obligations under the Flores       agreement (which governs the care of immigrant children in US       custody), were so horrified that they turned into public       whistleblowers and spoke to the Associated Press about what       they saw.        The stories they told have horrified much of America. The       past several days have seen growing outrage, and the acting       commissioner of Customs and Border Protection (which oversees       CBP) announced his resignation Tuesday (though officials       maintain the outrage didn't cause the resignation).        But the problem goes beyond one official--or one facility.        The story gained even wider traction after Rep. Alexandria       Ocasio-Cortez's (D-NY) reference to the detention facilities       as ``concentration camps,'' and the ensuing debate over       whether that term was appropriate.        The US government's response was to move the children out       of the Clint facility--and move another group of children in.        On Monday, officials confirmed that all 350 of the children       there last week would be moved to other facilities by       Tuesday; about 250 of them have been placed with HHS, and the       remainder are being sent to other Border Patrol facilities.       But on Tuesday morning, a Customs and Border Protection       official told a New York Times reporter on a press call that       about a hundred children were currently being housed at       Clint.        That's illustrative of the hectic improvisation that's       characterized much of the Trump administration's response to       the current border influx. It's a problem that is much, much       bigger than the problems at a single facility. Indeed, the       problems investigators identified at Clint are problems       elsewhere as well.        The lone member of the team of legal investigators who       visited the El Paso facility in which many children were sent       from Clint--called ``Border Patrol Station 1''--told Vox that       conditions there were just as bad as they were in Clint, with       the same problems of insufficient food, no toothbrushes, and       aggressive guards.        The problem isn't the Clint facility. The problem is the       hastily-cobbled-together system of facilities Customs and       Border Protection (the agency which runs Border Patrol) has       thrown together in the last several months, as the       unprecedented number of families and children coming into the       US without papers has overwhelmed a system designed to       swiftly deport single adults.        It is apparent that even an administration acting with the       best interests of children in mind at every turn would be       scrambling right now. But policymakers are split on how much       of the current crisis is simply a resource problem--one       Congress could help by sending more resources--and how much       is deliberate mistreatment or neglect from an administration       that doesn't deserve any more money or trust.        Border Patrol isn't prepared to care for children at all.       It's now housing 2,000 a day.        According to statistics sent to congressional staff last       week and obtained by Vox, between May 14 and June 13, US       Border Patrol facilities were housing over 14,000 people a       day--and sometimes as many as 18,000. (The most recent tally,       as of June 13, was nearly 16,000.)        Most of these were single adults, or parents with children.       But consistently, over that month, around 2,000--2,081 as of       June 13--were ``unaccompanied alien children,'' or children       being held without adult relatives in separate facilities.        In an early June press call, a Customs and Border       Protection official said, referring to the total number of       people in custody, ``when we have 4,000 in custody, we       consider that high. 6,000 is a crisis.''        Traditionally, an ``unaccompanied alien child'' refers to a       child who comes to the US without a parent or guardian.       Increasingly--as lawyers have been reporting, and as the       investigators who interviewed children in detention last week       confirmed--children are coming to the US with a relative who       is not their parent, and being separated.        Because the law defines an ``unaccompanied'' child as       someone without a parent or legal guardian here, border       agents don't have the ability to keep a child with a       grandparent, aunt or uncle, or even a sibling who's over 18,       though advocates have also raised concerns that border agents       are separating relatives even when there is evidence of legal       guardianship.        Under the terms of US law--and especially the 1997 Flores       settlement, which governs the treatment of children in       immigration custody--immigration agents are obligated to get       unaccompanied children out of immigration detention as       quickly as possible, and to keep them in the least       restrictive conditions possible while they're there. Barring       emergencies, children aren't supposed to be  [[Page H5237]]       in Border Patrol custody for more than 72 hours before being       sent to HHS--which is responsible for finding and vetting a       sponsor to house the child (usually their closest relative in       the United States).        That hasn't been happening. Attorneys, doctors, and human       rights observers have consistently reported that children are       being held by Border Patrol for days or longer before being       picked up by HHS. And in the meantime, they're being kept in       facilities that weren't built to hold even adults for that       period of time, or in improvised ``soft-sided'' facilities       that look like (and are commonly referred to as) tents.        The detention conditions crisis doesn't just affect       children. But conditions for children are under special legal       scrutiny.        Since late last year, US immigration agents have been       overwhelmed by the number of families coming across the       border. The US immigration system, which was built to quickly       arrest and deport single Mexican adults crossing into the US       to work, doesn't have the capacity to deal with tens of       thousands of families (mostly from Central America) who are       often seeking asylum in the US.        The length of time migrants are spending in Border Patrol       custody (and the conditions there) have attracted some alarm       before. In April, pictures of migrants being held outside       under a bridge in El Paso, fenced in and sleeping on the       ground, attracted outrage and led Border Patrol to stop       holding migrants there. And in May, the DHS Office of the       Inspector General released an emergency report about       dangerous overcrowding of adults in two facilities: with up       to 900 people being held in a facility designed to hold 125.        Because of the Flores settlement, lawyers have the       opportunity to investigate conditions for children to see if       the government is complying--and possibly ask a judge to       intervene if it is not. That's what spurred the fact-finding       mission that led to last week's stories.        The reports about Clint broke at a time when the Trump       administration was already playing defense about its       compliance with the Flores settlement. (While the       administration is working on a regulation that would       supersede the terms of the agreement, that regulation isn't       expected to be published in final form until fall, and may       well be held up in court.)        In a 9th Circuit Court of Appeals hearing earlier last week       about whether the administration needed to allow a court       appointee to monitor conditions for children in ICE and CBP       custody, Department of Justice lawyer Sarah Fabian told       judges that children didn't necessarily need towels or       toothbrushes to be in ``safe and sanitary'' conditions--a       clip that looked especially bad when the Clint stories came       out showing the children were being denied just that.        The court hearing was not specifically about the Clint       facility--it wasn't about what investigators found last week       at all. And as Ken White explained for the Atlantic, Fabien's       cringeworthy ``safe and sanitary'' argument came from the       awkward stance the Trump administration has taken in this       litigation: In order to challenge the court appointment of a       special monitor, they argued that there's a difference       between a promise to keep kids in ``safe and sanitary''       conditions (which the government has agreed to for decades)       and a guarantee of particular items like toothbrushes.        The court appeared unimpressed. And the stories about Clint       and other facilities that have come out in the ensuing days       certainly bolstered the case that the Trump administration       has either willingly violated its agreement to keep kids safe       and healthy, or has been unable to keep it--or a mix of both.        The problem isn't Clint.        The problems that investigators identified at Clint--too       many people, not enough food, no toothbrushes--weren't       inherent to that facility. They were indications of an       overloaded (or neglected) system.        And it's already clear that those problems go beyond Clint.        ABC News obtained testimony from a doctor who visited       another facility for children in Texas--the Ursula facility--      and witnessed ``extreme cold temperatures, lights on 24 hours       a day, no adequate access to medical care, basic sanitation,       water, or adequate food.'' She said the conditions were so       bad that they were ``tantamount to intentionally causing the       spread of disease.''        The children are now being sent from Clint to a facility       that is just as bad, according to Clara Long of Human Rights       Watch, who was the only member of last week's investigative       team who visited it.        Long told Vox that when she was there, the facility in El       Paso known as ``Border Patrol Station 1'' was mostly being       used as a transit center where migrants were staying only a       few hours before going elsewhere. But she spoke to one family       who had been held in a cell there for six days, and who       voiced the same concerns that children in the Clint facility       did.        The mother of the family, Long said, was so ashamed of not       having clean teeth--the El Paso facility, like Clint, wasn't       providing enough toothbrushes--that ``when she was talking to       you she would put her hand up in front of her mouth and       wouldn't take it down.'' The teenage son said he was afraid       of the guards because when he'd gotten up to go to the       bathroom in the middle of the night, a guard had shoved him       back into his cell and slammed the door on him. For two       nights, the family had had to sleep on the cold floor without       blankets.        The fundamental question: Why is it taking so long to get       kids out of custody--and is it happening on purpose?        Most of the children who were at Clint when the team       visited last week--about 250 of the 350--were set to be sent       to HHS custody by Tuesday.        Questions remain about what is happening to the other 1,750       or so children who were in Border Patrol detention on       Thursday if levels have remained static since mid-June, and       why the government was able to place only 250 children over       five days with the agency that's supposed to take       responsibility for all children within 72 hours.        It's not clear where the bureaucratic breakdown really is--      and whether it's the result of resource constraints or       choices about how resources are used.        The Trump administration definitely has made a choice to       keep single adults in detention, even if it could release       them. Border Patrol chief Carla Provost has told Congress       that ``if we lose (the ability to keep and deport) single       adults, we lose the border.'' That does raise questions about       whether the overcrowding in adult facilities could be       avoided.        But it doesn't address the issue of unaccompanied children,       who can't simply be released with a notice to appear in       immigration court. While children with parents in the US       could theoretically be placed with those parents, the       government is supposed to vet potential sponsors to make sure       it's not placing children with traffickers--but that's the       job of HHS, and the vetting doesn't begin until children are       released from Border Patrol custody.        Observers and policymakers agree that HHS simply doesn't       have the capacity to take migrant kids in. One Democratic       Hill staffer compared it to a ``jigsaw puzzle'': Not only are       there only so many spaces available to place a child, but the       facilities available might not match the child's particular       needs. (You can't put an infant in an HHS shelter for teens,       for example.) But another Hill staffer told Vox that HHS       claims it's never refused a transfer for space reasons,       muddying the waters.        Then there's the question of whether CBP is really doing       all it can to care for kids in the time they're in CBP's       care.        One of the Clint observers told Isaac Chotiner of the New       Yorker stories of cruelty from some guards, indicating that       they were deliberately punishing children for the sin of       coming to the US without papers. But she also said that many       guards were sympathetic, and told the observers that children       shouldn't be in their custody--implying that they were doing       the best they could and simply didn't have the resources to       do more. (Advocates also say they've tried to donate supplies       to Border Patrol facilities but had their donations rejected;       it's not clear if this was a Border Patrol decision, or if       there's a legal complication banning outside donations.)        Congress is considering a package right now to give the       Trump administration billions more dollars to deal with       migrants coming into the US. To Democratic leadership,       including the appropriators led by Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard       (D-CA), who drafted the House version of the supplemental       package, the solution to poor conditions in custody is to       provide more money specifically to improve those conditions.       They emphasize that the bulk of the funding will go to HHS to       increase capacity for migrant kids and that funding for ICE       and CBP will be strictly limited to humanitarian use.        But to some progressives, led in Congress by Alexandria       Ocasio-Cortez, giving any money to immigration enforcement       agencies right now is an endorsement of the current state of       affairs.        The not-one-more-dime camp, in part, is taking a bright-      line stance against the detention of children. But in part,       they're demonstrating a lack of trust in the administration       to adhere to any law or condition. And they assume that any       money given to ICE for transit of migrant kids will, in some       way or another, encourage ICE to detain more families and       arrest more immigrants in the United States.        The ``smart money'' camp, on the other hand, believes       firmly that without funds to improve conditions in detention,       the conditions will only get worse.        That's especially relevant in the case of kids deemed       ``unaccompanied,'' who have to remain in custody until a       sponsor is found. The past few days have demonstrated that       those children are extremely vulnerable and that much of the       American public wants their situation to change. It just may       not be clear how.                                   ____                          [From Time, June 20, 2019]   Lawyers Say Migrant Children Are Living in `Traumatic and Dangerous'                    Conditions at Border Detention Site          (By Ccedar Attanasio, Garance Burke and Martha Mendoza)         Clint, Texas.--In a tiny Texas town about a half-hour drive       from El Paso, a nondescript Border Patrol station operated       for six years primarily as a hub for agents on patrol,       drawing little scrutiny from immigration attorneys who have       been loudly advocating against mass U.S. detention camps that       can hold more than 2,000 teens at a time.        And so attorneys visiting the Border Patrol station in       Clint, Texas, this week said they were shocked to find more       than 250 infants, children and teens inside the complex of       windowless buildings, trying to care for each other with what       they described as inadequate food, water and sanitation.       ``This facility wasn't even on our radar before we  [[Page H5238]]       came down here,'' said law professor Warren Binford, a member       of the team that has interviewed 60 detainees in Clint.        Binford's group warned that because Customs and Border       Protection facilities are overwhelmed with migrants, they       feared similar situations could be unfolding elsewhere.        Attorney Toby Gialluca, who visited teens and their babies       last week in a McAllen, Texas, Border Patrol station, said       everyone she interviewed was very sick with high fevers,       coughing, and wearing soiled clothes crusted with mucus and       dirt after their long trip north. Fifteen kids at Clint had       the flu, another 10 were quarantined. ``Everyone is sick.       Everyone. They're using their clothes to wipe mucus off the       children, wipe vomit off the children. Most of the little       children are not fully clothed,'' she said.        Migrant teens in McAllen told her they were offered frozen       ham sandwiches and rotten food, Gialluca said. In both       stations, the children told attorneys that guards instructed       girls as young as age 8 to care for the babies and toddlers.        Border Patrol stations are designed to hold people for less       than three days, but some children held in Clint and McAllen       have been in there for weeks. Legally, migrants under 18       should be moved into Office of Refugee Resettlement care       within 72 hours.        But federal officials have said they have hit a breaking       point, with too many migrant children and nowhere to put       them. That's in part because over the last year, migrant       children have been staying longer in federal custody than       they had historically, meaning there are fewer shelter beds       in the separate Office of Refugee and Resettlement program       where kids are sent from the Border Patrol stations.        Unlike privately contracted child detention facilities,       Border Patrol stations are federal facilities, exempt from       state health and safety standards, according to Texas       Department of Health and Human Services spokesman John       Reynolds. Child abuse and neglect investigators are not       allowed to investigate the stations because they not licensed       by the state.        In Clint, Binford described that during interviews with       children in a conference room at the facility, ``little kids       are so tired they have been falling asleep on chairs and at       the conference table.'' An 8-year-old taking care of a very       small 4-year-old with matted hair could not convince the       younger girl to take a shower, Binford said.        The lawyers inspected the Border Patrol facilities as part       of a President Bill Clinton-era legal agreement known as the       Flores settlement that governs detention conditions for       migrant children and families.        Neha Desai, director of Immigration at the National Center       for Youth Law, said Friday that the U.S. government,       attorneys involved in the Flores settlement and an       independent monitor appointed by the judge overseeing the       Flores settlement are in conversation about the situation of       children held in McAllen and Clint.        The Clint facility opened in 2013 with little fanfare on a       country road not far from the town's water tower, a liquor       store and the sandwich shop where Border Patrol agents eat       lunch and dinner. The advocate lawyers who negotiated access       to the complex said Border Patrol officials knew of their       impending visit three weeks in advance.        Customs and Border Protection officials had no immediate       comment, but have said for months that the agency is at its       breaking point for housing migrants, calling the situation in       the El Paso area a humanitarian and security crisis.        In an interview earlier this week with The Associated       Press, Customs and Border Protection John Sanders       acknowledged that children died after being in the agency's       care, and said Border Patrol stations are currently holding       15,000 people--more than three times their maximum capacity       of 4,000.        He urged Congress to pass a $4.6 billion emergency funding       package includes nearly $3 billion to care for unaccompanied       migrant children.        A migrant father, speaking on condition of anonymity       because of his immigration status, said he did not know where       his daughter was until one of the attorneys visiting Clint       this week found his phone number written in permanent marker       on a bracelet the girl was wearing. ``She's suffering very       much because she's never been alone. She doesn't know these       other children,'' her father said.        Republican Congressman Will Hurd, whose district includes       Clint, said ``tragic conditions'' playing out on the southern       border were pushing government agencies, nonprofits and Texas       communities to the limit.        ``This latest development just further demonstrates the       immediate need to reform asylum laws and provide supplemental       funding to address the humanitarian crisis at our border,''       he said.     Madam Speaker, before I yield to our next speaker, I  would remind my colleagues that a vote to defeat the previous question  really isn't a vote to bring up the Senate bill. It is a vote to give  control of the House floor to the Republicans.   They say they would bring up the Senate bill, but there is absolutely  no guarantee that they would. They could bring up a bill to fund a  wall, for all we know.   Madam Speaker, we are here to find a way to alleviate the suffering  of these children at our border and not to play political games. So I  would urge my colleagues to make sure that they vote ``yes'' on the  previous question.   And, by the way, I just say to my colleague from Oklahoma, a lot of  us aren't satisfied with the Senate bill the way it has been drafted  because there are protections that we want to see in that bill because,  quite frankly, speaking for myself, I don't trust this administration.   I don't trust this administration to do the right thing, an  administration that separated--knowingly and deliberately separated-- children from their parents at the border, an administration that  tolerated the conditions that have horrified the entire country.   So I want it clear that the moneys that we are appropriating are  going to help children, not to continue this insane inhumane policy  that has horrified this Nation.   I won't trust this administration to tell me the correct time, at  this particular point. So, no, we are not satisfied. We want more  protections in here for the children. We want more transparency. The  American people, I think, expect that. We should provide them that  information.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Mrs. Torres), the distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30  seconds.    Madam Speaker, I would like to remind the gentlewoman  that we are members of the Democratic Party, not the Democrat Party,  and I would appreciate it if we were characterized correctly.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Mucarsel-Powell).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Florida.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Ms. Tlaib).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time is  remaining.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Cardenas).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from California.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H5241]]         Madam Speaker, I think what is so frustrating to so  many of us is that there is controversy around language to guarantee  the protection of these children. The reason we think that is important  is because this administration has ignored all the warnings.   We have had whistleblowers talk about the abuse at the border and how  these children were being mistreated, and they did nothing.   This administration oversaw a policy of literally tearing children  away from their parents. As a dad, I can't imagine what that must be  like for any of those parents, and yet this administration thought it  was fine.   We have a crisis at the border largely as a result of this  President's policies. We need to deal with it, and we need to deal with  it now. But we want to make sure we are actually dealing with the  crisis and not giving him more money to create other crises.   I appreciate what the gentleman from Oklahoma said about the need for  us to continue to work together, and while these negotiations are  continuing.   Madam Speaker, I withdraw the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 466 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 466         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R.       3401) making emergency supplemental appropriations for the       fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, and for other       purposes, with the Senate amendment thereto, and to consider       in the House, without intervention of any point of order, a       motion offered by the chair of the Committee on       Appropriations or her designee that the House concur in the       Senate amendment with an amendment consisting of the text of       Rules Committee Print 116-21. The Senate amendment and the       motion shall be  [[Page H5242]]       considered as read. The motion shall be debatable for one       hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Appropriations. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       motion to its adoption without intervening motion.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Mr. Speaker, we had a robust debate here today  surrounding the tragedy that is unfolding on our southern border where  children are being ripped from their families; forced to sleep on cold  concrete floors; denied soap, medicine, diapers--I could go on and on  and on--all because of the President's failed policies.   That is what many of us believe, and that is what most national and  international human rights organizations have also made clear.   Quite frankly, this should shake all of us to our core. I, for one,  am very disappointed, and I will never forget the images and the  stories. I will continue to fight for a better outcome and fight for  these kids.   Having said all of that, it has been decided that we should move  forward, so we are amending this rule so we can take up the Senate- passed bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Oklahoma  working with us. We have spent many hours up in the Rules Committee and  on the floor, and I know he is committed to trying to get this issue  right.                      Amendment Offered by Mr. McGovern     Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the amendment and on the resolution.   The previous question was ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 322,  nays 85, not voting 25, as follows:                               [Roll No. 426]                                 YEAS--322       Adams      Aguilar      Allen      Allred      Amodei      Armstrong      Arrington      Axne      Babin      Bacon      Baird      Balderson      Banks      Barr      Bass      Beatty      Bera      Bergman      Bilirakis      Bishop (GA)      Bishop (UT)      Bost      Boyle, Brendan F.
