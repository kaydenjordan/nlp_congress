Sec. 3.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 5788) to       provide for the processing by U.S. Customs and Border       Protection of certain international mail shipments and to       require the provision of advance electronic information on       international mail shipments of mail, and for other purposes.       All points of order against consideration of the bill are       waived. In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a       substitute recommended by the Committee on Ways and Means now       printed in the bill, the amendment in the nature of a       substitute printed in part C of the report of the Committee       on Rules accompanying this resolution, modified by the       amendment printed in part D of that report, shall be       considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the bill, as amended, are waived. The previous question shall       be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any       further amendment thereto, to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Ways and Means; and (2) one motion       to recommit with or without instructions.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the  underlying legislation. This rule provides for consideration of three  bills intended to give our country more necessary tools to tackle the  opioid crisis.   The three bills this rule makes in order today were all reported  favorably by their committees. H.R. 5735, the Transitional Housing for  Recovery in Viable Environments Demonstration Program Act, was the  subject of a hearing by the Committee on Financial Services on April 17  and was reported favorably on May 22 with a bipartisan vote of 34  ``yes'' votes.   H.R. 2851, the Stop the Importation and Trafficking of Synthetic  Analogues Act, was the subject of hearing by the Committee on the  Judiciary in June of 2017, and was reported favorably in July of 2017  by a unanimous voice vote.   The final bill made in order by this bill is H.R. 5788, the Securing  the International Mail Against Opioids Act, which was reported  favorably in May with a unanimous voice vote.   Together, these three bills provide the foundation of the House's  legislative response this week to the opioid crisis which is wrecking  lives and communities across this country.   Mr. Speaker, the eastern plains of Colorado has been my home for many  decades. I often refer to the area as God's country. It is full of  goodhearted, hardworking people who care for their families and  neighbors. Many of these people work the land and provide services to  those who do. They farm, they ranch, they produce energy resources,  they transport livestock.   And when hardship and disaster strikes, neighbors move heaven and  Earth to help each other. They grieve over loss and bear each other's  burdens. However, it is not an unfamiliar refrain to hear that in the  heart of this God's country is a disease plaguing our people.   All across this land, in rural towns, suburban developments, and  urban neighborhoods, abuse of opioids is wrecking people's lives.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,  approximately 64,000 Americans died of a drug overdose in 2016. Of that  number, 65 percent, or 42,000 of those deaths, were directly related to  the opioid epidemic. That means that every day 115 people die due to  opioids.  [[Page H5108]]    While those are astounding numbers, it helps to compare with past  figures. In 2000, 8,400 people died due to opioid abuse. These recent  numbers indicate a nearly 500 percent increase. That is shocking and  sad.   Colorado has not been spared from the opioid crisis. In fact, the CDC  reports that in 2015 alone, Colorado saw 159 heroin overdose deaths in  addition to the 259 prescription drug overdoses. This is particularly  harmful to my district, with 8 of the 17 counties in Colorado  exhibiting the highest overdose death rates being in eastern Colorado.   As some of these figures indicate, our opioid crisis is not just  prescription drug abuse. While many who are caught in the cycle of  abuse began with prescriptions, the availability and accessibility of  heroin has perpetuated and intensified the crisis.   Most of the heroin on our Nation's streets comes into the United  States through Mexico. It is distributed via cities like Denver in a  ruthlessly efficient manner. An entire delivery system is established  in which orders can be placed through a central operator, essentially a  franchisee of the cartels, who dispatches a delivery driver to the  purchaser.                                time  1230    In February of this year, Detective Nick Rogers of the Denver Police  Department testified before the Judiciary Committee how criminal  operations flow north through Mexico and from other places such as  Honduras and Nicaragua. Heroin dealers enter our country illegally with  fake identification from Mexico and establish these distribution  networks in neighborhoods.   In the past, our law enforcement officers were able to apprehend  these criminals and have them deported. Recently, however, local  government policies have been having a negative impact on these police  operations. Places like Denver have instituted so-called sanctuary  policies that prohibit local law enforcement from working with Federal  immigration authorities. The effect has been that law enforcement  officers, such as Detective Rogers, apprehend the same drug dealers  over and over and over again. They are prohibited from contacting  Federal immigration officers to help control this scourge. This is  confounding to many of us. We should be facing this crisis using every  tool at our disposal.   We could continue discussing at length how sanctuary policies--while  well-intentioned and sounding humanitarian--are having a profoundly  negative impact in relation to opioid abuse. But there is other work  that needs to be done to stand in the gap against this onslaught of bad  actors.   Mr. Speaker, in 2016 Congress passed and the President signed into  law the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA. CARA was the  most comprehensive addiction treatment legislation passed by the  Federal Government in several decades. It coordinated Federal response  with State and local efforts to prevent, treat, help recover, and  provide justice to those who are suffering under the impacts of opioid  abuse.   While that bill was a good step, the bills before us today continue  to organize Federal efforts to meet this public health and legal  crisis.   The first two bills deal with a gap in Federal law that has been  exposed by this crisis and exploited by international crime  organizations. That gap is synthetic drugs. According to the Drug  Enforcement Agency, there are more than 300 known designer synthetic  drugs, and this number grows with each passing year.   The gap in Federal law occurs because the Controlled Substances Act  was not designed to deal with the ever-changing compounds that have  resulted in more than 300 synthetic drugs. It currently takes us about  3 years to complete the process of placing a substance on the banned  substance list. If we attempted to ban each drug as it was discovered,  in the time it would take for our government to complete its action,  criminal gangs would simply change the molecular structure just enough  to avoid our laws, and we would be forced to start the process over  again.   Because of this scenario, H.R. 2851 sets up a streamlined process for  temporarily placing a synthetic drug on the illegal list. This will  empower the Attorney General to respond quickly to criminal drug  manufacturers in China and Mexico who work continuously to stay ahead  of our drug laws.   Not only do we work to streamline the process of banning a substance  in the United States, we also are working to prevent substances from  reaching our shores in the first place.   H.R. 5788 requires the Postal Service to obtain advance electronic  data on international mail shipments and transmit this data to U.S.  Customs and Border Protection, or CBP. Under current law, private  shippers, including express delivery carriers, are required to collect  and submit this same information to CBP. Because current law does not  require this information of the United States Postal Service, we have a  significant vulnerability that allows criminal operations to ship  synthetics and other contraband directly to the United States with  relative ease.   This legislation simply closes a loophole by extending the  requirement to the United States Postal Service. The data collected  will allow CBP to target high-risk shipments, particularly shipments  containing synthetics, for inspection and possible seizure.   The first two bills deal with bad actors overseas. The final bill  attempts to help those afflicted by opioid abuse transition back to  normal life. H.R. 5735 creates a pilot program in which a portion of  existing housing vouchers are set aside for transitional housing for  those who are undergoing opioid use disorder or other substance abuse  disorder recovery.   In March of 2017, President Trump established a commission to  strategize on how to combat drug addiction and opioid abuse. The final  report of that commission said: ``There is a critical shortage of  recovery housing for Americans in or pursuing recovery. Recovery  residences are alcohol and drug-free living environments for  individuals seeking the skills and social support to remain free of  alcohol or other drugs and live a life of recovery in the community.''   Mr. Speaker, oftentimes individuals who complete recovery programs  reenter life having lost everything. They are in danger of falling  right back into the rhythms of their previous life which could lead  them back into addiction. This bill ensures that they have a supportive  housing situation to help them become reestablished in their community.   Over the course of the next week, we are going to pass nearly 30  bills dealing with aspects of the Federal response to the opioid  crisis. These three bills today take major steps toward keeping the  flow of drugs out of our country and helping those who are caught in  the cycle of dependency become successful members of society again.   I know I speak for my community when I say that we need to be active  in combating the scourge of opioid abuse. The flow of opioids and  synthetics into our country from overseas must end. The lives of many  of our loved ones depend on it.   Mr. Speaker, I support passage of these bills, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Ross), my friend and the vice chairman of the Subcommittee  on Housing and Insurance.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Barr), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Monetary  Policy and Trade.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further witnesses. I reserve the  balance of my time to close.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, tens of thousands of Americans are dying each year due  to opioid abuse. What started as an epidemic of prescription drug abuse  has led into a resurgence in heroin addiction and synthetic drug abuse.  The easy availability of these drugs has led to widespread abuse and  death.   My home of eastern Colorado has been particularly hard-hit by this  affliction. In the most recent statistics available, more than 400  Coloradoans have died of opioid and synthetic overdose. This number is  devastating enough on its own, but it does not include the many other  lives that are wrecked and torn apart from this curse.    We know many of the bad actors. We know China and Mexico, in  particular, are deadly merchants in this sickening trade. Anything that  we can do to block these goods from entering our country we should do.  Our neighbors, our children, our loved ones deserve a fighting chance.  These bills today form yet another defense against the opioid crisis in  America.   I want to thank Chairman Sessions, Chairman Brady, Chairman  Hensarling, and Chairman Goodlatte for bringing these bills forward.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the rule,  supporting the underlying bills, and standing in the gap in defense of  our communities that are ravaged by this crisis.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:              An Amendment to H. Res. 934 Offered by Mr. Polis         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 4. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House  [[Page H5114]]       resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on the state       of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. 3495) to       amend the 21st Century Cures Act to appropriate funds for the       Account for the State Response to the Opioid Abuse Crisis       through fiscal year 2023, and for other purposes. The first       reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of       order against consideration of the bill are waived. General       debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one       hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.       After general debate the bill shall be considered for       amendment under the five-minute rule. All points of order       against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion       of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee       shall rise and report the bill to the House with such       amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except       one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the       Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to       no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day       the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of       business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the       Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill.        Sec. 5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 3495.          The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
