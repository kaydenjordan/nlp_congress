 Mr. President, under this bill as it is written  now, the government will pay many Americans more to be on government  assistance than they would make if they were working at their regular  jobs.   I support expanding the unemployment insurance program. It is the  best and quickest way to get money to people who need it most. But we  should not create a system where unemployment insurance benefits are  higher than their salary. We cannot pay people more to not work than to  work. This is common sense. Most people will choose the bigger check,  and I don't blame them at all.   No person who understands anything about business, economics, or  human nature would create such a perverse and ridiculous system. This  bill creates an incentive for people to be unemployed for the next 4  months--fact. Without workers, our economy cannot reopen--fact. If our  economy remains essentially closed for 4 more months, we will be in a  very deep recession--fact.   You may ask, how do I know all this? I grew up poor, in public  housing. My mom worked three jobs. My parents were constantly  struggling to find work. I know what it is like to skip Christmas and  see the family car repossessed. On the other end of the spectrum, I  have run businesses, small and large, and had great success. That is  exactly how I know these things. This is not conjecture; these are  facts.   There are many good things in this bill, and there are many  provisions that I wholeheartedly disagree with, but the worst thing we  can do right now is to create a disincentive to work. We can get our  economy up and running again, we can recover from this, but it will  take a lot longer if we don't amend this bill to eliminate these  perverse incentives.
