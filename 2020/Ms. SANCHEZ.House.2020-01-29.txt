 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I am proud to vote today to protect consumers and improve our credit  reporting system.   I thank Chairwoman Waters and Representative Pressley for their hard  work on this important legislative package, and I want to thank the  Financial Services staff who have worked diligently behind the scenes.   I would also like to thank the National Military Family Association,  the National Consumer Law Center, and the Consumer Federation of  America for their support of my amendment.   My amendment today, which is based upon a bill that I have long  championed, is focused on our friends and family in uniform who are  serving abroad. Specifically, my amendment would allow servicemembers  the ability to dispute negative information, or dings, on their credit  report that occurred while they were serving in a combat zone or aboard  a U.S. vessel.   Those who are serving in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps,  Coast Guard, National Guard, the commissioned corps of the National  Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Public Health Service  would benefit from this amendment.   This amendment isn't without guardrails. A credit reporting agency  must be notified that the servicemember was on extended Active Duty at  the time the hit to the credit report occurred. The credit reporting  agency would then be required to conduct a review of the information  and delete any negative information from the credit report should  certain requirements be met.   We must acknowledge the realities of deployment in today's  technological world. Life goes on at home while our military members  are deployed. Sometimes a bill payment is missed when an electronic  payment agreement lapses, a credit card on file expires, or an  unauthorized credit card is issued.   This amendment allows for credit reports that more accurately reflect  the full picture. This idea was born out of the incredible courage of  two parents who faced an overwhelming grief that I hope never to  experience.   John Kelsall, president of my local chamber of commerce at the time,  and his wife, Teri, a long-time southern California nonprofit leader,  lost their son. Lieutenant Commander Jonas Kelsall, a proud Navy SEAL,  was killed in Afghanistan in 2011. In order to keep their son's legacy  alive, the Kelsalls founded a nonprofit veterans business incubator to  assist U.S. military veterans upon their return to civilian life.   Whenever I was back home, John and Teri would catch me up on the  latest challenges and success stories from their organization. However,  one hurdle kept coming up over and over and over again for these  veteran would-be entrepreneurs.                                time  1530    Terri and John shared stories of servicemembers and veterans who had  trouble obtaining loans to help start their businesses. Why? Because  while they were deployed, they missed payments, and this negatively  affected their credit scores, even though, oftentimes, the delays were  out of their control.   I knew something had to be done. That is why, in 2014, I joined our  colleague, Congressman Lamborn of Colorado, in introducing legislation  to address this problem. I have been proud to strengthen the text of  this bill over the years with the help of the National Consumer Law  Center and military family support groups. Our country continues to ask  so much from our men and women who serve in uniform. They deserve peace  of mind during their Active Duty deployments.   Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment and  the underlying legislative package, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague for the offer to work on  this as a standalone bill. It was originally a standalone bill. It is  being offered as an amendment to the bill. I understand that you have  reservations on the underlying bill.   My hope is that it will pass as an amendment and that the underlying  bill will pass. But should that bill not be successful in being taken  up in the Senate, I would surely love to work with my colleague on a  standalone bill that will accomplish this very important goal of  helping our men and women who serve in uniform make their lives just a  little bit easier.   We ask a lot of them as a Nation, and so I think helping them when  they are on Active Duty and sometimes are late or miss payments is a  worthwhile endeavor.    Mr. Chair, again, I want to say that I have attempted to  pass this bill as a standalone bill. I believe that it is properly  included in the underlying bill, which I think is an excellent piece of  legislation.   Our country asks a lot of our men and women, and while you are on  Active Duty, the last thing that you should worry about is late  payments or missed payments, oftentimes because you are in far-flung  regions of the world when it is not like you can just mail a letter  back to make sure that your payment gets in on time.  [[Page H691]]    Mr. Chair, I believe very strongly in this amendment. I ask my  colleagues to support the amendment and support the underlying bill. I  yield back the balance of my time.
