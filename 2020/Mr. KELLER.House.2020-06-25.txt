 Mr. Speaker, as Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional  District continues to emerge from the COVID-19 virus pandemic, we can  recognize the people in our community that have played a uniquely  outstanding role in this unprecedented time.   Today, I recognize the work of Dr. Rutul Dalal, the head of the  infectious diseases unit at UPMC Williamsport. In the early days of the  pandemic, Dr. Dalal, along with the administration of UPMC  Williamsport, provided a critical voice of reason, calm, and  thoughtfulness in reassuring our community of local health providers'  ability to deal with COVID-19.   Dr. Dalal was a participant in a rural health roundtable our team  held in March that discussed COVID-19 testing capabilities, surge  capacity, and what government can do to ensure the medical community  has the tools it needs.   Dr. Dalal later joined me for a telephone townhall on COVID-19, where  he spoke to over 10,000 residents in Central and Northeastern  Pennsylvania about how to protect themselves in the pandemic and  answered their questions. Throughout the pandemic, Dr. Dalal has spoken  with many area lawmakers, community leaders, and others, while  maintaining his hospital responsibilities on the front lines of  fighting this terrible virus.   For his work, professionalism, and expertise, Dr. Dalal is truly a  PA-12 COVID-19 hero.                            ____________________
