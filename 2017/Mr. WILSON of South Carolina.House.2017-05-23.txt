 Mr. Speaker, May marks Military  Appreciation Month, a special time to recognize the tremendous support  and encouragement families offer their servicemembers. As the son of a  Flying Tiger who served in India and China, and as the grateful father  of four sons who have all served overseas, and as a 31-year veteran of  the Army Reserve and Guard, I know firsthand the commitment of our  troops, veterans, and military families.   Last week, I was honored to join Senator Roy Blunt, Senator Kirsten  Gillibrand, and Congresswoman Susan Davis to introduce commonsense,  bipartisan legislation, the Military Families Stability Act, which  provides for greater flexibility by allowing military families a 6- month option of moving to the start of their next assignment.   The happiness and success of our military families is critical to  overall troop readiness and retention. I am confident this legislation  will greatly benefit families around the country.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. We offer our  sympathy and solidarity for the victims of Manchester and our beloved  allies in the United Kingdom. Together with members of the European  Union Parliament, we will defeat the murderous losers.                            ____________________
