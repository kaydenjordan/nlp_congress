 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, on the campaign trail, Candidate Biden  made some big promises for America's economic recovery. His campaign  published ``the Biden Plan to revitalize Main Street and invest in  small businesses'' and another ``to give America's working families the  tools, choices, and freedom they need to build back better.'' So just  how have the working families and small businesses fared with President  Biden and the Democratic Party calling the shots? Sixty-nine percent of  Americans say our economy right now is bad. Even more--77 percent--say  they are pessimistic about costs rising even more in the coming months.  Just last month, one longstanding measure of optimism among small  business owners reached its lowest level on record.   Month after month, the historic high inflation Democrats helped  unleash with runaway spending last spring is taking its toll on  Americans' hope for the future, but more immediately, it is taking its  toll on their wallets. More than a third of Americans say they are  having difficulty paying for usual household expenses.   Just last month, the price of a gallon of milk was 16 percent higher  than the year before. Gas prices are scraping the stratosphere. In  Kentucky, the average price for a gallon of regular reached an alltime  high 2 weeks ago. Today, it is 20 cents higher than that.   In Lexington, one resident who drives a rideshare put it this way:         I'm not trying to be a billionaire, I'm just trying to pay       some bills.    She is facing more pain at the pump, and so are the folks paying even  more to fill up trucks, tractors, or delivery vans with diesel.   The costs behind small business owners' headaches are behind  consumers' hardship.   But somehow, as our Nation reaps the effects of their first year of  one-party control, Washington Democrats are operating as if the exact  opposite conditions were afoot. After their spending bonanza helped  kick off historic inflation, they want to pile on the biggest tax hikes  in history. After their radical day 1 climate agenda hammered the most  affordable forms of American energy, they want to double down on far- left fantasies.   As the Biden administration passed its 100th day in office, I urged  the President to ``recommit to solving our nation's actual problems.''  Well, here we are, approaching his administration's 500th day in  office. By now, America's working families have figured out for  themselves that the so-called ``Biden Plan'' for them is just a fast  track to historic hardships.    Madam President, the Country Music Highway cuts  through seven counties in eastern Kentucky that have produced some of  the finest singers in American history, from Loretta Lynn, to Chris  Stapleton, to Ricky Skaggs. Now, this formidable list of world-famous  Kentucky country artists has a new member: Noah Thompson. Today, I ask  my colleagues to join me in honoring Noah for becoming the first  Kentuckian to win ``American Idol.''   A few months ago, few people--even in Noah's hometown of Louisa--had  ever heard America's best new vocalist perform. Noah was working as a  construction worker at Addiction Recovery Care, had never sung  publicly, and hadn't even been musically trained. When Noah's best  friend Arthur signed  [[Page S2660]]  him up for ``American Idol,'' the singer worried about making it past  auditions, never imagining he would earn the ``golden ticket'' to  Hollywood, let alone become a finalist.   But Arthur believed Noah had a special talent, and, after several  arduous rounds, he emerged victorious after receiving the most votes  out of 16 million cast by fans all across the country. In the process,  he brought the ``American Idol'' camera crew back to Louisa to film a  hometown video with community leaders, his family, and thousands of  fans. He shined a light on eastern Kentucky, sharing the special  culture and history that makes the region such a hotbed for musical  talent.   Throughout the contest, Noah radiated humility and warmth. Labeled  the ``king of `aw shucks' '' by one of the judges, he entered every  round of competition with the best of Kentucky's attitude and spirit.  Even when Noah caught COVID-19 and had to isolate in his hotel room, he  performed cheerfully and continued to win viewers' hearts.   I am proud of Noah for winning this contest and jumping headfirst  into what I can only imagine will be a successful musical career. And I  am proud of Louisa, KY, for producing such a fine young gentleman to  represent the Commonwealth on the national stage. On behalf of the  Senate, I share our congratulations with Noah and wish him the best as  he pursues his dreams as a recording artist.                            ____________________
