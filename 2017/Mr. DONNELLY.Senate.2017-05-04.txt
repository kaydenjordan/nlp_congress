 Mr. President, I also congratulate my colleague from  Indiana. He is a terrific partner. The theme of his speech of working  together and building on Hoosier common sense couldn't be more  important, couldn't be more timely, and couldn't have been presented  any better.   I am fortunate to work with such a good partner for our State and for  our Nation. Both of us have benefited from the wisdom, the advice, and  the counsel of Senator Lugar, who, in our State, has set a benchmark  for all of us to aspire to in terms of decency, intelligence, ability,  craftsmanship, and leadership.   For a maiden speech, it was an extraordinary effort, a terrific job,  and I am proud to be his partner from Indiana.   I yield the floor.
