 Mr. Speaker, I know this may be the beginning  of a new year, but we are back to the same old thoughts, ideas, and  practices: Protect the wealthy. Disadvantage the poor.   We need a tax system that is fair. We need the skilled auditors who  can look at the more complex returns of wealthy taxpayers and make sure  that they are paying their fair share.   There is no doubt that this is a sham. Vote this down because it  takes away opportunity for fairness in our tax system. We need the  auditors.
