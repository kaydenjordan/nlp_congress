 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, before Congress went out of session 2  weeks ago, President Trump announced that he was declaring a national  emergency to redirect funds to the construction of a border wall. It  was a lawless act, a gross abuse of power, and an attempt by the  President to distract from the fact that he broke his core promise to  have Mexico pay for the wall.   Let me give a few reasons why the President's emergency is so wrong.   First, there is no evidence of an emergency at the border. Illegal  border crossings have been declining for 20 years. Just this morning, a  group of 58 former senior national security figures, including Chuck  Hagel and Madeleine Albright, released a statement saying: ``Under no  plausible assessment of the evidence is there a national emergency  today that entitles the president to tap into funds appropriated for  other purposes to build a wall at the southern border.''   I ask unanimous consent that the full statement be printed in the  Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:       Joint Declaration of Former United States Government Officials         We, the undersigned, declare as follows:        1. We are former officials in the U.S. government who have       worked on national security and homeland security issues from       the White House as well as agencies across the Executive       Branch. We have served in senior leadership roles in       administrations of both major political parties, and       collectively we have devoted a great many decades to       protecting the security interests of the United States. We       have held the highest security clearances, and we have       participated in the highest levels of policy deliberations on       a broad range of issues. These include: immigration, border       security, counterterrorism, military operations, and our       nation's relationship with other countries, including those       south of our border.        a.

On February 15, 2019, the President declared a       ``national emergency'' for the purpose of diverting       appropriated funds from previously designated uses to build a       wall along the southern border. We are aware of no emergency       that remotely justifies such a step. The President's actions       are at odds with the overwhelming evidence in the public       record, including the administration's own data and       estimates. We have lived and worked through national       emergencies, and we support the President's power to mobilize       the Executive Branch to respond quickly in genuine national       emergencies. But under no plausible assessment of the       evidence is there a national emergency today that entitles       the President to tap into funds appropriated for other       purposes to build a wall at the southern border. To our       knowledge, the President's assertion of a national emergency       here is unprecedented, in that he seeks to address a       situation: (1) that has been enduring, rather than one that       has arisen suddenly; (2) that in fact has improved over time       rather than deteriorated; (3) by reprogramming billions of       dollars in funds in the face of clear congressional intent to       the contrary; and (4)  [[Page S1412]]       with assertions that are rebutted not just by the public       record, but by his agencies' own official data, documents,       and statements.        3. Illegal border crossings are near forty-year lows. At       the outset, there is no evidence of a sudden or emergency       increase in the number of people seeking to cross the       southern border. According to the administration's own data,       the numbers of apprehensions and undetected illegal border       crossings at the southern border are near forty-year lows.       Although there was a modest increase in apprehensions in       2018, that figure is in keeping with the number of       apprehensions only two years earlier, and the overall trend       indicates a dramatic decline over the last fifteen years in       particular. The administration also estimates that       ``undetected unlawful entries'' at the southern border ``fell       from approximately 851,000 to nearly 62,000'' between fiscal       years 2006 to 2016, the most recent years for which data are       available. The United States currently hosts what is       estimated to be the smallest number of undocumented       immigrants since 2004. And in fact, in recent years, the       majority of currently undocumented immigrants entered the       United States legally, but overstayed their visas, a problem       that will not be addressed by the declaration of an emergency       along the southern border.        4. There is no documented terrorist or national security       emergency at the southern border. There is no reason to       believe that there is a terrorist or national security       emergency at the southern border that could justify the       President's proclamation.        a. This administration's own most recent Country Report on       Terrorism, released only five months ago, found that ``there       was no credible evidence indicating that international       terrorist groups have established bases in Mexico, worked       with Mexican drug cartels, or sent operatives via Mexico into       the United States.'' Since 1975, there has been only one       reported incident in which immigrants who had crossed the       southern border illegally attempted to commit a terrorist       act. That incident occurred more than twelve years ago, and       involved three brothers from Macedonia who had been brought       into the United States as children more than twenty years       earlier.        b. Although the White House has claimed, as an argument       favoring a wall at the southern border, that almost 4,000       known or suspected terrorists were intercepted at the       southern border in a single year, this assertion has since       been widely and consistently repudiated, including by this       administration's own Department of Homeland Security. The       overwhelming majority of individuals on terrorism watchlists       who were intercepted by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol were       attempting to travel to the United States by air; of the       individuals on the terrorist watchlist who were encountered       while entering the United States during fiscal year 2017,       only 13 percent traveled by land. And for those who have       attempted to enter by land, only a small fraction do so at       the southern border. Between October 2017 and March 2018,       forty-one foreign immigrants on the terrorist watchlist were       intercepted at the northern border. Only six such immigrants       were intercepted at the southern border.        5. There is no emergency related to violent crime at the       southern border. Nor can the administration justify its       actions on the grounds that the incidence of violent crime on       the southern border constitutes a national emergency. Factual       evidence consistently shows that unauthorized immigrants have       no special proclivity to engage in criminal or violent       behavior. According to a Cato Institute analysis of       criminological data, undocumented immigrants are 44 percent       less likely to be incarcerated nationwide than are native-      born citizens. And in Texas, undocumented immigrants were       found to have a first-time conviction rate 32 percent below       that of native-born Americans; the conviction rates of       unauthorized immigrants for violent crimes such as homicide       and sex offenses were also below those of native-born       Americans. Meanwhile, overall rates of violent crime in the       United States have declined significantly over the past 25       years, falling 49 percent from 1993 to 2017. And violent       crime rates in the country's 30 largest cities have decreased       on average by 2.7 percent in 2018 alone, further undermining       any suggestion that recent crime trends currently warrant the       declaration of a national emergency.        6. There is no human or drug trafficking emergency that can       be addressed by a wall at the southern border. The       administration has claimed that the presence of human and       drug trafficking at the border justifies its emergency       declaration. But there is no evidence of any such sudden       crisis at the southern border that necessitates a       reprogramming of appropriations to build a border wall.        a. The overwhelming majority of opioids that enter the       United States across a land border are carried through legal       ports of entry in personal or commercial vehicles, not       smuggled through unauthorized border crossings. A border wall       would not stop these drugs from entering the United States.       Nor would a wall stop drugs from entering via other routes,       including smuggling tunnels, which circumvent such physical       barriers as fences and walls, and international mail (which       is how high-purity fentanyl, for example, is usually shipped       from China directly to the United States).        b. Likewise, illegal crossings at the southern border are       not the principal source of human trafficking victims. About       two-thirds of human trafficking victims served by nonprofit       organizations that receive funding from the relevant       Department of Justice office are U.S. citizens, and even       among non-citizens, most trafficking victims usually arrive       in the country on valid visas. None of these instances of       trafficking could be addressed by a border wall. And the       three states with the highest per capita trafficking       reporting rates are not even located along the southern       border.        7. This proclamation will only exacerbate the humanitarian       concerns that do exist at the southern border. There are real       humanitarian concerns at the border, but they largely result       from the current administration's own deliberate policies       towards migrants. For example, the administration has used a       ``metering'' policy to turn away families fleeing extreme       violence and persecution in their home countries, forcing       them to wait indefinitely at the border to present their       asylum cases, and has adopted a number of other punitive       steps to restrict those seeking asylum at the southern       border. These actions have forced asylum-seekers to live on       the streets or in makeshift shelters and tent cities with       abysmal living conditions, and limited access to basic       sanitation has caused outbreaks of disease and death. This       state of affairs is a consequence of choices this       administration has made, and erecting a wall will do nothing       to ease the suffering of these people.        8. Redirecting funds for the claimed ``national emergency''       will undermine U.S. national security and foreign policy       interests. In the face of a nonexistent threat, redirecting       funds for the construction of a wall along the southern       border will undermine national security by needlessly pulling       resources from Department of Defense programs that are       responsible for keeping our troops and our country safe and       running effectively.        a. Repurposing funds from the defense construction budget       will drain money from critical defense infrastructure       projects, possibly including improvement of military       hospitals, construction of roads, and renovation of on-base       housing. And the proclamation will likely continue to divert       those armed forces already deployed at the southern border       from their usual training activities or missions, affecting       troop readiness.        b. In addition, the administration's unilateral,       provocative actions are heightening tensions with our       neighbors to the south, at a moment when we need their help       to address a range of Western Hemisphere concerns. These       actions are placing friendly governments to the south under       impossible pressures and driving partners away. They have       especially strained our diplomatic relationship with Mexico,       a relationship that is vital to regional efforts ranging from       critical intelligence and law enforcement partnerships to       cooperative efforts to address the growing tensions with       Venezuela. Additionally, the proclamation could well lead to       the degradation of the natural environment in a manner that       could only contribute to long-term socioeconomic and security       challenges.        c. Finally, by declaring a national emergency for domestic       political reasons with no compelling reason or justification       from his senior intelligence and law enforcement officials,       the President has further eroded his credibility with foreign       leaders, both friend and foe. Should a genuine foreign crisis       erupt, this lack of credibility will materially weaken this       administration's ability to marshal allies to support the       United States, and will embolden adversaries to oppose us.        9. The situation at the border does not require the use of       the armed forces, and a wall is unnecessary to support the       use of the armed forces. We understand that the       administration is also claiming that the situation at the       southern border ``requires use of the armed forces,'' and       that a wall is ``necessary to support such use'' of the armed       forces. These claims are implausible.        a. Historically, our country has deployed National Guard       troops at the border solely to assist the Border Patrol when       there was an extremely high number of apprehensions, together       with a particularly low number of Border Patrol agents. But       currently, even with retention and recruitment challenges,       the Border Patrol is at historically high staffing and       funding levels, and apprehensions--measured in both absolute       and per-agent terms--are near historic lows.        b. Furthermore, the composition of southern border       crossings has shifted such that families and unaccompanied       minors now account for the majority of immigrants seeking       entry at the southern border; these individuals do not       present a threat that would need to be countered with       military force.        c. Just last month, when asked what the military is doing       at the border that couldn't be done by the Department of       Homeland Security if it had the funding for it, a top-level       defense official responded, ``[n]one of the capabilities that       we are providing [at the southern border] are combat       capabilities. It's not a war zone along the border.''       Finally, it is implausible that hundreds of miles of wall       across the southern border are somehow necessary to support       the use of armed forces. We are aware of no military- or       security-related rationale that could remotely justify such       an endeavor.        10. There is no basis for circumventing the appropriations       process with a declaration of a national emergency at the       southern border. We do not deny that our nation faces real       immigration and national security challenges. But as the       foregoing demonstrates, these challenges demand a thoughtful,       evidence-based strategy, not a manufactured crisis that rests       on falsehoods and fearmongering. In a briefing before the       Senate Intelligence Committee on  [[Page S1413]]       January 29, 2019, less than one month before the Presidential       Proclamation, the Directors of the CIA, DNI, FBI, and NSA       testified about numerous serious current threats to U.S.       national security, but none of the officials identified a       security crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border. In a briefing       before the House Armed Services Committee the next day,       Pentagon officials acknowledged that the 2018 National       Defense Strategy does not identify the southern border as a       security threat. Leading legislators with access to       classified information and the President's own statements       have strongly suggested, if not confirmed, that there is no       evidence supporting the administration's claims of an       emergency. And it is reported that the President made the       decision to circumvent the appropriations process and       reprogram money without the Acting Secretary of Defense       having even started to consider where the funds might come       from, suggesting an absence of consultation and internal       deliberations that in our experience are necessary and       expected before taking a decision of this magnitude.        11. For all of the foregoing reasons, in our professional       opinion, there is no factual basis for the declaration of a       national emergency for the purpose of circumventing the       appropriations process and reprogramming billions of dollars       in funding to construct a wall at the southern border, as       directed by the Presidential Proclamation of February 15,       2019.

Even the President himself, who is now declaring an  emergency, halfway through his meandering speech proclaiming the  emergency, said: ``I didn't need to do this . . . but I'd rather do it  [build the wall] much faster.''   If there was ever a statement that says this is not an emergency,  that is it. He said he didn't need to do this. So, my colleagues, my  dear colleagues, if we are going to let the President, any President,  on a whim, declare emergencies just because he or she can't get their  way in the Congress, we have fundamentally changed the building blocks,  these strong, proud building blocks that the Founding Fathers put into  place.   Second, the President's emergency declaration could cannibalize  funding from worthy projects all over the country. We don't even know  yet which projects he is planning to take the funds from. I ask my  colleagues to think about that--what important initiatives in your  State are on the Trump chopping block? What military project will the  President cancel to fund the border wall Congress rejected?   Third, and I made this point a little bit at the beginning, but it  bears repeating. Far and away most importantly, the President's  emergency declaration is a fundamental distortion of our constitutional  order. The Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse, not the  President, and congressional intent on the border wall is clear. The  President's wall has been before Congress several times, and not once  has it garnered enough votes to merit consideration. In some cases it  was with Republican votes. The President said that it was just the  Democrats who blocked it. That is not true. There were Republican votes  when the wall was on the floor for voting as well.   As the great New Yorker, Justice Jackson from Jamestown, NY,  observed, the President's legal authority in the realm of emergencies  is at its very weakest when it goes against the expressed will of  Congress. In case the will of Congress was not already clear, soon it  will be made so. The obvious remedy for President Trump's outrageous  and lawless declaration is for Congress to vote to terminate the state  of emergency. The House will vote on such a resolution tomorrow, and  the Senate will soon follow suit.   I know my friends on the other side of the aisle fashion themselves  supporters of the military, defenders of property rights, and stewards  of the Constitution, as do Democrats. This vote on the resolution to  terminate the state of emergency will test our fidelity to those  principles.   Congress should come together to reject in a bipartisan fashion--we  have come together before in bipartisan ways. If ever there were one  moment that cries out for bipartisan rejection of an overreach of  power, this is it. We should reject this naked power grab, this  defacement of our constitutional balance of powers, for what seem to be  largely political purposes.                            ____________________     Madam President, the President is on his way to Thailand  for a second summit with Chairman Kim of North Korea. It is in all of  our interests for the President to achieve a diplomatic resolution with  North Korea that achieves a stable peace and the complete, verifiable,  and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Failing  that, the Congress must continue to pressure a regime that permits  gross humanitarian abuses and remains one of the most repressive  governments on the globe.   We cannot tolerate the President making concessions without, in  exchange, receiving verifiable, enduring, and concrete commitments from  North Korea to denuclearize.   President Trump's first summit with Chairman Kim granted his regime  the international legitimacy and acceptance that Kim has long craved  while undermining our policy of maximum pressure and sanctions,  seemingly so the President could have a photo op and make a speech.   Unsurprisingly, the results of that meeting were disappointing. The  President claimed, bizarrely and wildly, that North Korea is ``no  longer a nuclear threat'' right after the meeting, while the U.S.  intelligence community has continually testified before Congress that  North Korea has not been denuclearizing and appears unlikely to give up  its nuclear weapons. So how can the President say it is no longer a  nuclear threat when the same threat existed when he threatened North  Korea earlier and after, when he seemed to make nice to President Kim?  Meanwhile, the President suspended joint military readiness drills with  the South Koreans--drills we have been conducting for 60 years for the  safety of East Asia.   No one wants to see a repeat of the same movie. No one wants another  summit that is more about photo ops and optics than progress. We are  all rooting for diplomacy to succeed, but the President can't be too  naive or too eager to reach a deal that gives him the photo op again  but that doesn't achieve the complete denuclearization of the Korean  Peninsula.                            ____________________     Madam President, in a similar vein, on China, President  Trump announced he would be delaying the imposition of higher tariffs  on March 1, in the hopes of coming to a larger trade agreement. This is  all well and good if the Trump administration ultimately achieves a  strong deal that makes progress on China's rapacious trade policies.  But we are not there yet, and my message to President Trump is don't  back down.   The President has shown the right instincts on China many times. I  give him credit for that. I have praised him publicly for that, but at  other times, I believe his eagerness for the appearance of  accomplishment gets the best of him. Recent history has taught us that  when President Trump makes unilateral concessions to China--as he did  when he interfered in the sanctions against ZTE--China does very little  for us in return.   President Trump must not make the same mistake again, whether by  interfering in the U.S. criminal charges brought against Huawei or  otherwise decreasing our leverage, until and unless China makes  meaningful, enforceable, and verifiable agreements to end its theft of  American intellectual property and other trade abuses.   Hopefully, that is where the negotiations are headed. If the  President does  [[Page S1414]]  a good job, I will be the first to praise him. If he backs off or takes  some temporary measure in decreasing the balance of trade but doesn't  change China's structural rapaciousness against the United States and  our intellectual property and our industrial know-how, he will be  criticized by me and many others on both sides of the aisle.                            ____________________     Madam President, a word on today's vote on women's  reproductive rights: The bill the Senate will vote on shortly is  carefully crafted to target, intimidate, and shut down reproductive  healthcare providers. Doctors across this country--Democratic doctors,  Republican doctors--are lining up against the bill because it would  impose requirements on what type of care doctors must provide in  certain circumstances, even if that care is ineffective, contradictory  to medical evidence, and against the family's wishes.   My Republican colleagues have said some incendiary things about  opposing this bill. Let me be very clear. Many of these claims are  false. It has always been illegal to harm a newborn infant. This vote  has nothing--nothing--to do with that. Read the language. We are  talking about situations when expectant parents tragically learn their  pregnancy is no longer viable, and there is a fatal diagnosis. What  happens in those circumstances should be decided between a woman, her  family, her minister, priest, rabbi, imam, and her doctor.   It makes no sense for Washington politicians who know nothing about  individual circumstances to say they know better than the doctors or  the patients and their families. The bill is solely meant to intimidate  doctors and restrict patients' access to care and has nothing--nothing,  nothing--to do with protecting children.   Last Friday, the administration announced it was imposing a gag rule  on U.S. reproductive healthcare providers and trying to restrict access  to healthcare clinics that provide reproductive care. So this vote  doesn't occur in a vacuum. It is part of a pattern of actions taken by  President Trump and congressional Republicans to limit, deny, or  circumscribe a woman's right to healthcare.   I urge the American people to do their own research, read the bill,  and see what it says. Most of you will agree with it. Pay attention to  the facts and not the false rhetoric. This bill is Washington politics  at its worst. I will vote no.                            ____________________     Finally--and this time it is finally, I say to my good  friend from Nebraska--I turn the attention of my colleagues to a  harrowing fact: We are vastly approaching the point where more people  will have died from exposure to toxic chemicals on 9/11 than were  killed on 9/11 itself. These are the first responders, firefighters,  police, and FBI agents who rushed to the towers that fateful day, ran  into the fire, smoke, and twisted steel, risking their lives and,  later, we learned, risking their health to get people out. These are  the union members and construction workers who worked at the pile,  breathing in a toxic blend of ash and dust in the days and weeks and  months that followed. These are the people, the innocents, who lived  downtown when the United States was attacked in the most dastardly  attack on American soil.   Right now we have a problem. While these folks are heroes and, sadly,  many are suffering--because of the alarming number who are suffering  from 9/11-related illnesses, the victim compensation fund is running  out of money earlier than expected. The Justice Department recently  announced that it might have to cut compensation awards between 50 and  70 percent.   So today I was proud to join Senators Gillibrand and Gardner, as well  as a group of our colleagues in the House, to introduce legislation to  fix the shortfall of funding and put the victims' compensation fund on  sure footing for the foreseeable future.   I urge all of my colleagues, Democrat and Republican alike, to sign  on and help us pass this bill and give some hope to the thousands who  were brave on 9/11 and who are suffering now.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
