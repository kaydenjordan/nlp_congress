 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the MGT Act and  of continued efforts to improve the federal government's cybersecurity  posture. I would like to thank Mr. Hurd for his tireless efforts  advocating for this bill and his partners on the Oversight Committee,  Mr. Connolly and Ms. Kelly for their cybersecurity leadership. I also  must acknowledge the House's Minority Whip and my good friend, Mr.  Hoyer, for his work pushing for IT modernization.   The idea for the kind of revolving fund included as part of the MGT  Act grew out of President Obama's Cybersecurity National Action Plan,  itself issued in direct response to the massive breach of the Office of  Personnel Management. OPM was yet another wake up call to the  government about the lax attitude toward security present at many  agencies, but, to the prior administration's credit, the CNAP contained  a number of needed policy shifts, including the creation of a federal  Chief Information Security Officer and the use of DHS's authority to  conduct a government-wide review of high value assets.   Central to the CNAP, though, was the realization that attempting to  secure antiquated federal IT systems was a losing proposition. Just as  the Internet--developed in the 1970s--was not created with security in  mind, so, too, are many older government systems devoid of even basic  security controls. When we think about the fact that the iPhone turns  ten next month and the huge improvements that have been made from the  first generation model to today's, it's easy to see how systems that  are two or three decades old can hamper security.   Using outdated software also compromises efficiency. There's a reason  businesses keep up to date with technology--it saves them money. The  cleverness of the revolving fund approach is that it uses these savings  to drive further upgrades in a virtuous cycle. I hope that the MGT Act  is viewed as a pilot program, as there is a lot more technical debt we  have incurred than will be solved by $250 million per year. But it is a  very important first step, and I commend the sponsors for their work.  And I hope that federal agencies view this bill as license to be  innovative in their upgrade planning and to bring us a more efficient-- and secure--government.                                time  1515    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hurd) that the House suspend the rules and  pass the bill, H.R. 2227, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
