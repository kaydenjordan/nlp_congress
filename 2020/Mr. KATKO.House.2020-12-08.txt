 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   S. 4902 would designate the U.S. courthouse in Salt Lake City, Utah,  as the Orrin G. Hatch United States Courthouse.   Senator Hatch served the citizens of Utah and our Nation for many  years. First elected to the U.S. Senate in 1976, Senator Hatch served  in the other body for 42 years during seven different Presidential  administrations.   Prior to his retirement, Senator Hatch served as President pro  tempore and was third in line for Presidential succession from 2015 to  2019.   Senator Hatch has a longstanding record of bipartisanship, having  cosponsored or sponsored more than 750 bills that became law.   His leadership as chairman of three major Senate committees helped  pave the way for critical financial, judicial, and health legislation.   I think it is fitting to honor the dedication and service of Senator  Hatch by naming this courthouse after him. I say that as a Federal  prosecutor of 20 years.   Madam Speaker, I urge support of this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Utah (Mr. Stewart).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   In closing, Senator Hatch was one of the longest-serving members of  the U.S. Senate, often working on a bipartisan basis to get the work of  the American people done.   This bill will honor and recognize his dedication and decades of  service to this great Nation.   Madam Speaker, I urge support of this legislation, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
