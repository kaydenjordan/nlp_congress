 Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of National  Hispanic Heritage Month and to celebrate the many contributions  Hispanic Americans have made to our Nation.   From the founding of St. Augustine to the Battle of Yorktown to the  fight for school integration, Hispanic Americans have served as vital  cornerstones in the construction of our Republic.   The State of Florida also has a rich history of strong Hispanic  influence. In fact, Juan Ponce de Leon, who led the first Spanish  expedition to Florida, went on to serve as Puerto Rico's first  Governor.   To this day, our communities proudly have a strong Hispanic  representation, with 23 percent of my district having a Hispanic or  Latino heritage.   Hispanic organizations play vital roles in our community. The Club  Hispano de Lakeland hosts the Lakeland Hispanic Festival, where  Hispanic culture and history is embraced and celebrated.   The Hispanic Professional Women's Association and the Hispanic  Chamber of Commerce of Tampa Bay also lend rich leadership to our  communities.   So today, and every day, I say thank you to all Hispanics and  especially those of Florida 15. You have transformed our language, our  place names, our diets, and our entire culture. We are a better State  and country because of you.                            ____________________
