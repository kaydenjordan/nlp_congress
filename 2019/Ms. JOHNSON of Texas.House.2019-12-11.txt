 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  5038, the Farm Workforce Modernization Act. This bipartisan piece of  legislation will go a long way in addressing the shortage of labor in  our agriculture sector. This bill will also provide a pathway to  citizenship for agricultural workers who have spent many years working  in the fields helping to ensure we have a safe and affordable food  supply.   Thanks to the leadership of Chairwoman Lofgren and Congressman  Newhouse, we have finally started to look at immigration as a solution  to some of our labor shortages. Farmers and ranchers rely on foreign  seasonal agricultural workers largely because it's difficult to find a  reliable source of labor domestically for this sector. It's a fair  compromise that these workers be offered a pathway to citizenship so  that they can one day live the American dream just like the rest of us.   It is my hope that this bill can serve as a blueprint for other  sectors of our economy where labor shortages persist. Construction is a  prime example of this. My district, along with the rest of North Texas  is in the process of seeing rapid population growth. This means  construction workers are in high demand to build new homes, schools,  roads, and hospitals for the thousands of people moving to the region  every month. Similar reforms in the construction industry would help in  making sure the economy in North Texas can continue to prosper.   Madam Speaker, we have a unique opportunity here today to pass  legislation that would benefit both farmers and the agricultural  workers they employ. I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this  bill.
