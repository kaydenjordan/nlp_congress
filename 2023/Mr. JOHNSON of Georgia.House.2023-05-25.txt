 Madam Speaker, the well-being of the American  people should never be used as a political bargaining chip, but that is  exactly what House MAGA Republicans are doing.   Yesterday, my friend Matt Gaetz, who appears to be the lead MAGA debt  ceiling negotiator, let the cat out of the bag when he told us that  most of his caucus: ``Don't feel like we should negotiate with our  hostage.''   Who is the hostage that MAGA Republicans have tied to a chair and  left in the basement while they leave to enjoy the holiday weekend?   It is none other than the American people and our economy.   Why are they doing it after voting three times for a clean debt  ceiling under Donald Trump?   Because they want to ruin the economy, blame it on President Biden,  and pave the way to reelect their savior, Donald Trump.   How despicable.   We need five Republicans to sign the discharge petition so the House  can vote on a clean debt ceiling bill and continue moving our Nation  forward.                            ____________________
