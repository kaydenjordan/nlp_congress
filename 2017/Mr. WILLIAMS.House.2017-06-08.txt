 Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Hensarling for his  leadership on this issue.   Mr. Chair, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has cost American  small businesses, American entrepreneurs, and the American taxpayers  millions of dollars in regulatory costs since the inception.   I actually own a business. I am a small-business owner, and I can  tell you it is horrible legislation. And although this rouge and  unaccountable agency hides behind the false pretense that its actions  protect consumers, there could be nothing further from the truth.   Take, for example, the ability to exempt small community financial  institutions from any rule they impose. In fact, Dodd-Frank gives them  explicit authority to do so. Yet because they lack congressional  oversight, because they have a director who cannot be removed at will,  they simply do absolutely nothing.   Mr. Chair, if my colleagues are looking for a reason to vote for this  bill, they should look no further than the reforms that helped rein in  the CFPB.   Specifically, I am happy to see the committee-incorporated provision  I introduced last Congress which would apply the REINS Act to all  financial agencies, including the CFPB.   Over the last 12 years, $55 billion in regulatory costs have been  levied by our financial agencies, and this must end, and it must end  now.   Again, the Financial CHOICE Act is a win for American taxpayers. It  is purely a win for Americans who are sick and tired of the heavy hand  of Washington.   Mr. Chair, I urge all my colleagues to support this bill.   In God we trust.
