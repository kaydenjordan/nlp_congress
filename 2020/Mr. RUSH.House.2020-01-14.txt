 Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend, the dynamic part of  the dynamic duo, my brother who is known far and wide as being a voice  of inspiration, a voice of reason, and a mighty voice of valor, my  friend and colleague for many, many years, Congressman Danny K. Davis  from the great Seventh Congressional District in the State of Illinois.   I thank Congressman Davis for honoring the legacy of his friend and  mine, Mr. Richard Barnett, who was a true visionary, whose outstanding  efforts helped bring Chicago's local government and the State of  Illinois' government closer to the people who consented to be governed,  to the people who know governments are supposed to serve.    Madam Speaker, Richard Barnett was a man of enormous talents, skills,  and abilities. Integral to his vision, though, was a focus on  enfranchising those who had been intentionally excluded from the  political process by Chicago's political elite.   Richard was a courageous voice for the left out, for the locked out,  and for those who were forced to live on the margins of political power  in the city of Chicago.   I guess the clearest example of this was the critical role that  Richard Barnett played in the election of Chicago's first African  American mayor, Harold Washington, and the defeat of Chicago's vaunted  Democratic machine.   But we can't look at one election and summarize Richard's  contribution by just one election. Richard Barnett's transformative  role in Chicago politics would come years earlier, following the  untimely assassination of my dear friend and colleague, Fred Hampton.   The story goes that after then-Cook County State's Attorney Edward V.  Hanrahan led the political assassination of Hampton, who was chairman  of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party, Richard Barnett  encouraged all African Americans, all minorities, all good people in  the city of Chicago, all those who cared about civil rights, law and  order, and justice in our city, to refuse to vote for Edward Hanrahan  in the upcoming general election.                                time  1600    That was the election in 1972. This was in spite of the fact that  Richard was a Democrat, and most of the African American community was  Democrat. We vote with the Democratic machine.  [[Page H236]]    We refused to just be ignored and disrespected, and we defeated the  Democratic machine in Chicago in the election of 1972 for Cook County  State's attorney but, for the first time in the history of the city of  Chicago, elected a Republican as the State's attorney of Cook County,  Bernard J. Carey. The evil Edward V. Hanrahan would lose the general  election, mostly because of Richard Barnett's political acumen and  activism.   This defeat by the Cook County Democratic machine would ignite a  political awakening in Chicago that would begin with the 1983 election  of Harold Washington. But it would go even beyond that and would go on  to inspire African Americans all across the country to run for public  office, including yours truly.   Barnett's work elected strong political voices, committed political  voices, dedicated, passionate political voices up and down the ballot,  year in and year out. Richard Barnett helped elect scores of members of  the city council, aldermen, appellate court judges, judges in the  circuit court, State representatives, State senators, Members of  Congress, other elected officials.   I guess, personally, for me, Richard Barnett's legacy was centered  around his strategic and informed advice. I mean, you would just  marvel, sitting in a political education class, where Richard Barnett  would take a group of--not an organization, but just well-meaning  individuals from different places, some Ph.D.'s and some GEDs and no  Ds, bring them into a room, spend time telling them about not only how  to win an election, but why they should win an election.   Barnett would tell us how to use the very tactics that precinct  captains had been using for decades and use it against those same  precinct captains. He would teach us how to canvass an election.   The first time I ever heard anything about a canvass, it flowed from  Richard Barnett's lips: how to take a poll sheet and go from house to  house and building to building and floor to floor asking people would  they vote for your candidate, and then summarize that by either putting  a plus or a minus.   If they were going to vote for your candidate, they were a plus  voter; if they were going to vote against your candidate, then they  were a minus voter; and if they were undecided, then you put a zero.  And you just didn't stop there. The minuses, you left them alone, but  the zeroes, you went back to them.   Richard Barnett told us all of that every day from the announcement  to the decision day in an election, and that was election day, and how  you had to really be prepared for election day because, as Congressman  Davis indicated, we didn't have poll watchers in the polls, passing 100  feet outside of the polls. If you didn't go and locate your plus voters  and get them to the polls, then you would not win that election.   So Richard Barnett taught us the strategy and the discipline of how  to win an election.   Barnett shaped a lot of community leaders, politicians, and activists  through his example and through those political education classes. The  list is prominent, exalted, endless: Congressman Danny K. Davis; yours  truly, Congressman Bobby L. Rush; Congressman Chuy Garcia; former  Congressman Luis Gutierrez. We all sat at Richard Barnett's knee and  learned how to win elections from this eminent political strategist and  teacher.   Even Barnett's charisma, his character, his teaching transcended into  the mindset, the strategies of the former President of the United  States.    Certainly, Congressman Davis. I just wanted to add my voice  to the Richard Barnett story that the Nation must know about.
