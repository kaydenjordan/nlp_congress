 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  rise in opposition to this bill.   H.R. 1 is for the politicians, not the people. The bill weaponizes  the Federal Election Commission, infringes on  [[Page H976]]  States' rights, and drastically limits freedom of speech.   Arizona requires voter ID and prohibits ballot harvesting. H.R. 1  will undo Arizona laws.   This bill also puts people's privacy and security at risk by  requiring the disclosure of personal information for political  advertisers. The bill is solely designed to benefit politicians from  one particular political party.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill.
