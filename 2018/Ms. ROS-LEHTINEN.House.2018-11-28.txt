 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of  Juana Aurora Medina, a lifelong resident of the city of Hialeah in  south Florida.   Like me, Juana was born in Cuba but was forced to flee the island  under the brutal Castro dictatorship. Juana arrived to this land of  freedom and opportunity along with her husband, a political prisoner,  and their small children.   In the U.S., she worked in the garment district to provide for her  family and to make education available for her children.   As a religious woman, Juana found her passion for helping others.  After experiencing the plight of families and individuals affected by  alcohol and drug addiction, she founded, with several others, various  nonprofits, including Ministerio Catolico Nuevo Caminar, to address  these issues head-on.   Recently, the city of Hialeah recognized her legacy by designating a  city street to be named in her honor. We thank Juana for her service  and for her love and dedication to our community. She is an inspiration  to her family and to so many individuals she positively impacted  throughout her life.   Congratulations to the Medina family.
