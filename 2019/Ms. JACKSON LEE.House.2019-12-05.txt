 Madam Speaker, we do have a very solemn  responsibility to uphold the rule of law, but it is important to note  that Democrats and the majority in the House have worked every day for  the American people.   Among the 400 bills that we have supported are: H.R. 986, the  Protecting Americans with Preexisting Conditions Act of 2019,  legislation that I have consistently worked on for almost a decade; the  Equality Act, which gives equality to all people; the Paycheck Fairness  Act, to treat women fairly; the Climate Action Now Act and other  legislation to recognize the crisis in climate change; national flood  insurance, which my constituents in Texas are desperate for; directing  the removal of United States Armed Forces from hostilities in the  Republic of Yemen; and then, of course, a signature bill that I have  written over a 2-year period, the Violence Against Women  Reauthorization Act, which expands the rights of Native Americans and  provides $291 million for our law enforcement and prosecutors.   Finally, let me say, I was very proud to stand for H. Res. 183,  condemning anti-Semitism as hateful expressions of intolerance, which  are contradictory to the values and aspirations that define the people  of the United States, and condemning anti-Muslim discrimination and  bigotry against minorities as hateful expressions of intolerance.   We have been working on behalf of the American people. We ask the  other body to work, but we are doing our job for the goodness and the  greatness of this Nation.                            ____________________
