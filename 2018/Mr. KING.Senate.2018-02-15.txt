 Mr. President, on January 9 of this year, the President of  the United States said: We are going to come up with DACA. We are going  to do DACA, and then we can start immediately on phase two, which will  be comprehensive. I think we have to do DACA first. Later that evening,  he tweeted and said that in addition to DACA, we need to do the border.  This is that bill.   Much of the criticism are for things not in this bill. They weren't  intended to be. This is a narrow bill dealing with DACA and border  security. This is what the American people want us to do, and they are  going to be puzzled if anyone in this body votes against a bill that  will deal with DACA and border security.    Mr. President, I agree with the senior Senator from Maine  on the intent of this provision and support working with her and our  colleagues to move this date to January 1, 2018. I would also offer  that to prioritize some actions does not mean to do so at the exclusion  of others, nor does it mean that DHS is prohibited in any way from  enforcing the law.
