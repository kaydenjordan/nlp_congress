 Mr. Speaker, this has been one of the darkest and most  painful weeks our State of Michigan has had in recent memory. We stand  here, the Michigan delegation of Democrats and Republicans, along with  honorary Michiganians, to ask Congress to recognize that pain and to  ask Members here to see their own children in the pictures of those who  were lost in yet another school shooting.   In less than 5 minutes, the small town of Oxford, Michigan, was  changed forever when a gunman opened fire on his fellow high school  students.   In that momentary flash, four innocent teenagers, students with their  entire lives ahead of them, were taken from us in yet another senseless  act of violence.   Hana St. Juliana was an exuberant freshman and a volleyball and  basketball player. She babysat for a friend of mine and brought joy to  everyone who knew her. She made her high school debut on the basketball  team on Monday night. Hana was 14 years old.   Madisyn Baldwin was going to graduate this year, and she had already  been accepted to several colleges, some with a full scholarship. She  had a younger half-brother and two sisters, and her friends describe  her as an artist who loved to draw, read, and write. Madisyn was 17.   Tate Myre was a tight end and running back on the varsity football  team and an honor student. There is already a petition circulating to  rename Oxford's football stadium in his honor. He was 16 years old.   Justin Shilling was a senior getting ready for life after high  school. He was the co-captain of the school's bowling team, and he  worked part-time at Anita's Kitchen, a restaurant in nearby Lake Orion.  Justin was 17.   Seven others were wounded, and make no mistake, every single student,  parent, friend, family member, and community member in the greater area  now has wounds that you can't see, the wounds that affect the head and  the heart.   Last night, I attended a service at a church where many Oxford  families attend. The pastor spoke for many when he asked: ``Where do we  go with our fears? We feel powerless to prevent this kind of tragedy.  We mourn the brokenness of a culture where children kill children.''   Today I ask my colleagues from across the country to join me in a  moment of silence to honor the lives of Hana, Madisyn, Tate, and  Justin.   I ask you for this moment to put yourself in the shoes of the  families in places like Columbine, Sandy Hook, Parkland, Santa Fe,  Noblesville, and now Oxford, Michigan.   And I ask you to refuse to be powerless in the powerful body that is  the U.S. Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that the House observe a moment of silence in  honor of the victims of the Oxford High School tragedy.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today in the shadow of a terrible  tragedy that has shaken my district and the entire State of Michigan to  its core.   Oxford, Michigan, is a quiet town in northern Oakland County. It is a  small, close-knit community where folks know and care for each other.  But just 2 days ago, in less than 5 minutes, the heart of the town was  ripped out in a flurry of screams and gunfire.   On Tuesday, a 15-year-old boy walked into his Oxford High School and  took the lives of four of his fellow students, four young Michiganders  with their entire lives ahead of them.   I mentioned them in our moment of silence, but it bears repeating.   Hana St. Juliana was an exuberant freshman on the volleyball and  basketball team. She babysat for a friend of mine and brought joy to  all who knew her. She made her high school debut on the basketball team  on Monday night. Hana was 14 years old.   Madisyn Baldwin was going to graduate this year, and she had already  been accepted to several colleges, some with a full scholarship. She  had a younger half-brother and two sisters, and her friends described  her as an artist who loved to draw and read and write. Madisyn was 17.   Tate Myre was a tight end and running back on the varsity football  team and an honor student. Already, there is a petition with more than  80,000 signatures circulating to rename Oxford's football stadium in  honor of Tate. He was 16 years old.   Justin Shilling was a senior getting ready for life after high  school. He was the co-captain of the school's bowling team, and he  worked part time at Anita's Kitchen, a restaurant in nearby Lake Orion.  Justin was 17.   The loss of these four young people has ripped a hole in our  community, and the trauma inflicted on their friends and classmates  will never fully subside.   No one has been left unscathed. The aftershocks of the senseless act  of violence are being felt across the State, most clearly in the 60  school districts that have been forced to cancel school out of an  abundance of caution due to copycat threats.   All of us can see ourselves in the parents, students, and teachers at  Oxford, but we can't begin to imagine their pain.   As agonizing as the last few days have been, the place to take solace  is in the incredible response of the hundreds of first responders who  jumped into action to end the violence before more lives were taken.   Yesterday, I visited the professionals at the Oakland County  Operations Center, which was the eye of the hurricane on Tuesday, and  heard firsthand accounts of heroism, bravery, and dedication under  extreme stress.   In the darkness of the event, the light we should try and focus on is  that, in our hour of need, our first responders were trained and ready.  They did not hesitate. In the span of just a few minutes, the gunman  fired 30 shots, hitting 11 people. Four of them are dead.   When the gunman was stopped by law enforcement inside the school, he  had 18 rounds left. I shudder to think about how much more damage could  have been done if those officers hadn't stopped him so quickly.   The people who responded on Tuesday saved lives unequivocally. The  training, speed, and efficiency of those on site made all the  difference, and I want to speak directly to them for a moment.  [[Page H6907]]    First, to the teachers who have been through so much in these last 2  years and who jumped into action when the crisis struck; to the police  officers and sheriff's deputies who headed straight into the school  without hesitation and who told me, ``We were going inside no matter  what. We were never going to simply stage outside and wait to assess  the risks to ourselves''; to all the firefighters and first responders  from our area and well beyond who didn't wait for direction and simply  steamed straight for Oxford; to the 911 dispatch operators who took  more than 100 calls from terrified children whispering and crying from  their hiding places, and the dispatch shift leaders who ran the massive  logistical operation to coordinate over 300 first responders at the  school; and to the doctors, nurses, EMS, and hospital staff who put  emergency procedures in place and all answered the call to help, what  you did saved children, and teachers, and administrators.   You saved someone's child, someone's brother, someone's mom. You kept  people on this Earth for their families to cherish and hold close. And  every one of them will remember that day and the role you played. There  are children in that school who will go on to be police officers and  firefighters and doctors because of how you responded this week, and  for that, we owe you so much.   Madam Speaker, over the last few days, I have thought a great deal  about the sacrifices we ask our kids to make and the burdens we ask  them to bear. We are all so exhausted seeing fleeing students, panicked  parents, and bewildered teachers.   The inescapable conclusion we must draw is that we are failing our  children, not just failing to keep them safe but failing to set an  example. Our daily rhetoric continues to deteriorate. Threats of  violence are commonplace.   As someone who worked alongside the military for years, I was trained  that leadership climate is set at the top. Whether you are the leader  of a platoon or a small town, or simply the head of a household, the  leadership style you use in your own life will be internalized by those  you lead. It will become the standard. Nowhere is this more clear than  with our kids.   The hard truth is that violence, including gun violence, has become  normal. Threatening someone online has become normal. Inciting violence  and calling for violence has become normal. People do it online,  in neighborhood forums, at school board meetings, at hospitals, on  airplanes, and even on the steps of this Capitol, like it is nothing at  all, like it is somehow part of their freedom of speech. But it is not.    Threatening other people is where our freedom of speech ends. But how  are kids to understand that? How are they to rationalize the lessons  they learned in kindergarten to treat others as we would like to be  treated if they see adults demonstrating the opposite?   That betrayal has taken hold in the roots of our communities. Not a  day goes by that I don't hear about it, and our kids are watching our  every move.   This tragedy also makes clear that we are in desperate need of mental  health support for our young people. Services and providers are scarce,  and there is no way of meeting the need, especially in the wake of  COVID.   Our children are using violence, contemplating suicide, and generally  struggling more than at any other time in our history, and we must  acknowledge that and provide the resources to our communities to manage  the demand.   In these first 48 hours since the attack, that is where my office and  so many others have been trying to engage, to find Federal money, to  find State money. We need to address the mental health crisis in this  country with the seriousness that it demands or be prepared to live  with the consequences.   In the immediate aftermath of tragedy, in these moments of intense  suffering, there is often a need to understand what to do with our pain  by jumping into politics and policy. I must admit, I am torn about that  discussion because my community is still reeling from the crisis, and  our attention has been focused on immediate crisis response.   But there are some basic facts that simply can't be swept under the  rug: that a deadly weapon purchased legally fell into the hands of a  15-year-old child. I come from a family of gun owners. I was trained to  carry two different firearms on my person at all times during my three  tours with the CIA in Iraq.   But if a 15-year-old boy can get ahold of a weapon purchased by his  father on a Friday and use it to terrorize and murder his classmates on  a Tuesday, something in our country is horribly wrong.   Whether we like it or not, Oxford will be a town that our kids read  about, joining a long list of communities that have become synonymous  with the greatest tragedies our country has seen: Columbine, Virginia  Tech, Sandy Hook, Parkland, Santa Fe, and so many more.   This is, sadly, not a new set of issues. Long before the events in  Oxford, the U.S. House passed a bill requiring basic background checks  for purchases of any and all guns, just like we do at Walmart now.   This bill had both Democratic and Republican cosponsors. It was one  of those rare instances of this body rising to the occasion with some  basic common sense. We voted on this bill a few years ago in the last  Congress, and we voted on it again this last March 2021.   That bill is currently sitting in the U.S. Senate. It could be voted  on tomorrow if there was a will to act.   Please, to our colleagues in the Senate, take up this important  bipartisan legislation.                                time  2040    I am also focused on what it means to be a responsible gun owner.  Michigan is full of them, including my own family. But if you are going  to own a gun, you should be responsible for storing it safely and for  taking basic steps to ensure that the gun doesn't end up in the hands  of a child or a criminal or a dangerous person. Adults should be held  accountable for how they handle their guns.   This is an issue we are particularly watching in Oxford, where the  Oakland County prosecutor is considering charging the parents of the  shooter for their child's access to that gun. This is one of the areas  we are looking at for additional legislation, and I know that a similar  bill is being looked at in the Michigan legislature.   In the coming days and week, more facts will emerge from this  horrible tragedy and help guide our thinking on how to ensure that our  children--Hana, Madisyn, Tate, and Justin--did not die in vain.   To my colleagues in both parties, I look to you all, every single one  of you, to join me in recognizing the pain that our community is going  through and to make sure it means something.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
