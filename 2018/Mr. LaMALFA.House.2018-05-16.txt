 Mr. Speaker, in addition to National Police Week, it is  also National Infrastructure Week.   Currently, much of our Nation's infrastructure is in disrepair.  Dilapidated roads, crumbling bridges, and battered levees and dams  litter the country from coast to coast.   In large rural areas like my district in northern California, the  infrastructure gap is even more exaggerated, where funding is even more  difficult to come by, as it is in all rural areas of the U.S. We have  to stretch every dollar as far as possible. It is not enough to simply  put more money into the system, but to make those dollars more  effective.   Currently, local counties must jump through multiple, duplicative  regulatory hoops from both the State and Federal Government. That only  wastes time and money, and it makes no sense.   We have seen that local agencies have proven to be far more effective  than their Federal counterparts. That is why we have to streamline the  permitting process to allow States more authority to conduct  environmental reviews on their own and reduce the regulatory burden.   The President's MOU to have ``one Federal decision'' policy, one-stop  shopping, and, indeed, one lead agency will streamline that vastly and  help us get our highways done and our levee projects, multiple things  that need to be done to make us safer and more economically sound-- basic bipartisan reforms that will make sense for the American people  in a timely manner.                            ____________________
