 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed  to enter into a colloquy with my colleague, the Senator from Utah.    Mr. President, I hope that in tax reform, we will try to  do what we should do in all of our policies; that is, come up with  ideas that are both pro-growth and pro-worker.   There are a lot of good things in this tax bill, but we need to make  it better. We can make it more pro-growth and more pro-worker. Senator  Lee from Utah and I have a plan that helps us move in that direction. I  will describe it briefly, and I want him to have the opportunity to  weigh in on this as well.  [[Page S7388]]    On the pro-growth side, it is about becoming more globally  competitive, and we do so by lowering the current corporate tax rate.  The current corporate tax rate in the United States is 35 percent; we  would reduce that to 22 percent. Now, the current bill has it at 20,  but 22 percent is just as competitive as 20. Here is why. Just like the  current bill, it would be lower than the global average rate of 23  percent. Just like the current bill, it would move us from last place  to third place among the G7 countries. So it is just as pro-growth. It  makes us just as competitive, but it allows us to do the pro-worker  reform that we desperately need.   Here is what it allows us to do. It allows us to change the child tax  credit in the current bill to help working families even more. No. 1,  it would make it fully refundable up to the amount you pay in payroll  tax. No. 2, it would eliminate the marriage penalty, meaning you pay  more in taxes if you are a married couple than you do if you are an  individual. No. 3, it would index the tax credit to chained CPI, which  basically means that as inflation grows and the cost of living goes up,  the credit doesn't lose its value because it doesn't go up.   The one thing I want to emphasize is, Who does this help? I have had  some people in the past and even today ask: Why are you doing this?  This is like welfare.   I find that offensive. I find it offensive not because I am offended  by people who need the help and are in the safety net program because  they have come upon difficult times but because the people we are  trying to help are not on government assistance. They are workers. You  have to work to get this credit. In essence, the credit applies against  their tax liability, be it payroll tax or income tax. A lot of people  who are working don't make enough money to be paying a lot of income  tax, but they pay up to 15.3 percent of what they make in payroll tax.  It is their primary tax liability, and if you don't allow the credit to  apply toward that, you are not helping them.   Who are they? Who are the kinds of people we are talking about? In  essence, who are these workers? Well, this chart tells you who they  are. They are the waitresses making about $20,000 a year. They are not  fully benefiting from this credit right now. If we do it the way  Senator Lee and I are talking about doing it, they would. They are the  home health aides. They are the office clerks. They are the welders  making $35,000 a year. They are the truckdrivers. They are the nurses.  They are the firefighters making $48,000 a year. These are working  people, the backbone of our country, the ones who have been left behind  for over three decades because no one fights for them. They have been  ignored and disrespected in our public policy, and they are not  accounted for in this bill. They are raising families, our future  taxpayers. It costs money to raise a family. The more children you  have, the more expensive it is. Our Tax Code should recognize that, and  we make a reasonable proposal in that regard.   Now I would like to turn to Senator Lee and ask him to expound on the  importance of this for America's workers and why, if we are truly going  to have a pro-worker reform, the expansion of the child tax credit and  applying it toward the payroll tax the way we have described is  essential.    Mr. President, I would like to congratulate Damiani  Stores on their 30th anniversary of providing south Florida with  exceptional service and quality men's clothing. With three locations  serving the south Florida area, Damiani is an example of a successful  local business, one that started by selling suits out of the owner's  vehicle in 1987. They uphold a strong, longstanding reputation of  prestige in our community, and I have no doubt they will see many more  years of continued success.                            ____________________
