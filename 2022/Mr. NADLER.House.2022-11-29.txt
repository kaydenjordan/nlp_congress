Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on S. 4003.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 4003, the Law Enforcement De-Escalation Training Act  of 2022, is bipartisan legislation that would improve training for law  enforcement officers, including using alternatives to force and de- escalation tactics. It also includes training and support for officers  working with mental health professionals and crisis intervention teams.   This bill would empower police and the mental health professionals  working with them to link individuals to services in their community.   Law enforcement officers are often the first responders to  individuals in crisis. While we have worked to develop and implement  non-law-enforcement crisis response services, there continues to be a  need to train and equip law enforcement officers to de-escalate  interactions and divert individuals to appropriate mental and  behavioral health services.   Additionally, there is a need to provide officers and crisis response  teams the tools they need to understand and respond to individuals with  disabilities. One study found that disabled individuals make up one- third to one-half of all people killed by law enforcement officers.   Reforms to law enforcement, including de-escalation training, both  improve public safety and reduce crime. A study of the Louisville,  Kentucky, police department found that de-escalation training reduced  use-of-force incidents by 28 percent and community member injuries by  26 percent. Officer injuries were reduced by an even larger margin of  36 percent.   S. 4003 will require the Department of Justice's Office of Community  Oriented Policing Services to consult with a broad range of  stakeholders in developing the training curriculum, including law  enforcement and behavioral health groups, as well as civil rights and  civil liberties groups and associations that represent individuals with  disabilities.   This bill also requires the National Institute of Justice and the  Government Accountability Office to evaluate the implementation of the  program and the effect of the training to ensure that the curricula  have a tangible impact on law enforcement encounters with people in  crisis and to identify possible changes that would further improve  outcomes.   This bipartisan bill improves public safety by developing and  implementing evidence-based de-escalation training for law enforcement  officers. I thank Senator Cornyn for introducing the bill and  Congresswoman Karen Bass for leading the House version of this  important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   S. 4003 is bipartisan legislation that would improve training for law  enforcement officers, including using alternatives to force and de- escalation tactics. This training will reduce use-of-force incidents  and improve officer and community safety.   I cannot imagine how anybody can think this will somehow increase  crime. Senator Cornyn, who is not known to be soft on crime, is the  major Senate sponsor.   I urge all Members to support it, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 3846) to reauthorize the Justice and Mental Health  Collaboration Program, and for other purposes, as amended.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on S. 3846.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 3846, the Justice and Mental Health Collaboration  Reauthorization Act of 2022, is bipartisan legislation that would  reauthorize and make necessary improvements to the Justice and Mental  Health Collaboration Program, or JMHCP, within the Department of  Justice.   Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, communities across the  country have grappled with worsened mental health. There continues to  be a need to adequately address the mental health needs of our  communities and to redirect people in crisis away from the criminal  justice system and into the healthcare system.   State and local governments use JMHCP grants for critical services to  address the mental health needs of their communities, including by  establishing diversion programs, creating or expanding community-based  treatment programs, supporting the development of curricula for police  academies and orientations, and providing in-jail treatment and  transitional services.   Additionally, grant funds are used to train law enforcement on  identifying and improving their responses to people experiencing a  mental health crisis. This program, which was first created in 2004,  was reauthorized in 2008 and again in 2016 with bipartisan support.   S. 3846 will make needed improvements to the grant program by  strengthening support for mental health courts and crisis intervention  teams; supporting diversion programming and training for State and  local prosecutors; strengthen support for co-responder teams; and  supporting the integration of the national suicide prevention and  mental health crisis hotline system into the existing public safety  system.   This bill will also increase allowable uses for grant funds to  include suicide prevention in jails and clarify that crisis  intervention teams can be placed in 911 call centers.   This bipartisan bill improves the efficacy of the JMHCP grant program  and is supported by a wide range of stakeholders, including the  Addiction Policy Forum, the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention,  the Major Cities Chiefs Association, Major County Sheriffs of America,  National Alliance on Mental Illness, and many others.   I thank Senator Cornyn for introducing the bill and Congressman   Bobby Scott for introducing the House version of this important  legislation. I urge all of my colleagues to support the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a member of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Scott).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, the Justice and Mental Health Collaboration Program  funds a variety of essential services to support the mental health  needs of communities across the country and redirect people in crisis  away from the criminal justice system and into the healthcare system.   This legislation would reauthorize and strengthen this important  program so that it can continue to serve those in need of its services.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 3115) to remove the 4-year sunset from the Pro bono Work to  Empower and Represent Act of 2018.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 3115         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Pro bono Work to Empower and       Represent Act of 2021'' or the ``POWER 2.0 Act''.       SEC. 2. REMOVAL OF SUNSET.         Section 3(a) of the Pro bono Work to Empower and Represent       Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-237; 132 Stat. 2448) is amended       by striking ``for a period of 4 years''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on S. 3115.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, nearly 25 percent of women suffer from domestic violence  at some point in their lives. Domestic violence and related offenses  destroy lives and shatter families. Among the many challenges that  victims face is a lack of legal representation when seeking assistance  from the court system.   According to the National Network to End Domestic Violence, in just  one day in September 2014, domestic violence assistance programs  received more than 10,000 requests for services, including legal  representation, that were not met. The effect of this lack of  representation is devastating. Research has shown that 83 percent of  victims represented by counsel were able to obtain protective orders,  while only 32 percent of unrepresented victims were able to do so.   That is why in 2018, Congress stepped in by enacting the POWER Act,  which requires the chief judge of every judicial district to hold an  annual public event, in partnership with a State, local, Tribal, or  domestic violence service provider or volunteer attorney project, in  promoting pro bono legal services as a critical way to empower  survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault. The act also  requires that events be held every 2 years in areas with high numbers  of Native Americans and Alaska Natives, with a focus on addressing the  specific issues facing Native populations.   We recognize that pro bono legal assistance would not only provide  critical representation in court, but it would also help provide  survivors with access to services such as emergency shelter,  transportation, and childcare. We also recognize that legal summits  mandated by the act would raise awareness of the horrors of domestic  violence and sexual assault while inspiring others to devote their  efforts to helping survivors in their communities.   In addition to providing for these pro bono programs, the 2018 act  requires the Administrative Office of the United States Courts to  report to Congress about each public event conducted in the previous  fiscal year.   The programs authorized under the original POWER Act have been  extremely successful. In 2021, 73 pro bono legal summits were held  across the Nation, reaching more than 11,000 attorneys. In the years  since we passed the POWER Act, we have amassed an army of thousands of  lawyers who are helping survivors, including children, get out of  dangerous situations, giving them a measure of justice and a ray of  hope.   But as effective as they have been, the programs created and  authorized by the 2018 POWER Act are set to sunset at the end of this  year. Meanwhile, the crisis of domestic and sexual violence continues.   S. 3115, the POWER 2.0 Act, would ensure the continuation of the  critical programs we enacted in 2018 by removing the sunset date for  these programs, helping to deliver essential legal services and to  bring hope and healing to many more survivors across the country. We  have already planted the seeds, and by removing the 4-year sunset  provision from the original POWER Act, we will allow these pivotal  programs to continue to grow and thrive, helping more and more  survivors every year.   I thank Senator Dan Sullivan for introducing this important and time- sensitive legislation and the gentlewoman from Alaska (Ms. Peltola) for  leading the House version of this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in support of this bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Alaska (Mrs. Peltola), the House sponsor of the bill and a worthy  successor to our late colleague,  Don Young.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for  closing.   Mr. Speaker, there are an untold number of victims of domestic and  sexual violence in this country, including young children, who are  without legal recourse to escape their abusers, to protect themselves  and their families, and to obtain the services they need to rebuild  their lives.   The POWER Act has started the hard work of incentivizing and  encouraging thousands of lawyers to provide pro bono legal services to  the victims and survivors that are most in need. But we need more  attorneys to join the cause.   By removing the sunset date from the POWER Act, S. 3115 will allow us  to continue and expand the critical programs we created in 2018, while  ensuring that there is no gap in access to services for those who need  them.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in support of  this crucial legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1600     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5455) to amend the First Step Act of 2018 to permit  defendants convicted of certain offenses to be eligible for reduced  sentences, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on H.R. 5455.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5455, which would clarify that  the retroactivity provision of section 404 of the First Step Act of  2018 is available to all offenders who were sentenced for a crack  offense before the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 became effective,  including individuals convicted of offenses involving small quantities  of crack.   After decades of unfair sentences that swept too broadly, most often  applied to low-level dealers and impacted minorities  disproportionately, Congress has worked to right some of the wrongs of  the misguided war on drugs, often on a bipartisan basis. This  legislation continues that important effort.   In 1986, in response to a surge in the use of crack cocaine and  several high-profile cocaine-related deaths, Congress passed the Anti- Drug Abuse Act, which created mandatory minimum penalties for drug  offenses and introduced a 100-1 sentencing disparity between crack  cocaine and powder cocaine offenses.   This meant that a person who distributed 5 grams of crack cocaine  received the same 5-year mandatory minimum sentence as a person who  distributed 500 grams of powder cocaine, and the person who distributed  50 grams of crack cocaine received the same 10-year mandatory minimum  sentence as the person who distributed 5,000 grams of powder cocaine.   It soon became evident that this sentencing disparity had also  created a significant racial disparity. Four years after Congress  passed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, the average Federal sentence for  African-American defendants was 49 percent higher than the average for  White defendants.   In 2010, Congress passed the Fair Sentencing Act, which did not  eliminate the disparity but which significantly reduced the ratio from  100-1 to 18-1. Unfortunately, that legislation applied only to pending  and future cases, leaving thousands of inmates without a path to  petition for relief.   In 2018, the bipartisan First Step Act made the Fair Sentencing Act  retroactive if an inmate received ``a sentence for a covered offense,''  as defined in section 404 of the Act, providing a pathway to relief for  some but not all individuals affected by the sentencing disparity.   Three years later, after roughly 4,000 motions for sentence  reductions had been granted, the Supreme Court, in Terry v. United  States, limited the availability of sentence reductions under the Fair  Sentencing Act, contrary to the intent of Congress.   Based on a narrow reading of the meaning of ``covered offense,'' the  Court held that individuals convicted of crack offenses are only  eligible for a sentence reduction under the First Step Act if their  convictions triggered mandatory minimum penalties.   That means that individuals like Mr. Terry, who possessed less than 4  grams  [[Page H8626]]  of crack, are unable to seek sentence reductions, while individuals  convicted of sentences involving much larger quantities of crack can  seek a sentence reduction, and many have already done so, which is  simply absurd and unfair.   The First Step Act was meant to make retroactive sentencing relief  available to all individuals sentenced for crack cocaine offenses  before the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 took effect.   As Justice Sotomayor's concurring opinion in Terry reminds us,  Congress has numerous tools to correct this injustice, and H.R. 5455,  the Terry Technical Correction Act, is one of these tools.   The bill provides a new, expanded definition of ``covered offense''  that includes a list of drug offenses in the criminal code that do not  trigger mandatory minimum sentences.   The bill also ensures that no person seeking a sentencing reduction  under section 404 will be barred from filing a new petition on the  grounds that a judge had previously denied relief based on a  determination that the offense of conviction was not a ``covered  offense'' under the meaning provided in the First Step Act.   I thank Crime Subcommittee Chairwoman Jackson Lee, Representatives  Cicilline, Jeffries, Owens, Massie, and Delegate Holmes Norton for  introducing this important bipartisan bill. I urge all of my colleagues  to support it, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5455, the Terry Technical Correction  Act, is a straightforward bipartisan bill that advances our efforts to  make our criminal justice system more fair. I urge my colleagues to  support it, and I yield back the balance of my time.
