 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the good  people at Parkridge Pregnancy Medical Clinic in Lubbock, Texas.   Parkridge, a nonprofit pregnancy center, is celebrating 26 years of  providing compassionate care to mothers throughout their pregnancies,  and often in the most difficult of circumstances.   By providing ultrasounds, medical services, material assistance, and  even ministering to mothers' deeper emotional and spiritual needs, the  people at Parkridge are truly and literally saving lives.   You see, Madam Speaker, they believe, like I do, that all life is a  gift from God. They believe in the words etched into our Declaration of  Independence, our founding principle and fundamental belief that all of  us are created equally by God and endowed by our creator with the right  to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.   But for nearly 50 years now, we have fallen short of that national  ethic. Ever since the Supreme Court erred in Roe v. Wade, we have  failed to protect the sacred right for the most vulnerable among us,  rejecting the notion that life at every stage is equally valuable,  equally precious, not only in light of the Constitution, but in the  eyes of God.   Since then, over 60 million lives have been terminated through the  practice of abortion in these United States. And yet even in the shadow  of this darkness, we can see rays of hope shining through.   Because of places like Parkridge, I believe the tide is finally  turning, and in the direction of life. All across our country, the  growing momentum for a culture of life is palpable.   Last week, we learned that the abortion rate in America has dropped  to its lowest level at any point since 1973 and Roe v. Wade.   We have seen States throughout the country taking bold action to  defend the inherent dignity of every human life, especially those who  can't speak up for themselves.   I am proud to have supported every single pro-life measure considered  in this Chamber, from the Heartbeat Protection Act, to the pain-capable  protections, to defunding Planned Parenthood, to the recent born-alive  protection legislation.   I stand behind our President 100 percent in his efforts to reshape  the courts so that judges adhere to the Constitution and to the  independent and interpretive role that they are supposed to play,  rather than legislating from the bench and imposing their policy  preferences on the American people.   This is one of the most important and certainly lasting legacies of  this President, and I am proud to say and excited to say the Senate has  recently confirmed President Trump's 150th judicial nominee.   But I also recognize that in order to build a lasting culture of  life, we are going to need to do more than just change laws. We are  going to have to change hearts.   In the debate over abortion, the late Pennsylvania Governor Bob Casey  said:         The real question is not when life begins, but when love       begins.    For 26 years now, the people of Parkridge Pregnancy Center have been  coming alongside these young mothers not in judgment, but in joy, not  in condemnation, but to comfort, praying with them, loving them, and  ministering to them and meeting their deepest needs in their darkest  hours.   Thanks to the good and godly work that they are doing, along with  countless organizations like them across America, I hope, pray, and I  believe that we will soon see a day in our country when every child is  loved and every life, born or unborn, is celebrated, cherished, and  protected.    Madam Speaker, may God bless the Parkridge family, may He bless their  mission to protect life and promote love, all to the praise of God, the  author of both life and love.   Go west Texas.   Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining?    Madam Speaker, I would like to say that I feel like it  is incredibly irresponsible and premature and careless for this body,  led by our Speaker and the Democratic Party, to rush to this conclusion  and allege that our President has committed high crimes.   I don't believe this is under the auspices of pursuit of justice and  truth. I think it is placating a certain group in the Democratic Party.   I think this is more of the bloodlust for impeaching our President,  not because of high crimes, but because they hate him, they hate his  personality, they hate his policies, but that is no justification.   We are better than that as a country. We should be more responsible  in how we faithfully carry out our constitutional duties.   So I look forward to reading the transcript. I look forward to  getting the facts.   Republican or Democrat, Madam Speaker, we ought to look at the facts  and we ought to be very judicious and careful and certainly responsible  when wielding our constitutional oversight, and certainly that  provision of impeachment.   So that is what I am going to do on behalf of the good people of west  Texas and my beloved countrymen across the United States.                            ____________________
