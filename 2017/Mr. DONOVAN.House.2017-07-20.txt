 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R.  2825, the Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2017,  which will reauthorize the Department for the very first time.   As the chairman of the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness,  Response, and Communications, I am particularly proud of title VI of  division A, which includes provisions of my legislation, the PREPARE  Act.   The bill reauthorizes critical grant programs responsible for helping  first responders while measuring the returns on these investments. It  ensures first responders in fusion centers receive information on  cybersecurity threats. It requires FEMA to assess how homeland security  grant funding has closed capability gaps and provides grant recipients  with best practices to ensure fiscally responsible use of taxpayer  dollars. It requires the Department to consider the impact of emerging  technology while supporting efforts to achieve national interoperable  emergency communications.   The grant's authorization provisions have received the support of the  Police Commissioner of the City of New York, the International  Association of Fire Chiefs, the National Fusion Center Association, the  Major County Sheriffs of America, and the Conference of Mayors.   I include these letters of support in the Record.                                            The Police Commissioner,                                                City of New York,                                        New York, NY, June 12, 2017.      Chairman Michael McCaul,      Committee on Homeland Security, House of Representatives,           Washington DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul: New York City remains the nation's       top terror target because of its large population, historic       landmarks, iconic tourist destinations, and unique       international status. The New York City Police Department       (NYPD) is steadfast in fulfilling our mission to protect       millions of New York City residents, as well as the millions       of people who work in and visit our city each year.        The NYPD supports the new funding levels proposed in the       PREPARE Act. These levels reflect a willingness to ensure       that Law Enforcement is equipped with the tools to keep our       communities safe. The bill demonstrates an understanding that       we are safest when federal resources are focused where the       threats are.  [[Page H6114]]         The PREPARE Act would provide a crucial investment in       homeland security preparedness, both for the safety of New       York City and the entire nation. This investment is       particularly important in light of the recent events in       Europe and the expressed goals of a variety of groups seeking       to recruit individuals from within our borders to carry out       mass casualty attacks. Federal funding is essential to allow       law enforcement to adapt to the new challenges by developing       innovative technology and enhanced preparedness programs,       like the NYPD's Counterterrorism Bureau Training Unit.        I strongly support passage of the PREPARE Act and urge you       to continue to place the highest priority on protecting New       York and other high-threat urban areas. Increasing funding       for these key programs is critical to further ensuring our       nation's security and preparedness.        Thank you for your continued support of the New York City       Police Department.            All the best,                                                  James P. O'Neill,      Police Commissioner.                                   ____                                           International Association                                                  of Fire Chiefs,                                         Fairfax, VA, June 13, 2017.      Hon. Michael McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul: On behalf of the nearly 12,000 fire       and emergency service leaders of the International       Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC), I express our support for       Title VI of the amendment in the nature of a substitute to       the Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2017       (H.R. 2825). This legislation will play an important role in       helping our nation's fire and emergency service personnel to       respond to the escalating number of threats that we face.        As recent events have shown, the terrorist threat presents       a wide variety of tactics and techniques. For any type of       terrorist attack, local first responders will be the first       on-scene and will have to provide an immediate response. This       fact means that local first responders must be ready to       respond to explosives; active shooter incidents; complex,       coordinated attacks; and threats of biological or chemical       terrorism. The federal government can provide valuable       training and equipment as incentives to help states and local       governments develop multidisciplinary approaches to future       threats.        Title VI of the substitute amendment has a number of       provisions that will help local first responders, including:        Annually authorizing $800 million for the Urban Areas       Security Initiative (UASI) program and $600 million for the       State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSGP) from Fiscal       Year (FY) 2018 through FY 2022.        Allowing the use of SHSGP and UASI funds to develop medical       preparedness and surge capacity in case of a biological       attack, including medical kits to protect first responders       and their families;        Protecting the grant programs, like SHSGP and UASI, from       consolidation by the Federal Emergency Management Agency       without congressional authorization;        Authorizing a grant program to help emergency response       providers plan, train and prepare for complex, coordinated       attacks;        Expanding the role of the Chief Medical Officer to       authorize the development of policies to protect first       responders from the medical effects of acts of terrorism; and        Protecting the Office of Emergency Communications, which is       a valuable resource for improving public safety       communications interoperability, from elimination or       consolidation without congressional authorization.        The IAFC appreciates your leadership in ensuring that local       first responders are prepared to mitigate the increasing       number of threats facing our nation. An effective response by       local first responders at the beginning of a terrorist attack       will help save lives and reduce the success of an act of       terrorism. This legislation will help the nation's fire and       EMS personnel prepare for these threats. We urge the       committee members to support your substitute amendment to       H.R. 2825.            Sincerely,                                       Fire Chief John D. Sinclair,      President and Chairman of the Board.                                   ____                                                     National Fusion                                              Center Association,                                                      June 13, 2017.      Hon. Michael McCaul, Chairman,      Hon. Bennie Thompson, Ranking Member,      Committee on Homeland Security, House of Representatives,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson: I write       on behalf of the National Fusion Center Association (NFCA) in       support of provisions in the PREPARE Act that will strengthen       preparedness of the homeland.        The PREPARE Act would make meaningful improvements in the       way the Federal government supports terrorism prevention       activities carried out by fusion centers in collaboration       with the larger group of public safety partners including       components of the Department of Homeland Security. The bill       would reauthorize key preparedness grant programs with       improvements in the way the grants are administered,       including with meaningful input from the law enforcement       communities in each state. It would strengthen the Law       Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Activities requirement that       is in existing law by fostering enhanced engagement among law       enforcement practitioners and key offices within DHS       including the Office of State and Local Law Enforcement and       FEMA.        The bill also takes productive steps to help Federal,       state, and local partners share information on cyber threats.       Ensuring effective collaboration and preparedness regarding       cyber threats is becoming more important, and the PREPARE Act       would be helpful on this front by encouraging the timely       analysis and sharing of threat information.        We commend your consistent and aggressive efforts to find       ways for Congress to foster improved collaboration and       coordination by Federal, state, local, and private entities       to protect the homeland. We have made great progress, but we       have much more work to do. The PREPARE Act is the latest       example of your dedication to this purpose, and we look       forward to working with you and your colleagues to ensure       effective legislation is enacted.            Sincerely,                                                         Mike Sena,      President.                                   ____                                 Major County Sheriffs of America,                                       Alexandria, VA, June 9, 2017.      Hon. Michael McCaul,      House Homeland Security Committee, House of Representatives,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul: As Vice Presidents of the Major       County Sheriffs of America (MCSA) in charge of Homeland       Security and Government Affairs, we write to thank you for       your leadership and support of local law enforcement through       the FY18 grant authorizations found within Title VI of H.R.       2825, the Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act       of 2017.        MCSA is an association of elected Sheriffs representing the       nation's largest counties with populations of 500,000 people       or more. Collectively, we provide public safety services to       over 100 million residents and have a unique understanding of       the national security challenges facing our nation.        Since September 11, 2001, our country has made great       progress in our nation's ability to prepare for, respond to       and prevent terrorist attacks; however, in an era of deep       budget cuts and reduced federal funding, state and local law       enforcement do not have sufficient funds by themselves to       support the homeland security mission.        Federal funding such as the Homeland Security Grant Program       (HSGP) which includes the Urban Areas Security Initiative       (UASI) and the State Homeland Security Program (SHSP) work to       address gaps in local agency capabilities for responding to       terrorist threats in the homeland. Authorizing UASI at $800       million and SHSP at $600 million is critical to our efforts.       Local capabilities that have been built in part through UASI       and SHSP funds are not self-sustaining and require consistent       federal support to maintain a level of vigilance against       threats. This requires an active, and invested level of       collaboration with our partner agencies to maintain a level       of preparedness that our citizens deserve and expect.        There also remains a strong need for the Law Enforcement       Terrorism Prevention Activities (LETPA) requirement that is       in current law. Under this provision, 25% of all UASI and       SHSP funds that are received by a state must be used for       LETPA. If this requirement was removed, there would be zero       dedicated federal support for terrorism prevention       activities, which is a unique role of law enforcement. Based       on what we have recently seen all over the world, now is not       the time to step away from this critical activity. On a       related note, there should be much more formal local law       enforcement input into FEMA's grant guidance and       prioritization processes to ensure transparency in the policy       directives, grant guidance, and risk formulas.        We greatly appreciate your leadership and we thank you and       Committee staff for working honestly and collaboratively with       the MCSA. Please let us know if we can be of further       assistance as we continue our work to protect the homeland.            Very Respectfully,      Sheriff Michael J. Bouchard,        Oakland County (MI), MCSA VP--Government Affairs.      Sheriff Richard Stanek,        Hennepin County (MN), MCSA VP--Homeland Security.                                   ____                                    The U.S. Conference of Mayors,                                      Washington, DC, June 19, 2017.      Hon. Michael McCall,      Chairman, Homeland Security Committee,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCall: I write on behalf of The United       States Conference of Mayors to indicate our support for the       provisions relating to the homeland security grant programs       in H.R. 2825, the Department of Homeland Security       Authorization Act of 2017. At a time of growing concern about       the terror threat to our cities, it is important to have a       stable five-year source of funding that helps us prevent and       respond to attacks.        While we appreciate the authorization levels you have       included in the bill and understand the funding constraints       you faced in drafting the bill, we must be clear that more       funding is needed to help keep our cities safe. This applies,       of course, both to designated higher risk jurisdictions and       to the many areas not in that category, or no longer in that       category, which have critical infrastructure and other risk       factors which would suggest their need for assistance.  [[Page H6115]]         We also appreciate your inclusion of language that would       require authorization from Congress for any grant       consolidation proposals and the maintenance of the law       enforcement terrorism prevention set-aside, a provision of       great importance to our police departments.        The nation's mayors appreciate your leadership on homeland       security and other issues and look forward to working with       you and the Committee to see these provisions enacted into       law.            Sincerely,                                                       Tom Cochran,                                        CEO and Executive Director.     I am also pleased a number of the provisions provided by  the Committee on Homeland Security are included in division F of this  bill. These provisions authorize FEMA's senior law enforcement adviser,  ensure an appropriate focus on good management practices at FEMA,  support vital training programs for first responders, and codify the  Office of Disability Integration and Coordination to ensure individuals  with disabilities are integrated into disaster preparedness and  response efforts.   I look forward to continuing to work with Subcommittee Chairman  Barletta of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee as this  bill progresses through the process.   Mr. Speaker, I want to commend Chairman McCaul for his leadership in  getting this bill through the committee and onto the floor, and I urge  my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.
