 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory  of Paul Glaab who passed away on January 26.   Paul's career in public service began in the 1980s when he worked for  the Republican caucus in the California State assembly on business,  transportation, and housing issues. He continued to serve two  California Governors in the State's Division of Codes and Standards and  the Department of Transportation. He then served on the board of the  Orange County Transportation Authority and later as the board's chair.  Notably, he served two terms as Laguna Niguel's mayor.   Paul was a true public servant, and he will be missed by everyone in  the Orange County community.   Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Janice, his daughter  Molly, and the rest of his family. We join them in their mourning and  hope that they will find comfort in knowing that Paul's legacy of  leadership will live on for years to come.                            ____________________
