 Mr. Speaker, recently, if you look at the CDC numbers,  we hit an all-time record in drug overdoses for a 12-month period at  90,000. That is up from 45,000 only 6 years ago.   There are two dangerous trends that are going the exact opposite way  than you would think, if we care about the people who died and their  families.   First of all, because of the antipolice hysteria out there, the  number of police are being reduced; and for that reason, at least in my  area, they are no longer doing criminal investigations in some cities  when there are drug overdoses.   Secondly, I think the major reason for the massive increase in deaths  is the increase in fentanyl deaths--fentanyl being actually much more  dangerous than heroin.   We now have this happening at a time when the Border Patrol is being  pulled off the border to process unaccompanied minors and we have the  horrible situation of not even increasing the budget of the Border  Patrol.   Mr. Speaker, if we care about the 90,000 people who die every year of  drug overdoses, it is time to start caring a little bit more about the  border and care a little bit more about the number of police we have in  our country.                            ____________________
