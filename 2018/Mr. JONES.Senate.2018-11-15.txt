 Mr. President, today I wish to honor Albert B.  Head, a native of Troy, AL. Al has done a great deal for the southeast  and the country. His work has been particularly impactful in my home  State of Alabama, and I would like to touch on just a few of his  accomplishments today.   Al earned his undergraduate degree from Troy State University,  majoring in art history and aesthetics, was a star quarterback on Troy  State's 1968 NAIA national championship football team, and received his  master of liberal arts with a concentration on southern literature from  Auburn University at Montgomery.   In 1972, Al joined the Fine Arts Council of Florida and subsequently  received a National Endowment for the Arts fellowship to attend  Harvard's Arts Administration Institute in 1974. He served as executive  director at the Stephen Foster Folklife Center and the Louisiana  Division of the Arts before becoming executive director of the Alabama  State Council on the Arts, a position he has held with distinction  since 1985.   For more than 40 years as a director of three different cultural  agencies and as a national arts leader, Al has advocated for the  importance of the arts and the necessity of providing State support for  the arts. He is the only State arts director to start folk arts  programs in three States--Florida, Louisiana, and Alabama--and he has  strived to show how important the folk and traditional arts are to  defining and giving life to a community.   Al served two terms on the National Assembly of State Arts Agencies  board and in 1998 received the Gary Young Award from that organization  for his leadership and achievements in promoting the arts nationally.  Al has also served as a member of the South Arts board for 38 years,  presiding as its chair from 1983-85.   Al established the Alabama Center for Traditional Culture as a  division of the Alabama Council on the Arts dedicated to research and  presentation of the State's cultural traditions. In 1999, he received  the Alumnus of the Year Award from Troy University National Alumni  Association and in 2008 received the Distinguished Leadership Award  created by Troy University to recognize an alumnus who has rendered  outstanding service to the university and the public.   In 2012, he received the National Heritage Fellowship Bess Lomax  Hawes Award from the National Endowment for the Arts recognizing his  significant contributions to the preservation and awareness of cultural  heritage.   Al has developed a reputation as one of the foremost arts agency  directors in the Nation, has led the Alabama State Council on the Arts  through a period of tremendous growth and accomplishment and has served  as a mentor and champion for arts organizations and artists across the  State of  [[Page S7048]]  Alabama. He will be celebrated in Montgomery on December 6, 2018, and I  want to add my voice to the many others thanking him for his  work.                            ____________________
