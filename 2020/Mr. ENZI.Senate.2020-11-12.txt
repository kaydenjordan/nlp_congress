 Mr. President, I rise to submit to the Senate the budget  scorekeeping report for November 2020. This is my fourth scorekeeping  report since I filed the deemed budget resolution for fiscal year 2021  on May 4, 2020, as required by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019,  BBA19. The report compares current-law levels of spending and revenues  with the amounts agreed to in BBA19. In the Senate, this information is  used to determine whether budgetary points of order lie against pending  legislation. The Republican staff of the Budget Committee and the  Congressional Budget Office, CBO, prepared this report pursuant to  section 308(b) of the Congressional Budget Act, CBA. The information  included in this report is current through November 6, 2020.   Since I filed the last scorekeeping report on September 10, 2020, two  measures with significant enforceable budgetary effects have been  enacted. The first measure, the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2021 and  Other Extensions Act, P.L. 116-159, continued funding for all 12 annual  appropriations bills through December 11, 2020, and extended or  modified numerous surface transportation, healthcare, nutrition and  commodities, veterans' health and benefits, and immigration programs  and policies. The authorizing non-emergency provisions of the bill,  which were scored to the Finance (Division C), Agriculture (Division  D), and Veterans' Affairs (Division E) committees, would increase the  deficit $97.6 billion in fiscal year 2021, $7.1 billion over fiscal  year 2021-2025, and $8.4 billion over fiscal year 2021-2030. The bill  passed the Senate by a vote of 84-10.   The second measure, the Extension of the Caribbean Basin Economic  Recovery Act, P.L. 116-164, extended preferential duty treatment for  certain apparel items produced in the Caribbean Basin through fiscal  year 2030. It also extended the date through which certain customs user  fees and merchandise processing fees may be collected from September  30, 2029, to October 21, 2029. CBO estimated the bill would decrease  revenue by $299 million over the fiscal year 2021-2030 period, but the  fee extensions would reduce direct outlays by $435 million in fiscal  year 2030. On net,  [[Page S6670]]  the bill would reduce deficits by $136 million over the fiscal year  2021-2030 budget window. This bill cleared the Senate by unanimous  consent and was charged to the Finance Committee.   Budget Committee Republican staff prepared Tables A-D.   Table A provides the amount by which each Senate authorizing  committee exceeds or falls below its allocations for budget authority  and outlays under the fiscal year 2021 deemed budget resolutions. This  information is used for enforcing committee allocations pursuant to  section 302 of the CBA. As the table shows, five committees are  currently out of compliance with their allocations. The Finance  Committee's fiscal year 2021 breach is the largest for this recording  period and primarily stems from Division C, title V of P.L. 116-159,  which provided accelerated and advanced payments to Medicare providers.  CBO estimated that these advanced payments would be recouped in future  years.   Table B provides the amount by which the Senate Committee on  Appropriations is below or exceeds the statutory spending limits. This  information is used to determine points of order related to the  spending caps found in sections 312 and 314 of the CBA. Appropriations  for fiscal year 2021, displayed in this table, show that the  Appropriations Committee is currently compliant with spending limits  for fiscal year 2021. As of this filing, no full-year annual  appropriations bills have been enacted and figures displayed represent  advanced and permanent appropriations previously provided as well as  full-year anomalies from the most recently enacted continuing  resolution. Notably, P.L. 116-159 provided a full-year annual  appropriation of $13 million for costs associated with the upcoming  Presidential inauguration in January. This appropriation is categorized  as nonsecurity and has been charged to the Financial Services and  General Government subcommittee.   Table C displays figures related to the limit on the use of changes  in mandatory programs, CHIMPs, in appropriations bills. This $15  billion CHIMP limitation for fiscal year 2021 is found in section 207  of BBA19. The Appropriations Committee is currently in compliance with  this limit.   Table D provides the amount of budget authority enacted for fiscal  year 2021 that has been designated as either for an emergency or for  overseas contingency operations--OCO--pursuant to section 251 (b)(2)(A)  of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as  amended. Funding that receives either of these designations results in  cap adjustments to enforceable discretionary spending limits. There are  no limits on either emergency or OCO spending; however, any Senator may  challenge the designation with a point of order to strike the  designation on the floor. No new budget authority with either of these  designations has been enacted for fiscal year 2021.   In addition to the tables provided by Budget Committee Republican  staff, I am submitting CBO tables which I will use to enforce budget  totals approved by Congress.   For fiscal year 2021, CBO annualizes the effects of the last  continuing resolution, which provides funding through December 11,  2020. For the enforcement of budgetary aggregates under section 311 of  the CBA, the Budget Committee historically excludes temporary funding.  As such, the current law levels, which exclude the temporary effects of  the continuing resolution, are $1,079.0 billion and $569.6 billion in  budget authority and outlays, respectively, below allowable levels,  Tables 1 and 2. This spending room will be spent down as regular  appropriations bills are enacted for the budget year. Revenues exceed  assumed levels by $267 million, $1.4 billion, and $2.8 billion over the  fiscal year 2021, fiscal year 2021-2025, and fiscal year 2021-2030  periods, respectively. Social Security levels are at the levels assumed  by the fiscal year 2021 deemed budget.   CBO's report also provides information needed to enforce the Senate  Pay-As-You-Go, PAYGO, rule, table 3. This rule is enforced under  section 4106 of the 2018 budget resolution. The Senate PAYGO scorecard  currently shows enacted deficit increases in every enforceable window.  The largest debit on the scorecard is $17.1 billion over the fiscal  year 2020-2030 period. The deficit increases caused by the authorizing  provisions of the most recently enacted continuing resolution were  excluded from the PAYGO scorecard pursuant to a direction in that law.   This submission also includes a table tracking the Senate's budget  enforcement activity on the floor since the enforcement filing on May  4, 2020. No points of order have been raised since my September report.   All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years.   I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables be printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:   TABLE A.--SENATE AUTHORIZING COMMITTEES--ENACTED DIRECT SPENDING ABOVE                    (+) OR BELOW (-) BUDGET RESOLUTIONS                         [In millions of dollars] ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                             2021    2021-2025  2021-2030 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry     Budget Authority....................     8,418     10,002     12,089     Outlays.............................     8,261      9,676     11,462 Armed Services     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs     Budget Authority....................         0          4         21     Outlays.............................         0          4         21 Commerce, Science, and Transportation     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Energy and Natural Resources     Budget Authority....................     2,820     14,420     19,410     Outlays.............................       310      5,870     17,280 Environment and Public Works     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Finance     Budget Authority....................    89,738        373       -432     Outlays.............................    89,644     -1,116       -435 Foreign Relations     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Homeland Security and Governmental  Affairs     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Judiciary     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Rules and Administration     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Intelligence     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Veterans' Affairs     Budget Authority....................        13        -86          7     Outlays.............................        13        -86          7 Indian Affairs     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Small Business     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0                                          -------------------------------     Total         Budget Authority................   100,989     24,713     31,095         Outlays.........................    98,228     14,348     28,335 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ This table is current through November 6, 2020.

Mike Enzi,      Chairman, Committee on the Budget,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: The enclosed report shows the effects of       Congressional action on the fiscal year 2021 budget and is       current through November 6, 2020. This report is submitted       under section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the       Congressional Budget Act, as amended.        The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues       are consistent with the allocations, aggregates, and other       budgetary levels printed in the Congressional Record on May       4, 2020, pursuant to section 205 of the Bipartisan Budget Act       of 2019 (Public Law 116-37).        Since our last current level dated September 4, 2020, the       Congress has cleared and the President has signed the       following legislation that has significant effects on budget       authority, outlays, or revenues in fiscal year 2021:        Continuing Appropriations Act, 2021 and Other Extensions       Act (Public Law 116-159); and        Extension of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act       (Public Law 116-164).
