 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Washington  State for his leadership and the floor debate.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the 2018 farm bill, and I  thank Chairman Conaway, Collin Peterson, and all the members of the  House Agriculture Committee staff for all their hard work. There is no  single piece of legislation more important in my district or rural  communities throughout this Nation than the farm bill, and given the  depressed state of the farm economy, there has never been a more  pressing time to get one passed.   The 2018 farm bill significantly strengthens the agriculture safety  net, which will give our producers the certainty they need to keep  providing a safe and affordable supply of food to our families. It also  makes important investments in rural infrastructure to help sustain  these small towns that are so critical to our vibrant agriculture  economy.   Additionally, 18 of the 21 House-passed reforms to the Food Stamp  program are reflected in the final report, which strengthen the  program's integrity, provide needed oversight, and reduce waste, fraud,  and abuse.   Finally, this farm bill stewards the American taxpayer monies in a  fiscally responsible way by having a farm bill that is budget neutral.   Mr. Speaker, agriculture and traditional American values go hand in  hand. Farmers and ranchers represent more than food and fiber. They  symbolize a culture of faith, hard work, and independence, which has  always been at the heart of America's greatness.   The 2018 farm bill will not only support our producers and families  living in rural America, it will provide security and peace of mind to  all Americans by maintaining our ability to feed and clothe our own  people, or agriculture independence.   I urge my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, to support our farmers and  ranchers, to support rural America, to support agriculture independence  in these United States, and I urge them to vote ``yes'' for the 2018  farm bill.
