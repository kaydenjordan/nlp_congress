 Madam Speaker, the NAACP has been at the forefront in  the fight for equal educational, social, economic, and legal rights for  African American communities.   The Mainland-Pleasantville NAACP branch, led by President Olivia  Caldwell, has continuously fought for those things, and they recently  held their annual Freedom Fund Awards Luncheon. The luncheon honored  the people who fought alongside the NAACP and their efforts for equal  rights.   President of Atlantic Cape Community College, Dr. Barbara Gaba,  received the education award for furthering educational fulfillment in  the African American community.   I would like to thank Dr. Gaba, President Caldwell, and the NAACP for  their resilience in the fight for equality that not only impacts the  people of south Jersey, but all Americans everywhere. We all have the  same blood flowing through our veins.   May God bless them.                            ____________________
