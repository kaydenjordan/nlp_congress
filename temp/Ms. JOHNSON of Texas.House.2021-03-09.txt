 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support  of H.R. 842, the Protecting the Right to Organize Act of 2021, or the  PRO Act.   For too long, wealthy corporations and employers have dictated the  stability and success of working and middle-class Americans--often  without their best interests in mind. The PRO Act seeks to combat this  injustice by providing increased opportunities for workers to organize,  holding employers accountable for violations of workers' rights, and  securing free, fair, and safe union elections.   The timing of the vote on this legislation is crucial. We have  watched as the COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the existing  inequalities in our economy. The rich have gotten richer, while the  employees on the front lines have faced harsh conditions, risks to  their health, and a minimal, at best, increase in pay. It is therefore  critical that these workers be able to exercise their right to organize  a union so that they can advocate as one for higher wages, better  benefits, and safer working conditions.   As a dues-paying, active member of the American Federation of  Government Employees (AFGE), I have seen firsthand the important role  that unions play in empowering workers across the country. And I will  continue to be a strong advocate for workers' rights--because our  country is only as strong as our workers.   Madam Speaker, a strong middle class is essential to a strong  economy. That is why I am proud to support the PRO Act and would  encourage its immediate consideration in the Senate.
