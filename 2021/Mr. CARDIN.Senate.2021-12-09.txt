 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, shortly, I am going to be making a  unanimous consent request in regard to the confirmations of several  nominations that are currently pending before the U.S. Senate.   My colleagues have been pointing out that these are unprecedented  times with the number of Presidential nominations that have cleared our  committee and cleared committees with overwhelming votes--in some  cases, near unanimous votes--of people who are well qualified for the  positions to which they have been nominated, but they cannot take their  responsibilities, their oaths, until after we have confirmed them  before the U.S. Senate.   So, for reasons unrelated to their qualifications or the need to have  confirmed nominees in positions, we have seen individual objections to  allowing these nominations to go forward--objections from Republican  Members of the U.S. Senate. I say that because these are unprecedented.  We have never seen mass numbers like we have seen in this Congress.   We have a responsibility. We have a responsibility to confirm  Presidential nominations so that they can carry out the missions that  we want them to carry out and the responsibilities that go with the  reasons why we think it is important enough for the Senate to confirm  those nominations. We then have a responsibility to take these  nominations up in a timely way and act on them.   Secondly, when we have a confirmed person in position, we get greater  accountability on the responsibilities of  [[Page S9060]]  that Agency. We have a person whom we can hold accountable because of  the actions that we have taken in confirming that individual. Both are  missing in regard to not having these confirmed positions.   I chair the subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee  that deals with the management of the State Department, and I am going  to be asking unanimous consent in regard to seven nominees who passed  out of our committees a long time ago and have been pending in the  Senate for months. There is no question as to the qualifications of the  individuals, but they are not able to take on the responsibilities for  why we decided it was important enough to have nominations with the  confirmations of the Senate. That is just not right, and I think we  need to point that out.   First, I want to just talk about the individuals, and then I will  make my consent.   One is Adam Scheinman, as the Special Representative of the President  for Nuclear Nonproliferation, with the rank of Ambassador. The  nomination has been pending before the full Senate since October 19-- for over 50 days.   Adam Scheinman is the Special Representative of the President for the  Nuclear Nonproliferation, a position that is essential to national  security as a U.S. Special Representative on the nuclear  nonproliferation treaties and the support of activities to strengthen  global nuclear nonproliferation regimes. Can you think of a more  important position?   Mr. Scheinman is eminently qualified for the position to which he has  been nominated, and there is no stated reason not to confirm his  nomination.   The second is Jack Markell, to be Representative of the United States  to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, with the  rank of Ambassador. Jack Markell is the nominee to be the Ambassador of  the OECD, known as the heavy-weight multilateral organization in the  area of anti-corruption and keeper of the OECD's anti-bribery  convention, which is one of the most important international anti- corruption treaties. We all talk about our commitment to fight  corruption, and yet we are holding back a confirmed ambassador to that  position.   Jack Markell is a former Governor and is eminently qualified for the  position to which he has been nominated. There is no reason why we  should not confirm his nomination.   Marcela Escobari was appointed to be the Assistant Administrator of  the U.S. Agency for International Development, USAID. The Assistant  Administrator for Latin America and the Caribbean oversees all USAID  activities in the region, including the 13 field offices for regional  programs and 3 Washington, DC-based programs. Ms. Escobari served in  the same position for which this nomination is being made under the  Obama-Biden administration.   I must tell you, I was on a call with Senator Blunt yesterday with  regard to Colombia, the need to up our game in regard to USAID  activities in that one country and so many more.   Ms. Escobari is eminently qualified for the position to which she has  been nominated. Indeed, she served in this position under the Obama- Biden administration, and she should be confirmed today.   Atul Gawande has been nominated as the Assistant Administrator of the  United States Agency for International Development, another USAID  appointment. He would lead the U.S. international health, development,  and humanitarian efforts worldwide.   Now, more than ever, we know we need a confirmed person in the USAID  to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. Our leadership is desperately  needed. We are asking lots of international questions today from the  Biden administration. Wouldn't it be nice to have a confirmed  ambassador who is responsible for this?   The nomination has been pending before the full Senate since  September 29, for over 70 days.   Dr. Gawande is eminently qualified for the position to which he has  been nominated. There is no good reason not to confirm him today.   Next will be Marcia Bernicat, as the Director General of the Foreign  Service and Chair of the Board of the Foreign Service, Department of  State.   The Director General of Foreign Service, who serves concurrently as  the Director of Global Talent Management, is responsible for leading  the GTM Bureau's mission of recruiting, retaining, and sustaining a  diverse, talented, and inclusive Foreign Service and Civil Service  workforce at the Department of State.   The position is critical in the modernization of the State Department  and making sure the Department is attracting and training the necessary  talent needed to tackle the challenges of the 21st century.   This nomination has been pending before the full Senate since  September 13, over 86 days.   I recently held a hearing in the subcommittee on the retention and  training of our State Department personnel. We had lots of questions,  lots of good things we need to do. We need a confirmed administrator in  order to have a person responsible to carry out the changes that we  need in regard to the personnel at the State Department. There is no  reason why she should not be confirmed without any further delay.   My next unanimous consent will be in regard to Julieta Valls Noyes to  be Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees, and  Migration.   Now, more than ever, with the administration dealing with a backlog  that has been heightened by COVID and with the withdrawal from  Afghanistan, the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration needs to  have a Senate-confirmed representative in place.   This nomination has been pending for over 50 days.   My colleagues on both sides of the aisle are questioning the State  Department and asking what they are doing to get people out of  Afghanistan. We are asking valid questions. There is no reason to hold  up this nomination from the point of view of her qualifications.   We need this position filled in order to carry out our responsibility  to those Afghans who are at risk today and migrants who are at risk  around the world.   Lastly, I will be asking consent with regard to Anne Witkowsky, the  nominee for Assistant Secretary for Conflict and Stabilization  Operations and Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization.   The Conflict and Stabilization Operation Bureau is responsible to  anticipate, prevent, and respond to conflicts that undermine U.S.  national interests. We are putting our national security at risk  without leadership in the Conflict and Stabilization Bureau to assess  how the United States will engage in emerging conflicts.   We were trying to stop conflicts from happening. We all recognize  that. The risk factors couldn't be greater around the world for  conflict. We need to have a confirmed Assistant Secretary responsible  for this portfolio in place immediately.   This nomination was reported out of the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee on August 4. Her nomination has been awaiting confirmation  for 126 days.   Dr. Witkowsky is fully qualified and should be confirmed without  further delay.   So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule  XXII, the Senate proceed to executive session to consider the following  nominations: Executive Calendar Nos. 323, 327, 328, 461, 462, and 528;  that the nominations be confirmed, the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate; that no further motions be in order to the nominations; that  any related statements be printed in the Record; that the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's actions; and the Senate resume  legislative session.    Mr. President, I would be willing to modify to get those  two nominations approved. I want to be clear. I have been told that  there may be other objections on the other side of the aisle. I would  like to get them done right now, if possible. I would modify my request  to get these two nominations done.   I have been told that there is a Republican objection to the other  two nominations.   Let me just conclude this part of the discussion by saying I  understand that you have a right to demand a vote, but you are  requiring us to file cloture, which means basically it is a filibuster.  And under the Senate rules, that requires an intervening day; it  requires a vote and debate on the cloture motion; then debate time. And  there are only a certain number you can get done within a period of  time while other ones are pending.   So the fact that we are not able to have a process to conclude these  nominations is not the majority leader's fault. It is the fault of the  massive objections that are being made en bloc to qualified individuals  in regards to these appointments.   And I understand the gentleman's concerns, but the American people  have a right to demand that there is an accountable person to deal with  nonproliferation, that there is a confirmed nominee to deal with the  remaining individuals that are in Afghanistan that we are trying to get  out of Afghanistan. And by denying the confirmations of these  appointments, we are denying the rights of Americans to have  accountable people confirmed by the Senate in regards to all of these  important subjects.   So, for all those reasons, I am disappointed. I will take back to my  colleagues the offer in regards to the two individuals that the  gentleman mentioned. And if we can clear those two, we will try to  bring them back to the floor and get them cleared. So I appreciate that  offer, and we will see what we can do about getting those two  confirmed.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today--on International Anti- Corruption Day, as declared by the United Nations--to speak about the  Democracy Summit that President Biden is convening today and tomorrow,  to which government leaders from 110 countries have been invited. It  will also include a range of leading civil society actors, business and  labor leaders, civic educators and investigative journalists,  philanthropists, and nonprofit leaders as speakers and participants.   Undeterred by the Coronavirus pandemic, the Biden administration has  organized a global virtual gathering with participants tuning in from  six continents. It is an ambitious, even audacious, undertaking.   And it comes at a critical time, as the world is now 15 years into a  global democratic recession, according to the well-respected watchdog  organization Freedom House. In its widely cited annual survey of  freedom, it has reported that, in each of the past 15 years, more  countries have seen their democracy scores decline than the number of  countries whose scores have improved. And last year, during the height  of the global pandemic, nearly 75 percent of the world's population  lived in a country that saw its democracy score deteriorate last year.   For a President who has pledged to put democratic values at the heart  of American foreign policy, it is fitting and proper that he should  convene the democratic leaders of the world and other relevant parties  to plan the revitalization of global democracy.   Of course, readers of the annual Freedom House assessment will know  that there are not 110 well-functioning, effective democracies in the  world and that way too many poorly performing nominal democracies have  been invited to this gathering, thus diluting its character.   While some conspicuously back-sliding countries, like Hungary and  Turkey, have not been invited, there are numerous back-sliding pseudo- democracies, including the current governments of the Philippines and  Pakistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Zambia, Bolsinaro's  Brazil among others, that unfortunately have been included.   Then there is India, which dropped from Free to Partly Free status in  Freedom in the World 2021, which contributes significantly to the fact  that 75 percent of the world's people last year resided in countries  moving away from democracy. Yet the government of Prime Minister  Narendra Modi, after its sustained crack down on critics during the  past 2 years and the atrocious scapegoating of Muslims, who were  disproportionately blamed for the spread of the virus and faced attacks  by vigilante mobs, has been invited to the Democracy Summit.   Members of the Senate will also know that there has been precious  little information sharing with this body about the contours of the  summit. There has been no discussion with us about the invitation list  or the way forward from this week's summit, which I see as a missed  opportunity for the Biden administration.   On the other hand, I was proud to be able to participate in a side  event convened last Friday morning by the House Democracy Partnership  for a discussion with legislators from other countries about the  important role that parliaments can and do play in leading their  governments to address the enduring and universal problem of  corruption. I want to congratulate Representative   David Price of  North Carolina for his leadership of that important initiative and for  convening a productive international exchange of views last week in the  run up to the President's gathering. One of the main take-aways from  that webinar was that it is always incumbent on the legislatures of the  world to press forward with laws that instruct and enable executive  branch officials to elevate their work to combat corruption.   This is the main topic of my intervention today, to discuss one of  the hopeful aspects of the President's Democracy Summit, which is the  central role that the battle against corruption is playing in the  proceedings and to underscore the leading role that we in the Congress  must take to compel further action from our colleagues in the executive  branch.   History tells us that they will likely not do so on their own. In  fact, the history of anti-corruption laws in the United States is  replete with fervent opposition from the executive branch, whether  during Democratic administrations or Republican, to virtually every  measure proposed in the Congress. This was true of the Foreign Corrupt  Practices Act of 1977, which barred U.S. companies and their officials  from paying bribes in foreign countries. The executive and the business  community declared that this would end the ability of American  corporations to do business around the world, which turned out not to  be true, of course.   Indeed, it became in due course a foundational element in the United  Nations Convention Against Corruption--UNCAC--and other elements of the  international architecture of the battle against corruption.   Yet the executive has continued to oppose every measure introduced in  Congress to address kleptocrats and human rights abusers, including the  original Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012 and  its successor, the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act of  2016.   This is especially ironic because, since the enactment of the 2016  law, both Republican and Democratic administrations have been utilizing  the law frequently and to good effect. Indeed, today, Secretary of  State Tony Blinken announced that--on the occasion of International  anti-Corruption  [[Page S9089]]  Day--the Department of State has designated 12 individuals from 7  countries for significant corruption and also named another 18 family  members. In five of the designations, the Treasury Department has  invoked Global Magnitsky sanctions for their roles in corruption.   The Democracy Summit is being built around three principal themes:  defending against authoritarianism, promoting respect for human rights,  and fighting corruption. Corruption is the means and the method for  kleptocratic rulers around the world to steal from their own people and  to stash their wealth in safe havens, most often in the democratic  Western world. This is directly and intimately connected to the  undermining of the rule of law and the repression of human rights in  these same countries--which is why I was so pleased to see that, on  June 3 of this year, President Biden declared the fight against  corruption to be ``a core national security interest.'' And he directed  his National Security Advisor to develop a comprehensive strategy to  address the problem.   Accordingly, earlier this week, in the run-up to the Democracy  Summit, the White House published the first ``United States Strategy on  Countering Corruption.''   The strategy is a 38-page document that describes several major lines  of effort in the new strategy. Among the document's commitments are  pledges to crack down on dirty money in U.S. real estate, to require  certain gatekeepers to the U.S. financial system such as attorneys,  accountants, and investment advisers to perform greater due diligence  on their prospective clients, and to make it a crime for foreign  officials to solicit or accept bribes from U.S. companies.   If this strategy is matched with appropriate resources, it has the  power to fundamentally change the calculus for kleptocrats and redirect  stolen funds back to the original problems they were meant to fund such  as fighting the pandemic, countering the effects of climate change,  funding economic development and opportunity.   We in the Congress can do our part by passing pending legislation  that would further strengthen the hand of the U.S. Government in this  effort. While there are a number of valuable proposals pending, there  are two that I suggest would be the most impactful and necessary.   The first is the Combating Global Corruption Act, S. 14, which I  introduced and was cosponsored by my Republican friend from Indiana,  Mr. Young, which would create an annual global report, modeled in some  ways on the Trafficking-in-Persons report, in which the State  Department would assess how earnestly and effectively the governments  of the world are living up to the commitments they have made in  international treaties and covenants. The report would also place the  countries of the world in 3 tiers, according to how well they are  doing. And for those in the lowest performing tier, likely the  governments that are actually kleptocracies, the bill asks that the  executive branch assess government officials in those places for  possible designation for Global Magnitsky sanctions.   The second is the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act,  S. 93, which I introduced and was cosponsored by my Republican friend  from Mississippi, Mr. Wicker, which would permanently reauthorize the  existing Global Magnitsky framework and to widen the aperture of the  law to encompass more bad actors and actions.   Both these measures have been reported favorably and unanimously by  the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, and both are ready for final  action by the Senate. As President Biden convenes the Democracy Summit  today, with its major focus on the battle against corruption, it would  be timely for the Senate to demonstrate our resolve as well.   So I hope that my colleagues here in the Senate will agree in the  coming days to adopt these two bills, so that we may take them to the  House of Representatives, where they also enjoy bipartisan support, and  get them onto the desk of President Biden during the coming year.  Participating governments in the Democracy Summit, including the United  States, are making commitments to strengthen their own democracies in  the next 12 months, in advance of a second summit that is envisioned  for next December.   The American position will be enhanced if we have enacted these laws  before then.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that selected excerpts of the  ``United States Strategy on Countering Corruption'' be printed in the  Congressional Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:              United States Strategy on Countering Corruption   Pursuant to the National security Study Memorandum on Establishing the    fight against corruption as a core united States National Security                          Interest--December 2021       Introduction        When government officials abuse public power for private       gain, they do more than simply appropriate illicit wealth.       Corruption robs citizens of equal access to vital services,       denying the right to quality healthcare, public safety, and       education. It degrades the business environment, subverts       economic opportunity, and exacerbates inequality. It often       contributes to human rights violations and abuses, and can       drive migration. As a fundamental threat to the rule of law,       corruption hollows out institutions, corrodes public trust,       and fuels popular cynicism toward effective, accountable       governance.        Moreover, the impacts of corruption frequently reverberate       far beyond the immediate environment in which the acts take       place. In today's globalized world, corrupt actors bribe       across borders, harness the international financial system to       stash illicit wealth abroad, and abuse democratic       institutions to advance anti-democratic aims. Emerging       research and major journalistic exposes have documented the       extent to which legal and regulatory deficiencies in the       developed world offer corrupt actors the means to offshore       and launder illicit wealth. This dynamic in turn strengthens       the hand of those autocratic leaders whose rule is predicated       on the ability to co-opt and reward elites.        On June 3, 2021, President Biden established the fight       against corruption as a core national security interest of       the United States. As he wrote in National Security Study       Memorandum-I (NSSM-1), ``corruption threatens United States       national security, economic equity, global antipoverty and       development efforts, and democracy itself. . . . [B]y       effectively preventing and countering corruption and       demonstrating the advantages of transparent and accountable       governance, we can secure a critical advantage for the United       States and other democracies.''        Pursuant to NSSM-1, Federal departments and agencies have       conducted an interagency review to take stock of existing       U.S. Government anti-corruption efforts and to identify and       seek to rectify persistent gaps in the fight against       corruption. In parallel with this review, departments and       agencies have begun to accelerate and amplify their efforts       to prevent and combat corruption at home and abroad; bring       transparency to the United States' and international       financial systems; and make it increasingly difficult for       corrupt actors to shield their activities.        This first United States Strategy on Countering Corruption       builds on the findings of the review and lays out a       comprehensive approach for how the United States will work       domestically and internationally, with governmental and non-      governmental partners, to prevent, limit, and respond to       corruption and related crimes. The Strategy places special       emphasis on the transnational dimensions of the challenges       posed by corruption, including by recognizing the ways in       which corrupt actors have used the U.S. financial system and       other rule-of-law based systems to launder their ill-gotten       gains.        To curb corruption and its deleterious effects, the U.S.       Government will organize its efforts around five mutually       reinforcing pillars of work:        Modernizing, coordinating, and resourcing U.S. Government       efforts to fight corruption;        Curbing illicit finance;        Holding corrupt actors accountable;        Preserving and strengthening the multilateral anti-      corruption architecture; and,        Improving diplomatic engagement and leveraging foreign       assistance resources to advance policy goals.        By pursuing concrete lines of effort that advance strategic       objectives under each of these pillars, and integrating anti-      corruption efforts into relevant policy-making processes, the       United States intends to lead in promoting prosperity and       security for the American people and people around the world.      The Impacts of Corruption        From the small-town hospital administrator who demands       bribes in exchange for life-saving services, to the globe-      trotting kleptocrat who offshores an embezzled fortune,       corruption harms both individuals and societies. The effects       of corrupt acts are frequently both direct and indirect. When       government officials steal from public coffers or fix a       contract to reward a political crony, these actors directly       transfer funding from essential services to private       interests. Corruption also indirectly contributes to reduced       public trust in state institutions, which in turn can add to       the appeal of  [[Page S9090]]       illiberal actors who exploit popular grievances for political       advantage.        Whether grand corruption perpetrated by powerful elites, or       administrative corruption carried out by lower-level       officials interacting directly with the public, corrupt acts       harm the public interest, hamper countries' development, and       diminish state capacity. Corruption has been shown to       significantly curtail the ability of states to respond       effectively to public health crises and to address climate       change, migration, and inequities of all forms, while       contributing to state fragility. Countries with high levels       of corruption are more likely to have populations that suffer       from human rights abuses, and are less likely to address       those abuses. And states with endemic corruption are more       vulnerable to terrorist networks, transnational organized and       gang-related criminals, and human traffickers.        Corruption's increasingly globalized nature--fueled in part       by transnational illicit finance and criminal networks, as       well as exploitation of the licit financial system--imposes       steep costs on ordinary citizens and good governance alike.       In particular, transnational corruption driven by political       and economic elites with the aid of complicit financial and       legal service providers undermines lower income countries'       ability to advance the welfare of their citizens and       perpetuates aid dependency. According to the United Nations       Conference on Trade and Development's Economic Development in       Africa Report 2020, for example, every year an estimated       $88.6 billion--equivalent to 3.7 percent of Africa's GDP--      leaves the continent in the form of illicit capital flight.        Corrupt actors exploit deficiencies in anti-money       laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/      CFT) systems and processes--as well as in other critical       transparency, reporting, business, real estate, and tax       regimes--to use public contracting, concessions, and       procurement processes for personal enrichment. Corrupt elites       and non-state armed groups enrich themselves through illicit       proceeds and trade of high-value commodities, including gold,       wildlife, timber, petroleum, and other natural resources.       Across an ever-more connected and digital world, corrupt       actors exploit oversight and regulatory weaknesses in       jurisdictions around the world to divert and hide the       proceeds of their acts. And by leaving their financial       systems vulnerable to illicit assets--through anonymous shell       companies, opaque transactions, and under-regulated       professional service providers--rule-of-law-based societies       continue to provide entry points for corrupt actors to       launder their funds and their reputations. Such activity       negatively impacts average citizens in the United States,       tilting the economic playing field against working Americans,       enabling criminals to flourish and foreign adversaries to       subversively peddle their influence, perpetuating growth-      dampening inequality, and contributing to pricing out       families from home ownership through real estate purchases.        In parallel, authoritarian regimes and their proxies have       been shown to engage in bribery and other corrupt acts as a       means to advance their strategic goals, while exploiting the       international financial system to offshore illicit gains, and       influence elections and policies in democratic states.       Corruption in the form of state-directed cross-border       investments from authoritarian states, for example, has had a       corrosive effect on institutions in developing countries.       Such practices harm the competitive landscape of financial       markets, and often have long-term corrosive impacts on       governance and human rights standards. The U.S. Government       will continue to study the weaponization of corruption to       understand its use and impacts on the United States, other       democracies, and countries around the world, as well as how       to thwart and build resilience against this evolving threat.        While the U.S. Government has long recognized countering       corruption as an important foreign policy goal, a growing       understanding of corruption's strategic impact and the       increasing interconnectedness of the global economy       underscores the need for a new approach. For the U.S.       Government to effectively counter contemporary corruption, we       must recognize the transnational dimensions of the challenge,       and respond in a manner that is both systemic and tailored to       local conditions. Doing so will require addressing       vulnerabilities in the U.S. and international financial       systems; bolstering international best practices,       regulations, and enforcement efforts; supporting the role of       non-governmental actors; building political will and       recognizing when it is absent; and consistently pursuing       accountability through a combination of diplomatic       engagement, foreign assistance, and enforcement actions.        The United States will continue to evaluate and implement       measures as needed to further safeguard our financial system,       and will work with like-minded partners and relevant       multilateral institutions to do the same. We will make it       harder to hide the proceeds of ill-gotten wealth in opaque       corporate structures, reduce the ability of individuals       involved in corrupt acts to launder funds through anonymous       purchases of U.S. real estate, and bolster asset recovery and       seizure activities. We will innovate, adapt, partner, and       learn, so as to maximize the potential for diplomatic tools,       including foreign assistance and targeted sanctions, to stem       corruption and to hold corrupt actors accountable, while       expanding efforts to ensure that foreign assistance and       engagement do not inadvertently contribute to corrupt       practices. And we will continue to vigorously enforce the       Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other statutory and       regulatory regimes via criminal and civil enforcement       actions.        Countering corruption is not a simple task. Changing       embedded cultures of corruption requires significant       political will, and achieving sustained progress can take       decades. Positive change requires consistent leadership,       public accountability, an empowered and impartial judiciary,       and a diverse and independent media. Mindful of these       realities, the United States will increase support to state       and non-state partners committed to reform, boost the       capacity of other governments to tackle corruption, and       empower those, including activists, investigative       journalists, and law enforcement on the front lines of       exposing corrupt acts. We will bolster and promote public-      private partnerships to more consistently bring in the       private sector as critical actors in the fight against       corruption, help level the playing field and improve the       international business climate, and lead in international       fora as we work to curb the ability of actors to hide ill-      gotten wealth behind anonymity. Our closest engagement will       be with our most committed allies and partners, including       with respect to the influence of strategic corruption       deliberately employed by authoritarian governments.      Illustrative Types of Corruption        Corruption takes on many forms and is used to further       various illicit behaviors. Illustrative types of corruption       include, but are not limited to:        Grand corruption: when political elites steal large sums of       public funds or otherwise abuse power for personal or       political advantage.        Administrative corruption: the abuse of entrusted power for       private gain--usually by low to mid-level government       officials--in interactions with citizens and the private       sector, including to skirt official regulations and extort       citizens in exchange for their basic services.        Kleptocracy: a government controlled by officials who use       political power to appropriate the wealth of their nation.       Can include state capture.        State capture: when private entities improperly and       corruptly influence a country's decision-making process for       their own benefit.        Strategic corruption: when a government weaponizes corrupt       practices as a tenet of its foreign policy.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to ask the Senate to join me  in recognizing the incredible career of Dr. Francis Collins, Director  of the National Institutes of Health, as he prepares to step down as  Director and return to his research laboratory at the National Human  Genome Research Institute, NHGRI.   NIH is the crown jewel of our Nation's and the world's biomedical  infrastructure. The Institute touches all of our lives through its  research, which deepens our understanding of the natural world and  produces groundbreaking medicines and lifesaving treatments for  diseases. Like all Marylanders, I am proud that NIH is headquartered in  Bethesda and has several satellite campuses throughout the State.   Dr. Collins' career with NIH has spanned more than three decades. A  physician-geneticist, Dr. Collins served as the director of the  National Human Genome Research Institute from 1993 to 2008. In this  work, he led the Human Genome Project, which in April 2003 completed  sequencing the human DNA instruction book. The sequencing of the 3  billion DNA letters that make up the human genetic ``instruction book''  has been instrumental in uncovering the role that the genome plays in  human health and disease and marshalling in a new era of medicine. For  this work, Dr. Collins deservedly received the Presidential Medal of  Freedom in 2007.   Dr. Collins is the longest serving, Presidentially appointed NIH  Director, having served as the 16th Director of NIH under three U.S.  Presidents over more than 12 years. Building on his groundbreaking  research in genetics, Dr. Collins has led the Institutes in the effort  to develop a greater understanding of medicine and pursue innovations  in diagnoses and treatments.   This includes the ``All of Us'' program, which is a precision  medicine initiative that in 2018 began gathering the health data of 1  million participants to develop individualized healthcare that enables  us to better treat and prevent disease. Dr. Collins' leadership has  similarly led to incredible advancements in understanding neurological  conditions. The Brain Research through Advancing Innovative  Neurotechnologies--BRAIN--Initiative aims to develop revolutionary  pictures of the brain to enable researchers to find new ways to treat,  cure, and even prevent neurological disorders that affect millions of  Americans.   Dr. Collins' tenure has included leading the fight to eradicate  cancer under the Cancer Moonshot Initiative. This generational effort  aims to improve our ability to prevent cancer or detect it at an  earlier stage and develop more effective therapies to treat it. To  date, over $1 billion in Moonshot funding has made incredible progress  through support of over 240 research projects across more than 70  cancer initiatives.   Last but certainly not least, Dr. Collins' leadership as NIH Director  has witnessed one of the toughest and most challenging tests for the  Institutes: the COVID-19 pandemic. Through Dr. Collins' commitment to  adhering to the science and steadfast leadership, the NIH has played an  historic role in shepherding the development of vaccines, therapeutics,  diagnostics, and all manner of medical resources toward COVID-19  response efforts. Though the Omicron variant is troubling and the  pandemic rages in many parts of the world, we are better prepared to  respond and persevere against the COVID-19 pandemic because Dr. Collins  played a principal role in leading our national biomedical response  efforts.   Dr. Collins is not just a scientist. He is also an avid guitarist and  motorcyclist. And his book, ``The Language of God: A Scientist Presents  Evidence for Belief'', is one of the most intellectually rigorous and  compelling efforts to reconcile the worlds of science and faith.   I ask the Senate, my fellow Marylanders, and a grateful Nation to  join me in recognizing the career of an extraordinary physician- geneticist, Dr. Francis Collins. We are incredibly grateful for his  leadership and stewardship of NIH and wish him a happy and well- deserved return to his research laboratory.                            ____________________
