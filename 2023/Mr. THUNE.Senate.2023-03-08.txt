 Madam President, I, too, want to acknowledge the great  work of the Senator from Tennessee, Senator Hagerty, on this matter on  which we will be voting later this afternoon. It has to do with the  issue of DC crime.   I think he has touched a nerve in a way that I think is going to lead  to a very big bipartisan outcome on this because it is a recognition  that the issue he addresses with this resolution is one that the  American people, I think, feel deeply about; one that is affecting our  cities, both large and small, across this country; and one on which I  think this United States Senate needs to be heard.   The last weekend in February, eight men were fatally shot in  Washington, DC--eight men in a single weekend. It was a tragic  illustration of the current crime situation in our Nation's Capital.  Homicides in Washington, DC, which had already reached disturbing  heights in 2021 and 2022, are up 33 percent so far this year compared  to this point a year ago. We are just 67 days into 2023, but so far  this year, there have been 101 carjackings--that is a motor vehicle  theft where the victim is actually present--66 percent of those  involving guns. There have been a staggering 1,258 motor vehicle thefts  to date this year--1,258. That is an average of roughly 19 motor  vehicle thefts every single day--19 thefts every day.   In the face of the crime surge DC has been experiencing for a while  now, the DC City Council recently decided to pass legislation weakening  penalties for a number of crimes. The bill the council passed late last  year would reduce the maximum penalty for crimes like carjacking,  robbery, and firearm offenses; remove mandatory minimum sentences for  all crimes except first-degree murder; clog up the court system by  substantially expanding access to trial by jury to individuals charged  with misdemeanors; and more.   Later today, we will be taking up legislation here in the U.S. Senate  to block the bill. Congress, of course, has the legal authority to  block DC ordinances thanks to Federal legislation rooted in the  Constitution which gives Congress legislative jurisdiction over the  seat of the U.S. Government--namely, Washington, DC.   It looks like today's vote will receive strong support from both  parties. That certainly was not looking like it would have been the  case a week ago. Last month, the Biden administration issued a  statement opposing the move to block DC's crime bill. When the House  took up the measure, 82 percent of House Democrats voted against  blocking the DC bill. But last week, the President changed his tune. He  announced that he would not veto the attempt to block the DC bill.  Since then, Senate Democrats have been lining up to announce they will  vote to block DC's measure.   I am pleased Democrats have recognized that weakening criminal  penalties is not the way to address DC's crime surge. Blocking DC's  crime bill will be a victory for common sense and for the people of DC,  who deserve a safe city in which to live.   While I am pleased at the expected outcome of today's vote, I remain  deeply concerned about how we got here in the first place. How have we  gotten to the point where some people think that an appropriate  response to a surge in crime is to weaken criminal penalties, to a  point where ideology has overtaken common sense, to the detriment of  public safety? Part of the answer lies in the deeply troubling surge in  anti-law enforcement rhetoric over the past few years and the  accommodation of it by members of the Democratic Party.   There has been talk of defunding our most essential public servants-- the police; characterization of our justice system as fundamentally  unjust; an attitude that the answer to crime is not to try to stop it  from taking place but to stop punishing criminals. The Democratic Party  has been deeply complicit in this. One leading Democrat Senator and  Democrat Presidential candidate had this to say a few years ago:         Let's just start with the hard truth about our criminal       justice system. It's racist. It is. And when I say our       system, I mean all the way. I mean front to back.    That from a leading Democrat Senator and Democrat Presidential  candidate.   She is not the only prominent Democrat who has spoken that way. Many  other Democrats, of course, have not been that explicit, but they have  tried to have it both ways--attempting to say they support the police  on one hand, while also accommodating the radical elements of their  party who want to tear down our justice system and demonize not just a  few bad police officers but a whole community of public servants who  put their lives on the line for us every single day.   President Biden is a striking example of this. As his about-face on  the DC crime bill makes clear, he is eager to portray himself as a  supporter of law and order, especially, I assume, given that polling  has made it clear Americans are deeply concerned about crime. But at  the same time that he is trying to portray himself as anti-crime, he is  nominating individuals to serve in his administration who have engaged  in anti-police rhetoric.   The President can't have it both ways, and his attempt and Democrats'  attempt to do so has helped a troubling anti-law enforcement, anti- justice system narrative to gain hold in our communities.   One thing I always think about when I hear anti-law enforcement  rhetoric is how little attention is paid to the victim. People speak  negatively about criminal penalties or overpolicing, but they don't  talk about the victims of violent crimes and what it is like to live in  a place where you literally fear for your safety.   As DC's Mayor recently said:         We have to think about victims of crime as much as we think       about perpetrators.    I would argue, more than we think about perpetrators.   But, too often, the focus of discussions is almost entirely on  perpetrators, with little attention paid to the victims of crime or the  consequences of tolerating criminal activity.   As the DC police chief recently said of DC's bill:         Where's the victim in all of this? Who does this actually       help? Is the victim being helped or is it the person who       victimizes? I don't think victims win in that space. And       again, that is a nonstarter for me.    That from the DC police chief, speaking of the very bill we are going  to block today.   Bills like the DC City Council's bill should be a nonstarter for  everyone. Democratic politicians need to stop accommodating the common  ideology that thinks reducing criminal penalties is an appropriate  response to crime.   I am thankful, as I said, for the Senator from Tennessee's leadership  and that later today we are going to vote to block legislation that  would endanger DC residents and visitors to our Nation's Capital. I  hope--I sincerely hope--this bill will mark a return to common sense as  we work to battle crime in DC and around the country.   I yield the floor.
