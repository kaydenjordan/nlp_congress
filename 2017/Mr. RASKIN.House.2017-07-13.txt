 Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose the amendment, which  selectively requires the military to identify Islamic religious  doctrines, concepts, or schools of thought used by various extremist  groups and how they have been incorporated into terrorist messaging.   The problem, of course, is that terrorist killers have used religious  doctrines and concepts from every major religion on earth, including  not just Islam, but Christianity, Judaism, Mormonism, Hinduism,  Buddhism, for homicidal purposes. Because religion is based on faith  and not reason, and because religious texts are not self-explanatory,  good people will invoke scripture for good causes and evil people will  invoke scripture for evil causes.   We don't need a big government study to teach us something so  commonsensical, which the Founders taught us a long time ago. If we  want to study the exploitation of religion for terrorism, let's study  it universally.   Focusing on one religion not only vastly understates the problem, but  exacerbates the problem by fomenting the myth that religious fanaticism  and terrorism are unique to the charlatans and predators of Islam when  they are common to the charlatans and predators of nearly every  religious faith and identification.   Constitutionally, we do not single out particular religions for  governmental inspection and suspicion under the First Amendment.
