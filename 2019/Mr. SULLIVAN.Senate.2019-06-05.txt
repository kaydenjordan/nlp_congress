 Mr. President, this week we are celebrating the  50th anniversary of Special Olympics Alaska, an organization that has  done so much for so many Alaskans living with intellectual disabilities  in my State and across the globe.   The rise of the Special Olympics is one of the world's great stories.  It demonstrates both on the political and personal fronts what can  happen when a group of people get together to ensure that everyone has  the ability to participate in sports and, furthermore, develop skills  and friendships that will last them a lifetime.   The story of Special Olympics dates back to the 1960s, when one  woman, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, decided to make a difference. Mrs.  Shriver had a sister, Rosemary, who had an intellectual disability and  with whom she was very close. She knew that Rosemary's disability  shouldn't hold her or anybody else back from competing in sports and  fulfilling her dreams.   In the summer of 1968 in Chicago, Eunice Shriver opened the first  national games for Special Olympics. One thousand athletes from 26  States and Canada competed in track & field and swimming. Jump forward  to today. Because of Mrs. Shriver's vision and advocacy for people with  intellectual disabilities, there are now nearly 5 million Special  Olympics' athletes around the world, and as many as 80,000 competitions  are held every year, including in the great State of Alaska.   In 2001, Alaska hosted the Special Olympics World Winter Games. Mrs.  Shriver said it was the best World Winter Games in Special Olympics  history. That success was only possible because of the hard working  staff, board, volunteers, and athletes from the Special Olympics Alaska  organization and the complete support of a caring, engaged community.   Special Olympics Alaska will be celebrating its 50th anniversary this  weekend in conjunction with the Special Olympics Alaska Summer Games.  Hundreds of athletes and unified partners from across the State will  gather in Anchorage for 3 days of competition. They have been dedicated  to their training in aquatics, basketball, gymnastics, powerlifting,  and track & field, and this weekend will strive for their personal best  and, no doubt, have a lot of fun. There is no better place to see the  joy of competition and pure sportsmanship than at a Special Olympics  event.   My family is proud to be part of a community that supports our  Special Olympics athletes and, to brag a little, part of a State with a  world-class training center and program that is the envy of many other  States and nations. Special Olympics Alaska's success would not be  possible without the dedicated support of so many Alaska families and  the passion our athletes have for sports and this organization. Our  athletes inspire all of us. They show us the true meaning of grit,  determination, and perseverance. Our athletes know, more than any of  us, what Vince Lombardi meant when he said, ``It's not whether you get  knocked down; it's whether you get up.''   Congratulations again to all the athletes, staff, board, and  volunteers of Special Olympics Alaska for an incredible 50 years of  serving the community.                            ____________________
