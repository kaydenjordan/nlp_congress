 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize this week as National Apprenticeship Week.   For over 80 years, the Registered Apprenticeship system has been the  gold standard for workforce development policy in the United States.   In 2017, President Trump signed an executive order expanding the  apprenticeship program, and since then more than 500,000 people have  entered the program.   Apprenticeships that are registered with the Department of Labor  provide participants on-the-job training and classroom education,  equipping them with the skills needed to succeed in today's labor  force.   With continued job growth in today's economy, I want to encourage  more apprenticeship opportunities. I introduced H.R. 1774, the LEAP  Act, which incentivizes more employers to offer the DOL Registered  Apprenticeship program through a new tax cut.   DOL registered apprenticeships also come with incremental wage  increases, improved skills, career advancement, enhanced retention, and  increased productivity.   I would like to thank all the businesses, employers, and the building  trades who have utilized these registered apprenticeships and encourage  more businesses in various fields to participate.                            ____________________
