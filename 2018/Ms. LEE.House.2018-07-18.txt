 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the late, great  President Nelson Mandela, whose 100th birthday we celebrate today.   Like many of my colleagues, I was first inspired by Mr. Mandela in  the early 1970s. I was arrested in Berkeley, California, protesting  apartheid, when our brave brothers and sisters in the labor movement  refused to unload ships from South Africa that arrived at Oakland's  port.   I remember very vividly when the African National Congress was  designated a terrorist organization by the United States Government. It  was illegal to meet with the freedom fighters in the United States, but  many of us did anyway in safe places around the world.   I was so happy when we finally passed legislation, which I led, to  lift President Mandela and the ANC off the terrorist watch list on his  90 birthday 10 years ago.   As an election observer, I will never forget the lines of people  waiting to vote for Nelson Mandela as the first Black President of  South Africa.   Madiba's impact was not limited to South Africa. He sparked social  justice movements that reached around the world and reminded us of the  power of the vote. As President Obama noted yesterday, he said Madiba  ``came to embody the universal aspirations of dispossessed people all  around the world, their hopes for a better life.''   President Mandela taught us many lessons, lessons in reconciliation,  perseverance, and public service. Above all, he taught us that the  fight for justice was never finished. His legacy will live forever.                            ____________________
