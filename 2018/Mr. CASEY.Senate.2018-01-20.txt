 Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                      Recognition of the Majority Leader    The majority leader is recognized.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, well, here we are. Here we are, day one  of the Senate Democrats' government shutdown. We did everything we  could to stop them. We put forward a noncontroversial bill that  contains nothing--nothing--they even claim to object to. It would  continue funding the Federal Government and secure the future of the  State Children's Health Insurance Program for the vulnerable families  who rely on it.   The bill passed the House, the President said he would sign it, and a  bipartisan majority of Democrats and Republicans voted for it. The  votes were there, the President was ready, the solution to this  manufactured crisis was inches away, but then the Democratic leader  took the extraordinary step of filibustering this legislation,  preventing it from passing, and plunging the country into this totally  avoidable mess.   The House of Representatives, the President, and a bipartisan  majority of Republican and Democratic Senators all agreed on a  compromise bill that would have prevented a shutdown. It would enable  Congress to do the commonsense thing--keep negotiating other issues  while also providing for our troops, our veterans, and literally  millions of vulnerable Americans--but the Democratic leader instead  chose to filibuster the bipartisan bill.   So here we are, day one, and already funding is in jeopardy for our  veterans because the Democratic leader filibustered a bipartisan  compromise that a majority of Senators supported and chose instead to  shut down the government. Of course, low-income families across America  woke up today without the knowledge that their children's healthcare is  safe, all because the Democratic leader filibustered a bipartisan  compromise that a majority of Senators supported and chose instead a  government shutdown.   Yesterday, my friend the senior Senator from New York tried to insist  a shutdown was anybody's fault but his own--anybody else but me, he  said. He blamed President Trump because the President wouldn't resolve  months of ongoing negotiations over massive issues in one brief meeting  and give the Senator everything he wanted. He blamed Republicans in  Congress, as though everybody didn't know the Senate rules allow the  minority party, if they choose, to obstruct the American people's  business and filibuster for their own political purposes. It is  possible, but in this instance, foolishly done.   These rhetorical gymnastics are simply not persuasive. The American  people see right through all this bluster.  [[Page S360]]  They see right through all this bluster. Like the President, like the  House, and like a bipartisan majority of Senators, the American people  want long-term solutions on immigration policy, on government spending,  and on all the major issues we have been discussing literally for  months and will continue to discuss.   Like the President, like the House, and like a bipartisan majority of  Senators, the American people cannot begin to understand why the Senate  Democratic leader thinks the entire government should be shut down  until he gets his way on illegal immigration.   The American people cannot comprehend why the senior Senator from New  York is advising his party to keep the government shuttered for  American troops, American veterans, American military families, and  vulnerable American children until he gets exactly what he wants on the  issue of illegal immigration, a situation which does not even become  urgent until March. All these other matters are indeed urgent. They  need to be dealt with right now. This particular issue does not become  urgent until March.   I hope Senate Democrats are starting to realize all this. I hope they  are starting to realize their constituents, the President, the House,  and the majority of the Senate are on one side of this. On the other  side--all alone--is the Democratic leader who invented this unfortunate  hostage situation and led his party into this untenable position.   The solution is to end the foolishness. It is hurting millions of  Americans who have done absolutely nothing to deserve this. I invite  all of my colleagues across the aisle to join together and do what is  obviously responsible and right for the people we represent. It is  pretty clear. Let's reopen the government. Let's resume the bipartisan  discussion on funding our troops, DACA, on government spending, and on  all the other priorities all of us can work together to resolve.                      Recognition of the Minority Leader    The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.    Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Michigan  for her words today but also, more importantly, for her advocacy for so  many years, and maybe especially in the last year, on the Children's  Health Insurance Program and all of the great work she has done.   This is a program which has been bipartisan for a generation. I speak  from the vantage point of Pennsylvania. It has been bipartisan in my  home State for even longer than the Federal program. In Pennsylvania,  the program was passed in 1992 and became law in 1993, and so for  longer than the Federal program, which many people know started in  1997.   It has personal connections to me. My father was the Governor who  signed the legislation into law in 1993. Since that time, every  Republican and Democratic Governor and, for the most part, the  legislatures of both parties have supported it, which has been the case  here. It is only lately that CHIP has become contentious.   The tragic irony here--or if you wanted to use stronger language, I  would use the word ``insult''--in this case, you had legislation to  reauthorize--which is a fancy Washington word for ``do it again'' with  maybe some changes--the legislation was reauthorized in the fall and  was ready for passage on the Senate floor. The majority leader  indicated that it had to get through committee, and it did. We had a  unanimous vote in the Finance Committee to have children's health--to  have that program be part of our law going forward. What happened? The  deadline was September 30. The Republican majority had the opportunity  to bring that bill, the KIDS Act--that was the bill--to the floor. If  that bill were brought to the floor, it would have passed in a matter  of hours, if not less.   The majority decided not to bring the Children's Health Insurance  Program reauthorization bill, the KIDS Act, to the floor before  September 30, so the program expired September 30. Here we are, more  than 100 days--I guess it is 112 days or something like that--since it  expired. Republicans had the power to get children's health insurance  done by September 30. They failed despite the fact that there was a  bill to do that. It could have passed on the floor very quickly. They  have all the power to do it, to get it on the floor, and they chose not  to.   That is bad enough, but it gets worse. They had all of the month of  October, and they did nothing on children's health insurance. They had  all of the month of November, and they did nothing on children's health  insurance. They had all of the month of December, and they did nothing  on children's health insurance.   Now there is this newfound urgency to make sure they criticize  Democrats for not passing this defective piece of legislation that has  major holes in it from the House, which was developed only by the  Freedom Caucus in the House, and we are supposed to accept, I guess,  whatever the Freedom Caucus in the House wants. That is the way we are  supposed to run the U.S. Senate.   Why would Republicans--despite their assertions that they want to  move the children's health insurance bill forward--let all of October,  all of November, and all of December pass after they already let it  expire? Why would they let all that time go by? It is not a mystery. We  don't have to hire a private investigator to find out why they let it  go that long. One reason is, because for most of November or all of  November but certainly all of December, until, I guess, about the 22nd  of December, they were focused on one priority, their tax bill, a tax  bill which is a giveaway to the superrich. The top 1 percent gets about  $51,000 in year one. I hope everyone else is going to do that well-- sorry, they are not. What do they do in that bill in addition to  helping the wealthy? They gave big corporations not just the kind of  tax cuts we have never seen before--more than almost $1.5 trillion for  corporations--but they made it permanent. So they got permanent  corporate tax relief when they should have been figuring out a way to  get children's health insurance done. So that is the story of how we  got from there to here.    We hear now that because there are changes in the cost of children's  health that this would be a 6-year bill. Well, that is a good amount of  time, but guess what. Guess what. Because of all that change in the  intervening period, we could do a 10-year Children's Health Insurance  Program and save billions of dollars in doing it, compared to what  Republicans want to do now. So if there is this urgency to do something  about children's health on the Republican side, I say let's join  together and not only get children's health insurance done--today we  could do it. We have all day today. We have all day tomorrow. We have a  big weekend of work here. Let's get children's health insurance done  and knock something off the list. We don't have to worry about it, but  while we are at it, let's make it 10 years. I would argue that  children's health insurance should be a permanent program, just like  the tax cuts for corporations. They found a way to give corporations  permanent tax relief. Why wouldn't you support permanent children's  health insurance? But if they can't do that, we could at least do it  for 10 years. That is easy to do right here today, a 10-year Children's  Health Insurance Program so that 9 million kids and their families and  180,000 in Pennsylvania can have the certainty to know that despite the  fact that it is over 100 days late because of Republican failure to get  the job done, we could get it done right now, today. So let's see what  they do.   Here is another issue we have to talk about because this bill that  came over from the House didn't address this issue: community health  centers. Eight hundred thousand people in Pennsylvania depend upon  those community health centers. There is nothing in that bill that we  voted on last night to address those 800,000 people in Pennsylvania and  tens of millions across the  [[Page S375]]  country. The House bill didn't even touch that. I guess those people  shouldn't have to worry.   Community health centers, we know after that expired, just like the  Children's Health Insurance Program--and the Republicans have the  majority. They could have made sure the health centers continued, but  they didn't. So after expiring, we know these health centers face a  funding reduction of 60 percent to 70 percent. We also know, at least  in my State, of the 180,000 children covered on CHIP, something on the  order of 9,000 children enrolled in the CHIP program go to community  health centers. So having CHIP in place is essential, but having  community health centers in place alongside it is also essential. What  do those 9,000 kids in Pennsylvania do if they have CHIP coverage but  can't go to the community health center down the street because it is  closed because it wasn't addressed by House Republicans or Senate  Republicans?   So while we are at it this weekend, why don't we get community health  centers done. In my State, 4,915 people work there in full-time jobs-- 4,915 people.   The third issue of four--and I will be done in a minute--tax  extenders. That is kind of another Washington phrase, right? Well, in  this case, not getting these extenders done by the end of the year,  which we almost always do no matter who is in charge--but guess what.  They couldn't do it. They didn't get to tax extenders for rural  hospitals by the end of the year because guess what. They were working  on their tax bill for big corporations and rich people. So rural  hospitals got pushed aside, just like children's health got pushed  aside, just like community health centers got pushed aside because they  had to get their tax bill done for those big corporations and rich  people. So tax extenders for rural hospitals didn't get done. Rural  health providers face hundreds of billions of dollars of cuts across  the Nation.   I represent a State that has 67 counties, but we have 48 counties of  those 67 that are rural. In those 48 rural counties, about 279,000  people got healthcare either through the Medicaid expansion or through  the exchanges. In those communities where there is a rural hospital-- sometimes there is only one hospital for a long distance--those  communities rely upon that hospital not just for healthcare but for  jobs. Sometimes--in most places, it is the biggest employer in the  county or the second biggest employer. In my State, there are between  20 and 30 rural counties where the hospital is either the biggest  employer or the second biggest. They need those tax provisions in  place, but the majority did not get that done.   Finally, I will end with this. The senior Senator from Michigan  highlighted this, and I think it is important. Another thing that  didn't get done that wasn't in this bill coming over from the House was  an important program we don't talk about enough. It has been in place a  couple of years. That is the Maternal Infant and Early Child Home  Visiting Program, an evidence-based home visiting program that supports  at-risk pregnant women and young families. That didn't get done in this  bill. It was not in the bill. In fiscal year 2017, funding for that  program was $400 million. It is the right thing to do to have that in  place.   We know that just in Pennsylvania, for example, 3,282 families  benefit from this program. That is another part of this bill that  wasn't included. So if the majority is so concerned, as they professed  last night--I wish they did this months ago, but just last night,  breaking news, they are concerned about the Children's Health Insurance  Program--let's pass it today. Let's get it done today and make it a 10- year program. No one would have to worry for an entire decade about  children's health insurance if the Republican majority wants to join us  in that effort.   I yield the floor, and note that the next speaker is the senior  Senator from Ohio, a great fighter for our kids and for our families.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.
