 Mr. Speaker, last week, House Democrats took  aggressive action to address rising food prices by passing the Lowering  Food and Fuel Costs Act.   The bill would lower costs by doing three things:   First, it will reduce our dependence on overseas fertilizer  production. Russia and Ukraine are major producers of fertilizer.  Putin's war on Ukraine has driven up the cost of fertilizer for our  farmers, and, therefore, for critical staples on our grocery store  shelves.   Second, the bill will also crack down on unfair, anticompetitive  practices in the meat and poultry sector, helping to drive down the  prices of meat products.   Third, and finally, it would expand access to cleaner ethanol blends  that cost, on average, 40 cents less per gallon. This will help ease  the pain at the pump.   These provisions may sound technical, but they are sound and sensible  solutions to lower prices for America's families in the grocery aisle  and at the gas pump.                            ____________________
