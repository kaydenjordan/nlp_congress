 Mr. President, I am honored to recognize Caroline  Keane of Concord as September's Granite Stater of the Month. For the  past 8 years, Caroline has organized the Ready to Learn Fair, where  Concord School District students can receive free backpacks and other  school supplies.   About 9 years ago, when Caroline was an education assistant for  Rundlett Middle School's autism program, she came across a young  student who was attempting to carry his books in a flimsy plastic bag,  crying. He was upset because the plastic bag--his makeshift backpack-- had torn open.   She began raising money to purchase school supplies and reaching out  to local businesses and organizations to donate materials or provide  free services.   Over the past 8 years, the Ready to Learn Fair has expanded beyond  just school supplies and has become an essential part of the school's  community. At the fair, the New England School of Barbering provides  free haircuts; and there is a long line for this every year. Caroline  also works to bring representatives from the district's Free and  Reduced Lunch Program to the fair so that families can sign up their  kids. Last year, families could get their COVID-19 vaccines, and this  year she is collecting winter supplies such as coats and hats for  students in need. After the fair, Caroline stores any leftover supplies  in a closet at the school, so that students can access the supplies  throughout the year.   After seeing a need in her community, Caroline took action to make  sure that students, regardless of their family's income, are prepared  for school--helping students succeed and alleviating parents' stress.  Even beyond this impact, Caroline's initiative brought her community  together, from volunteers, to small business owners, to the school's  maintenance team, to donors. Caroline's initiative represents the  Granite State spirit of taking care of your neighbors and bringing  people together for a common goal, and I commend her for her  work.                            ____________________
