 Mr. Speaker, I first want to welcome Steve Scalise back  to this House floor. The strength of his message shows why he is such a  hero to us all.   I also want to tell the story of another hero, one from my  congressional district in Dayton, Ohio.   On April 5, 2016, letter carrier Donte Cotton saw an overturned car  that had collided with a pole. The driver told Donte her child was  inside the car. Acting on immediate instinct, Donte crawled through  broken glass to rescue the baby from the car. Both the mother and the  child were taken to the hospital and treated for minor injuries.   In August of last year, Donte again found himself in the right place  at the right time; again, on his letter carrying route.   While on his normal mail delivery route, an elderly woman, whose home  had just been invaded, ran up to Donte seeking help. Donte drove the  woman to a nearby police cruiser, ensuring her safety.   His courage is being rewarded this week by the National Association  of Letter Carriers, which has given Donte its 2017 Central Area Hero  Award.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Donte for his acts of true heroism  in our community.                            ____________________
