 Mr. Speaker, mandatory spending programs are the  overflowing sinks that have bedeviled Congress for decades on end. Two- thirds of all Federal spending is allocated to mandatory spending  programs, and there are few constructive opportunities to curb exceeded  cost estimates.   While Congress returns to Washington this week to cut spending in  exchange for lifting the debt ceiling, far too little attention is  being paid to autopilot spending that far outpaces these cuts.   My bill, the Spending Safeguard Act, would restore congressional  control over mandatory spending increases by establishing program- specific caps for new or reauthorized programs. If a program spends  more than what was anticipated, then it needs to be reformed or  extinguished. It is that simple.   Let's be honest, Mr. Speaker. Congress has a knack for ignoring  opportunities to address direct spending head-on. My bill offers a  viable pathway to restore both fiscal sanity and fiscal responsibility  in Washington.   It is time for Congress to act.  [[Page H2652]]                                ____________________
