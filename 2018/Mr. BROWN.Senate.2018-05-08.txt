 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that privileges of  the floor be granted to Rachael Hartford of my staff for the remainder  of the day.    Mr. President, everyone in this Chamber knows how bad the  opioid epidemic is. In my State, we have the second highest number of  opioid deaths per capita in the country next to West Virginia. In my  State, we also have more people die of opioid overdoses than any other  State in the country. On average, 11 people died yesterday, 11 will die  today, 11 will die tomorrow, and 11 will die on Thursday of opioid  overdoses.   Last month at the Cleveland City Club, I called for a comprehensive,  coordinated, and sustained public health campaign to fight addiction  through education, prevention, treatment, and recovery.   We know from history that we cannot arrest or execute our way out of  this crisis, whether in Montana or in Ohio. I met with law enforcement  officers in every corner of my State. They shoulder a huge burden. They  all tell me the same thing: They need resources to fight this. That is  why I joined Senator Portman and a bipartisan group of our colleagues  on the POWER Act--to get State and local law enforcement the high-tech  tools they need to effectively screen for dangerous opioids, such as  fentanyl.   We also know from history that those enforcement tools are just one  piece of this fight. We need a comprehensive approach, and that means  recognizing how important treatment and rehabilitation are. We don't  write off thousands of Ohioans struggling with addiction. We simply  don't write off entire communities. That is where drug courts come in.  These courts are partnerships between law enforcement and treatment  providers. They are spearheaded by judges who see the same people back  in their courtrooms over and over again for drug offenses. These judges  realized that traditional court proceedings simply were not working.  They weren't curing people's addictions. Fines and jail time don't cure  a medical condition. So judges set up these special courts where  participants agree to enter treatment programs and are strictly  supervised by law enforcement. If they successfully complete the  program, instead of going to prison, they have a graduation ceremony.   We have seen this model work successfully for veterans. There are  hundreds of these courts across the country, which are built around  counseling and treatment. Veterans who get into  [[Page S2555]]  trouble with the law often face unique issues, such as PTSD.   My office recently visited the first Federal Veterans Court in the  Southern District of Ohio, in Dayton. We saw the difference it made in  the lives of men and women who served this country. The court was  created by my friend, Judge Michael Newman, with the support of Chief  Judge Edmund Sargus. It works with the VA to help address the issues  veterans are struggling with. My staff met with Page Layman, a veterans  justice outreach coordinator who helps the participants in the program.  He talked about how one of the participants in the court had limited  transportation options and lived in a rural area, so Mr. Layman drove  to meet him at the local library. Judge Newman reports that 49 veterans  have graduated from the program with their charges dropped and are now  leading healthier lives.   We have the same opportunity with drug courts. The Ohio Office of  Criminal Justice Services studies these courts. They found that drug  courts enhance treatment, increase collaboration in the community, and  save taxpayers money.   My staff and I met with judges across Ohio who are helping people  break the cycle of drug use and crime. Earlier this year, we talked  with Hocking County Municipal Court Judge Fred Moses while he was in  town as a State of the Union guest of Representative  Steve Stivers of  Ohio. He started an innovative drug court program just outside  Chillicothe, OH, in 2012. As a judge, he saw the opioid epidemic coming  years before most folks in Washington saw it. He started the first  medication-assisted drug court program certified in my State. Five  years later, his programs are reuniting families, cutting down on  repeat offenses, and helping participants get jobs.   He and his staff are improving the lives of people in Southeast Ohio  and serving as a model for other drug courts around the State and  country. Since the program began, more than 30 other judges have  visited Hocking County to learn about its success. Now we are seeing  similar success all over Ohio.   Tuscarawas County has two drug courts--COBRA, in the Common Pleas  Court, and the New Philadelphia Municipal Recovery Court. Judge  Elizabeth Lehigh Thomakos runs the COBRA court, which held its 125th  graduation. One graduate said:         When I couldn't get clean, you helped me get clean. You       guys believed in me when I couldn't believe in myself.    Another:         My daughter has her mamma back. A healthy mom, hard-      working, motivated, goal-oriented mom, who smiles again and       is grateful in all she does. By this program shaping my       future, it has also shaped hers.    The Recovery Court in New Philadelphia is run by Judge Nanette  DeGarmo VonAllman. She hears so many stories like that one. She told  the Times Reporter--the newspaper in Tuscarawas County--``We try to  give them and their families hope: that treatment works and people do  recover.'' Programs all over Ohio and all over the country are offering  families that hope.   In Cleveland, the Cuyahoga County Drug Court, under Judge David  Matia, has graduated more than 300 people. Both that court and the  Cleveland Municipal Drug Court operate under the Stephanie Tubbs Jones  Greater Drug Court umbrella, named for my former colleague.   In Marion, OH, Common Pleas Court Judge Jim Slagle, a longtime friend  of mine, held a graduation ceremony for eight graduates at the end of  last month. Jennifer, one of the women who spoke, talked about her  granddaughter. She said:         The most challenging part was admitting I needed this.    When she found out her granddaughter was going to be placed in foster  care:         I knew I had to do something. I needed to get myself       together. I had to do it for her.    She has now been clean for 2 years. She has custody over her 18- month-old granddaughter.   These are the kinds of success stories we hear all over the State and  all over the country. If we are successful in this fight, hundreds of  thousands of fewer Americans will use opioids, but we will also have  hundreds of thousands more who have used opioids but whose lives are  not lost or ruined. They are going to be living with and managing their  addiction. That is why we need to expand and build on these approaches.   I am also working with my Republican colleague, Senator Capito of  West Virginia, on bipartisan legislation--the CARE Act--to combine  existing resources from the Departments of Labor and Health and Human  Services to fund combined addiction treatment and workforce training  efforts.   I hear the same thing from mayors from New Philadelphia, Middletown,  Chillicothe, and Piqua: Employers can't fill openings because workers  can't pass drug tests. Ohioans struggling with addiction--even those  who have completed successful programs like these drug courts--can't  find jobs. Our bill will help those Americans continue their recovery  with good jobs that provide stability.   The government is spending money on drug treatment, mostly through  Medicaid, and the government, through the Department of Labor, is  spending money on job retraining. Why not put them together so that  people, while they get clean and get whole, are ready to go to work  because they have had that job training?   I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the CARE Act and  finding ways to support successful drug court programs around the  country.                            ____________________     Mr. President, tomorrow the Senate will vote to move  forward with the President's nominee to join the Seventh Circuit Court  of Appeals. It is a new low that sets a dangerous standard for judges  who have the power to make critical decisions that impact the everyday  lives of the people we serve.   Take a look at Judge Michael Brennan's record. At his hearing, he  refused to acknowledge the ways our criminal justice system is biased  against Americans of color. He made statements condoning judicial  activisim. He argued that judges are justified in not following  precedent if they feel it was incorrectly decided. Think about that for  a minute.   I am not a lawyer, but I understand this about our courts: A judge  who feels no obligation to follow precedent laid out by higher courts  is not a judge; that is someone who has ceased to be bound by any  standards guiding a judge. Precedent is the backbone of our legal  system. Saying that judges can disregard it if they feel it is  incorrect would be a radical departure. Think about how this could  work. In a Brennan court, it could be OK for a judge not to follow a  Supreme Court decision like Brown v. Board of Education, which  desegregated schools, as long as that judge--in this case, I guess,  Judge Brennan--believes the case was incorrect. If you disregard  precedent, decades of legal progress could be rolled back. The well- established rights of so many Americans would be at risk.   During his hearing, Brennan claimed he was only talking about  precedent from the same circuit, but the article where he originally  made these arguments made no such distinction then, and Brennan even  admitted that at the hearing.   We cannot entrust the people we serve to a judge who can't be trusted  to follow settled law.   Brennan would also be the first judge in more than 35 years to be  confirmed over the objection of a Senator from his home State. Think  about that. That doesn't even account for the backstory that I am going  to mention. He would be the first judge in 35 years to be confirmed  over the objections of a Senator from his home State. Senator Baldwin  from Wisconsin has not returned her blue slip on Brennan. In departure  from Senate tradition, Republicans had a hearing and are now allowing a  vote on Brennan's nomination despite not having a blue slip from  Senator Baldwin.   The seat Brennan is nominated for has been vacant since 2010. Why?  Because Senator Johnson, now the senior Senator from Wisconsin, did not  return a blue slip on President Obama's first nominee to fill this  seat. This body honored Senator Johnson's blue slip and was not going  to confirm that nominee because the blue slip had not been returned.  That was following the  [[Page S2556]]  precedent of this Senate--decades of precedent. The nominee therefore  did not receive a hearing, let alone a vote. Now Republicans are  refusing to show Senator Baldwin the same level of courtesy and  respect.   We have a blue-slip procedure in place not out of courtesy to  Senators personally but to the Americans we serve. Senator Baldwin  represents the people who will be most affected by Judge Brennan's  decisions. She opposes his nomination. Her blue slip should be  respected.   The people served by the Seventh Circuit and Americans all over the  country need judges who will follow the law. To be sure, Judge Brennan  is not that judge. We can do better. We should do better. I ask my  colleagues to oppose his nomination.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
