 Mr. Speaker, recent executive actions have  resulted in confusion, demonstrations, and late-night court rulings.  Many executive orders have been announced with little notice, and the  American people have had to wait hours afterwards to see the text.   Federal agencies have also been blindsided by these orders. The  Secretary of Homeland Security found out about the President's  immigration orders through cable news. In some cases, the President  himself has been uncertain of what his executive orders contain.   Sir, we need transparency today. Congress has a responsibility to  eliminate this confusion and make sure that executive actions are clear  and transparent to all Americans.   That is why I am introducing the Executive Order Transparency Act.  This one-page bill requires that all executive orders be posted on the  White House website 72 hours before each is signed. This simple bill is  an investment in a working government, and I urge all my colleagues to  join me.                            ____________________
