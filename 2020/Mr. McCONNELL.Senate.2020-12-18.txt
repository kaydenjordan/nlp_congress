 Mr. President, our bipartisan discussions are  continuing to make significant headway toward another relief package  for the American people. The Democratic leader, Speaker Pelosi, Leader  McCarthy, and I have been working around the clock for several days  now. The talks remain productive. In fact, I am even more optimistic  now than I was last night that a bipartisan, bicameral framework for a  major rescue package is very close at hand.   Well, let's face it, though, it doesn't help struggling Americans  keep their jobs or endure unemployment or pay their rent or get  vaccines any faster to keep hearing that we are having good  discussions. What families across the country deserve--what they have  needed and deserved for months now--is an outcome, another targeted  relief package to get more assistance into their hands as fast as  possible.   Struggling small business owners have already waited too long for a  targeted second round of PPP. Laid-off workers have already waited too  long to have expiring programs extended. Kids, teachers, and families  have already waited too long for funding to help schools reopen safely.  We have already waited too long to fully fund vaccine distributions so  our scientists' historic sprint toward a safe and effective vaccine is  followed up by an equally important logistical effort.   This has been an unbelievably hard year for our country. We have seen  normal daily life grind to a halt and take a record-setting economy  right down with it. And even as we have watched doctors, nurses, and  researchers make lifesaving history, we have lost more than 300,000  Americans entirely too soon.   Like I have said, the Senate will be right here until an agreement is  passed, whenever that may be. We will just continue voting. There are  some more well-qualified nominees for important posts that we can  confirm in the meantime. So let's finish our business for the American  people                            ____________________     Now, on a completely different matter, Mr. President,  [[Page S7649]]  I jump at any opportunity to praise my incredible staff. I am just  sorry that one natural occasion is when great people head toward the  exits.   Phil Maxson of Lexington, KY, has mastered one of the toughest jobs  on Capitol Hill. As chief of staff for my personal office, he oversees  the operation that delivers for Kentucky families and Kentucky  priorities.   Here is what that role means in our tight-knit organization. It is  like being the player-coach on an old baseball team who is also a  utility player at the same time. Phil wears about 10 hats each day,  orchestrating a seamless operation. He has mastered policy, political  strategy, messaging, and constituent services. He has budgeted and  managed the office itself, and Phil is also a liaison and colleague to  my leadership office here in the Capitol.   He is the linkage between the two sides of my operation, the single  person most responsible for helping me harmonize home-State priorities  with my national duties and keep the Commonwealth at the center of all  I do. It is a tall order. It takes the best of the best, someone who is  so capable that every important issue will involve them, but so humble  that situations never become about them. Enter Phil Maxson--a kind,  cheerful, and unbelievably confident servant leader whom I am convinced  nobody in this planet dislikes.   Phil climbed the Capitol Hill ladder the old-fashioned way. He joined  my team as an intern a decade ago. Actually, I think Phil may have  snuck a late application into a last-minute opening. If I am right  about that, then his good fortune was ours as well.   He has done every job: legislative correspondent, legislative  assistant, legislative director, and then the top spot.   As one of his old bosses reminded me recently, ``every time a gap in  the office appeared, Phil was the natural choice'' to fill it. It is  not like he elbowed his way up. It is that circumstances and our needs  kept pulling him up. He is that good.   For the past decade, Phil has walked into every meeting, every  markup, every normal day at the office, and every grueling far-flung  codel with total preparation, complete professionalism, and the score  of the latest UK game.   Another former supervisor of his put it this way: ``I don't think I  ever asked Phil a single question he didn't already know the answer to,  or didn't find the answer within about 10 minutes.'' That is high  praise when your portfolio ranges from U.S.-Burma relations to the  BUILD grants that improve our roads and everything in between.   It helps that Phil is a Kentucky thoroughbred through and through.  The man really is ``dyed in the bluegrass.'' As a young man in  Lexington, he found part-time work giving tours at Henry Clay's Ashland  estate. He also graduated from Henry Clay High School.   You could say the Senate was a natural destination. Here, he met UK  Coach Calipari, President Netanyahu, and families from Kentucky's  smallest towns. And they all got exactly the same attention,  enthusiasm, and warmth from Phil Maxson.   He clicks with everyone. He is as affable as he is intelligent. In a  town full of big egos and sharp elbows, he stands out because he  doesn't try to stand out.   For the better part of a decade, virtually every significant win we  have notched for our Commonwealth has had Phil at its nucleus. But if  you drop by the staff meeting the day after, what you would hear is  Phil explaining why everyone else deserves more credit than he does,  why it really all came down to my leadership or his peers' efforts or  the hard work of the junior folks beneath him--in other words, everyone  else but him.   You would have to go to everyone else to learn that Phil was the  human glue that, in fact, held it all together. It would take me all  day to list every win Phil helped quarterback for our home State: a  state-of-the-art chemical weapons destruction facility in Madison  County, the transfer of the Rochester Dam to local ownership, a new  wildlife refuge in Henderson County, environmental cleanup and health  benefits for nuclear workers in Paducah, the planned construction of a  new VA hospital in Louisville, Freedom to Fish and the raising of Lake  Cumberland, and many, many more.   But, alas, his dedication to Kentucky is so all-encompassing that he  and his wife Sarah Beth have decided they don't want to raise their  young family anywhere else.   So ``Bee and Phil on Capitol Hill''--as friends have called them-- plus their two boys, Barbour and Theodore, are homeward bound.   I made the same decision myself as a young man, trading in the life  of a Senate staffer for a move back home. So I can't exactly fault his  decision.   Phil needs to spend fewer breakfasts and dinners with me and more  with his own burgeoning clan. I get it, but I am sure sorry to see him  go.   Phil is the kind of Senate all-star who deserves a full-dress curtain  call. He deserves toasts and a dinner and a big farewell party. I  regret that in these bizarre pandemic times, a floor speech will have  to suffice, at least right now.   So, Phil, thank you for your years of dedication to the State we both  love. We will miss your brain. We will miss your heart. You are leaving  behind one heck of a fan club all throughout the U.S. Senate. We wish  you all the best in the chapters ahead.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I think that all of our colleagues understand our  present situation.   Both sides of the aisle are firmly committed to finalizing another  major pandemic rescue package for the American people. Constant  discussions have been underway for several days now.   As of right now, we have not yet reached a final agreement,  regretfully. I believe all sides feel we are making good progress on a  major relief bill that would travel with a full-year appropriations  measure.   But, alas, we are not there yet.   Given that, our urgent task is to pass a stopgap government funding  measure. There is no reason the Federal Government funding should lapse  while we hammer out our remaining differences. We are going to take up  the continuing resolution, which just passed the House a few minutes  ago on an overwhelming bipartisan basis.   I hope this body will pass it easily and get this measure on the  President's desk so Congress can complete our negotiations with no  pointless lapse in normal government operations.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, at the end of last month, my friend  Todd Ruckel closed out 8 impressive years of leadership as Lewis County  judge-executive. This financial consultant turned public servant has  given so much to his community. I would like to take a moment today to  join Todd's admirers in thanking him for his service.   As a former county judge-executive myself, I know just how close Todd  is with his constituents. He hears their stories and has been  instrumental in Lewis County's success. It is a difficult assignment  but one with many rewards for a job well done. Todd ends his time in  office with the respect of his colleagues and the gratitude of the  families he served so well. He was even named the Kentucky Emergency  Management Judge-Executive of the Year in 2017 for his work to keep his  community safe.   My team and I have worked with Todd over the years. In particular, we  secured over $1 million from the Appalachian Regional Commission to  upgrade the water infrastructure in Lewis County. It is just a snapshot  of Todd's accomplishments for the families who placed their trust in  him.   Unfortunately, the pain caused by the coronavirus this past year has  led to many challenges for local officials and communities. Todd  recognized the danger early on. He took steps to protect families  throughout Lewis County. I am proud the CARES Act delivered more than  $2 million to the community, including to support Todd's team.   Although the transition has begun toward new leadership in Lewis  County, Todd is still working for Kentucky. He is joining the Kentucky  County Judge-Executive Association as its new executive director. Now,  Todd can use his talents to help local officials in communities across  the Bluegrass State.   I am sure everyone in the Lewis County courthouse is sad to see Todd  and his wife Sandy go, but the results of his leadership will remain.  On behalf of the Senate, I am grateful for Todd's continued service to  Kentucky. We extend our best wishes and congratulate him on an  accomplished career for Kentucky.                            ____________________     Mr. President, over the course of 40-plus years, my  friend Bob Hutchison and his brother Tom built an impressive network of  restaurant franchises in Eastern Kentucky. The brothers employed  thousands of Kentuckians, believing a firm commitment to their  community would bring success. They were right. Bob and Tom recently  announced the sale of their 13 McDonald's franchises to pursue new  opportunities. On behalf of the families across the region who continue  to benefit from their entrepreneurial investment, I would like to  congratulate the brothers on their great achievement.   While many folks are lucky enough to be born in Kentucky, some find  their way to the Bluegrass State. As the Hutchison brothers scouted  across the region for the right place to open their first restaurant,  Bob saw something special in Paintsville. I think they found a  wonderful community.   They decided to open their store during the local festival called  Apple Days. Some onlookers were skeptical the Hutchison brothers could  be prepared for a successful opening during such a high-traffic event.  Bob and Tom were undeterred. To put their best foot forward, they  trained staff to flip Styrofoam patties in their living room as they  prepared for the big day. When the restaurant opened on October 6,  1979, they surpassed all expectations. I have visited them during the  Apple Days festival through the years as their restaurant continued to  thrive.   Together, the brothers developed a recipe that worked. Their first  restaurant connected with customers, and they continued opening more  franchises around the region. At each of their 13 restaurants, Bob and  Tom made a commitment to investing in their employees and community.  They gave many young people their first job, instilling the values of  hard work and dedication. Scores of Kentuckians have grown up and  achieved because of the brothers' influence. In addition to the  McDonald's restaurants, Bob also founded the HUTCH Auto Group and a  gasket and supply company in Ohio.   I had the privilege to become friends with Bob as he grew more active  in the community. He has promoted our shared values and made  extraordinary contributions to a wide range of organizations, including  the University of Pikeville, the Christian Appalachian Project, and the  Boy Scouts of Eastern Kentucky. Working more than 20 years with the  Paintsville/Johnson County Tourism Commission, Bob has helped others  see the great beauty and potential of this community in the same way he  did all those years ago.   Although Bob and Tom are stepping away from their restaurants, they  will keep working for Eastern Kentucky's future. I am grateful to the  Hutchison brothers for their inspiring achievements. Whatever the  future holds in store for them, I wish them the very best.   Mr. President, the Appalachian News-Express published a profile on  the Hutchison brothers' inspiring career in Eastern Kentucky. I ask  unanimous consent the article be printed in the Record.    There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:             [From the Appalachian News Express, August 7, 2020]    Passing the Spatula: Bob and Tom Hutchison Part Ways With McDonald's                                   Stores                             (By Reagan Coburn)          Paintsville--Bob and Tom Hutchison, brothers and owner-      operators of 13 McDonald's restaurants in Eastern Kentucky,       recently announced that they have sold their franchise to       Faris Enterprises of Clinton, Tennessee. Tom described the       joint decision of the two brothers, stating, ``The time has       come to turn over the spatula to the next opportunity.''         The Hutchison brothers' journey led them from Ohio to the       mountains of Eastern Kentucky. Along the way they made       numerous contributions to the area through their restaurants,       and have given back to the communities in which they have       engrained their lives.         The two youngest of five brothers, Bob and Tom were raised       by parents who instilled values and beliefs in them to which       they credit their successes in life.         ``Our Dad had a full ride of a career,'' said Tom. ``He       had been in the restaurant business and was with McDonald's.       He worked for this group of investors. He pretty much       retired, but when he went to McDonald's they knew that we       were going to use our father's brain and brawn. The gentleman       who was running McDonald's in that division at the time knew       our work ethic. He's the one that kept pushing us to come to       Kentucky.         ``At that time I was 22, Bob was 25,'' Tom continued.       ``The youngest franchisees signed on. That was unheard of.       But the guy knew our work ethic from our parents. Our father       grew up in an orphanage from the age of five until he got out       until he got out to marry our mother. A single mother raised       our mother after the age of 12. Her father had an early       death. So both of our parents were very goal-oriented, stern,       family-based and those values were how we were raised.''         Tom described the duo as being business partners even as       young children cutting grass, shoveling driveways in the Ohio       winters and washing and waxing cars. They began working from       a very young age. From the age of 9 to 14, Bob delivered       newspapers. At the age of 14, both brothers entered the       restaurant business with the assistance of their father.         ``We knew the restaurant business,'' stated Tom. ``We       started at 14 years old. We did management and I got into       marketing. Bob did some schooling. The fact is that we knew       how to run a restaurant and that it was about people--      powering our people with pride. That is what we made as a       foundation for building our company.''                      Getting started in Eastern Kentucky          Making the choice to settle in Eastern Kentucky and open a       McDonald's restaurant in a community like Paintsville in the       1970s and 1980s did not come without some reservations and a       few obstacles along the way.        ``We had several places to go to,'' described Bob. ``Our       dad had just retired working with McDonald's--another       operator. Then one of his cohorts tried to get him involved       with the restaurants and there was no way that we could do       that because we had no cash of that means. A fella from       McDonald's was very encouraging to Dad about getting into the       restaurant franchise. They said, `You gotta get a       McDonald's.' ''        ``So we came to the conclusion that we can try it, even       though we knew we had a short falling of cash.'' Bob said       that his father's cohort stated, ``There's this little spot       in East Kentucky called Paintsville. We want you to go look       at that.''         Bob continued, ``Mom, Dad, Tom and I came to Paintsville       at the McDonald's recommendation. Mom and Tom weren't really       on fire in the beginning because it was raining, a two lane       road and lots of coal trucks. So we went back and said,       `Aren't there any other areas?' So we went back and looked at       three or four other spots in the Ohio area, but for one       reason or another, we gravitated back here.''  [[Page S7703]]          The family returned to Paintsville once again to give the       area a second consideration to establish their restaurant.         Bob stated that he loved the area because of the many       state parks that were within an hour or so of the town.         ``I thought that's the place we need to be. You've got the       Daniel Boone National Forest, you've got the Red River Gorge,       you've got Fishtrap, you've got Dewey (Jenny Wiley). This       place was rocking with that kind of stuff,'' Bob explained.         During their second visit to Paintsville they stayed in       the Heart O' Highland's Motel, one of two motels in the town       at the time. The family received a knock on the door of their       room by a staff member stating they had to leave because the       dam at Paintsville Lake was going to break, a historic moment       for many in the area during 1978, and that they must evacuate       the town.         ``Mom said that's an omen, we don't need to be here,''       stated Bob.         ``I was already in the car,'' Tom joked.         After that debacle, the family once again looked for other       locations and stores but they were repeatedly told by their       advisor that Paintsville was ``where it's at.''         ``So we came back, but we didn't have the money. We needed       $250,000,'' Bob said. ``The next trip was come back with our       newly-purchased dress suits and went to the bank. We went to       First National Bank and the vice president was very cordial.       We sat down and told him we need $250,000 and we want to put       in a McDonald's. We knew we were in trouble when he said,       `What's a McDonald's?' '' So we presented a packet to him of       what McDonald's was.'' After about 15 minutes of       deliberation, the Vice President of the bank offered them a       mere $25,000.         Bob stated, ``We walked out of the bank. Dad was a chain       smoker. He lit a cigarette and as we walked down the street       toward the car Mom said, `No luck there. I can tell by the       way you're walking and smoking.' ''         Bob said that was the moment when his mother made the       switch from pessimist to optimist.         According to Bob, she said, ``Now look, there's another       bank down there. You guys go down there and find some       money.''         ``So we went down to Citizen's National Bank and were       greeted by a very hospitable lady, Nancy Brugh, and we told       her what we were looking for,'' Bob explained.         Brugh seated the boys in the office of Trigg Dorton, an       famous local banker during the time. Describing Dorton, Bob       stated, ``He had his three-piece suit, his glasses and a       cigar and introduced himself and sat down.''         Dorton allegedly said, ``Boys, tell me about yourself. He       started with Tom. He said, `go back as far as you can       remember. Tell me about your life,' '' Bob stated.         Dorton then asked Bob and his father to do the same.         Bob stated that Dorton was incredibly impressed with their       life stories and that Dorton and his father shared a common       link- they were both in the Second World War.         ``It was the very first time I heard Dad say anything       remotely about the war,'' said Bob. He continued, ``He was       also impressed that Dad was raised in a children's home. He       was impressed that Tom and I started working when we were       fourteen.''         The following day, Dorton presented the family with a       check for $250,000.         ``He was probably the most knowledgeable banker I ever       met,'' said Bob. ``Then, of course, his son Dennis Dorton,       who just passed, was my second mentor there.''         They opened a bank account there, deposited the check, and       that was the beginning. Choosing to stay         Tom stated, ``By the fall of 1978 we knew we were coming.       We broke ground that winter and were open by the fall of       1979.''         He continued, ``We opened up on Apple Days--right in the       swing of things. McDonald's came in and said there's no way       you guys can handle opening during the festival. We were       doing trainings in our living rooms with Styrofoam       hamburgers. We were teaching them service. We had nowhere to       train them,'' Tom laughed. ``It really was fun.''         ``But despite all that, we opened up on October the 6th,       during Apple Days, and it went great,'' he said. ``We had       high sales and the team pulled together. It was phenomenal.       McDonald's was in awe.''         Following the opening on the Paintsville store, their       advisor in Ohio helped with the banking to open the       Hutchisons' Prestonsburg and Pikeville locations.         ``Mom said, `Boys, we're not moving, but sometimes you       gotta do things in life you don't want to do to get where you       need to go,' '' reminisced Tom.         ``So we signed the papers--Dad, Bob and I, and the       gentleman leaned backed in his chair and said, `Thank God.       You guys are the 12th people we've sent down there. Everybody       else told us to stick it,' '' he joked.         Tom stated, ``The beauty of it is, this is where we came.       But the most beautiful part of it is, this is where we chose       to stay. We had chances to leave. We did Paintsville.       Pikeville was our next one in 1982. Goody was two weeks after       that. Then we came back in 1987 and opened up Prestonsburg as       store number four.''         When asked for the reasons they chose to stay here after       launching so many successful restaurants, Tom stated, ``I       think a couple of things. We had people who believed in us--      our parents, McDonald's, Mr. Dorton--but we believed in the       brand. We believed in McDonald's and we were taught that you       have to be entrenched in your communities. We learned that       from our parents. We learned to give back. We chose to stay,       we chose to be involved and be part of the grain of the       community. To us, that's what created our success. We chose       to be local and build upon what we had. We knew we had a       beautiful garden here, so we just kept cultivating our       garden.''                             Not a `dead-end' job          Bob and Tom have given back to their employees and       community members in countless ways. Having employed       thousands of people over the past several decades, Bob said,       ``I think we've had an impact on a lot of people. Many people       that have come through the doorways of the arches have become       successful, reaching and fulfilling their dreams. Our biggest       reward is working with people who are a little shy, a little       backwards and have self-esteem issues and no confidence. I       love to coach people that are in those situations, especially       the 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18-year-olds that have never been       exposed to a lot.         ``Also, every manager that we have working with us now has       been promoted within, and that in itself is a success,'' he       continued. Speaking on the work ethic people of Eastern       Kentucky, Bob stated, ``The people in this area want to work       given the opportunity to work.''         ``I love giving people second chances,'' he said. ``We've       got five or six felons working with us right now. We've got       several single mothers who have gone through different       programs--spousal abuse and things of that nature. It all       goes back to their confidence and self-esteem. That's been my       mission field- working with people of that nature.         He continued, ``A lot of people refer to McDonald's as a       dead-end job. It's no dead end job at all. It's whatever an       individual wants to make of it. It's whatever they want to do       with it. They can create anything they want to. They're their       own molder of the clay and it's just a unique thing.''         Tom echoed the sentiment, stating, `` ``There's plenty of       rewards. Just this week, getting hit up on Facebook by a       previous employee who worked with us for six years, who, of       course, heard about Bob and I making the change, and there       are so many individuals like this young lady who went off to       other careers, but what they learned as crew people they've       carried into their present fields. McDonald's is not a dead       end job. It leads to many opportunities. McDonald's has       touched so many lives. We've been fortunate to be and create       McDonald's of East Kentucky and create those opportunities.''         Bob then spoke of various programs that McDonald's offers       their employees to better their lives. He mentioned the       McDonald's Archways to Opportunity program, which recently       assisted team member Josh Halliday.         He stated, ``Through the McDonald's program and through       our encouragement, he went to college through the McDonald's       program. Now he has a four-year degree with minimal expense       to him thanks to McDonald's, Tom and I. He's a rock star and       he's our IT guy. He'll be going to HU in the near future and       he'll be dually accredited. He can run a restaurant or he can       do IT, whatever fits his niche, no matter where he's at in       life and whether it's McDonald's of Kentucky and he wants to       pack his bags and move west. He is a highly sought after,       highly valuable individual.''         Tom noted, ``The hospitality industry is here to stay.       Their training is so intense with management that an       individual can get 22 hours of training that can be converted       to accredited college classwork. No restaurant and very few       businesses have programs remotely like that.''                                  Giving back          It is this spirit of giving back that has continued to       drive the two brothers over the years, both within their       restaurants and the community at large.         When asked in what ways he has enjoyed giving back the       most, Bob stated, ``One was being heavily entrenched in Boy       Scouts of East Kentucky and I got there through the       assistance of Trigg Dorton. Trying to keep Boy Scouts alive       in East Kentucky and I was on the Bluegrass Council out of       Lexington and I took that position to try to facilitate a       stronger stance for Boy Scouts in East Kentucky. I left that       position two years ago but I'm still considered an assistant       troop master and remain active. I try to keep scouting alive       in Johnson County.         ``The second thing would be the Christian Appalachian       Project,'' Bob said. ``I've been involved with them for 20       plus years and that's very rewarding in many ways at the       local level and also when we have national disasters such as       Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans to see how well the people       of East Kentucky gather around and drive down there to help       people in dire straits.''         ``Third, mostly, has been education. Whether it's UPIKE,       Mountain Christian Academy when they were around in Martin,       or the Johnson County Board of Education. Regardless of which       district, this has been my number one thing that I've       thoroughly enjoyed. I've had some sort of impact with       education through different programs here in East Kentucky.''         His brother Tom bragged on him, stating, `` ``Not being       biologically a father, he's been a father to more kids than       anyone can possibly imagine.''         Tom then described the philanthropic efforts that meant       the most to him.         ``I was on the board of forming Judi's House in       Pikeville,'' Tom said. ``The arts was a big thing for me. I       work a lot with underprivileged kids, usually under my       grandmother's name. I don't put my name out  [[Page S7704]]       there. That's not what it's about. To me, it's about I know       where I can put something and it gets out there, and you're       helping someone. It goes back to giving back. The littlest       thing can mean so much to somebody. If it's that family, if       it's that crew person at the restaurant, it might be that       gentleman at the gas station you see everyday. On and on . .       . I think it's the biggest reward is if it's Christmas and       it's breakfast with Santa and there's children, seeing those       kids smile . . . I'm touched, man. That's it right there. And       watching kids grow up.''         Bob then stated, `` ``The successes and rewards are not       always measured in money. There are people in East Kentucky       that are as close as family. They are family--extended family       here in the hills.'' The two brothers then took a moment to       reflect on what it is like to work as partners in their       business endeavors.         ``It's very unique,'' said Tom, ``to be in a partnership       for that many years, but then it's unique added to it to be       in partnership with your brother for all of those years. We       are totally like night and day. Ask any of our crew. But       that's part of it. I respect Bob's forte, he respects mine,       but do we always agree? No. But when we sit down at a table       and we have a discussion, it may not be what I sat down at       the table and wanted or thought was best, but when we walk       away, we're on the same mission. What is the result we want?       We talk it out. It's about communication, cooperation and       coordination.''         ``If we really hit head to head, then we do paper,       scissors, rock,'' joked Tom.         Bob stated, ``My strong points might be his weak points.       His strong points might be my weak points. However, through       osmosis over the years we've been able to balance each       other.''         ``I'm a very diplomatic guy,'' Bob continued. ``Tom likes       to put a lot of bling in stuff. Tom likes to make stuff look       nice. There's really nothing wrong with it, but we've went       head-to-head on some of the remodels that we've done. Before,       when we were allowed the luxury of picking out nice lights       and nice wallpaper or quality seating, and he wanted to do       things . . . we went into a boxing match over that one. I       said, `Do whatever you'd like, but keep in mind that I've got       the budget.' ''                             Leaving the business          The decision to move on from McDonald's, the brothers       said, was linked to the death of their older brother at 70.         ``Bob and I reflected on the passing of our older brother       and thought when is the right time?'' Tom said. ``I don't       know if there is a right time, but we did make a plan and so       we made the availability. What was nice is that some of the       perimeters we had set were like `Who's going to come in and       represent and take care of our people? Who would take care of       our guests? Who is going to best reflect what we've laid a       great foundation out for?' It was about finding the right       team, family or person who had the same beliefs and was going       to keep our company intact.''         For Bob and Tom, the Faris family was the perfect fit for       continuing their legacy.         Bob stated, ``It was an easy decision. We've had five or       six people approach us over the last couple of years without       even putting a sign out. It was really easy when we saw who       they (the Faris family) are personally and professionally. We       knew who to sell it to. They're people-oriented.''         Tom echoed the sentiment, stating, ``The Farises, what       they had to offer us and what they had to offer the team, I       want to say that we are like book ends. Bob, Tom and the       Faris family. Same core beliefs. That's what felt good.''         ``I wouldn't be surprised one bit if they make this       organization better than it already is,'' said Bob.         The two brothers plan to remain in Eastern Kentucky and       continue making a difference in their communities.         Tom stated, `` ``What's most important is that Bob and I       came here almost 42 years ago to go into business. We had the       opportunity to leave many times, to relocate. But we chose to       stay because the mountains spoke to us and there's a lot of       opportunity here. We've seen a lot of opportunity here--but       the people. The people in the communities and the people that       were with us in our organization--our company was really       powered by people with pride and we knew we had everything we       ever set out for and that we could begin and continue our       foundation by staying here in Eastern Kentucky, where we       chose to make our home. We're still in the community. We'll       still be engrained in many things in the community. We are       not leaving or abandoning, we are just taking ourselves to       the next level.''         Bob stated, ``We will be here, we will be active, we will       be involved and the thing that's keeping us here is the       people--the people in the mountains. People here have been       great--we've been able to help a lot of people, but there's a       lot of people that have been able to help us.''         Tom said the brothers are simply opening another chapter       in their lives.         ``We walked in together, and we're walking out together,''       he said. ``It's a beautiful scenery.''                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of H.J.
