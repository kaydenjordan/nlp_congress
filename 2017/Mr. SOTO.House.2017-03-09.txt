 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 3, line 10, strike ``This'' and insert ``Except as       otherwise provided in this subsection, this''.        Page 5, line 4, strike the close quotation mark and the       period which follows.        Page 5, after line 4, insert the following:        ``(5) This subsection does not apply with respect to a case       in which the plaintiff seeks compensation for public health       risks, including byproducts of hydraulic fracturing, well       stimulation, or any water contamination.''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 175, the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Soto) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment would create an exception to  this bill for instances of public health risks, including byproducts of  hydraulic fracturing, well stimulation, or any water contamination.  Fracking, especially in my home State of Florida, is dangerous, and its  effects can be far-reaching. Just last week, a State senate committee  voted unanimously to ban the practice in our State, and the bill  continues to move through.   Pollution can reach our aquifers that provide drinking water to  millions. Sometimes concerned citizens must go to court to stop this.  Access to justice is a fundamental American right, and we must protect  it. Sometimes in Washington, up is down and right is wrong. This,  unfortunately, is the case with the so-called Innocent Party Protection  Act.                                time  1530    This bill is incredibly harmful to those injured by corporate  wrongdoers. If someone drinks poisoned water as a result of fracking,  well stimulation, or general water contamination, this bill will make  it harder for them to get justice for their injuries. By restricting  access to State courts, the courts that are closest to the people, this  bill would deny justice.   The bill will deny plaintiffs their right to choose a State court  forum for their claims and will instead allow defendant companies that  negligently pollute water to drag a case out, which will drive up costs  and increase burdens for plaintiffs by removing it to Federal court.   Then, once a case is in Federal court, instead of litigating over the  merits of the case, the courts will argue over the various requirements  that this bill establishes. Placing a higher threshold that a plaintiff  must satisfy to get the case sent back to State court is unnecessary  and unduly burdensome.   The amendment I am offering would restore access to justice. It would  allow people whose water has been contaminated by fracking and related  activities to seek damages from corporate wrongdoers.   This amendment isn't just a hypothetical exercise. Here in my hand I  hold 18 cases involving fracking. They are 18 cases where fracking led  to injury. In 10 of these cases, plaintiffs sued in State court,  raising State claims, yet defendants removed the case to Federal court,  only to have the Federal court remand the cases back to the State due  to lack of diversity jurisdiction.   Thus, I hold here 10 cases where a remand back to State court would  be denied under this bill. If this bill had been enacted, I hold here  10 cases that would have been denied justice. Four of these 18  hydraulic fracturing cases are still pending. Will we deny justice for  these four cases?   For these plaintiffs and for future plaintiffs, I ask my colleagues  to vote in favor of this amendment and safeguard justice to all who  drink water.   Mr. Chair, I urge support of my amendment, and I reserve the balance  of my time.  [[Page H1973]]         Mr. Chairman, water is not arbitrary. The right to clean  water is not arbitrary. It is essential. Just ask the plaintiffs in  these cases. Just ask the people of Flint. Just ask victims of fracking  across our Nation, which is why we in Florida are looking to ban the  practice.   So this isn't just some arbitrary area. This is an essential area  that is affecting issues right now throughout the Nation.   Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Raskin).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 8, strike line 7 and all that follows through line 14       (and amend the amendment to the table of contents on page 9       after line 3 accordingly).    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 180, the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Soto) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment would strike section 1721 of  this Fairness in Class Action Litigation Act of 2017. The irony of  section 1721 is it unfairly subjects class action plaintiffs to an  inevitable deluge of prolonged delay.   A stay of discovery means no depositions. It means injured people  will not get essential documents. It means victims will not be entitled  to the names of necessary witnesses and more as long as a motion that  may dispose of the case is pending. There is nothing to prevent a  corporation from filing motion after motion to obstruct a victim's path  to justice.   Numerous consumer, civil rights, environmental, labor, and other  public interest groups oppose this bill because it builds in an  automatic stay of discovery in the district court whenever an alleged  wrongdoer files any one of a list of motions, including common motions  like a motion to strike, a motion to dismiss, and a motion to dispose  of class action allegations. There will be no end to the filing of  these motions. This is an invitation for gamesmanship and delay and  will deprive judges of the ability to properly manage their cases.   The framers of the bill want you to believe that plaintiffs are  greedy, undeserving people who want to hinder small business. This  could not be further from the truth. If there are big settlements, it  is because the damage to the victims was heinous.   Is there any doubt that huge corporations would file motion after  motion to obstruct these victims from getting the facts they need?   Class actions are critical for enforcement of laws prohibiting  discrimination in employment, housing, education, and access to public  areas and services.   At the end of the day, if we are trying to reduce litigation, why  have this glaring loophole where someone continues to file motions to  stop ordinary discovery from going forward?   Mr. Chairman, I urge Members to support my amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, even if we included motions to dismiss in the  stay, which are at the beginning of the case because they are  dispositive motions, there are still motions to strike that are left in  this bill.   After surviving a motion to dismiss, motions to strike are regularly  filed. Anybody who has had any time in the courtroom know they can be  filed over and over and over again. There is no limit of them under the  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. So simply by filing motion to strike  after motion to strike, a defendant can continue to delay justice; and  justice delayed is justice denied.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida will  be postponed.              Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. Johnson of Georgia    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5  printed in part B of House Report 115-29.
