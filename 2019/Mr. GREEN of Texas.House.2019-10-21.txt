 Mr. Speaker, I rise, yes, to mourn his death, but  I also rise to celebrate his life, because it was a life worthy of  great celebration.   I rise understanding that, yes, he was brilliant. He was a Phi Beta  Kappa with some 13 doctoral degrees, but he did not allow his  brilliance to outshine his goodness.   His goodness was such that he was one who cared for the least, the  last, and the lost. He was there for those whom we consider the least  among us, those who were not born into plenty but, rather, into  poverty.    He was there for those who were the last, the last hired and the  first fired. He fought for jobs for them.   He was there for those who are lost, lost in poverty in the richest  country in the world, and he fought to elevate their lives; those lost  in chemical abuse, he was there to help them acquire healthcare.   He was truly a person who made a difference in the lives of people  whom he never had the opportunity to meet and greet.   So I mourn his passing, but I celebrate his living.   And while I am sure there are many who will say that he left too  soon, I can only say this: We had him for 68 years, and I am grateful  for that 68 years.   God bless you, dear brother. You were a wise warrior and a seeker of  peace. And while you may not be with us physically, your spirit will  endure forever.
