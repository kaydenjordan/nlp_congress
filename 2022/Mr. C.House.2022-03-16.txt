  Scott Franklin), who came to Congress after 26 years of distinguished  service as a naval aviator and knows of what he speaks.    SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. Madam Speaker, I always appreciate  my colleague from Louisiana's leadership on these important issues and  I appreciate the time he is yielding me.   Madam Speaker, as my colleagues have shared, the Biden administration  [[Page H3767]]  has been defined by a series of self-inflicted crises. These include  failed leadership on the world stage, runaway inflation, and a  deliberate failure to secure our borders. In fact, you could say they  are having a record year, record high inflation, record violent crime,  record gas prices, record numbers of illegal immigrants, seizures of  illegal drugs all at our southern border. The common denominator in  each of these disasters is the President himself.   The President listened to the State Department over the  recommendation of his generals, which led to last year's disastrous  withdrawal from Afghanistan.   He shut down American energy production, which led to skyrocketing  gas prices long before Russia invaded Ukraine.   He catered to the radicals, flooding our economy with trillions in  free money, and that has created the rampant inflation that we are  experiencing today.   On the border, his reversal of President Trump's policies has led to  nearly two million migrants pouring across our southern border since he  took office. That is more than the population of 15 of our States.  Think about that, the equivalent of creating a State or two every  single year with the number of people crossing the border.   These disasters were completely self-inflicted, and American families  are paying the price.   Despite our political differences, I take no joy in watching this  administration fail. When our President fails, America fails.   Madam Speaker, the American people need and deserve a true leader. If  the President is incapable of leading, he has a duty to surround  himself with smart people willing to give him good counsel in the best  interests of our Nation. Listen to the smart ones and not those with a  track record of failure, and then act on it.   The President should focus on American energy independence, which  will bring down gas prices here at home and help our allies abroad. He  should not be talking to a Venezuelan dictator when we have reliable,  affordable energy right here at home. He also needs to stop the out-of- control spending and reinstate tough border policies to protect our  communities.   For the sake of our country, this administration must stop  administrating and implementing the worst ideas of the D.C. political  class and lead decisively.
