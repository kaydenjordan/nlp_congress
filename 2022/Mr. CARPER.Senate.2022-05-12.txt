 Mr. President, Senator Capito and I are introducing  legislation today to reauthorize appropriations for the National  Wildlife Refuge System's volunteer and partnerships program. I want to  share with our colleagues some information about the Keep America's  Refuges Operational Act and ask for their support.   The Keep America's Refuges Operational Act reauthorizes the volunteer  and partnerships program, with no increase, at $2 million per year. The  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service uses the modest Federal funding it  receives for this program to leverage volunteer contributions by  providing uniforms, training, equipment, and necessary travel.   Our National Wildlife Refuge System is an exceptional network of more  than 850 acres of public lands and waters dedicated to fish and  wildlife conservation. Tens of millions of people visit our refuges  each year to explore, fish, hunt, and view and study wildlife. This  ecotourism strongly supports local economies. During the pandemic in  particular, our national lands, including refuges, were safe outdoor  spaces for recreation.   Volunteers are critical to refuge operations. They assist with fish  and wildlife surveys, restoring habitat, and supporting refuge office  functions. Without volunteers and partner groups, refuges would likely  have to cut back on public programs and reduce hours of operation.   In my home State of Delaware, we have two beautiful refuges--the  Prime Hook National Wildlife Refuge and the Bombay Hook National  Wildlife Refuge. Both refuges are highly dependent upon volunteers.   Each year, people come to our refuges to observe the federally  threatened red knot shorebird, which stops along the Delaware Bay to  refuel on horseshoe crab eggs along its migration journey. Volunteers  make sure these visitors have memorable experiences.   When people can see these pristine habitats and the many species that  call them home, they are inspired to be good stewards of our planet for  the enjoyment and benefit of future generations.   I want to ensure that these opportunities opportunities abound in  Delaware and around the country. A small annual investment in the  refuge system volunteer and partnerships program goes a long way. Every  $1 appropriated to coordinate these volunteers translates to  approximately $10 worth of volunteer services.   These appropriations also help cut government costs. In fiscal year  2021, more than 11,000 volunteers donated 68,879 hours, with donated  time equaling that of 318 full-time employees. The value of this time  contribution is about $18.5 million.   I want to thank Senator Capito for cosponsoring this commonsense  legislation. I look forward to working with her and our colleagues in  the House to pass the Keep America's Refuges Operational Act and enact  it into law.                                  ______                                         By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Markey, Mrs. Capito, Mr. Warner,          Mr. Moran, and Mr. Menendez):   S. 4202. A bill to require an annual budget estimate for the  initiatives of the National Institutes of Health pursuant to reports  and recommendations made under the National Alzheimer's Project Act; to  the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.                                  ______                                         By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Warner, Mrs. Capito, Mr. Markey,          Mr. Moran, and Mr. Menendez):   S. 4203.
