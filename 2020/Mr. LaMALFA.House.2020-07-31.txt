 Mr. Speaker, lying in northern California and southern  Oregon is the Klamath Lake as well as the Klamath Project, which has  provided water for agriculture for almost 100 years.   The science involved that informs how much water the Klamath Project  receives each year has been flawed for quite some time. For years,  farmers and ranchers in the Klamath Basin have competed with salmon and  suckerfish for the full water allocation that they need. This year's  battle was the final straw.   Earlier this month, in July, Secretary Bernhardt and Commissioner  Burman came to visit the Klamath Basin to meet with farmers, ranchers,  locals, and other stakeholders at the invitation of myself and my  colleague,   Greg Walden. They got to see just how harmful the bad  science has been to the irrigators in the basin.   This week, the Secretary and Commissioner announced that the Trump  administration is making a commitment to update the science on the  Klamath Project, and it will inevitably provide relief to the  irrigators and the dwindling fish populations that have suffered  nonsensical allocations.   In a time where it seems that our government can't seem to get much  right or much production done, this administration has provided a  potentially lifesaving solution to the Klamath Basin in just under a  month.   Updating the science is critical and will help us make more informed  decisions for decades to come.                            ____________________
