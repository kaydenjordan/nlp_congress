 Madam President, the President of the United States  swears an oath to protect and defend the Constitution, including  bedrock principles like the rule of law and the sanctity of our  elections. But nearly every day, President Trump ignores this  fundamental responsibility and tramples on the values that have made  our country the light of the world. No President has come close to  defaming and trying to destroy the democratic values of this country.  No President has come close--none.   This morning, for what seemed like the millionth time, the President  angrily, wildly, and baselessly ranted about the special counsel's  investigation. It doesn't matter to him that his claims have no basis.  It doesn't matter to him that his words may degrade faith in our  independent law enforcement agencies and the rule of law. He proceeds  only according to self-interest. He is offended that someone might look  into the fact that he did something wrong--this happens with every  President--and he lashes out in ways that hurt our democracy  permanently.   Just look at how over the past few weeks President Trump has tried to  intimidate and bully election officials in Florida and Arizona with  fantastical claims of voter fraud. It doesn't matter to him that there  is no evidence to the charges. It doesn't matter to him that in both  States--Arizona and Florida--Republican officials have said there is no  fraud, debunking the President's claims. It doesn't matter to him that  his claims erode faith in the integrity of our elections among a  segment of his supporters. If the President thinks it will help him  personally, he will say it.   One of the most recent examples of this just happened yesterday. The  President keeps getting more and more absurd. He makes things up. He  most recently claimed in an interview with the Daily Caller that  ``illegal'' voters ``go to their car, put on a different hat, put on a  different shirt, and vote again.''   Name one. Name a few. When did it happen and when? Or did you just  read this on some rightwing, nasty, dishonest blog and just repeat it?  Donald Trump, you are the President of the United States. Because you  read something in a blog that has no basis in fact, you don't have the  right to repeat it, if you are President and behaving Presidentially,  and yet he does it over and over. It is the height of irresponsibility.   Since his first day in office, President Trump has made these  ridiculous claims about voter fraud that even his sham voting  commission, led by Kris Kobach, couldn't prove. The real disgrace is  how low the President and  [[Page S6970]]  some Republicans will stoop to prevent American citizens from  exercising their right to vote and how far they will go to undermine  faith in our democracy, even to the point of disenfranchising military  voters--people who may be overseas defending our freedom, risking their  lives, who want to vote--and if their ballots don't come in at exactly  the right moment, they shouldn't be counted--disgraceful.   The tendency is to treat the President's words as an extension of our  modern, partisan politics. Well, we have too much partisan politics,  but the truth is that the President's blatant disregard for basic  norms, constitutional constraints, and truth is unique to him. No  President has come close to going as far to destroy democratic norms.  He is doing severe and possibly irreparable damage to our democracy all  to suit his goal and often, it seems, just his ego.   Democrats condemn this behavior, but where are our Republican  friends? They should know better. They do know better. I hear the  private chatter. The silence of the Republican majority as the  President takes an ax to democratic norms will go down as one of the  least bright moments in the history of the Republican Party. It will go  down as one of the bad marks in the history of the Senate, and we don't  hear a peep. Are our Republican colleagues afraid? Are they just being  mercenary? After this last election, I wouldn't think that would be the  case. Trump didn't lead them to overwhelming victory. When are we going  to hear from them?   This is not an issue of partisanship. When a President, Democrat or  Republican, does so much to destroy democratic norms and does so much  to just make up things--like that people went into a car and put on a  different hat to vote--where are our colleagues decrying this, at least  saying that the President shouldn't do it? They are embracing a  President whom they know has done so many bad things. I am not talking  ideologically. I am talking about honor and respect for democracy. It  is something they should not be proud of.                            ____________________     Madam President, now, on the Russia investigation  itself. There is this idea out there on the Republican side that the  President doesn't intend to interfere with the Russia investigation.  Republicans, including my friend the Republican leader, say President  Trump has not threatened the special counsel investigation, and so  there is no need to protect it. That is a laugh. He threatens the  investigation almost every day. He did this morning in his tweets. To  say that the President hasn't threatened the special counsel is not  only logically dubious, but it is just dead wrong and untrue.   A few weeks ago, President Trump said the investigation ``should  end.'' This morning, again, President Trump made clear that he does not  want the Mueller investigation to reach a fair and impartial  conclusion. Last week, President Trump went around the traditional line  of succession in the Justice Department--what many believe to be a  violation of the Constitution--to install an Acting Attorney General  whose only qualification for the job seems to be that he has publicly  criticized the Russia probe.   My friends--particularly my friends, again, on the Republican side-- the writing is on the wall. Let's avoid this constitutional crisis.  Let's at least stand up for the rule of law. We should pass legislation  now, in the lameduck, to protect the special counsel's investigation  from the President and from his woefully unqualified henchman, Mr.  Whitaker.   Senators Flake and Coons tried yesterday--bipartisan--but the  Republican leader objected. They are going to keep trying, as they  should, and Democrats will try to add this proposal to the must-pass  spending bill because we believe it is so important for our democracy.  There is too much at stake to sit around and wait until the President  crosses the line, creating the constitutional crisis we all abhor.   But waiting until that happens would be too late. We need to act on  legislation to protect the special counsel, to protect the rule of law,  and to protect democracy, accountability, and the fundamental checks  and balances that is the hallmark of our great Nation.                            ____________________     Finally, last Tuesday's election was historic for not  only the number of ballots cast by Americans in the midterms but also  for whom those ballots were cast. Americans sent to our Nation's  Capital the most diverse Congress in the history of the country. In  several States, the first Native American women, the first African- American women, and the first Muslim women were elected in the history  of those States. Finally, the men and women walking the corridors of  power are beginning to look more like the Nation they represent, at  least on our side of the aisle, I am proud to say. We are not there  yet, but we are a lot closer.   In light of this progress, it is perhaps fitting that exactly half a  century ago, a fellow Brooklynite, Shirley Chisolm, became the first  African-American woman elected to Congress and eventually the first  African-American woman to run for a major party's nomination for  President, breaking that glass ceiling and paving the way for so many  others to follow. Whether they know Shirley Chisolm or not, so many who  are elected on the other side in the House of Representatives owe a lot  to her, as do all Americans.   So I have introduced a resolution in the Senate, along with my  friends in the House--Representative Yvette Clarke, my Congresswoman  whom I was proud to vote for in November, and Barbara Lee of  California--to honor Shirley Chisolm's achievements and her legacy of  public service.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
