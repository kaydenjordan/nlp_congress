 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Yarmuth for  yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, snake oil is all that this Republican budget will give  to the American middle class and working families.   This Republican budget before Congress is squarely aimed at ramming  through a tax plan without bipartisan consensus or input. This proposed  tax plan will increase our deficit, adding $1.5 trillion over the next  decade, and it leaves the middle class stuck footing the bill, with an  increase in their annual Federal taxes.   In fact, 80 percent of the tax cuts in this plan benefits only the  wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. That means those benefits are geared  towards those earning $900,000 a year or more.   One in three middle class families making between $50,000 and  $150,000 will see their taxes go up.   One proposal that Republicans have put forth to pay for their plan is  eliminating the State and local tax deduction. This will cost central  coast homeowners and families in my district over $15,000 a year on  average.   As a member of the Budget Committee, I encourage my colleagues to  reject this plan and to get to work on bipartisan negotiations for  lasting tax reform that benefits middle class families.
