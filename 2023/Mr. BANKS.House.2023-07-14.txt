 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, this amendment would prohibit the use of funds to  discriminate on the basis of race and ethnicity in admissions to the  military service academies.   Currently, all of the military service academies use race and  ethnicity as selection criteria for admissions. Not only is this a  violation of the Constitution, as recently affirmed by the U.S. Supreme  Court, but it is a violation of the military's longstanding  meritocratic principles.   The military service academies are elite universities that train and  educate the future leaders of our armed services. We need the best and  the brightest, the most fit cadets and midshipmen, regardless of their  skin color and ethnicity. To consider immutable characteristics like  race and ethnicity is blatantly discriminatory.   For our national security, we must uphold the ideals of our country  and put hard work, dedication, and service above all.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Mast), a real American hero.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment is simple. It ensures our  military service academies are in line with the Supreme Court's recent  decision on the unconstitutionality of race-based affirmative action,  and it strives to uphold the ideals of meritocracy, which is nowhere  more important than in the United States military.   Mr. Chair, I urge all Members to support this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
