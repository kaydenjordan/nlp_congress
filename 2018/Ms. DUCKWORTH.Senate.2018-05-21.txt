 Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for  vote No. 102 on the motion to invoke cloture on Executive Calendar No.  608, the nomination of Dana Baiocco to be a Commissioner of the  Consumer Product Safety Commission for a term of 7 years from October  27, 2017. On vote No. 102, had I been present, I would have voted nay  on the motion to invoke cloture on Executive Calendar No. 608.                            ____________________
