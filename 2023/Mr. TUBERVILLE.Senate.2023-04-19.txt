 Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 35,  S.J. Res. 10.  [[Page S1228]]     Mr. President, I am proud to have come from a  military family. Our veterans are some of the best people in this  country. Because of that, I am grateful to serve on the Veterans'  Affairs Committee. Giving back to our veterans has been a passion my  whole life. Our men and women in uniform deserve the best medical care  available. I am grateful for every healthcare provider that works for  and with our veterans.   The mission of the VA is taken from Abraham Lincoln's second  inaugural address. Lincoln pledged our country to ``care for him who  shall have borne the battle.'' That is what the VA is supposed to be  about. But today, under the Biden administration, we see the VA  increasingly--increasingly--getting distracted from that very important  mission. The Biden administration increasingly has the VA involved in  politics.   Last year, the VA announced they would begin providing taxpayer- funded abortions--last year. This is something the VA has never, ever  done. Let me repeat that. The VA has never done abortions. In fact, the  VA has been prohibited by this body from performing abortions at its  facilities for more than 30 years.   The 102nd Congress--1991 to 1992--made taxpayer-funded abortions at  VA facilities illegal. Let me repeat that. Thirty years ago, this body  made taxpayer-funded abortions illegal. It is a law. They did this with  the bipartisan Veterans Healthcare Act of 1992. The last I heard, that  is a Federal law, passed by this body, which, for some reason, we don't  want to do anymore. We want the executive branch to be able to do it on  their own, and that is wrong. We need to do our job.   This, today, is not about abortions. It is about taxpayers paying for  abortions that they don't have to pay for because of a law that was  presented and passed in this Chamber in 1992. The bill was introduced  in the House and the Senate by whom? None other than the Democrats. The  Senate passed it unanimously. This includes a Senator by the name of  Joe Biden.   Now President Biden is breaking the law that he voted for. How do you  do that? This is a direct violation of Federal law. The Biden  administration even wants taxpayers on the hook for abortions for  veterans' dependents. That has never happened. So we are changing the  law at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and not in here, where we are supposed  to do our job. It has got nothing to do with the VA's mission.   The VA won't even tell Congress if they are placing restrictions on  abortions. When are they doing it--at 5 months? 3 months? 2 months?  after the baby is born? We can't get any information out of them. They  just write the laws themselves. The VA has refused to cooperate with  Congress throughout this whole process. And that is what this is all  about. For all we know, a taxpayer-funded abortion can be at any time,  at their choosing.   This new policy also includes very limited moral protections for VA  medical staff. This, too, is unheard of in our laws and our traditions.  We have had moral protections on the books for decades. It was James  Madison who said that a man has a right to his property, and  ``Conscience is the most sacred property of all.'' This was the  attitude of our Founders. Frankly, the Founders would be shocked by  what is happening in this Chamber today.   Frankly, the Biden administration is violating the consciences of the  taxpayers as we speak by putting pressure on the taxpayers to have to  defend and go after this. Taxpayers shouldn't be forced to pay for  abortions, especially not when this was done without anybody's taking a  vote in this building, especially when Congress voted to make it  illegal 30 years ago. It is illegal and it is wrong.   In just a few moments, the Senate has a chance to do something about  it. We are going to vote on a bipartisan basis to overturn this rule.  If Democrats want taxpayer-funded abortions within the VA healthcare  system, let's vote on it. That is what we are elected to do, not lean  on a President and the White House to say this is what we are going to  do. That ain't the way we do it in this building. If we are going to do  it that way, let's lock the door and go home and save the taxpayers a  lot of money.   Again, this is not about abortion; this is about doing it the wrong  way. Let's pass the bill. Let's change the law. Let's don't break the  law in here.   I would like to thank the dozens of Senators supporting my  resolution. I would also like to thank Senator Manchin and Senator  Marshall for standing with me earlier today at a press conference to  explain the facts to the taxpayers and the citizens of this country.   It is very simple: Any Senator who votes against this resolution is  voting for taxpayer-funded abortion with no guardrails or protection  for any medical staff or nurses.   Voting no on this resolution means voting to give away even more  power from Congress to the executive branch, and that is really all we  need around here.   Right now, the VA is spending money we have never voted to spend.  Anyone who believes in the appropriations process, let's oppose this  rule and support this resolution.   Voting no would mean letting the administration spend money without  the consent of the people in this room, and that is what we are elected  to do. Voting no means a big stamp of approval for a blatantly illegal  regulation. Voting against the resolution also means turning the VA  into a taxpayer-funded abortion clinic.   The VA should be focused on their mission. Lord knows, we have got 20  veterans a day dying of suicide. Why don't we focus on helping the  veterans who have been fighting in wars, these last 20-year wars that  we have been funding. Let's keep politics out of the VA. These people  have had enough politics in their lives. Let's stay focused on their  mission to ``care for him who shall have borne the battle,'' as spoken  by President Abraham Lincoln.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, today, I want to honor  Alabama's own Officer Garrett Crumby who made the ultimate sacrifice  last month while responding to a shooting call in Madison County. A  graduate of Hillcrest High School in Tuscaloosa, he began his law  enforcement career as a patrol and field training officer at the  Tuscaloosa Police Department in November of 2013 before transitioning  to the Huntsville Police Department in August 2020.   Nicknamed ``Batman'' by his family for his heroic nature, Officer  Crumby is remembered as someone whose service to others extended beyond  his job. Officer Crumby's sister stated he ``believed that being a  police officer meant that anyone in their darkest moments had someone  to call, regardless of any race, age, creed, gender, tax bracket or  political affiliation. He would answer that call.''   He demonstrated this deep conviction by often showing up for  additional assignment calls that were not required of him and  volunteering at local events in the community. There was never an  ``off-duty'' moment for him; he actively looked for ways that he could  help those around him. His fellow officers recalled one instance when  he gave someone a ride who was pushing a wheelchair loaded with  groceries down a busy road before a big storm.   In 2019, he was named Huntsville Police Department's West Precinct  Officer of the Year, a testament to the respect he had already earned  from his peers, supervisors, and community during his time with the  Tuscaloosa and Huntsville Police Departments.   He is survived by his wife Taylor Campbell Crumby; father William  ``Russ'' Crumby; mother Janet Sherman; grandparents James and Sammi  Sherman; sisters Jennifer Crumby, Courtney Crumby, and Casey Wright  (David); and 10 nieces and nephews.   Alabama is grateful for Officer Crumby's contributions to public  safety. We will never be able to repay him for his sacrifice, but we  will make sure that he is never forgotten.                            ____________________
