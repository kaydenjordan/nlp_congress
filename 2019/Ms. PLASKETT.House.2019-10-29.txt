 Mr. Speaker, this week, the Virgin Islands celebrates  Liberty Day and honors David Hamilton Jackson and his relentless  pursuit of free press for the people of the Virgin Islands.   From the 1700s until the 1950s, the Virgin Islands was owned by  Denmark, which maintained censorship over the press. D. Hamilton  Jackson knew that in order for a people to truly have freedom, the  press must also be free.   Traveling to Denmark to advocate on behalf of the workers of the  Virgin Islands, he took it upon himself to also fight for the  emancipation of the press. His passionate advocacy was fruitful, and  upon his return to the territory, he published the first newspaper in  the Virgin Islands not controlled by the government.   This act empowered the people of the Virgin Islands and opened the  door for generations of Virgin Islanders to allow their voices to be  heard in the formal medium of press.   D. Hamilton Jackson challenged the status quo and the prevailing laws  of his time to secure a future for the islands he loved.   D. Hamilton Jackson used his newfound right for the free press to  create The Herald. As editor, he used that publication to uncover  corruption and educate the working class. Frustrated with neglect from  the Danish Government, Jackson used The Herald to build support for the  transfer of the Virgin Islands from Denmark to the United States.   The American flag that flies over the Virgin Islands today is a fruit  of the seed that D. Hamilton Jackson sowed on his quest for liberty and  greater opportunity for Virgin Islanders.                                time  1030    The Virgin Islands continue to embody the spirit of D. Hamilton  Jackson and his work.   Rena Brodhurst has spent her life walking the path of Jackson as a  champion of Virgin Islands Free Press as the owner and editor of the  St. Croix Avis. Educated on St. Croix and then attending college, she  followed her family's tradition of fighting to defend a free press.   Her father, Mr. Brodhurst, was once convicted of contempt of court  after publishing an unsigned letter critical of a court decision and  social conditions of his time. However, the right to free press  prevailed with the U.S. Third Circuit making clear that the  constitutional right to freedom of speech in the press was not one that  would be infringed upon in the United States.   Rena, herself, has sued the government to protect the right to  publish freely without retribution. A strong woman, mother, and friend,  she acts as a true Virgin Islands queen, unbroken and a fierce defender  of free press.   Today, a new generation steps up to carry the torch of D. Hamilton  Jackson. State of the Territory founder Amaziah George, a Marine Corps  veteran, brings Virgin Islands press to the world through his online  social media paper.   His passion for making the voice and concerns of millennial Virgin  Islanders heard make him a trailblazer of his generation. With his  willingness to speak truth, the secret stories that  [[Page H8547]]  others are unwilling to discuss, this veteran is really a fighter and a  soldier of truth.   These individuals have dedicated themselves to truthfully informing  the people of the Virgin Islands about their community and the world  outside of our small corner of it. They are truly legacies of D.  Hamilton Jackson.   We must continue this work, as Virgin Islanders still have limited  constitutional rights as determined by the Insular Cases of the early  1900s. Those Supreme Court decisions relegate people living within the  territories to a separate and unequal status.   The cases posture that people living in territories are inferior  races that cannot understand Anglo-Saxon principles of law. It keeps  American citizens living in places like the Virgin Islands, Guam, and  Puerto Rico as disenfranchised from the full American experience.   As a young constituent of mine recently wrote in an essay outlining  the importance of free press, ``only a free press can ensure the  people's access to information and build a well-informed, transparent,  and accountable society,'' and that ``we, the people, owe it to our  country to demand and defend the freedom of such a priceless  heritage.''   What a wonderful sentiment from a young person.   Free press, we must cherish and protect it as a most American of  values and as one of the most fragile pillars of democracy here and  around the world.   In the words of D. Hamilton Jackson, I challenge us to walk in his  spirit and challenge the status quo for the betterment of our people  and our Nation. Let us all embody the motto of his newspaper, The  Herald: ``Liberty, equality, fraternity.''                            ____________________
