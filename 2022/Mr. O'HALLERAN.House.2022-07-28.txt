 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  sacrifice of Yavapai County Sheriff Deputy Richard Lopez, who was  killed in the line of duty last month.   I was incredibly humbled to attend Officer Lopez's service, and to  see and feel the outpouring of love and support. I saw right away that  Officer Lopez left an indelible mark on Yavapai County.   Beloved by his community, respected by those he served, and mourned  deeply by his family and his colleagues, I saw right away that he was a  wonderful person.   As a former police officer and homicide investigator, I know that  police work is an incredibly dangerous profession. Any arrest can turn  dangerous in an instant, putting officers and all involved in jeopardy  in a single moment.   We must always keep our brave law enforcement officers and their  families in our thoughts and in our prayers.   Today, I extend my sincerest condolences to Lushana Lopez and their  two children, and to the men and women of the Yavapai County Sheriff's  Department.                            ____________________
