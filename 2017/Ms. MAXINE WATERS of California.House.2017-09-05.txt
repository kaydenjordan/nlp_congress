 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to say a word about Mr. Hultgren, who just  took up the previous bill, H.R. 3110, the Financial Stability Oversight  Council Insurance Member Continuity Act. I enjoyed working with him. It  was a wonderful experience. I think we can do a lot more of that.   Mr. Speaker, having said that, I am pleased to rise today in support  of S. 1616, legislation to award a Congressional Gold Medal to former  Senator Bob Dole in recognition of his distinguished service to the  Nation.   In his younger years, Bob Dole made clear that he truly exemplified  the best of the Nation's Greatest Generation. When his studies were  interrupted by World War II, he enlisted in the United States Army,  where he risked his own life to save a fellow soldier. In recognition  of his brave service, which left him badly wounded by machine-gun fire  and with a permanent disability, he was awarded two Purple Hearts and a  Bronze Star with an Oak Cluster, among other honors.   Following his service in the U.S. Army, Senator Dole began a long and  distinguished career in public office, serving first in the Kansas  House of Representatives, followed by multiple terms in the U.S. House  of Representatives. In 1999, Dole was elected to the United States  Senate, where he served for 27 years and rose to be majority leader  before running for President.   Over the course of his political career, Senator Dole developed a  reputation as an outspoken and pragmatic leader who was willing to work  across party lines to advance the health and welfare of the American  public.   For example, in speaking about the importance of Social Security and  the need to protect Medicare for America's senior citizens, Dole said  in a speech at the 1996 Republican National Convention: ``And I have  learned in my own life, from my own experience, that not every man,  woman, or child can make it on their own. And that in time of need, the  bridge between failure and success can be the government itself. And  given all that I have experienced, I shall always remember those in  need. . . .''   In addition to working to safeguard important programs like Social  Security and Medicare, former Senator Dole was also a strong advocate  for the disabled, and he played a central role in passing the landmark  Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Nation's first  comprehensive civil rights law to protect people with disabilities from  discrimination in employment, public services, and public  accommodations.   Although he was not elected President, as the nominee of the  Republican Party, he made clear that he would not accommodate racial or  religious intolerance, stating that if anyone had ``mistakenly attached  himself to our party in the belief that we are not open to citizens of  every race and religion . . . the exits, which are clearly marked, are  for you to walk out  of. . . .''   After leaving the Senate in 1996, former Senator Dole continued to  dedicate himself to a range of causes, particularly those aimed at  helping those in need. For example, Senator Dole served as co-chair of  the Families of Freedom Scholarship Fund, which raised more than $100  million for the educational needs of the families of victims of 9/11,  and he served as the co-creator of the McGovern-Dole International Food  for Education and Child Nutrition Program, which aimed to alleviate  child hunger.   While Senator Dole and I have had our share of policy differences  over the years, it was always possible to have a civil disagreement  that didn't lead to disrespect. A true gentleman, statesman, and  legislator, Senator Dole could debate the issues with the best of  [[Page H6640]]  us, all while maintaining a good sense of humor.   For all of these reasons, it comes as no surprise that the  legislation before us today has already garnered the unanimous support  of the United States Senate, and it is fitting that the House today is  doing its part to give the highest honor this body can bestow to former  Senator Bob Dole. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in quickly  passing this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to  the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1  minute to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to start off by thanking Representative  Sinema and Representative Hollingsworth for working together to craft  bipartisan legislation that will help smaller public companies raise  the funds necessary to grow and thrive.   Specifically, H.R. 2864, the Improving Access to Capital Act, would  narrowly expand the relief that we provided in the Jumpstart Our  Business Startups Act, the JOBS Act, to allow public companies to raise  money under Regulation A-Plus.   Currently, Regulation A-Plus allows private companies to raise up to  $50 million in capital by selling unregistered but freely tradable  stock to the public as a quicker and less expensive alternative to a  fully registered securities offering.   Extending Regulation A-Plus eligibility to public companies would  provide them with an additional efficient method of raising a small  fixed amount of capital. To be eligible to use this faster and cheaper  fundraising alternative, public companies must be up to date in their  public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.   In addition, public companies must comply with all of the other  regulatory requirements in Regulation A-Plus, including SEC approval or  qualification of the offering, disclosure of the offering information  to investors, and limitations on sales per investor.   Importantly, bad actors who have committed certain felonies,  misdemeanors, or other misconduct within the past 5 years are  disqualified from using Regulation A-Plus.   These restrictions help ensure that investors in Regulation A-Plus  offerings are informed about their purchases and protected from fraud.   Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 2864 for providing targeted relief to  public companies that balances their need to raise capital with the  protection of their investors.                                time  1800    I remain concerned that the Financial Services Committee has adopted  a piecemeal approach to private and public market regulation.   Going forward, I hope that we thoughtfully review the securities laws  to ensure that our legislative efforts appropriately incentivize  companies to become public.   Again, I want to thank the bill's sponsors, especially Ms. Sinema,  for their work on this bipartisan piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R.  2864, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, again, I would like to  thank the cosponsors for their vision, for their work, and for the  bipartisan effort that they so successfully put together.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman  from Arizona (Ms. Sinema), the lead sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the  balance of my time.
