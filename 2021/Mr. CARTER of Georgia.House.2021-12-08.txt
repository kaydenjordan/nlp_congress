 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and ranking  member for bringing this important legislation to the floor. The  Improving the Health for Children Act is up for vote today. It is an  extremely important bill.   As we all know, the National Center on Birth Defects and  Developmental Disabilities does phenomenal work to protect, prevent,  and research birth defects and intellectual disabilities for a wide  range of conditions.   They also provide much needed educational resources to parents and  caregivers about the conditions a child may have, and they work to  raise awareness about conditions that may be hard to identify.   Unfortunately, the center has been operating under an expired  authorization since 2007. We must not forgo our commitment to these  children.   This legislation reaffirms congressional support of the center,  expands their scope to study more conditions, and provides an increase,  per authorization, so that they can continue to carry out the great  work they do.   I want to thank the bipartisan supporters of this legislation for the  help in authoring this bill, Representatives Trahan, Cuellar,  Butterfield, and Hudson, and I urge a ``yes'' vote on passage of this  important legislation today.
