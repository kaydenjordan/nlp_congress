 Madam Speaker, I find myself sort of the oldest freshman in  my class returning after just a 2-year hiatus and finding a House that  I am having a hard time understanding how it got so bad in such a short  period of time.   As my colleague on the other side of the aisle aptly said, we have  had to remove people for cause in this body. When I was a freshman some  20 years ago, we removed Jim Traficant because he had been tried and  convicted and still wouldn't resign.    We have stripped people of their committees when they have been  indicted and ensured that they left this body when they were convicted.   But we have not and should not, in fact, hold people responsible for  actions before the people of their home State elected them and their  Secretary of State certified them, and they came here. In so doing, we  could pick a plethora of people not to seat or not to give committees  to.   On the other side of the aisle, there is a gentleman who I respect  whom I have served with for my entire time in Congress who was  impeached and removed from office by this very body and, yet, has  served honorably here for more than two decades and sits at a high  position on many committees.   After the Civil War, in time, there were people who had been  Confederate soldiers who came here as Congressmen. In fact, the famous  Senator Byrd was a grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan before he was a  member of these bodies.   We cannot and should not judge people by what they have done before  they arrive, and we should not tell the minority who they can seat. You  may shame us, you may disparage us if we give somebody a committee  assignment, but that is part of free speech.  [[Page H343]]    In closing, if we do this, it will be no different than when John  Adams allowed for a Member----         Madam Speaker, when a member of this body was incarcerated  for something that John Adams felt was injurious to him under the  Sedition Act, it was retroactive. He had written it before the act was  passed and the act was, in fact, not in keeping with our free speech.
