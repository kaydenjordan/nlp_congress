 Mr. Speaker, we respect every single officer who has  died in the line of duty.   The question is: Why don't you respect those Black and Latino  individuals who were shot in the back, choked to death, beaten nearly  unconscious, or have a knee to the neck, strangling the life out of  them for 8 minutes and 46 seconds? Why don't you respect them?   That is what the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act is all about.   We respect police officers, those who protect and serve; but we have  a challenge with police violence, police brutality. The police abuse of  force cannot be denied, video after video after video. Don't believe  us, believe your own eyes.   Thirty years ago, Rodney King was beaten on this very day, and we  thought it would be different. But 30 years later, nothing has changed  in terms of accountability and reining in those officers who cross the  line.   It is time to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, and do  it now.
