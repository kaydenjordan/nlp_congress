 Madam Speaker, in all of our bills, virtually all the  money goes to bandage the economic wounds. We need a greater focus on  beating the disease. Workers need paid sick days so they will stay home  if they are sick, even if they work for an employer with under 50 or  over 500 employees.   The Defense Production Act needs to be amended so it can provide for  the licensing of new technology, and inventors need to be well  compensated if they invent something useful to attack the COVID virus.   We have provided money for testing, but only one-quarter of 1 percent  of the money we provide in this bill or prior bills has gone for  therapeutics, prophylaxes, and vaccines.   The clinical medical researchers of this country are sitting at home,  because virtually all non-COVID medical research has been suspended.  Let's put them to work. Let's learn more of the basic facts of COVID,  and let's test every reasonable combination of generic compounds at  every stage of the disease.   Yes, for a while, we can bind our economic wounds, but ultimately, we  need to beat the disease.
