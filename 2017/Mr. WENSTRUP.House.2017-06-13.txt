 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding, and I  appreciate the opportunity to talk about this.   You know, as a physician, we take an oath. We say: Do no harm.   And today in America and here in Washington, D.C., we are debating  physician-assisted suicide, where we are authorizing physicians to take  someone's life--to assist in taking someone's life. To me, this  undermines the very thing that healthcare is all about.   Who is most affected in this situation?   Our most vulnerable citizens: the disabled and the poor.   As a doctor, I can tell you, what has always been in my heart is this  is about care and about comfort, and those are our priorities.   Physician-assisted suicide does not provide comfort. It merely ends  life.   In Washington, D.C., a doctor can decide that you may be going to die  within 6 months if you have a terminal disease--a terminal disease if  you are untreated. Many terminal diseases would be terminal if they are  not treated. With that, the doctor can write a prescription. There is  no tracking of that prescription once it is given and there is no  witness of the patient taking this prescription. They can simply go  home to die alone.    In one State where there is physician-assisted suicide, they have had  an increase in suicides outside of physician-assisted suicides. I think  that what we are saying to too many people is: You are not needed.   Again, this undermines what I think we are all about and what  healthcare should be all about.   I think of the movie, ``It's a Wonderful Life,'' which so many people  watch every Christmastime. Mr. Potter says to George Bailey: ``George,  you are worth more dead than alive.''   Is that really who we want to be?   As a resident in Chicago in the 1980s, one of our responsibilities  was to do physical exams on everyone admitted to the hospital  regardless of what they were admitted for. I can remember a doctor  coming up to me and saying: We just admitted our first AIDS patient,  but you don't have to go see him.   And this is a time when people didn't know what was going on, what  was causing this, how it was being spread. And I thought that was wrong  and I went in anyway to examine this patient. I had to go in like it  was a lunar landing because there was so much uncertainty about what  was causing death to so many people. This patient was very sick. I  learned so much from this one patient because there were so many things  wrong, but it didn't compare to what I learned when I finished that  exam and he looked at me and said: You just examined me more than  anyone.                                time  1715    I have never forgotten, throughout my entire medical career, the  value of human life and what it must feel like to be discarded. He died  the next day. I still know his name. And he taught me a valuable lesson  on his very last day of life: Healthcare is about cures, it is about  caring, it is about compassion, and society should be about the same  thing, and the ideal that every person has value until their very last  breath.   I am pleased to say that the President's budget addresses this issue,  and we will, too, here in the House because you and your loved ones  matter.
