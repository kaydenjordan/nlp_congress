 Madam President, over a storied 50-year career, Sabra  Field has established herself as a great Vermont artist. Her works have  made hers a unique and highly sought-after brand, one which beautifully  depicts Vermont's landscape. Her prints, made by hand using woodblocks,  are a premier example of how Vermonters harbor a deep commitment to  creating and providing high-quality goods, made with passion. Her work  has promoted Vermont, and I could not be more proud to recognize this  acclaimed artist.   Sabra enrolled at Middlebury College in 1953, where she was inspired  by Piero della Francesca's painting ``The Flagellation of Christ.'' One  of her instructors instilled a belief within her that, in her words,  made art ``seem like a noble calling.'' Sabra has followed this calling  over the last 50-years, creating beautiful works of art that portray  Vermont's landscapes. Born in Oklahoma and raised in neighboring New  York, Sabra believes that her professional career began when she moved  to Vermont. She recalled in a Vermont Digger article that ``Vermont was  beautiful and Vermonters unpretentious, generous, and understood `home  occupation.' I was free to be me.'' This environment made Vermont an  ideal work and home location for Sabra.   Sabra's achievements are impressive. Her work has been featured on  the cover of Vermont Life magazine. It is showcased in a stained glass  window at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in New Hampshire. It has  been printed on 250,000 UNICEF Cards. And Sabra's work was featured on  60 million postage stamps commemorating Vermont's 1991 bicentennial.  Sabra's work has gained popularity far and wide over the last five  decades. Marcelle and I have several of her prints in our home as well.   I am proud to recognize the contribution and achievements that Sabra  has made over her 50 years in Vermont. I ask unanimous consent to have  printed in the Record a Vermont Digger article titled ``Sabra Field  marks 50th year making Vermont Art.'' It describes the hard work that  goes into making each piece of art and highlights Field's commitment to  capturing Vermont's picturesque landscape.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the Vermont Digger, July 7, 2019]               Sabra Field Marks 50th Year Making Vermont Art                            (By Kevin O'Connor)         East Barnard.--Sabra Field recalls the moment a half-      century ago when she made her first woodblock print in       Vermont.        ``No one said I couldn't,'' she says, ``and I was too naive       to realize the odds.''        The Oklahoma-born and New York-raised artist didn't know       her ink-on-paper images of red barns, green hills and blue       skies would land on the cover of Vermont Life magazine, an       annual namesake calendar, a stained glass window at       neighboring New Hampshire's Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical       Center, 250,000 UNICEF cards and 60 million postage stamps       commemorating Vermont's 1991 bicentennial.        This coming weekend, the 84-year-old printmaker will       celebrate her 50th year making iconic Vermont art.        ``When people ask what piece means the most to me,'' she       says, ``I answer, `The one I'm going to do next.' ''        Field's Green Mountain story began in 1953 when she       enrolled at Middlebury College (``there was no math       requirement,'' she explains) and had an epiphany while       studying Piero della Francesca's 1450s painting ``The       Flagellation of Christ.''        ``I saw that great art is composed from what we see,'' she       recalls, ``but it is not a replica of what we see.''        Field's watercolor teacher made art ``seem like a noble       calling.'' But she yearned less for a brush than for       woodblocks, which she discovered upon further schooling at       Connecticut's Wesleyan University.        ``Prints are for everybody,'' she says of the easily       reproducible medium. ``I wanted to spend all my time making       images and I was willing to take the risk. I felt, in a       sense, that I had no choice.''        ``Over the course of her career she has received any number       of accolades, and has been variously described as `the Grant       Wood of Vermont,' `the artist laureate of Vermont,' and as       someone who `has touched more lives than any Vermont artist       in history,' '' Richard Saunders, a Middlebury College       professor and director of its Museum of Art, wrote in the       catalogue of the 2017 retrospective ``Sabra Field, Then and       Now.''  [[Page S5185]]         Yet every peak in this artist's world is framed by valleys.       The mother of two young sons moved from Connecticut to a       former 19th-century tavern in the White River valley village       of East Barnard after her first marriage ended in 1969.        ``When I arrived, people were unsure,'' she recalls. ``Is       she just here for the summer?''        Field soon contacted the secretary of state's office to       register a printmaking business.        ``Somehow I knew I wanted the legitimacy of being       validated.''        Tallying initial sales on her children's toy cash register,       Field began to design, draw and cut the woodblock images that       have sustained her ever since.        ``My life as a professional artist really didn't begin       until I moved,'' she says. ``Vermont was beautiful and       Vermonters unpretentious, generous, and understood `home       occupation.' I was free to be me.''        Field soon met her second husband, Spencer, who became her       business manager. But her work wasn't always seen as       marketable. Take the story behind her 1977 four-print       ``Mountain Suite.''        ``Vermont Life requested a seasonal suite to sell,'' she       recalls. ``Then they declined to buy them.''        The artist went on to distribute the images herself. The       magazine has since folded. But log onto her website and       you'll see the passed-over prints remain in circulation for       $250 each.        Field's resulting career has been chronicled in two books--      2002's ``The Art of Place'' and 2004's ``In Sight''--and the       2015 documentary ``Sabra.'' Middlebury College, for its part,       has an archive copy of every one of her prints.        Field can share stories of private struggle as well as of       professional success. She rewinds back five decades to inking       her first works.        ``I hung them outside to dry.''        The wind wasn't the only thing that got carried away that       day.        Field has weathered bigger changes ranging from the advent       of new reproduction technology for the prints she continues       to create by hand to the 2010 death of her husband. Now       assisted by fellow printmaker and neighbor Jeanne Amato, she       still works with woodblocks, be it for a recent children's       book ``Where Do They Go?'' with Addison County writer Julia       Alvarez or a coming nine-piece suite of prints she conceived       after President Donald Trump's election.        ``I decided we needed to look at it as a challenge and we       couldn't let him manipulate our emotions,'' she says of the       Trump-inspired prints. As for exactly what they picture, she       adds only: ``They will be somewhat mysterious. But when you       get it, you get it.''        Field is marking her 50th year in Vermont with a special       poster and open house at her East Barnard studio July 13 and       14 from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., with more information available on       her website.        ``The career highs that sustain me are not glamorous by the       standards of the wider world, but they confirm that I made       the right decision and that this wonderful place is home,''       she says. ``I've never fallen out of love with my medium. I       couldn't be happy otherwise.''                            ____________________     Madam President, White River Junction, VT, has seen a  renaissance over the last 20 years. Led by a band of female  entrepreneurs, this village tucked along the Connecticut River is today  the home of dozens of thriving businesses. No fewer than 25 of these  business are run by women, and together they are the core of a vibrant,  growing community.   Kim Souza, the owner of the consignment store Revolution, was one of  the first business owners to move back to White River Junction. The  first few years were tough, but with the support of her community,  Revolution found its footing. Soon more businesses opened, and new life  was breathed into the town.   Across the street, Julie Sumanis and Elenda Taylor opened JUEL, a  juice bar and cafe, in the ground floor of a new apartment building. In  2008, Leslie Carleton moved from nearby Norwich to open Upper Valley  Yoga. Seven years later, Kate Gamble opened Open Door, another yoga  studio.   The successes of these businesses did not come without challenges and  difficulties, but their successes showcase the power of bold ideas,  commitment, dedication, and, ultimately, community. In 2007, Kim  thought Revolution would have to close its doors, until she found the  backing of a local mother and daughter that allowed her to stay open.  Catherine Doherty, the producing director of White River's Northern  Stage theatre company, credits the community's support for keeping the  company alive through challenging times.   Today, White River Junction has become a destination and a cultural  center of the region. The surge of development brought on by pioneers  like Kim continues to bring new people into the town, some feeling  empowered to start businesses of their own, to shape their futures, and  to make the community stronger. This is the very heart of the American  dream. The future of Vermont rests with entrepreneurs across the State,  and I am glad to see it in such capable hands.   I am proud to recognize the achievements of these women and the  contributions they have made to the town of White River Junction and  their broader communities. I ask unanimous consent to enter into the  Record a Boston Globe article titled ``In White River Junction, sisters  are doing it for themselves.'' It describes their successes and the  challenges they overcame in helping to revive their town.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                   [From the Boston Globe, July 4, 2019]        In White River Junction, Sisters are Doing it for Themselves                             (By Kevin Cullen)         White River Junction, VT.--Kim Souza opened her consignment       and thrift clothing store here in 2002, when this old, wheezy       village hard by the New Hampshire border was so deserted you       half-expected to see tumbleweeds rolling down North Main       Street.        She let the locals know that beyond selling new clothing,       she would also sell used stuff and offered to buy gently used       clothes from them.        Dancers at The Wrap, a strip joint directly across the       street from Souza's shop, began showing up regularly with       outrageously high platform shoes and audacious, skimpy       outfits. Souza had to wave them off when the strippers tried       to sell her their thongs.        ``I had to draw the line somewhere,'' Souza said, standing       behind the counter of her store next to an elaborate       cappucino machine.        The Wrap burned to the ground years ago, and in its place       has risen, phoenix-like, a modern apartment building, the       anchor of which is a ground-level cafe, apothecary, and juice       bar called JUEL, after its owners, Julie Sumanis and Elena       Taylor.        The cafe, located on the corner of North Main and Bridge       streets, in the heart of downtown, captures the essence of       the renaissance of this old industrial village: On the same       spot where women were once exploited and objectified, two       young female entrepreneurs are running a thriving business.        Souza, White River's pioneering businesswoman, recently did       some research and figured out that no less than 25 businesses       that have opened in the once-vacant and newly built       storefronts in the four-block downtown area are run by women.        It wasn't planned. It isn't part of some high-minded       government-incentive program. It just happened. Organically.        Souza was working at a travel agency in New Hampshire when       a mentor, Murray Washburn, suggested she start a business in       gritty White River, which is sandwiched in the Upper Valley       between the more genteel locales of Hanover in New Hampshire       and Woodstock in Vermont.        Souza went for it, opening a funky clothing store in what       had been a frame shop for 30 years and called it Revolution,       which was prescient because she started one.        Things were slow at first. After four years, Souza thought       she would have to go out of business. A local woman, Ann       Johnston, and her then-teenage daughter, Simran, loved the       store and were crestfallen when Souza told them she was going       to close up.        ``What would it take to keep Revolution open?'' Ann       Johnston asked.        The answer was financial backing, which Johnston and her       daughter provided, giving new, sustained life to Revolution,       and the revolution of female businesses.        Souza said Leslie Carleton's decision to open Upper Valley       Yoga on North Main Street in 2008 was a pivotal moment.       Carleton's previous studio was in Norwich, a nearby, more       upscale town. Many of Carleton's well-heeled students       followed her, with some trepidation, to White River.        Those mostly female yogis discovered something that Souza       has immortalized on a T-shirt she sells, emblazoned with the       words, ``White River Junction'' on the front, and, on the       back, ``It's not so bad.''        ``When I came to White River Junction,'' Carleton said,       sitting at a table outside JUEL, ``it was still pretty rough.       It was dead on a Sunday morning. The sleazy strip club was       still there. The ATM at the strip club dispensed only $1 and       $5 bills.''        But Carleton hung in there, and other yoga studios have       followed.        Four years ago, Kate Gamble, a physical therapist, opened       Open Door, a one-stop wellness center, offering services       including yoga, physical therapy, acupuncture, and Chinese       medicine. At something she hosts called The Death Cafe, a       hospice nurse helps people ``be more comfortable about end of       life issues,'' Gamble said.        ``This place reminds me of Brooklyn,'' Gamble said. ``It       was a dump, but a lot of people with energy and new ideas       have moved in and changed things.''        Carleton harbors a nagging worry that it might become too       much like Brooklyn, with rents soaring and inventory drying       up.  [[Page S5186]]         But given what White River Junction looked like and felt       like not so long ago, the pros seem to far outweigh the cons,       and officials in the town of Hartford, where White River is       located, are thrilled with all the new businesses and tax       revenue.        And as freight trains roll through the downtown regularly,       blowing their horns, White River is not in danger of becoming       precious or pretentious any time soon. It retains a chunk of       its old grittiness.        Taylor, 37, and Sumanis, 31, became fast friends when they       worked as waitresses at Elixir, an upscale restaurant here.       They had a shared interest in wellness, herbalism, and eating       healthy. More importantly, their bosses, Skip Symanski and       Jane Carrier, had set an example.        When Symanski and Carrier opened a high-end restaurant here       10 years ago, people thought they were nuts. But Taylor and       Sumanis learned that if you build a quality business, the       people will come. It gave them the gumption to strike out on       their own. Three years ago, they started with a food truck.       When space became available in a new building, they went all       in.        ``Elixir paved the way for a lot of us,'' Sumanis said.        They also point to Souza as a nurturing maternal figure to       younger entrepreneurs.        Souza gives credit to the male developers who remade the       town's footprint, but agrees there is a mutually supportive       business climate that has an especially feminine side to it.        ``Women are by nature nurturing,'' she said. ``There is a       lot of mutual support and encouragement going on here.''        Given that they both offer yoga classes, Carleton and       Gamble are technically competitors. But they routinely send       customers to each other's business, depending on what those       customers want and need.        ``Everybody has each other's back,'' said Taylor, who has       given spare keys for JUEL to Gamble and Souza, whose       businesses are right across North Main.        There are downsides to all this progress and prosperity.       You used to be able to park an aircraft carrier along North       Main Street. Now they limit free parking to two hours between       7 a.m. and 7 p.m., from Monday to Saturday. Things can get       tight, especially on weekends.        And, this being Vermont, there are some who decry what they       dismiss as gentrification.        A local blogger, Rejjie Carter, bemoaned what he calls the       colonization of White River Junction, writing that the land       where it sits belonged to the Abenaki tribe before settlers       showed up, and that landlords are now cashing in and driving       out poorer residents.        ``Colonialism, capitalism, and private property are the       enemies,'' Carter wrote.        Like I said, this is Vermont.        Souza, who is a town selectboard member and committed to       many social justice causes, bristles at characterizing what       has happened here as gentrification.        ``When women are opening businesses in a defunct town, it's       less about money and power and more about care and       community,'' she said. ``Gentrification happens when people       are displaced. There were no people in White River Junction       when developers like Matt Bucy, Mike Davidson, and Bill       Bittinger came along. Almost every single one of the old       empty buildings they rehabbed or the new buildings they       erected in vacant lots added affordable living space to our       community.''        Two months ago, a teacher from the Hartford public schools       brought a bunch of students on a field trip to visit some of       the female-run businesses.        ``It was a joy to listen to so many of the young girls ask       questions about how to start a business,'' said Souza. ``It       felt like something was happening.''                            ____________________     Madam President, when Lincoln, VT, resident Tom Verner  performs magic shows for children in refugee camps, orphanages, and  hospitals, he brings joy and laughter to the places where it is most  needed. In 2002, Tom and his wife, Janet Fredericks, cofounded  Magicians Without Borders and have since performed in more than 40  countries, for more than 1,000,000 of the world's most vulnerable  people. Magicians Without Borders is one shining example of Vermonters  thinking outside the box and using their creativity to make the world a  better place. It is with pride and appreciation that I recognize Tom,  Janet and the Magicians Without Borders organization for their  achievements.   Tom was a professor of psychology in 2001 when he embarked on a trip  through the Balkans, performing magic shows in the refugee camps of  Kosovo and Macedonia. The performances were so well received that, upon  returning to Vermont, Tom took a year off from his position at  Burlington College to found Magicians Without Borders.   Since Tom's first trip, he and Janet have made six trips each year,  continuing to use magic to transform the lives of youth in at risk  situations around the globe. Tom, Janet, and Magicians Without Borders  have performed everywhere from the Sudan, to Colombia, from Ukraine to  Bangladesh. They traveled to Thailand and Burma for a month of  performances in the wake of a tsunami and performed stateside  throughout Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina.   In 2004, a series of shows at rural schools in El Salvador was met  with such positivity that Tom was asked to teach a few magic tricks to  the students. These impromptu classes turned into a unique, long-term  education program geared toward increasing self-confidence, discipline,  focus, and self-esteem. Tom, Janet, and Magicians Without Borders have  now returned to El Salvador more than 30 times to entertain and educate  these children who find themselves surrounded by terrible gang violence  and abject poverty. The program has inspired young Salvadoran magicians  to perform their own magic shows in orphanages, hospitals, and disaster  areas and aspire to teach magic to other young people.   Due to their success in El Salvador, Magicians Without Borders  expanded these education programs to Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, and  the United States. Two additional education programs have been  implemented in India.   I am proud to recognize the contributions that Tom, Janet, and  Magicians Without Borders have made me so many communities across globe  in the last 18 years. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the  Record an Addison Independent article titled ``Lincoln Magicians Bring  Joy to Refugees at the Border.'' It describes how Tom and Janet use  magic to connect with those suffering at our southern border and how  they have expanded their mission to entertain, educate and empower  across the world.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                [From the Addison Independent, July 3, 2019]           Lincoln Magicians Bring Joy to Refugees at the Border         Lincoln.--Tom Verner and Janet Fredericks performed magic       at the U.S.-Mexico border last December.        Not the kind of magic that allows tired, hungry and fearful       refugees to simply waltz across the border to new lives in       America. The Lincoln couple, working as Magicians Without       Borders, staged a show of sleights-of-hand and humor designed       to not only entertain, but also to provide a light of hope in       dark circumstances.        Since that December trip, U.S. Customs and Border       Protection has encountered more than half a million       additional migrants hoping to enter the U.S. The vast       majority of these refugees were arrested and detained by       Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in facilities that       a growing number of experts, including Holocaust scholars,       have compared to concentration camps.        Performing at the border last year, and again this past       March, has helped Verner and Fredericks better understand the       issues there.        ``These refugees didn't want to leave their homes,'' Verner       told the Independent this week. ``They're fleeing murderous       violence, political oppression and grinding poverty, and       they're coming to the closest place where, as the Statue of       Liberty says, they can `breathe free.' ''        During their March trip, Verner and Fredericks met a six-      year-old boy named Sebastian, whose family had fled Honduras.       Because Sebastian has cerebral palsy and cannot walk, his       father had carried him on his back--for more than 1,800       miles.        The conditions and political climate of the U.S. border are       nothing, however, compared with those in Honduras,       Sebastian's father told Verner.        It's the kind of story the Lincoln residents have       encountered over and over again--all over the world.        Since founding Magicians Without Borders in 2002, Verner       and Fredericks have traveled to more than 40 countries and       performed for ``over 1 million of the most forgotten people       in the world.''        Their mission is to entertain, educate and empower.                                  BEGINNINGS         In 2001 Verner, then a professor of psychology at       Burlington College, was traveling through the Balkans,       performing magic shows in refugee camps in Kosovo and       Macedonia.        ``It was a transformative experience,'' he said.        In one Macedonian camp, which sheltered about 2,000 people,       mostly Roma, Verner met a little girl named Fatima who became       his ``assistant'' for the day.        ``We couldn't understand each other's languages, but we       understood each other,'' Verner said. When it came time for       Verner to move on to the next camp, however, he could not       find Fatima to say good-bye. Disappointed, he returned to his       car, only to find Fatima hiding in the back seat. She  [[Page S5187]]       begged Verner to take her with him, but he could not.        Verner's driver then suggested they visit Shutka,       Macedonia, which the driver said was ``swollen with       refugees.'' Within 10 minutes of their arrival in the main       square more than 300 people had gathered to watch him       perform, Verner said.        Afterward, he recalled, ``a Roma woman who'd seen me       multiplying things in my show, came up to me holding a five-      dinari Macedonian coin. `Make more money,' she said. She       thought if I could make things multiply, why not money?''        Verner performed a trick producing a 50-dinari coin--the       equivalent of about 80 cents at the time--and the woman was       genuinely thrilled.        After she walked away, two Roma men who'd been watching       asked Verner if he could produce visas to America.        ``They were completely serious,'' Verner said. ``As if I       could wave a magic wand and Condoleezza Rice would suddenly       sign the necessary paperwork.''        These and other encounters led to an epiphany for Verner,       which he distills into a quote from fellow magician Harry       Houdini--himself a refugee from Hungary:        ``In certain circumstances, magic not only amazes and       amuses but it has the power to awaken hope that the       impossible is possible.''        Upon his return to Vermont, Verner obtained a year's leave       from Burlington College to found Magicians Without Borders.        ``That one year has turned into 18,'' he said happily.                                TEACHING MAGIC         In 2004, Magicians Without Borders        (MWB) visited El Salvador, which was still reeling in the       aftermath of a 12-year civil war that had been fought in       large part by child soldiers.        The founder-director of the Salvadoran Rural Health       Association was so impressed with Verner's school       performances that she asked him to teach some magic tricks to       children participating in a program called ``Barefoot       Angels'' (so named because many of the children had been       working barefoot in a garbage dump). Verner readily agreed.        At the end of that daylong workshop, one of the students,       14-year-old Jaime Zumba, asked, ``When are you coming back?''       Verner, who had had no return plans, hesitated, then said,       ``How about May?''        That moment, Verner said, changed the course of MWB. Since       then he's visited El Salvador more than 30 times.        Soon, some of the children wanted to do more than just       learn a few magic tricks. They were aspiring to teach it to       other children. As a result, MWB now has programs in Brazil,       Colombia, El Salvador and Costa Rica.        Two more programs have evolved in India, as well--one at a       night-care shelter for the children of brothel workers who       are trapped in the sex trade.        ``These were children who had been sleeping under mom's bed       while she was working,'' Verner recalled soberly.        That program's Hindi name, Prerana, translates into English       as ``Inspiration.''                                    DREAMS         ``We're not trying to teach them to be magicians,'' Verner       said. ``We're trying to build their confidence in themselves.       What happens is that these kids start studying and       performing, and something starts to happen, you start to see       all these benefits. It awakens dreams.''        Verner spoke of children who've gone on to pursue studies       in nursing, culinary arts and social work.        None of this would have been possible, however, without the       generous support Verner and Fredericks have received over the       years, both abroad and at home.        In the coming weeks, for instance, allies of MWB have       scheduled two fundraising events at Bixby Library in       Vergennes, which they hope will help fund another trip to the       U.S.-Mexico border in August.        Magicians Without Borders will perform for children at the       Bixby on July 25, from 6:30 to 8 p.m., then give a brief talk       about their work.        An event on Aug. 1, from 7 to 8:30 p.m., will be geared       toward adults: travel stories and performance history, with       some magic woven in.        Verner hopes MWB can make multiple trips to the border in       the future, in part because he knows what's at stake. After       all, even his own sources of hope and inspiration have       emerged from deeply, shockingly tragic circumstances.        Jaime Zumba's enthusiasm in El Salvador 15 years ago may       have changed the course of MWB, but the young man's lived       experience, like that of so many thousands who have fled       their homes, is all too familiar in that part of the world       and often inspires too little notice.        ``It is not uncommon,'' he once told Verner, ``for me to       walk over a decapitated naked body on my way to school.''                            ____________________     Mr. President, earlier this month, fans across the  country--and around the world--watched as the U.S. Women's National  Team made history, winning its second consecutive World Cup title, and  fourth title overall. The players, coaches, and support staff of the  Women's National Team are role models to athletes young and old, male  and female. They played through the tournament with the tenacity,  skill, and commitment that is the hallmark of any champion.   These women--world class athletes--have consistently demonstrated  their dedication to excelling in the sport and to representing our  nation on the world stage. Their success on the soccer field is  remarkable in itself, but many of these women have used their voices to  speak out and speak up against a glaring disparity that disadvantages  them, and countless women across our country and around the world:  equal pay.   This is not a new issue, and it's shameful that it is one that has  not been rectified. What the players of the U.S. women's soccer team  want is pretty simple: to be treated no different than their  counterparts on the men's team. Earlier this year, the players filed a  lawsuit against the U.S. Soccer Federation, arguing that disparities in  pay between the men's and women's teams constitute discrimination on  the basis of gender. But even if this lawsuit improves U.S. Soccer pay  practices, much of the pay disparity will remain, due to policies of  the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA). For  example, FIFA awarded $38 million to the winner of the 2018 Men's World  Cup, but will award only $4 million to the U.S. women's team for their  win this year. Men's teams also earn more from FIFA for losing a World  Cup qualifying game than women's teams earn for winning all of them and  becoming world champions.   Today I am reintroducing a resolution that I first introduced in  2015, after the U.S. Women's National Team won its third World Cup.  This is a simple, straightforward, and commonsense resolution. I am  calling on FIFA to immediately eliminate gender pay inequity and treat  all athletes with the same respect and dignity, regardless of gender.  Yet in 2015, Senate Republicans  [[Page S5201]]  inexplicably objected to its adoption. I'm still waiting for an  explanation as to why.   I'm proud that this resolution is cosponsored by Senators Sheldon  Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Richard Durbin (D-Ill.),  Mazie Hirano (D-Hawaii), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Robert Menendez  (D-N.J.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Richard  Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Tom Carper (D-Del.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Chris  Van Hollen (D-Md.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Edward Markey (D-Mass.),  Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Maria Cantwell  (D-Wash.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Jon  Tester (D-Mont.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), and  Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.).   Equal pay for equal work should not be a political football. All  women, including the women of the U.S. National Team, deserve to be  paid for the job they do, not based on their gender. Equal pay should  not still be up for debate in 2019.   When time expired on the game clock during the World Cup championship  game, chants of ``Equal Pay!'' echoed throughout the stadium in France.  I am proud to join in that chorus today.                            ____________________
