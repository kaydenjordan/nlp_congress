 Madam Speaker, I rise today to share my concern for  the extraordinary lengths that my colleagues across the aisle will go  in order to rip away a chance at life from unborn children.   H.R. 8297, the Ensuring Access to Abortion Act, is a deceptive ploy  to circumvent the authority of States to set their own laws about  abortion procedures or, more plainly, the procedures that violently end  an unborn child's life.   On June 24, the Nation received historical news from the highest  court in the land that Roe v. Wade had been overturned. This decision  was an answer to nearly 50 years of prayer and a decision that rights a  wrong that was committed in the very same court almost half a century  ago.   The Supreme Court ruling verified that our Constitution gives no  protections for abortion procedures. Abortion was never a  constitutional right, and that has been the big lie to millions of  women for the past 50 years. It was determined that this decision  should not be mandated by Washington but chosen by the people through  their State legislatures.   The Ensuring Access to Abortion Act is not only a blatant attempt to  undermine State sovereignty; it also opens the door to incredibly  dangerous consequences.   For one, the bill would restrict enforcement of State laws that  require physicians to be present when chemical abortions are  administered. This supervision is a safety measure to ensure that a  patient does not have an ectopic pregnancy, which could lead to fatal  consequences.   The primary pillar of the pro-life movement is that all life is  precious. We must consider the health implications of women who receive  an abortion or partial procedure across State lines and return to their  home State in need of dire medical attention.   Women who have abortion procedures face a myriad of increased risks  that can occur later. Sterilization, miscarriage, and tubal pregnancies  are not uncommon.   Are we to assume that the responsibility for treatment of these  subsequent health risks falls on the State whose laws were  circumvented? Because that is what would ultimately happen.   And as a woman in Congress, I urge my colleagues to look at how this  legislation puts at-risk minors and women in vulnerable positions. The  language in this bill is so vague that it makes no consideration for  abusers, those abusers that transport minors across State lines to  receive abortions after their abuse.   We can't afford to be vague and allow blanket protection for anyone  assisting in an abortion. We cannot be that naive, especially when  these procedures have life and death consequences.                                time  1115    To be clear, not a single State has banned interstate travel for  women seeking abortion. This bill isn't about protecting women from the  State; it is about dramatically restricting States from protecting  their citizens and forcing pro-life States to absorb the burden of  safety complications that follow the superseding of their protective  measures.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to think about the damaging  consequences.    Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to think  about the damaging consequences of taking power from the States. Not  only does it set a dangerous precedent of Federal overreach and taking  power from the people, but it also has terrifying health implications  for expectant mothers and at-risk youth, and the protection of bad  actors.   I will always be a steadfast defender of an unborn child's right to  live, and I will never back down from a fight to protect women and  those unborn children. We cannot put both at risk with this damaging  legislation.
