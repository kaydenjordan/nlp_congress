 Mr. President, on January 20, the world watched as we  inaugurated the 46th President of the United States on the west front  of the Capitol, as we have done now for the last four decades. But this  was the 59th time in our Nation's history that we have gathered to  witness one of what has really become one of our most iconic and sacred  ceremonies. I described it that day, as President Reagan did 40 years  earlier, as ``commonplace and miraculous.'' Commonplace because we have  done it every 4 years since 1789; miraculous because we have done it  every 4 years since 1789.   This is the second time I have had the privilege to serve as the  chairman of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies  or, as it is normally known, JCCIC, and that is how I will refer to it  in the rest of these remarks. Senator Klobuchar, the ranking member at  that time on the Rules Committee, was a big part of helping with that,  as were the other four members of that committee.   In a normal year, organizing an inauguration is a major undertaking,  but when you add a pandemic and then you add the events of January 6,  it is uniquely challenging. Without a doubt, this was an inauguration  of twists and turns, where adaptability, creativity, and determination  were crucial.   Today, I am here on the floor to thank the staff, the partners, and  the volunteers who met those challenges and made this year's  inauguration a success.   As I mentioned earlier, the two factors that posed the greatest  challenges this year were the pandemic and security. In order to keep  the inauguration from becoming a superspreader event, we consulted with  public health authorities at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health  Security and the Cleveland Clinic. We engaged experts from the National  Football League, the Major League Baseball, NASCAR, the National Hockey  League, Disney, Ardian Group, and CLEAR about pandemic protocols and  technology that relates to them.   We were in regular consultation with the Office of the Attending  Physician, particularly Dr. Monahan and his chief of staff, Keith Pray.  And we relied on support from the Defense Health Agency and the  Department of Health and Human Services' COVID-19 Joint Command Cell.  Testing was required for all attendees, and over 7,000 tests were  administered at two sites, one in the Capitol and one in the Pentagon.   Masks were required to be worn by all attendees. Graciously, Ford  Motor Company produced a significant quantity of masks, truly a first  for this or any inauguration, and we are grateful to them, and 3M  provided some specialized masks for the limited indoor activities that  we had.   The health and safety measures put together really created  significant logistical challenges. All of this couldn't have been done  without the leadership of Robin Mangan, our director of operations for  that health activity and that testing activity. Her team,  [[Page S879]]  Dr. Alex Lazar, who was on sabbatical from MD Anderson; Jordan Wilson  was with us from  Rob Wittman's office; Shannon Ryder, detailed from  the Capitol Police Office of Emergency Management to help with that  part of what we did.   Security is always the foremost consideration for an inauguration. It  is a time of great exposure, frankly, for our democracy and our  Nation's leaders.   And, as I said earlier, just 2 weeks earlier, the inaugural platform  itself had been stormed and damaged. The officers who fought valiantly  that day to protect the Capitol were also in charge, 2 weeks later,  with keeping the inauguration safe. And while carrying the burden of  the events of January 6, the U.S. Capitol Police officers, with the  assistance of the National Guard, ensured that the inauguration was  secure and that the events of the day would occur without interruption.   Our committee's Capitol Police liaison, Lieutenant Jillian Jeffers,  seamlessl coordinated the work of the JCCIC and the department's  Inaugural Task Force. I want to thank Lieutenant Jeffers, the U.S.  Capitol Police, and the Inaugural Task Force, along with the National  Guard, and the entire Executive Steering Committee, and law enforcement  elements of this National Special Security Event for maintaining the  security of the Capitol Complex during the inauguration.    Because COVID significantly limited in-person participation, we had  to put a particular emphasis on ensuring that people at home could also  experience the inauguration. I believe we succeeded. Viewers of the  59th Inaugural Ceremonies totaled more than 108 million people. The  enhanced viewing experience provided by JCCIC was viewed by more than  75 million people across social media platforms and the committee's  website. This was more than double--surprising to me, at least--the  viewership of the traditional national television news broadcast, which  tallied about 33.8 million people. In addition, the JCCIC was able to  generate 5.2 million individual impressions on Twitter, making it one  of the bigger Twitter events ever.   One of the most well-received aspects of the JCCIC production was the  narration provided by two Capitol Visitor Center guides, Janet Clemens  and Ronn Jackson, who described the various events through the day,  offering viewers a behind-the-scenes experience that only somebody who  spent day after day totally understanding the Capitol Building could  have done.   We appreciate the technical expertise and the creative insights  offered us by industry professionals, like Gorilla Flicks and Razor  Management, Showcall, Castle Technologies, and TRI Leadership  Resources. All of those groups came together to help give us advice and  assistance.   I want to especially thank Paige Waltz, the JCCIC's communications  director. Paige was on loan from Senator Romney, and her vigorous  efforts to overhaul the JCCIC brand and the website and to realize  innovative ways to make our ceremonies more inclusive for Americans and  viewers around the world really paid off on inaugural day. I think we  can all agree that Paige and her team--Spring Binsted, Corinna Schutte,  Channing Foster, and Matthew Mondello--outshined any expectations  anybody would have had for what we were able to get across in this  different kind of Inauguration Day.   There was much to be seen on what we call ``I-Day,'' as the staff  called it, and there is so much that we didn't get a chance to see. The  staff worked tirelessly in the background. That is the work we didn't  see--the months for some, weeks for others--to make the inaugural  presentation seem like it was basically effortless, even though there  was incredible effort.   Jen Jett, on loan from Senator Wicker's office, was our director of  administration and kept a master timeline, a lengthy document and  intricate task that allowed the President to be sworn in before noon,  as required by the 20th Amendment to the Constitution. We all watched  President Biden take the oath of office at 11:48.   Jen was ably assisted by Abby Stahl, who was the first to greet you  when you called or visited the JCCIC offices, as we made preparations  for this inauguration.   Todd Beyer, our director of advance, made certain we all knew where  to be and when to be there through all the ceremonies of the day.  Jackson Blodgett skillfully supported those advanced efforts and  facilitated an immense undertaking of credentialed access.   Grace Higgins, hired to support our alternative plans for inclement  weather, instead became responsible for successfully managing a complex  technical solution and the integration of elaborate health screening  processes to ensure everyone's health safety.   Sam Burke, most recently a Marine Corps Senate liaison officer,  served as the JCCIC's operation manager and military liaison, where he  worked closely with the joint task force officials from the military  district of Washington, who also played an incredibly instrumental role  on that day.   Martha Scott Poindexter, now the Republican staff director of the  Senate Agriculture Committee, served as our director of member services  and ticketed and was responsible for assisting Senators,  Representatives, Governors, foreign dignitaries, former Presidents, and  former Members, frankly, as only she can, through the complexities of  participating in this year's ceremonies.   Volunteers manager, Molly Harris Stevens, who was on loan from  Representative Stauber, and Vincent Brown, on loan from Senator  Klobuchar's Rules staff, recruited and managed 278 essential volunteers  over months of unacknowledged tasks. Molly also helped design and  implement a brandnew and seamless integration of our health and  security operation, fielded by our volunteers.   Without the volunteers, an inauguration would not be able to be  carried out. We want to thank each of them, and the names of each of  them I would like to be printed in the Record.   I ask unanimous consent that those names be printed in the Record   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                             List of Volunteers         Alexis Alavi, Hannah Albert, Bre Allen, Connor Allison,       Alexis Anderson, Nina Andrews, Chelsea Angelo, Jonathan       Aquino, Miguel Argueta, Hector Arias, Mauricio Armaza,       Anourath Arounlangsy, Abby Atkins, Shallum Atkinson, Molly       Austin, Adam Axler, Shahryar Baig, Scott Balough, Jake Barr,       Laura Bart, Alec Bartishevich, Andres Bascumbe, Amanda       Beaumont, Stewart James Becker, Jenna Behringer, Auburn Bell.

While the JCCIC had to make the difficult decision to  forgo a traditional congressional luncheon this year, we are grateful  to partners like Korbel, Lenox, and the Smithsonian American Art Museum  for working so closely with us on planning.   Emily Kearney, the first person hired by the JCCIC, who early on  worked with our partners at the Government Printing Office to design  the tickets, invitations, and programs, is certainly to be commended  for her work and to later coordinate and maintain the tradition of  gifts presented to the President and Vice President in the Capitol  Rotunda.   Lauren McBride, detailed from the House Sergeant at Arms to manage  our exercises and rehearsals, expertly led our JCCIC team and core  partners through a series of new ways to prepare for inclement weather,  and she directed the massive undertaking of the dress rehearsal.   There is also a small group of dedicated staff who returned to  support inauguration after inauguration: Celeste Gold, from Senator  Romney's office; Michelle Reinshuttle, from the House Appropriations  Committee; Tim Mitrovich from the Senate Sergeant at Arms returned to  the JCCIC and once again loaned their experience to benefit the  ceremonies.   Special thanks to Jen Daulby and Tim Monahan, the Republican staff  director and deputy staff director, respectively, of the Committee on  House Administration, for their assistance in the inauguration's  performers and program participants.   I also want to thank the JCCIC staff representatives of our committee  members, my personal staff, and my Rules Committee staff, who, in  addition to their normal duties, were also able to lend their  considerable talents and expertise to the JCCIC.   I especially want to thank Rules Committee staff Fitz Elder, who  served as the dedicated staff director of the JCCIC, overcame the  extraordinary challenges presented to the committee, and was undeniably  paramount in the ultimate success of the ceremonies; Rachelle  Schroeder, deputy staff director; Jackie Barber, chief counsel; Cindy  Qualley, chief clerk; and James Ferenc, director of information  technology.   Cami Morrison, the deputy inaugural coordinator, was once again  responsible for the organization of the Presidential platform. She  seated every single person in attendance and made certain we were 6  feet apart or sitting right by somebody whom we sit by all the time. I  am thankful for her tireless efforts, patriotic heart, and inaugural  expertise. This was Cami's fifth inauguration on the JCCIC staff.   Maria Lohmeyer, chief of inaugural ceremonies--this is the second  inauguration that I have asked Maria to take responsibility for, and  she helped once again to plan and execute this in a way that I am very  grateful for. I am glad she did it the first time and even more pleased  she was willing to come back and do it again. Right before she joined  us with JCCIC, she had been deployed to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as part  of her duties in the Navy Reserve. Maria, ever the determined  professional, developed a plan and then another plan and then another  plan and then another plan. She built a staff and a positive culture in  a really challenging time. She exceeded expectations and with  determination made certain that democracy prevailed on January 20.   Finally, I want to thank the Office of the House Chief Administrative  Officer; the Appropriations Committee and especially the Legislative  Branch Subcommittee clerks, Jessica Berry and Lucas Agnew; Julie Adams  and many of the behind-the-scenes staff in the Office of the Senate  Secretary, especially Sydney Butler, Senator Curator Melinda Smith, and  Senate Historians Betty Koed and Beth Hahn; and Clerk of the House  Cheryl Johnson for lending the technical expertise of her communication  editorial staff, Catherine Cooke and January Layman-Wood.   I want to thank Architect of the Capitol Brett Blanton and his staff,  who not only had to build a platform and put in a sound system, but  they had to repair that platform and replace the sound system; from  Brett Blanton's staff, in particular Mark Reed, Jason McIntyre, Raynell  Bennett, and Dwayne Thomas.   I thank Acting House Sergeant at Arms Tim Blodgett and his staff,  especially Ted Daniel and Davita Jones, and Acting Senate Sergeant at  Arms Jennifer Hemingway and her staff, especially Becky Schaaf and  Carly Flick.   I also want to thank Acting Chief Pittman of the U.S. Capitol Police  and in that case especially Inspector John Erickson, who commanded the  ITF and took personal responsibility to safeguard our JCCIC staff.   On January 20, 2021, the world witnessed the 59th inaugural  ceremonies--``Our Determined Democracy: Forging a More Perfect  Union''--as a periodic event that has really become, as I said earlier,  both commonplace and miraculous. The inaugural ceremonies are not only  a hallmark of American governance and democracy but also fulfill our  constitutional duty and give assurance of our unbroken commitment to  continuity, perseverance, and democracy.   With great thanks to everybody mentioned and with tremendous  cooperation from Members of the House and Senate, I yield the floor.
