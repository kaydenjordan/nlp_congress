 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the passage of H.J.  Res. 76, a resolution to overturn Secretary DeVos' shameful borrower  defense rule.   Secretary DeVos claims her rule is to help students and to protect  taxpayers, but this rule does the complete opposite.   Instead of working on behalf of students that have been defrauded by  predatory for-profit colleges, Secretary DeVos seeks to protect those  bad actors who leave students with crushing debt and worthless degrees.   Secretary DeVos refuses to provide relief to defrauded students,  eliminates consumer protections and higher education, and weakens  safeguards to prevent low quality schools from receiving taxpayer  money.   Mr. Speaker, that is why I was proud to vote for and help pass H.J.  Res. 76 to overturn Secretary DeVos' anti-student rule, and I urge  prompt action by the full Senate.                            ____________________
