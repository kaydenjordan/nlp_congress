 Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President. When a U.S. servicemember gives their life  in service to their Nation, they often leave behind family who we are  equally indebted to. Ensuring that these survivors are provided every  opportunity to succeed and get a quality education supports our values  and upholds our promise to servicemembers and military families.  Unfortunately, our ability to uphold our promise to dependents of  servicemembers who were killed in action (KIA) in Iraq and Afghanistan  following the attacks on September 11, 2001 has been affected.   As a result of sequestration, the U.S. Department of Education (ED)  sent a letter to institutions requiring them to reduce the Iraq and  Afghanistan Service Grant awards by about 6.2% or almost $400 per  recipient for the 2018-2019 award year. These grants are critical for  students to use for tuition, books, and room and board and any future  cut would be significant for a young college student. Many children and  dependents of servicemembers who were KIA in Iraq and Afghanistan are  now reaching college age so more and more students will not be  receiving as much in grants as they should be getting and rightfully  deserve.   Today, I am pleased to introduce with my colleagues Senator Lankford,  Senator Tester, and Senator Scott (from South Carolina) a bipartisan  bill called the Protecting our Gold Star Families' Act of 2019. This  legislation will move the Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant program to  the Pell Grant program to stabilize the funding source for these awards  and ensure Gold Star families have access to the maximum Pell Grant  funding available if they previously did not qualify for Pell Grants.  Additionally the bill would align eligibility requirements under  existing Department of Veterans Affairs grants such as the Fry  Scholarship with ED and the Iraq and Afghanistan Service program to  ensure that all Gold Star families are receiving the award.   While Virginia public universities already offer tuition assistance  to dependents whose parents were killed in action or were permanently  disabled under the state's Virginia Military Survivors and Dependents  Education Program (VMSDEP), these funds could be used to offset tuition  at private institutions and could also cover additional expenses,  including room and board, books, and supplies. Over 500 Virginians have  attended or are currently attending college at public universities with  assistance through VMSDEP and would qualify for these Pell Grants as  well.   Our Gold Star families have made the ultimate sacrifice for this  country. Helping them afford college is the least we can do. We should  give our servicemembers a peace of mind that if anything happens to  them, the nation they served will look out for their children and help  them access a high-quality education. As more of our post 9/11 Gold  Star children are starting to reach college age, now is the right time  to improve the program. I hope that my colleagues will incorporate this  bipartisan bill in a reauthorization of the Higher Education Act.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Ms. Duckworth):   S. 1852. A bill to require rulemaking by the Administrator of the  Federal Emergency Management Agency to address considerations in  evaluating the need for public and individual disaster assistance, and  for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and  Governmental Affairs.

I hope that my colleagues will incorporate this  bipartisan bill in a reauthorization of the Higher Education Act.                                  ______    Mr. President, I applaud my colleague for reaching out to  see if we could work together on this important resolution--a  resolution that, coming to the Senate in 2013, as did my colleague,  neither of us believed we would need to stand on the floor of this body  to introduce.   In August of 2017, students and their families had just arrived in  the town of Charlottesville to move in at the University of Virginia. A  close friend of mine, Rabbi Jake Rubin, is the Hillel rabbi at the  University of Virginia. The students and their families, many of whom  were coming to Charlottesville or to Virginia for the first time,  excited to begin their college career, gathered with other Hillel  students on campus on a Friday, together with members of the  Charlottesville Jewish community, for fellowship and worship. Soon,  they heard chants outside the place where they were worshipping, and  they saw individuals dressed in a sort of uniform of khaki pants and  white shirts, carrying torches and marching. They were marching at  something that was a 2-day rally billed as a Unite the Right rally. But  it was the words that were coming out of the marchers' mouths that  terrified these worshippers and students because what they were  chanting were slogans from Nazi youth rallies from the 1930s: ``Jews  will not replace us,'' ``blood and soil,'' and other horrible and  chilling statements terrified these young people and the adults who  were with them.   The next day, this rally/riot continued--White supremacists, White  nationalists, neo-Nazis, and neo-Confederates. An individual in a  vehicle ran his car into a crowd, injuring many and killing Heather  Heyer, a paralegal from the Charlottesville area.   Two State troopers, both of whom I knew because they were part of the  Governor's security detail during my tenure as Governor and also the  tenure of then-Governor McAuliffe, were patrolling in a helicopter to  try to provide order in a difficult situation. Their helicopter went  down, and both of them were killed, trying to protect public safety.   We didn't think that would happen in Virginia. We didn't think that  would happen in the hometown of an archetypal American political leader  who believed that the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of  religion was one of the most important things about our country--that  you could worship as you like or not and not be preferred or punished  for the choice that you make. Yet it did happen in Virginia. It did  happen in our country.   As my colleague mentioned, this day was a day that extended a long  history of anti-Semitism in the country: lynchings--the Leo Frank  lynching in Atlanta, GA, in the early 1900s--Jews wrongly accused of  crimes and then killed, crimes that they didn't commit; American  boycotts of Jewish businesses in Michigan in the 1930s; restrictive  covenants that prohibited Jews from moving into certain neighborhoods;  restrictions on access to country clubs and educational institutions;  bars that made it difficult to become members of certain professions;  and even in addition to formal restrictions, a culture of intolerance,  a culture of segregation that treated Jews as not fully equal in this  land of equality. I had hoped that those days were behind us.   But it is not just Charlottesville. There is a Jewish day school, the  Gesher Day School a few miles from here in Virginia, that experienced  bomb threats in 2017 and 2018. The Jewish Community Center in Fairfax,  VA, has been repeatedly defaced with Nazi graffiti and anti-Semitic  graffiti. In a heartening sign, when that happens, the faith  communities of Virginia--Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Hindu, and Baha'i-- gather to scrub the graffiti off. Yet this hasn't happened just once;  it happens over and over again.   The shootings at the synagogue in Pittsburgh; the shootings in  California; the assassination of Jewish senior citizens at a senior  center in Overland Park, KS, near where my parents live; the uptick in  reported hate crimes against Jews, as my colleague mentioned--hate  crimes directed against any religion in this country are often directed  against Jewish Americans. So we stand at a time when, regardless of  where it comes from and regardless of who perpetrates it, we have to  acknowledge that it is real, that it is dangerous, and that it is  growing. Those of us in leadership positions have to be able to stand  against it as firmly as we can.   I applaud my colleague for reaching out to see if we could work on  this together. This is a topic that could be used for partisanship and  that one side could point at things folks on the other side have said  that they didn't like. Senator Cruz and I talked about that, but what  we realized is that this is just too important an issue to get bogged  down in partisan politics, that the clear and present danger felt by  members of the Jewish community and the escalating rhetoric against  Jews in many parts of the country and around the world are things that  call for a bipartisan response, a clear condemnation, and also a Senate  commitment that, as a Senate, we will do all we can to combat anti- Semitism so that we can be true to the equality principle that is our  Nation's North Star, so that  [[Page S3622]]  we can be true to the freedom of religious worship that is enshrined in  the First Amendment. It is in the First Amendment for a very important  reason.   I applaud my colleague, and I hope it is the pleasure of this body to  accept the motion he will soon make by unanimous consent that we pass  this strong statement of where the Senate is on this most important  topic.   With that, I yield the floor back to my colleague from Texas.
