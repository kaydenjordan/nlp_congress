 Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman from Connecticut for  his tireless, bipartisan leadership in shepherding this bill to this  historic point. It was my honor to work on the healthcare worker  portions of this bill, and I am proud that it will pass today.   Madam Chair, I rise today in support of the Workplace Violence  Prevention for Health Care and Social Service Workers Act.   For far too long, the workers who serve on the front lines of our  communities have had to work in dangerous conditions without adequate  protection. Every day, our nurses and social service workers face high  levels of dangers, levels that most of us would find unacceptable in  our own occupation. Their courage to keep working, despite these risks  of violence, exemplifies the selfless nature of healthcare.                                time  0930    This bill follows what California has done in creating a nationwide  workplace violence prevention standard, so people no longer have to  work in fear.   Since the implementation of California's own standard, healthcare  workers have experienced marked improvements in workplace violence  prevention measures. The California Nurses Association reports that  hospitals in California are seeing increased security staffing,  increased training, and comprehensive reporting. These commonsense  protections did not exist prior to California's standard.   It is time to expand these protections to healthcare and social  service workers nationwide. This affects real people. We have heard  stories of people who have been injured, killed, whose families have  been harmed because of this kind of violence.   Madam Chair, I include in the Record a letter from National Nurses  United in support of this legislation. National Nurses United has  boldly led on this issue for many years, including getting the  standards across the finish line in California.                                         National Nurses United,                                  Washington, DC, November 18, 2019.        Dear Representative: This week, the House of       Representatives is scheduled to vote on H.R. 1309, the       Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social       Service Workers Act, sponsored by Congressman Joe Courtney.       National Nurses United, representing more than 155,000       registered nurses (RNs) across the country, is firmly in       support of this bill and strongly urges you to vote in favor       of it.        Our members work at the bedside in every state in the       nation, and we know that when nurses are unsafe, our patients       are also at risk. Violence on the job has become endemic for       RNs and other workers in healthcare and social assistance       settings. Nurses report being punched, kicked, bitten,       beaten, and threatened with violence as they provide care to       others--and far too many have experienced stabbings and       shootings. But there are practical steps that healthcare and       social service employers can take to fulfill their       obligations to protect their employees from this serious       occupational hazard. We know that violence can be prevented       through the development and implementation of plans that are       tailored to specific patient care units and facilities. These       plans must assess and address the range of risks for       violence--from the sufficiency of staffing and security       systems to patient-specific risk factors.        H.R. 1309 mandates that the Occupational Safety and Health       Administration promulgate a workplace violence prevention       standard that would require healthcare and social service       employers to develop and enforce plans to protect their       employees from violence on the job. To ensure that workplace       violence prevention plans are effective, workers (including       nurses, other direct care employees, security personnel and       ancillary staff) must be involved throughout all stages of       plan development, implementation, and review, which go hand-      in-hand with the standard's comprehensive training       requirements. The enforceable occupational health and safety       standard established in this legislation is necessary to       create and maintain protections against workplace violence       that our members, other workers in healthcare and social       settings, and, importantly, our patients deserve.        This bi-partisan legislation is of high priority for RNs       across the country, and we hope you will join with us in       supporting it and voting yes on H.R. 1309 on the floor of the       House of Representatives.            Sincerely,      Bonnie Castillo, RN,        Executive Director.      Zenei Cortez, RN,        President.      Deborah Burger, RN,        President.      Jean Ross, RN,        President.     I want to thank, again, the gentleman from Connecticut  for his leadership.
