 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment,  which really is a life-or-death question before the Chamber.   On February 7, 2010, a bunch of workers who were at a natural gas  plant construction site early in the morning lost their lives in a  horrific explosion because there was a natural gas blow where they  intentionally put natural gas through the pipe that was being installed  as a way of cleaning it. This is a practice which the pipe suppliers,  Siemens, GE, and others have issued serious warning is an unsafe  practice. Unfortunately, it wasn't followed that day, so six men lost  their lives. One of them was Ronnie Crabb, who was a dear friend of  mine.   It never should have happened because, again, in the private sector,  the workplace standard was there, but there was no workplace standard  in OSHA, which is now, again, trapped in the Chemical Safety Board and  the regulatory process.   This bill is just going to do nothing but, again, add additional  obstacles so that preventive measures that OSHA is really about--it is  about compliance, not retribution. There was a $16 million fine imposed  after the fact. The company, the contractor, went out of business and  paid just a fraction of it. That is not the way to protect workers'  lives. Let's allow a healthy regulatory process with private sector  input so that people like Ronnie Crabb won't lose their lives in the  future.   Mr. Chairman, again, I strongly support the Scott amendment.
