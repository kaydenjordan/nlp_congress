 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for us to take 5  minutes to address the PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act.    Mr. President, it was 10 years ago that we all got  together and passed a bill to help women, when they go back to work, to  be able to pump breast milk at work. We have 80 percent of women who  are having babies today striving to breastfeed. Half of the women who  have babies are going back to work within a very short period of time,  and the only way they can breastfeed is to pump milk at work. This was  a beautiful, bipartisan vision, and it was Dr. Coburn who educated us  all about the tremendous benefits of breast milk for babies.   But, in that work we did 10 years ago, we left out a significant  group of women in America--those who work according to a manager's  salary rather than according to wage. So now we have a bill that has  come out of committee, by voice vote, to fix that, and here we are  talking about baby formula.   Truly, what is better, in terms of baby formula, than a mother's  milk?   Let us stand with the babies; let us stand with the mothers; let us  stand with the families and fix this so that every single mother in  America who wishes to breastfeed can do so.   As if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 65, S. 1658;  further, that the committee-reported substitute be withdrawn and that  the Merkley substitute amendment at the desk be considered and agreed  to; that the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time and  passed; and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table.    Mr. President, a huge thanks to my colleague from  Alaska, Senator Murkowski, who has partnered with me in this effort.   We have worked through the flexibility needed in every setting, and I  [[Page S3065]]  must say the railroads weren't the folks who came to us and said they  needed help. In the past, we worked out every possible way to address  this for fast-food locations and for all kinds of industries that said,  ``We need special arrangements,'' and we worked them out. We have  worked them out in this version for the airlines.   It really is beyond the world of reasonableness to keep saying and to  keep finding some excuse that we can't--with the innovation, the  inventiveness, and the ingenuity of Americans--find the ability for a  woman to be able to express breast milk. We have solved this problem in  much more difficult situations. I am very disappointed that, today,  because of my colleague from Wyoming's objection, the women, the  mothers, the babies, and the families, lose. Let's win next time.                         Vote on Motion to Discharge
