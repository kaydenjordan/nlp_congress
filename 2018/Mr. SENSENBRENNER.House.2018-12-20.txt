 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, Congress has spent years talking about reducing crime,  enacting fair sentencing laws, and restoring lives. Today, we are  putting our words into action, and this is historic.   I am proud to have been a leader in this effort for over a decade:  First, introducing the original Second Chance Act with the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis), then serving as chairman of the  Over Criminalization Task Force in 2013, and introducing a  comprehensive criminal justice reform bill with the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Scott). This Congress, I sponsored the Second Chance  Reauthorization Act, which helps prisoners rejoin their families and  reenter society. I am happy to note that the First Step Act includes  this reauthorization.   The Second Chance Act was originally passed with bipartisan support  and signed into law in 2008. This first-of-its-kind legislation  authorized Federal grants for vital programs aimed at improving the  reentry process and reducing recidivism. Grants have been used for a  wide range of improved supervision practices and reentry programs,  including employment assistance and job skills training, treatment for  mental and substance abuse disorders, education, housing assistance,  family services, and mentoring.   Reauthorizing the Second Chance Act is an essential step to reducing  our prison population and improving the overall criminal justice  system. By providing the resources needed to coordinate reentry  services and policies at the State and local levels, this legislation  will ensure that the tax dollars spent on corrections do not simply  fuel a revolving door in and out of prison. I urge my colleagues to  support the First Step Act.
