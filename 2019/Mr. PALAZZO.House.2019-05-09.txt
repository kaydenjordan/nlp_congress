 Madam Speaker, I rise today along with my fellow members  of the Mississippi delegation to express the sorrow and grief within  our hearts. This week, the city of Biloxi lost one of our law  enforcement officers at the hands of senseless violence.   Officer Robert McKeithen's end of watch was on May 5, 2019, when he  was killed in the line of duty less than an hour after helping a Biloxi  man out of his wrecked car.   McKeithen was an Air Force veteran who served our Biloxi Police  Department for nearly 24 years. He was a family man who leaves behind a  wife and children.   During his time as an officer, McKeithen became known for his  selfless acts to put those in our community first. Particularly, he was  awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroic actions during Hurricane  Katrina, where he went out of his way to save the lives of a family  trapped in their home while the floodwaters were rising.   We have come to expect our law enforcement officers to run to the  dangers we civilians run from. They choose to keep our families and  neighborhoods safe, never knowing if they will return home to their own  families when their shift ends.   Our community now comes together in a time of grief mourning the loss  of our fallen hero.   Madam Speaker, at this time, I ask the House to join me in a moment  of silence to honor the life and service of Officer Robert McKeithen.                            ____________________
