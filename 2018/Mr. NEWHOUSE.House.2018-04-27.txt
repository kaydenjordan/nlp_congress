 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank one of the House's  own and a great public servant. Todd Ungerecht is a proud son of Pasco,  Washington, and has given this Nation over 20 years of tireless public  service.   Prior to his most recent service with the House Natural Resources  Committee as deputy staff director to Chairman  Rob Bishop, Todd served  the United States Senate for Washington's former U.S. Senator Slade  Gorton, for the George W. Bush administration as an appointee with the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and for former  chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee Doc Hastings.   A proud Gonzaga University undergraduate and law school graduate,  Todd is a man of family, of faith, and of public service. He represents  the quintessential staffer, working diligently behind the scenes, never  looking for credit, never seeking the limelight. Todd is a humble  public servant, who places the highest value on good public policy.   As Todd retires from the House, and his wife, Magda; and their two  children, Alexa and Evan, head west, we send them our sincere gratitude  and warmest wishes.                            ____________________
