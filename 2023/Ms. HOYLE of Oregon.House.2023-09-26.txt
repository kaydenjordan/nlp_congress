 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from  California for yielding time.   I rise in strong support of the Protecting Hunting Heritage and  Education Act, which passed unanimously out of the Education and  Workforce Committee by a 42-0 vote. This is how Congress is supposed to  work.   The bill would ensure that archery, hunter safety, culinary, and  related outdoor education programs will continue to receive Federal  funding through the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, or  ESEA.   For decades, schools across the country in districts like mine have  provided archery and hunter safety education classes with funding  provided by the ESEA.   These programs get kids off of their phones, out from behind the TV,  into the outdoors. They learn focus, physical agility, and a respect  for the outdoors. In many districts like mine, people hunt for food.   Again, we want to promote gun safety, and, again, hunter training.   Unfortunately, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, an important gun  violence prevention law that Congress passed last year, contained  language that mistakenly cut off the Federal funding from these  programs. It was no one's intent.   The Federal funding prohibition was not the original intent of the  Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. I was proud to lead a bipartisan  letter along with Representative   Mike Thompson from California urging  support for continued Federal funding for these programs.   The Protecting Hunting Heritage and Education Act will clarify that  Federal funding for these programs will continue.   I thank Representative Mark Green, Chairwoman Virginia Foxx, and  Ranking Member  Bobby Scott for their bipartisan work on this issue  that matters so much in districts like mine.   I call on the Senate to swiftly pass this legislation and ensure our  young people can continue to have access to these vital programs.   Our rural communities can't wait any longer.
