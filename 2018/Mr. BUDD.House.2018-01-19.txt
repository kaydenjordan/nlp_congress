 Madam Speaker, while many of us in this body disagree on  the issue of abortion, we should all be able to agree that, once a  child is born, he or she deserves protection.   If a doctor attempts to perform an abortion, sometimes a baby  actually escapes and emerges from the womb still living. If this real- life scenario isn't terrible enough, sometimes these babies, who are  breathing the same air as you and I, are left to die and their lives  are terminated right there in the medical facility.   Madam Speaker, these surviving children from this terrible procedure  need our protection.   Back in 2002, President Bush signed a bill that said if an abortion  results in the live birth of an infant, that infant  [[Page H566]]  is a legal person for all purposes under our laws. However, this law  didn't create additional protections for these surviving children.   That is why I am urging my colleagues to support Mrs. Blackburn's  bill that would add additional protections. Whether it is making sure  an infant is immediately taken to a hospital or mandating these doctors  do everything they can to save their life, these survivors need our  protection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Madam Speaker, last year, we voted on a bill to ban  abortions after 20 weeks. While I supported that bill, many of my  colleagues chose not to, but I urge them to at least support this  commonsense bill to protect the lives of abortion survivors.
