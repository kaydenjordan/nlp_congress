 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today to offer an amendment supporting an additional $13  million appropriation for the Readiness and Environmental Protection  Integration Program, known as the REPI Program.   Since 2003, REPI has been tasked with ensuring our military  installation readiness by allowing the Department of Defense to enter  into cost-sharing partnerships with State and local government to  combat encroachment near military installations while simultaneously  promoting environmental conservation. The underlying bill appropriates  $87 million for this program, which is a slight increase over last  year's enacted amount.   I am thankful to Chairman Visclosky for his recognition of REPI's  successes, which have established it as a model for intragovernmental  and private partnerships, but there is still more work to be done to  ensure that our military operations are able to proceed unimpeded and  our natural habitats are protected.   Over the past 15 years, the REPI Program has protected over half a  million acres in 33 States by working with Federal, State, and local  government entities, private conservation groups, and the military  services. These partnerships not only lead to thoughtful encroachment  mitigation solutions by expanding the landscape buffer around our  military installations, but also result in burden sharing across the  stakeholders. Over the life of the program, non-DOD REPI partners have  shouldered nearly half of the financial burden of these projects,  proving the cost-sharing value of the program.   Not too long ago these partnerships were uncommon; however, the  successful partnerships created by the REPI Program are lasting,  beneficial to all participants, and often foster new arrangements that  would not have happened otherwise. In total, the program is making a  difference for the military and our installations.   In my district, Buckley Air Force Base is a prime example of the  significant win-win impact that the REPI  [[Page H4729]]  Program can have on the installations and the community. By working  with partners like the Trust for Public Land and the Colorado  Department of Military and Veterans Affairs, the City of Aurora, the  REPI Program was able to preserve nearly 300 acres of land.   The environmental protection and antiencroachment measures undertaken  at Buckley have protected agricultural and recreational lands while  ensuring that Buckley Air Force Base has the land required to conduct  operations and even grow to meet additional needs for decades to come.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1715     Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Calvert).    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Indiana  (Mr. Visclosky).    Madam Chair, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself the  balance of my time.   Madam Chair, I want to take the opportunity to speak about how the  REPI program saves taxpayer dollars, supports military readiness, and  preserves our environment.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment for an  additional $13 million that is in line with the amount authorized in  the NDAA that was marked up last week to ensure its valuable work can  benefit more installations and communities.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I rise today to offer an amendment to vastly increase  funding for ALS research by $40 million through the Congressionally  Directed Medical Research Programs at the Department of Defense. This  is to build on the program's vision to improve treatment and find a  cure for this disease, which poses far more questions than answers.   In the United States, 15 people are diagnosed with ALS every day,  with an estimated 16,000 Americans living with this degenerative  disease. Commonly referred to as Lou Gehrig's disease, the average  survival time after diagnosis is only 3 years.   Although an estimated 10 percent of ALS cases are inherited, more  than 90 percent are sporadic, and medical research can't yet determine  why. It is further complicated for veterans, as research suggests that  there is a mutually inclusive relationship between ALS and military  service. In fact, veterans who were deployed during the Gulf war are  twice as likely to develop ALS.   This disease also hits home for me in many ways. On March 18, our  community lost Mike Cimbura to ALS. Mike was, first and foremost, a  loving husband and father, but on top of that, he fought ALS  ferociously to ensure that ALS will no longer be a hopeless diagnosis.  He worked to get right-to-try legislation across the finish line to  increase access to experimental treatments that would one day cure this  disease.   In my own family, we lost our dear cousin, Jeff Van Brunt, to this  disease just last year. Jeff would have just celebrated his 40th  birthday. He left behind his wonderful wife, Jill, and kids, Megan,  William, Sophia, and Mark.   In short, this disease knows no stranger, impacting communities and  families across the country. This disease continues to take loved ones  in our communities too early, and we need to continue to fight for  funding to find treatments and a cure.   I am extremely grateful to the chairman and his entire team for  working to increase funding this year, but I want to be clear that we  need to attack this disease more aggressively.   It costs between $1 billion and $2 billion to find a treatment for  ALS and can take up to 15 years to bring an effective ALS treatment to  market. Furthermore, finding a cure would open up a path to finding  cures for other diseases, like Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, multiple  sclerosis, and many others.   We owe this to our veterans. We owe this to every member of our  community who should not have to face this disease without any hope for  a cure.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time, and I withdraw the  amendment.
