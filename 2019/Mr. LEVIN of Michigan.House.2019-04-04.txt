 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for his  leadership on this, and I really want to thank Representative Ro Khanna  for his continued, steadfast efforts to end this situation.   So, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this resolution and  finally end U.S. involvement in the Saudi-led war in Yemen.   If we fail to act today, if we let one more opportunity to end these  horrors pass us by, we are telling the world we are okay with another  day in which innocent civilians are killed; another day that nearly 20  million people go without basic healthcare, and even more in need of  emergency food aid; another day that a child must battle illnesses that  could easily have been prevented, if not for this crisis happening on  our watch.   We have an opportunity, as Members of this body, Republicans and  Democrats, to tackle the difficult problems and have the debates that  others have ignored for too long. This is one of those problems. And  this is one of those moments that makes me optimistic that the tide is  finally turning.   I want to thank the chairman for making this a top priority. It is  long past time for Congress to reassert its role, our role, in foreign  policy and exercise our Constitutional duty.   Seeing the level of suffering in Yemen, we cannot wait one more day  to do it. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.
