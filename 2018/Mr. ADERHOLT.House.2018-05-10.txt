 Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague, Mr. Shimkus, for this  important legislation.   This is a bipartisan piece of legislation that, it has already been  said, puts our country back on the right track in honoring that  commitment that was made by the Federal Government to safely collect  and dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high-level nuclear waste.   It has been noted here this morning that, under the Nuclear Waste  Policy Act of 1982, Congress assigned the responsibility for spent  nuclear fuel to the Federal Government; but today, because the Federal  Government has failed to honor this commitment, spent nuclear fuel sits  idle in 121 communities across 39 States.   It was back in 1987 that Congress designated Yucca Mountain as the  permanent repository for nuclear waste, but despite collecting more  than $40 billion from taxpayers, Yucca Mountain nuclear waste  repository has yet to be completed.   The legislation before us today offers important reforms for our  country's nuclear waste policy. It utilizes Yucca Mountain as our main  point of nuclear waste storage, while directing the Department of  Energy to move forward with a temporary storage program as it works on  the Yucca Mountain facility.   Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague again for his legislation, and I urge  my colleagues to support H.R. 3053.
