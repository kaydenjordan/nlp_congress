 Madam Speaker, today I rise in support of the brave  Iranian protestors who are fighting against barbaric forces of  immorality.   During his 1967 inaugural address as Governor of California, Ronald  Reagan said that ``Freedom is a fragile thing, and it is never more  than one generation away from extinction.''  [[Page H315]]    Iranian protestors have based this revolution on three principles:  women, life, and freedom, all of which America has rightfully  championed.   With a considerable population of Iranian Americans in New York's  Third Congressional District, let America serve as a Democratic beacon  of light for the Iranian men and women who are fighting abroad.   I acknowledge Representative Tenney, who introduced a House  concurrent resolution commending the bravery of the men and women of  Iran.   I declare, with every bullet and with every act of violence imposed  by the Iranian government, comes a call for us to condemn their actions  and urge the Biden administration to take far greater actions than mere  sanctions to address the countless murders and examples of senseless  brutality.                            ____________________
