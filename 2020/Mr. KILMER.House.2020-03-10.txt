 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chair Lofgren and Ranking Member  Davis for their support in bringing this resolution to the floor.   H. Res. 756, the MODCOM Resolution, is the product of a bipartisan  desire to make Congress work better for the American people.   Over the past year, the Select Committee on the Modernization of  Congress has taken a hard look at the many challenges this institution  faces. Select committee members have listened closely to what their  colleagues and staff have to say about how to improve Congress and  listened to the American people.  [[Page H1572]]    Through a collaborative, bipartisan process, the select committee has  so far passed 45 recommendations to make Congress work better so that  Members can better serve their constituents.   Making recommendations to improve Congress is one thing, but making  sure those recommendations are carried out is quite another.   The Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress is the first  reform committee in recent history to turn its recommendations into  legislation. The MODCOM Resolution ensures that the select committee's  initial recommendations are implemented by the House of  Representatives.   These recommendations cover a broad range of issues but share a  common goal: making Congress work better for the American people.   Article I of the Constitution established Congress as the first among  coequal branches of government. Our Founding Fathers envisioned a  strong legislative branch, but Congress' capacity to uphold its  constitutional powers has been weakened. This resolution is a first  step toward restoring capacity and strengthening Congress.   The resolution improves transparency so that the American people can  easily access basic information about Congress, including following the  bill through the process, seeing how Members vote in committee and on  the floor, and tracking what bills Members sponsor.   The MODCOM Resolution also contains recommendations focused on  attracting and retaining a diverse and highly qualified workforce,  again, working on behalf of the American people. The resolution creates  a one-stop HR shop to help Members and staff with questions about  recruitment, retention, diversity, legal counsel, training, and  benefits.   The select committee has heard a lot about how new Member orientation  should do more to encourage civility and bipartisan collaboration. This  resolution will overhaul the onboarding process for new Members and  provide continuing education opportunities for all Members.   Select committee members also agree that trying to solve 21st century  problems with 20th century technologies is a disservice to the American  people, who rightfully expect timely action from their Representatives.  This resolution will modernize House technologies and, ultimately, save  taxpayer dollars.                                time  1245    Modernizing Congress also means making the proceedings and functions  of the House accessible to all Americans. The MODCOM resolution  addresses the equal access challenges that persons with disabilities  face when working for, visiting, or interacting with Congress.   The bottom line is this: All Members want Congress to work better for  the American people, and the MODCOM resolution serves that goal.   I am proud to lead this effort, but I want to emphasize that this is  an entirely collaborative effort. Congressman   Tom Graves, the select  committee's vice chair, has been a great partner, and I want to thank  him for his leadership, his partnership, and his commitment to the  committee's success.   I thank the gentleman from Illinois for wishing Tom and his family  well and wishing his son a speedy recovery.   Mr. Speaker, the experience and perspective of Chair Lofgren and of  Ranking Member Davis they have shared with the select committee has  also been invaluable. I want to thank them and the Committee on House  Administration and their staff for their help and their guidance and  for their work in bringing this resolution to the floor today.   I also want to thank all of my colleagues on the select committee. We  serve with such thoughtful and dedicated Members, and I look forward to  our continued collaboration.   The CAO's office and the House Clerk's office have also been  instrumental in this effort, and I want to thank the many people in  both offices who have given of their time and expertise in working  through a lot of these issues with the select committee.   This is the first step in trying to make Congress function better on  behalf of the American people. There is more to come. The committee has  additional recommendations that we hope to move forward.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support passage of H. Res. 756.
