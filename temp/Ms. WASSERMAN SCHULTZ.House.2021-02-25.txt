 Mr. Speaker, as a founding vice chair of the  LGBTQ-plus Equality Caucus, I am proud, once again, to cast my vote for  the Equality Act. It is my sincere hope that this is finally the year  that it will be signed into law.   In dozens of States, including my own, LGBTQ Americans are still  denied housing, discriminated against in education, or denied service  at businesses. The Trump administration ruthlessly attacked the LGBTQ  community's rights from the transgender military ban to allowing  doctors to deny medical care to LGBTQ individuals.   States have continued to put forward so-called bathroom bills.  Legislators in my own State have introduced bills to deny medical care  to trans children and prevent trans youth from playing sports. Even  worse, 44 trans Americans were murdered in 2020, the deadliest year on  record.   We can't tolerate any more discrimination. It costs lives. The  Equality Act is vital so that Americans everywhere can love whom they  love and be their authentic selves without fear of persecution,  eviction, or discrimination.
