 Madam President, Washington and the cable news  channels have spent the week fixated on House Democrats' impeachment  hearings.   A few months ago, Speaker Pelosi was saying she was not ``for  impeachment'' unless it was ``bipartisan.'' But even after the  resolution codifying the Democrats' unfair process received zero  Republican votes, the House plowed ahead anyway, searching for a way to  arrive at an outcome the Democrats literally predetermined years ago.   Meanwhile, the American people are still waiting for Washington  Democrats to stop blocking crucial bipartisan legislation. I spoke  yesterday about the USMCA, the landmark trade deal that experts say  would create 176,000 American jobs. For 9 months, Speaker Pelosi has  told the press every couple of weeks that she will allow a vote soon.  Last winter, she was ``optimistic''; over the summer, ``We want to pass  this bill''; this fall, ``becoming closer''; and a couple of weeks ago,  ``I think we are close.''   We have had months of this stalling. Now we are 1 week out from  Thanksgiving, and there is still no tangible sign--none--of progress  from the House. If the House cannot pass the USMCA this year, there is  no way they will be able to claim that the people's business has not  taken a back seat to impeachment.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, the USMCA is not  the only important legislation Democrats are holding up. As if  neglecting the first major update to North American trade policy in a  generation were not enough, they are also on track to break a nearly  60-year tradition of passing a bipartisan Defense authorization bill.   Passing the NDAA is one of Congress's most basic governing  responsibilities. It authorizes and assures the ongoing missions of our  Armed Forces and the resources the Department of Defense needs to carry  them out.   Every year since 1961, these goals have been enough to get Members  across the ideological spectrum to  [[Page S6726]]  come together and deliver a comprehensive, bipartisan piece of  legislation--but not this year, at least not yet.   House Democrats are so intent on picking fights with the White House  that they decided to play partisan games with our Armed Forces. They  passed a fully party-line NDAA--not one Republican vote--for their  House version on the floor. I believe it is the first time ever that  either Chamber has passed a purely partisan NDAA.   The House, on a partisan basis, also included many provisions that  aren't even in the jurisdiction of their Armed Services Committee. Even  in conference, House Democrats are holding germane provisions hostage  in order to secure partisan, nongermane provisions that literally have  nothing whatsoever to do with our national security.   Their demands to treat the NDAA like a gift basket to liberal  interest groups is imperiling the passage of this important  legislation. We are talking about demands like a new taxpayer-funded  benefit for all Federal employees and burdening farmers, ranchers,  small businesses, local airports, and community water utilities with  expensive new environmental liabilities--all kinds of domestic policy  changes that were not in the Senate's bipartisan version and have no  business bringing this crucial process to a halt.   The Senate did things the right way. We passed a bipartisan NDAA back  in June, just as we do every year. That is a credit to Chairman Inhofe,  Ranking Member Reed, and the rest of the Senate Armed Services  Committee. It was a thoroughly bipartisan product, debated out in the  open.   But House Democrats literally went off the rails. The House Rules  Committee afforded floor debate only on a single substantive Republican  amendment while they jammed through their own partisan priorities. They  passed a totally partisan NDAA with zero Republican votes--none. Now  they are risking the entire conference committee to insist those  partisan demands wind up in the end product.   Enough is enough. The USMCA and NDAA cannot be clearer examples of  bipartisan legislation that would make our country stronger.   Our Democratic friends said that they want to do more than just  impeach. They say they came to Washington to do more than pick fights  with the President. Well, in the next days and weeks, we will find out  if they mean it.                            ____________________     Madam President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk that is due for a second reading.
