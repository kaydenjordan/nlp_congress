 Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Daines for all the  effort he put into this legislation, the Fort Belknap Indian Community  Water Rights Settlement Act. It has been a long time coming, and I want  to take a moment to acknowledge the current leader of the Fort Belknap  Indian Community, President Stiffarm.   President Stiffarm is a courageous leader, and he deserves a  tremendous amount of credit for bringing this bill to the moment we are  at today.   This bill was first introduced by me in 2012. The bipartisan version  that we are voting on today is the result of years of negotiation  between the Tribe, local elected officials, State legislators, Federal  Agencies, and other stakeholders that hammered out a fair compromise  that honors the trust and treaty responsibilities while guaranteeing  water certainty to all water users in North Central Montana through the  rehabilitation of the Milk River Project.   Look, I am a farmer, and I know how critical water is for the health  of communities, for agriculture, and for economic growth. Water is  necessary for our crops, for our businesses, for our homes. We all rely  on it.   For the Fort Belknap Indian Community the work started on this over  100 years ago. In the Senate, we have been debating moving this water  settlement forward for years, and, today, we can make it happen.   I would urge my colleagues to do right by the Tribe by honoring our  trust and treaty responsibilities, and do right by all the folks who  rely on clean water in the Treasure State. And I support Senator  Daines' call for a voice vote.    Mr. President, I rise today to share a few words in honor  of the 62nd birthday of Marc Hilliard Fogel, an American currently  imprisoned in Russia.   Marc is an American schoolteacher, a father, a husband, and an uncle.  And in August of 2021, after living and teaching in Russia for 9 years,  Marc was arrested and sentenced to 14 years in Russian prison. His  imprisonment is unjust and unacceptable, plain and simple.   I recently met with Marc's family, who currently reside in Montana,  and I would like to honor his birthday today by taking the time to  share some of what they shared with me as they work tirelessly to bring  him home.   Marc is a dedicated partner to his wife Jane, an inspiring dad to his  two sons Sam and Ethan, and a caring son to his 94-year-old mother  Malphine. He is a committed brother to his sisters Anne and Lisa and an  uncle to Anne's three children. He is a sports fanatic, a fan of Steely  Dan, an avid reader, a passionate teacher, and a world traveler. If you  talk to his family, they will tell you about his infectious  personality, his love for learning and teaching, and his dedication to  community. He devoted his life to children, and was steadfast in  guiding his students to learn, grow, and think independently. And  today, he is marking his 62nd birthday not with his loved ones, but in  Russian prison.   As we approach the second anniversary of Marc's detention, it is our  duty to use all the tools at our disposal to bring Marc home. This  week, I introduced a bipartisan resolution calling for his immediate  release, and I am  [[Page S3746]]  here today to strongly urge the Biden administration to prioritize  securing his release and the State Department to designate him as  ``wrongfully detained.''   The unjust imprisonment of Marc Fogel has gone on far too long. Now,  we must do everything in our power to ensure this innocent American is  reunited with his loved ones, so he can spend his next birthday--and  many after--surrounded by family.   Happy Birthday, Marc. We will keep working to get you home.                            ____________________
