 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Joe Berklich, a  World War II veteran and Hibbing, Minnesota, native, who is celebrating  his 100th birthday today.   In 1943, Joe enlisted in the Army and courageously served in the  Pacific theater until the end of the war. In fact, all four of the  Berklich brothers were proud to serve during our country's time of  need.   Upon returning home, Joe married the love of his life, Margaret. He  still lives in the family home in Hibbing, Minnesota, where they raised  their four children: Michael, Danny, Timmy, and Mary. Always a family  man, Joe's favorite memories are spending the Fourth of July at their  cabin on Bear Lake and spoiling his grandchildren on Christmas Eve.   After the war, Joe worked for U.S. Steel, the Sherman Mine, and  Minntac in Mountain Iron. He became a foreman and also traveled the  Nation working with vendors of mining equipment.   In his free time, Joe has been an active member of the Hibbing  community, serving as a Hibbing city councilor to the president of the  Hibbing Curling Club.   Mr. Speaker, members of the Greatest Generation like Joe Berklich are  the pride of our communities. As the Hibbing community gathers today  for a drive-by past his house to celebrate this major milestone, I am  proud to stand here on the House floor to thank Joe for his service and  wish him the happiest of birthdays.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``nay'' on Rollcall No. 35.
