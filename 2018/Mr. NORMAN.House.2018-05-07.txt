 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill H.R.  4301, A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 201 Tom Hall Street, in Fort Mill, South Carolina,  as the ``J. Elliot Williams Post Office Building.''   James Elliot Williams was born in Fort Mill, South Carolina and lived  an extraordinary life, in service to our nation. James served in the  United States Navy for 20 years. During his tenure, James served in and  during the Cold  [[Page H3757]]  War, the Korean War, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the Vietnam War.   One example of his heroic actions occurred during the Vietnam War,  when he and his men fought off enemy combatants behind enemy lines for  three hours in South Vietnam. Under James' leadership, the American  Naval force, killed roughly one thousand Viet Cong guerrillas,  destroyed over 60 vessels, and disrupted a major enemy logistic  operation.   James retired on April 26, 1967 as the most highly decorated enlisted  sailor in the history of the United States Navy. He was the recipient  of multiple awards during his service in the Navy, including the Navy  Cross, Silver Star, Bronze Star Medal, Purple Heart, Korean Service  Modal and the United Nations Service Medal and during his last seven  months in the Navy, James received every sea-service award for heroism.   On May 14, 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson, in the name of  Congress, presented James Elliot Williams the Medal of Honor. In the  20th century, three sailors of American Indian heritage received the  medal--James was one of the three.   Mr. Speaker it is my privilege to put forth this legislation with the  entire South Carolina delegation--to honor the life of service and  sacrifice of James Elliot Williams.
