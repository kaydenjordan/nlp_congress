 Mr. Speaker, as students prepare to return  to classrooms, it is now more clear than ever that the lockdowns of the  past 2 years have dealt a devastating blow to the education of our  Nation's children.   Isolation and a lack of hands-on learning was detrimental with  students falling behind grade level in both reading and math.   In fact, new research shows that students have only recovered between  15 and 35 percent of the learning that was lost during school  shutdowns.   Students are not learning the math, the science, the history, and the  English that they will need to be successful, and over the long term,  the consequence of this learning loss could be catastrophic for our  young people.   Instead of addressing this crisis head-on and involving parents  directly in their child's education to help get them back on track, the  Biden administration has taken steps to limit parents' involvement and  federally mandate what our children are taught in classrooms.   To take on this problem, I am proud to join my Republican colleagues  as a cosponsor of the Parents Bill of Rights Act. This important  legislation would ensure that parents know what their children are  being taught in schools and that they have the chance to be heard and  to be a part of their kids' education and not a bystander.   This bill would give parents the right to see their school district's  budget and spending because it is time that we have transparency  throughout our education system.   This would go even further to give parents the opportunity to protect  their student's privacy by making sure that a school cannot change  their policy on privacy without parental consent.   Our students are counting on us. They are counting on us to find  solutions to the challenges that they face every day in school. It is  time to increase family involvement, enforce high standards, and make  sure that we are preparing our kids of all ages for success in  education.                          Celebrating Sigrid Andrew     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate  Sigrid Andrew on her upcoming retirement from her role as medical  center director at the James E. Van Zandt VA Medical Center in Altoona,  Pennsylvania.   Ms. Andrews' 26 years of service to the United States Department of  Veterans Affairs culminated with her time leading the Van Zandt VA  Medical Center's team to where she has been a pillar of support for our  veteran community.   Ms. Andrews' years of experience, not only as a nurse but as a leader  in operational management, led her to find innovative solutions to a  variety of unique challenges that face our veterans each and every day.   On a personal note, Sigrid Andrew has been instrumental in the  development and deployment of the Homegrown Healthcare Initiative,  which allows third- and fourth-year medical students to return to their  communities in central Pennsylvania to care for patients and build the  skills that they will need as young doctors, doctors who will be  trained to address the physical and mental health issues of our great  veterans.   Sigrid Andrews' tireless work to help address the rural physician  shortage has been extraordinary and without her, the Homegrown  Healthcare Initiative would not be where it is today.   Sigrid Andrews' persistence, her intelligence, and her dedication to  excellence has been an essential tool to support the veteran community  throughout Pennsylvania.  [[Page H7076]]    On behalf of the people of Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional  District, I thank Sigrid Andrew for her hard work and her commitment to  the veterans of the United States military. I wish her all the best.                            ____________________
