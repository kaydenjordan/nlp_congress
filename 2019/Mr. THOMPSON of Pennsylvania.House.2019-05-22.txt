 Mr. Speaker, this weekend marks one of  our most solemn occasions, Memorial Day, where we mourn those we have  lost in the defense of this Nation.   Many in this House will attend ceremonies throughout the weekend and  on Memorial Day, which is observed annually on the last Monday of May.   The traditional Memorial Day dates back to 1864 in Boalsburg,  Pennsylvania, my home county, where three ladies decorated the graves  of fallen Civil War soldiers. The custom has continued every year since  then. Boalsburg still puts on a traditional Memorial Day celebration,  complete with a parade, a community walk to the cemetery, speeches,  military reenactments, and much more.   We must never forget the unthinkable pain for the families whose  loved ones have not returned home, and this includes those missing in  action and prisoners of war. Currently, there are more than 83,000  American servicemembers who remain unaccounted for from World War II,  the Korean war, and Vietnam.   While several nations have worked to assist the United States in  search and recovery efforts, many challenges still exist when it comes  to negotiations and operations. That is why today I will introduce the  Keeping Our Promise to MIAs/POWs resolution that expresses a sense of  Congress that any nation seeking to potentially enter into a mutually  beneficial trade agreement with the United States should provide  reasonable access and cooperation to help us recover our unaccounted- for servicemembers.   This resolution sends a message that this Nation will uphold its  eternal promise to our Armed Forces to always work to bring our men and  women home, no matter the circumstances we face, no matter the time  that has passed.   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, especially in  advance of Memorial Day weekend. Mr. Speaker, America will gather this  weekend with family members, friends, and neighbors to remember those  whom we have lost. As we raise the Stars and Stripes, as we lay wreaths  at monuments and memorials and cemeteries, as we march in parades and  attend services, let us remember that our freedom is thanks to those  who died in sacrifice.   May God bless them, and may God bless the United States of America.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Brad Farmer, who has spent the last 38 years of his life in service to  the Boy Scouts of America, and to congratulate him on his retirement.  It is because of people like Brad that Scouting has been able to  positively influence the lives of millions of young American men and  women.   Brad began his service in 1981 as a district executive in Wood River,  Illinois, and has served Scouting in several local and national roles  since then. Brad most recently served in the National Office of the Boy  Scouts, where he was Assistant Chief Scout Executive for Development  from 2009 until earlier this year. Brad was also charged with  overseeing the Boy Scouts of America sustainability and outdoor  stewardship efforts.   Mr. Speaker, over the last 10 years, Brad has provided incredible  service and leadership. Brad leaves tremendous shoes to fill, but I  congratulate him on a well deserved retirement.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Brad for his contributions to the Boy Scouts of  America and our Nation's youth.                            ____________________
