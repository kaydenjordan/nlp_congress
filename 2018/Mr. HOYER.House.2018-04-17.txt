 Mr. Speaker, Louise Slaughter was a scientist, and she  approached her work in this House with scientific precision. She found  that special formula for success: mix an extraordinary work ethic with  a deep intellect and love of her community, and the result was thirty- one years of excellence serving New Yorkers in Congress. I was deeply  saddened to learn of her passing last month, and I will look back  fondly on the three decades we served together in this House.   As the daughter of a coal mine blacksmith, Louise grew up around  hardship and challenge. Later, as a microbiologist and an elected  official, she made public health and economic opportunity her focus. In  Congress, she fought for funding for women's health, to keep our troops  safer in combat, and to crack down on domestic violence. As Chairwoman  of the Rules Committee, she played a key role in advancing to the Floor  major legislation, including the Recovery Act, Affordable Care Act,  Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform, and the Don't Ask Don't Tell Repeal Act.   None of us who served with her ever doubted her tenacity or resolve.  Louise never forgot her roots or the constituents who sent her back to  Congress year after year. Her loss is a great loss for this House, for  the people of upstate New York, and for our country. I join in offering  my condolences to her daughters Megan, Amy, and Emily and their  families.
