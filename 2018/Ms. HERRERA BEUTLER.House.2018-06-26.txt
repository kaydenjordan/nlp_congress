 Mr. Chairman, thanks to Kurt Schrader, who has  been a partner with me on this legislation for a while--actually, since  before I was here, he has been working on this bill--and today is a  good day.   ``I would like to think that there might still be salmon and  steelhead to fish for when my great-grandkids try fishing.'' That is  from Bob, who lives in Brush Prairie in my district. I have heard Bob's  sentiments echoed literally from thousands of folks across southwest  Washington.   Unfortunately, our salmon runs are now fighting for survival. It is  practically a miracle when a fish can make it upstream without getting  caught between a sea lion's teeth. They certainly don't get caught  unscathed.   Mr. Chairman, what we currently have on the Columbia River is an  ecosystem seriously out of balance. I recently met with local fishing  guides who, with despair in their voices, told me between 70 and 100  percent of the fish they land show visible signs of a struggle with a  sea lion, barely escaping becoming a meal for the already engorged sea  lions. We are seeing fewer and fewer salmon, steelhead, and sturgeon  make it past this gauntlet of sea lions as the fish make their way  upstream.   Donald from Vancouver told me the other day he reeled in a salmon-- half of a salmon. A sea lion was fighting him for the other half.   Look, we are not anti-sea lion. Oh, my goodness, no. We are just for  protecting our native fish, a Pacific Northwest icon, and in order to  do that, we have got to make it easier to remove some of the most  egregious offenders, problematic pinnipeds.   Sea lions aren't endangered anymore. In fact, they are doing really,  really well. They weigh a ton. Literally, a Steller sea lion can weigh  up to 1 ton. Between the California and the Steller sea lions, their  populations have increased by hundreds of thousands, and now they are  overindulging on an all-you-can-eat buffet of salmon at numbers that  are totally unnatural on the Columbia River system. The sea lions are  winning this battle.    Forty-five percent of spring Chinook adult salmon disappear between  the mouth of the Columbia River and the Bonneville Dam. Oregon's fish  and wildlife agency has concluded after much study that the Willamette  River steelhead runs are facing a 90 percent chance of extinction due  to predation.   That is why we are here today, Mr. Chairman, in a bipartisan effort  to save our wild fish from being decimated by animals that have  migrated out of their natural habitat and whose population is ever  increasing.   My bill, the Endangered Salmon and Fisheries Predation Prevention  Act, provides Tribal and government resource managers with the means to  rapidly respond and remove California and Steller sea lions from  specific areas where they are posing the most harm to our salmon  restoration efforts.   The Columbia River makes up the entire southern border of my  district. The river is a lifeline for clean, affordable energy and  brings economic benefit through both recreational and commercial  fishing.   While the lethal take of sea lions is a last resort, it is necessary  to protect the hundreds of millions of dollars in investments that the  Northwest residents have made to protect and enhance salmon and other  ESA-listed species on the Columbia River.   Nonlethal solutions like hazing and, literally, transporting sea  lions hundreds of miles away and releasing them have not worked. The  sea lions come right back.   In Washington State, we are forced to live with a cautionary tale of  failing to take strong action. In the 1980s and 1990s, Federal  officials failed to grant the same authority that we are asking for  today to halt the salmon slaughter in Seattle at the Ballard Locks. By  the time Congress acted, a whole run of steelhead was decimated.   Let's not allow history to repeat itself. H.R. 2083 is a much-needed  solution. The bill would amend section 120 of the Marine Mammal  Protection Act to authorize the Secretary of Commerce to provide States  and local Tribes with the tools necessary to humanely manage sea lions  on the waters of the Columbia River and its tributaries as long as the  sea lions are not part of an ESA-listed species. This is common sense,  Mr. Chairman.   Additionally, this legislation allows not only the Northwest State  wildlife agencies, but also qualified Tribes to obtain permits to help  protect the recovery of ESA-listed salmon, authority not granted  currently under the law.   Simply put, my bill cuts through the bureaucratic red tape,  streamlines the permitting process, and allows States and Tribes to  rapidly respond to remove sea lions from areas they pose the most  threat to salmon recovery. Mr. Chairman, this is the last line of  defense against fish runs bordering on extinction.   This bill enjoys bipartisan support both here in Congress and at  home. As I mentioned, my friend and neighbor to the south, Kurt  Schrader, has been an invaluable partner in getting this bill to the  floor today.    Mr. Chairman, this legislation is supported by  the Governors of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho; the Columbia River  Inter-Tribal Fish Commission; the Washington, Idaho, and Oregon State  Department of Fish and Wildlife; the Ilwaco Charter Association; the  Coalition of Coastal Fisheries; and the Coastal Conservation  Association of Oregon and Washington. Public utilities are among the  bill's supporters.   I am also pleased a companion bill is moving through the Senate now,  with bipartisan support, underscoring the urgency of this issue.   I ask my colleagues to join me today in supporting H.R. 2083. Let's  make sure our kids and our grandkids and great-grandkids can experience  the thrill of reeling in their first salmon on the Columbia River.    Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record a letter  of support from the Public Power Council and a letter of support from  the States of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho Departments of Fish and  Wildlife and the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission.                                                      June 22, 2018.      To: Speaker Ryan, Minority Leader Pelosi, and Northwest         Congressional Delegation.      Re Support for H.R. 2083 and S. 1702--To reduce marine mammal           predation on endangered Columbia River salmon.        We come together today to lend our strong and joint support       for H.R. 2083 and S. 1702, bills that would reduce predation       of endangered adult salmon and steelhead. The Public Power       Council (PPC) is a not for profit association that represents       about 100 consumer-owned electric utilities in the Pacific       Northwest on issues regarding the Federal Columbia River       Power System. The Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission       (CRITFC) provides coordination and technical assistance to       the tribes in regional, national, and international efforts       to ensure  [[Page H5702]]       that treaty fishing rights issues are protected in a way that       guarantees the continuation and restoration of tribal       fisheries into perpetuity.        In the last few decades, west coast sea lion populations       have increased ten-fold. This growing population has expanded       its search for food and found it in the Columbia and       Willamette Rivers, river systems they had never before       accessed. A recent NOAA Fisheries study estimates that       pinnipeds consumed between 10-45 percent of some stocks of       returning adult salmon in 2017. It is difficult to envision a       successful recovery plan for fish listed under the Endangered       Species Act without addressing this aggressive predation on       the very adult fish that have benefitted from current efforts       only to fall short in surviving a return to their spawning       grounds.        H.R. 2083 and S. 1702, introduced in the first session of       the 115th Congress, address this concern by building on       existing authorities that allow some lethal take of sea lions       near Bonneville Dam by appropriate tribal and state entities.       Fisheries biologists estimate predation would greatly       decrease by incorporating all management activity in the       areas of high predation between the mouth of the river up to       the dam.        These bills are widely supported in the Northwest. In       addition to this joint support from CRITFC and PPC, regional       governors from both parties, along with other industries who       rely on healthy salmon and steelhead runs, have come together       to back these bills. We are hopeful the proposals will       receive broad bipartisan support in the House of       Representatives and Senate.        This situation continues to expand supporters of this       legislation among diverse interests in the public, private       and nonprofit sectors. Our joint support represents that       healthy salmon and steelhead runs are critical to the future       of the Columbia River treaty tribes and utilities. This bill       would give fisheries managers greater tools to appropriately       reduce predation of these endangered fish. Again, we support       H.R. 2083 and S. 1702 and urge their expeditious passage       through Congress.            Sincerely,                                                      Scott Corwin,                          Executive Director, Public Power Council.                                                  Jaime A. Pinkham,              Executive Director, Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish       Commission.                                   ____                                                      June 25, 2018.      Hon. Speaker Ryan,      Hon. Leader Pelosi,      Hon. Chairman Bishop,      Hon. Ranking Member Grijalva.        As directors of the co-managing agencies charged with       conserving fish and wildlife in Oregon, Washington, and       Idaho, we are writing to express our support for H.R. 2083,       the Endangered Salmon and Fisheries Predation Prevention Act,       with amendments proposed by our three agencies and the       Columbia River treaty tribes. Passage of this legislation is       critical to ensuring we can manage the ever-increasing issue       of predation on sturgeon, lamprey, and Endangered Species Act       (ESA)-listed salmon and steelhead in the Columbia Basin.        Our agencies are acutely aware of the many issues facing       salmon, steelhead, and sturgeon in the basin. We continue to       advocate for actions to the hydro-system, hatcheries,       harvest, and habitat to support the recovery of this region's       iconic fish runs. However, if we avoid taking the hard step       of managing sea lions in the basin, recovery will be all the       more difficult for some stocks, while others will be placed       on a rapid pathway to extinction. We have already seen this       happen at Ballard Locks in Washington. Sea lions are not a       scapegoat, but managing predation is now an essential part of       recovering fish runs in the Columbia.        As amended, H.R. 2083 ensures that we retain the strong       environmental protections of the Marine Mammal Protection Act       (MMPA) and the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA),       while allowing managers the flexibility to manage sea lions       in the Columbia basin. The changes proposed in the bill will       allow the MMPA and the ESA to work together to benefit both       fish and sea lions.        H.R. 2083 provides managers flexibility to proactively       remove sea lions that are foraging on ESA-listed salmon,       steelhead, and sturgeon over 100+ miles from the ocean. These       are locations where sea lions did not historically forage.       Over a decade of scientific research has shown that 1) the       diet of sea lions at these locations is almost exclusively       salmon, steelhead, and sturgeon and 2) once sea lions locate       these areas, they return year after year. It only makes sense       to recognize the body of science that has accumulated on this       issue and adjust our management accordingly to prevent sea       lions habituating to these areas.        Sea lion predation is not just an issue at the dams.       Increasingly we are observing sea lions forage in many of the       undammed tributaries to the lower Columbia River. Many of       these tributaries contain our healthiest salmon and steelhead       populations and have large tracts of pristine habitat. These       runs are critical to recovering the larger salmon and       steelhead Evolutionary significant units (ESU). Without       passage of H.R. 2083 we can do nothing to prevent sea lions       gaining a toehold in these areas which, as we have seen at       Willamette Falls and Ballard Locks, places the fish on a       pathway to extirpation before action can be taken.        H.R. 2083 will have no impact on sea lion populations.       National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) recently       published a paper demonstrating that California sea lions are       at carrying capacity. Their population in the United States       is projected to fluctuate between 250,000-300,000 individuals       in the foreseeable future. Additionally, NOAA is required       under the MMPA to calculate the Potential Biological Removal       (PBR) level, or the number of animals that could be removed       from the population without affecting its viability. For       California sea lions, that number is currently 9,200. As a       margin of safety, the proposed legislation caps the removals       at no more than 10% of this number, for a total annual       removal not to exceed 920. This is an extremely conservative       number when put in context of the overall population.       Moreover, in the Columbia River, there are only around 300       sea lions exhibiting the problem behavior, and they are all       males. Thus, removal of these few animals will have no impact       on the population.        H.R. 2083 ensures the process currently used to oversee       permitting and program implementation stays intact. Before       new permitting there will be a NEPA review, a public comment       period, and a taskforce process. After a permit is issued,       the federally appointed taskforce is required to evaluate the       program annually and make recommendations to NMFS to improve       its effectiveness.        H.R. 2083 does not expand the limit on the number of       animals that may be lethally removed. Current law provides no       limit to the number that the National Marine Fisheries       Service may authorize states to remove. H.R. 2083 strengthens       this by placing a basin-wide cap on removal numbers that is       linked to best available science. This means that if sea lion       populations ever decline, the number of animals States and       Treaty Tribes can remove will also decline.        Our agencies are committed to ensuring our iconic salmon,       steelhead, and sturgeon are conserved for current and future       generations and that we have healthy and thriving pinniped       populations. We would be deeply grateful for your       acknowledgement that the issue of pinniped predation in the       Columbia River must be addressed legislatively. We cannot       thank you enough for your support on this issue.            Sincerely,      Joe Stohr,        Acting Director, Washington Department of Fish and       Wildlife.      Curtis E. Melcher,        Director, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife.      Virgil Moore,        Director, Idaho Fish and Game.      Jaime A. Pinkham,        Executive Director, Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish       Commission.     Mr. Chairman, I want to speak to one piece. I  keep hearing that this isn't a silver bullet. No one is claiming that  this is a silver bullet. This is a step in the right direction to  protect endangered salmon runs that are critical for commercial,  recreational, and Tribal resource use. This is really iconic to the  Pacific Northwest, and it is part of our heritage. It is something that  we would like to pass on to our kids and our grandkids. Passing this  bill today allows us to do that.   Ratepayers are so committed to this. In the States of Washington and  Oregon, ratepayers who fund the Bonneville Power Administration and the  dam--the hydro system--spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year. If  you get it all together, it almost cracks $1 billion annually that is  spent in mitigation efforts to protect the species that are impacted.   As ratepayers, we spend a lot of money to protect and support these  runs because it is so specific and unique to our way of life. This is a  critical thing for us. It is one of those things where you literally  can stand on the shore of the Columbia River and you can watch sea  lions toss salmon, and you watch them play with salmon. You can come  across carcasses of salmon on the river with a single bite mark taken  out.   I walked across and found a sturgeon longer than my arm with a single  bite mark taken out of her stomach. Basically they took the eggs--they  took the caviar--and then let it go.   We look at that and we think we, as ratepayers, because we spend  hundreds of millions of dollars to protect these runs and bring them  back into fuller health, to watch these animals not even eat a full  meal but just play with them, it makes you sick, Mr. Chairman.   So if you are someone who believes in protecting species and having a  balanced ecosystem--this isn't about picking one species over the  other. This is literally us trying to restore some balance here. It is  one of those things where you would have to fight hard to find a reason  not to support this.  [[Page H5703]]    When very liberal Governors and very conservative Republican  Governors come in and ask us to pass this legislation, it should cause  you to stop and pause. This is one of those things that this body  should be about, and today is a good chance to take a step forward in  protecting these wild runs.
