 HORN of Oklahoma. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at  the desk.    HORN of Oklahoma. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, the Export-Import Bank is a critically important tool  in the economic toolbox for Oklahoma businesses and workers. The Ex-Im  Bank has long helped Oklahoma businesses sell their products to the  global marketplace, opening the door for our economy to enter global  commerce. Over the last 5 years alone, the Ex-Im Bank's partnership  with businesses across my State has resulted in the export of more than  $500 million in goods around the world.   My amendment would require the GAO to submit to Congress, within 1  year, a report about the impact that closure of the Export-Import Bank  would have on businesses that utilize the Bank's services.   I have visited with businesses across my State and district about the  use of the Export-Import Bank and learned from them how the services of  the Ex-Im Bank helped them to export their products. One important  service that they shared with me is the Export-Import Bank's credit  insurance program. This program allows businesses to purchase insurance  and acts as a safety net in the case where a foreign buyer does not  fully pay for the product that was exported.   One company in my district is the Mills Machine Company, located in  Shawnee, Oklahoma. This small business, established in 1908, is a  family-owned custom manufacturer and worldwide exporter of earth  drilling tools and bits. Chuck Mills, the president of Mills Machine  Company, shared that the Export-Import Bank's credit insurance program  allows his company to offer open account terms to their customers with  minimal risk.   When the Ex-Im Bank's reauthorization lapsed in 2015, Mr. Mills  searched the private market for similar insurance to the Ex-Im Bank but  couldn't find anything remotely comparable. His business slowed until  the Bank's reauthorization later this year.   The Bank's lapsed reauthorization in 2015 gave us but a small window  into the economic hardship that would result if the Export-Import Bank  permanently closed for the Mills Machine Company and many other similar  businesses across this country. My amendment would help us further  understand the impact closure of the Export-Import Bank would have on  businesses across this country.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and the  reauthorization of this bill so American businesses across this country  and in Oklahoma can continue to utilize the Bank to grow their  businesses and export American products to the world.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    HORN of Oklahoma. Mr. Chairman, I will close by saying,  the information that this amendment would provide will help us to have  a broader picture of the economic impact and benefits of the services  and the benefits of the Export-Import Bank.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and the  underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    HORN of Oklahoma asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)    HORN of Oklahoma. Madam Speaker, today I rise to  recognize the 50th anniversary of the Oklahoma Intercollegiate  Legislature, a student run and led mock-government organization.   OIL has brought together thousands of young people from every corner  of my State to learn how to effect change and to make their voices  heard in our democracy.   OIL replicates every part of Oklahoma's State government, from our  legislative branch to the Governor's office to the judiciary.   The college students who participate in this program draft their own  legislation, build lifelong and often bipartisan friendships, and learn  what it takes to move an idea from concept to reality. They learn how  to craft policy, negotiate and compromise, and how to lead.   I know because, as a young college student, I was a member of OIL and  learned these lessons myself, as have so many of Oklahoma's current  leaders in government, civic, and business communities.   So, today, please join me in celebrating OIL's 50th anniversary and  the impact it has and will have on Oklahoma's students and future  leaders.                            ____________________
