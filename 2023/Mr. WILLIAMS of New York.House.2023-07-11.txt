 Madam Speaker, after a routine doctor's  appointment found an important medical issue, I am now scheduled for a  minimally invasive surgical procedure this week. This will impede my  ability to vote. Had I been present today, I would have voted ``yea''  on rollcall No. 290, H.R. 1548 and ``yea'' on rollcall No. 291, H.R.  1096.                            ____________________
