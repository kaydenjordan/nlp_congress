 Mr. President, today I recognize Florida  Blue Key and the celebration of their centennial anniversary. One  hundred years ago in 1923, Florida Blue Key was founded at the  University of Florida to foster leadership and service. Since that  time, Florida Blue Key members have served their State and our country  at every level of government, including here in the U.S. Senate. I had  the honor of being inducted into Florida Blue Key in 2014 and was  preceded in this body by fellow Members, including Lawton Chiles, Bob  Graham, Connie Mack, Bill Nelson, Marco Rubio, and George Smathers.  Today, Florida Blue Key serves as the oldest leadership honorary in the  Sunshine State and continues to graduate its membership into law,  medicine, business, and government. I would like to extend my sincere  appreciation to Florida Blue Key and wish them continued success in the  years to come.                            ____________________
