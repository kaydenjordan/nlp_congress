 Mr. Speaker, today, Democrats will take unprecedented  and urgent action when we pass the Inflation Reduction Act.   Today, we make good on our promise to take on climate change and  climate justice with historic investments in green technologies that  will cut carbon emissions by 40 percent by 2030, create over 9 million  good jobs, put $60 billion into environmental justice, and cut energy  costs for the average American family by almost $1,000 a year.   Also, for the first time, we take on Big Pharma's price gouging,  finally allowing Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices,  capping the cost of insulin, and continuing to make healthcare more  affordable. All of it is paid for with taxes on the largest  corporations and the wealthiest.   We have more to do to complete the rest of the President's agenda on  childcare, senior care, expanding Medicare, and investing in housing.  With a few more Democrats in the Senate, we will get that done, too.   Today, let's celebrate this massive investment for the people. People  over politics. Let's pass this bill.
