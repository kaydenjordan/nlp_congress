 Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the CBO score on this  legislation.       CBO's Estimate of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Effects of Rules       Committee Print 116-63, H.R. 4447, The Clean Economy Jobs and      Innovation Act, Including Manager's Amendment (Pallone 170), as          Reported by the Committee on Rules on September 21, 2020         The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 establishes budget-      reporting and enforcement procedures for legislation       affecting direct spending or revenues. The net changes in       outlays and revenues that are subject to those procedures are       shown here.        H.R. 4447 would modify existing laws and policies governing       the energy sector. CBO estimates that the provisions noted       below would have an insignificant effect on net direct       spending, revenues, and the deficit over the 2020-2030       period.        Subtitle C of Title I would require federal agencies and       data centers to implement strategies to acquire, use, and       maintain information technologies expected to increase energy       efficiency. Those provisions could affect direct spending if       agencies procure energy-efficient technologies using longterm       contracts known as energy savings performance contracts.        Subtitle F of Title II would allow operators with certain       federal leases to noncompetitively acquire the rights to       coproduce geothermal resources under that lease and to       noncompetitively lease land adjoining that lease. CBO expects       that few leases would be affected by this provision.        Subtitle C of Title IV would reduce revenues by extending       quotas for imports of uranium from Russia until 2040, which       under current law are set to expire in 2020.        Title XI would allow aggrieved persons to sue entities,       such as local governments, for discrimination that occurs in       the context of implementing environmental projects or       regulations promulgated by federal agencies. CBO expects that       provision would increase the number of suits filed in federal       court. Those changes would increase both revenues (from court       filing fees) and spending of those fees.        H.R. 4447 also would authorize the appropriation of more       than $125 billion over the 2021-2025 period for various       programs related to clean energy. Any spending would be       subject to the availability of appropriations for those       programs.        H.R. 4447 contains intergovernmental and private-sector       mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act       (UMRA). CBO estimates that the costs of mandates on private       entities would exceed the private-sector threshold       established in UMRA, and the costs of mandates on state,       local, and tribal governments would fall below the threshold       for intergovernmental mandates (those thresholds are $168       million and $84 million in 2020, respectively, adjusted       annually for inflation).     Mr. Speaker, I would also be happy to share this with my  colleague and my friend from Louisiana. The CBO score on this is zero.  So I will make sure I hand this over to him, as well, to take a look.   Mr. Speaker, at home in New Mexico, we are very proud of our national  labs, three national labs, two at the Department of Energy. New Mexico  has seen the value that the United States Department of Energy brings  to the fight against COVID-19.   Through our national labs, the Department has provided support to the  National Institutes of Health and other government agencies, leveraged  its scientific resources, but did a lot of work to improve the  epidemiological models and much more.   The Department of Energy has another important role to play by  helping to restart America's innovation economy, creating jobs, and  moving us toward economic recovery.   My amendment with Representatives Wilson, Torres Small, and Casten,  and based on the IMPACT for Energy Act, would help the Department  achieve these goals by establishing the Department of Energy-affiliated  nonprofit foundation to raise private-sector funds and leverage  expertise that supports the research, development, and commercial  application of technologies that address our Nation's energy challenges  and combat climate change.   This model works. The National Institutes of Health, CDC, and USDA  foundations have already demonstrated that they can raise billions of  private-sector dollars to support research and innovation. And  innovation, in turn, drives economic growth.   To enhance these efforts as part of the clean energy economy, we have  the Clean Economy Jobs and Innovation Act.   We will also be advancing my legislation to improve innovators'  access to national lab facilities and to develop the next generation of  tech leaders through partnership between national labs and institutions  of higher education.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this en bloc amendment  and the underlying bill.
