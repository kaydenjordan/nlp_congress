 Mr. President, Floridians will never forget the  horrific events of June 12, 2016. Four years ago, our State, Nation,  the city of Orlando, and Hispanic and gay communities were attacked,  and 49 innocent and beautiful lives were lost. It was an evil act. It  was an act of terrorism designed to divide us as a nation and strike  fear in our hearts and minds, but we didn't let it because Floridians  are resilient. We came together, and we supported each other.   The weeks following the attack will always stay with me--days spent  in hospitals with families, at funerals, at wakes with loved ones, and  countless events throughout the community. As a father and grandfather,  it was one of the hardest things I ever had to do. It was  heartbreaking. Yet, in this horribly dark time, the selfless courage of  so many--from community members, to law enforcement, to healthcare  workers--provided a sense of hope. This incredible strength, love, and  bravery uplifted the community and helped us repair and rebuild.   On the fourth anniversary of this unthinkable tragedy, the State of  Florida comes together to honor the lives lost too soon, and we vow to  always stand up and fight against evil and hatred in this world.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the  consideration of S. Res. 614, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be  agreed to, the preamble be agreed to,  [[Page S2911]]  and that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table with no intervening action or debate.
