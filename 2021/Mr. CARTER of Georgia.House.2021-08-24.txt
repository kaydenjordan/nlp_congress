 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 4.   This legislation is named after a good man and a fellow Georgian,  John Lewis, whom I was honored to call friend while we served together  in this body.   And let me remind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and  the Speaker that I was the only Republican to join you in San Diego for  the christening of the USNS John Lewis, and I  [[Page H4404]]  did it because he was my friend. I did it because he should be honored.   While he was a good man, this legislation does nothing to advance the  rights of our citizens to vote as my friends on the other side of the  aisle would claim.   H.R. 4 is a radical and unprecedented Federal power grab over State- administered elections under the guise of updating the Voting Rights  Act of 1965.   At the time, the extraordinary measures employed by the Voting Rights  Act were important, however, thankfully, as the U.S. Supreme Court  recognized in a 2013 decision, things have changed dramatically in the  U.S. since 1965.   In fact, elections in 2018 and 2020 saw record turnout among  Americans from minority communities.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 4 must be rejected to ensure that the Federal  takeover of our elections stops right here.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember and  honor Frank Peeples of Savannah, Georgia, who passed away on August 18  at the age of 93.   Frank's accomplishments in life are nothing less than remarkable. He  graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology and earned a degree  in industrial engineering. Under the leadership of Coach Bobby Dodd,  Frank made history as the first sophomore to become head manager of the  football team. He was inducted into the Georgia Tech School of  Engineering Hall of Fame and the Athletic Hall of Fame for his  remarkable achievements.   Following graduation, he served this country in the Korean war in the  United States Army. After the war, Frank achieved a global reputation  as an entrepreneur, inventor, and businessman. Frank's pride in his  service to his country and community is remarkable, and I am honored to  recognize him today.   My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends, and all who  knew him during this most difficult time.                            ____________________
