 Mr. Speaker, this is about the medical technology industry  and a manufacturing success story, one of the last expanding  manufacturing enterprises in the United States. While the U.S. is the  current worldwide leader in medical technology innovation, that  leadership is being threatened.   I am speaking to you today about the medical device tax. This  industry has a huge presence in Utah, and this unfair tax would have a  negative effect on my district and the country as a whole.                                time  1615    In Utah, this industry has created more than 10,300 jobs and  contributes over $5 billion to the State's economy.   Recently, Congress has been focused on reducing taxes to make the  United States a more attractive place to do business, but the medical  technology industry would get a significant tax increase. Even with the  recent tax changes, industry gains would be neutralized by this tax.   Under the 2.3 percent excise tax, medical device manufacturers would  be required to pay the IRS an estimated average of $194 million per  month in medical device tax payments. In Utah, BD's total impact of the  device tax is about $90 million on an annualized basis. For Edwards  Lifesciences, this would be a $30 million expense.   In a competitive global economy, this tax threatens the industry that  directly employs 400,000 Americans, generates $25 billion in payroll,  and invests nearly $10 billion in research and development annually.   American companies represent 38 percent of the global market, and the  suspended tax looms over our Nation's ability to innovate and to stay  competitive. As companies look to make cuts to offset the tax, research  and development is often the first one to go. This tradeoff undermines  the future of the industry and puts discovery of new breakthrough  medical technologies at risk. In other words, it is putting the  livelihoods of people and their health at risk.   According to figures from the U.S. Department of Commerce, the United  States medical technology industry lost nearly 29,000 jobs while the  medical device tax was in effect. When the medical device tax was  suspended, most medical device companies reinvested most of their  savings into their innovative strategies and improving United States  facilities. But long-term investment has been postponed because of the  threat that it might come back.   Mr. Speaker, it has been said that, by repealing the medical device  tax, we are going to be taking money out of Medicare. That is  absolutely ridiculous. As a matter of fact, there was a $700 billion  cut to Medicare to pay for the Affordable Care Act.    Mr. Speaker, Utah's Merit Medical was planning on spending  $1.5 million for salary increases and 401(k) benefits for hourly  workers, but they can't, unless this tax is repealed.  [[Page H7122]]    Merit Medical is also planning a $60 million R&D facility, but it is  now on hold because of the tax. In Utah, with the last suspension, BD  increased R&D spending from 6 percent to 6.5 percent in sales.   If this tax does not get repealed, the industry is forced to start  making payments. Investments will be the tradeoff, and innovation will  be stifled. This means less jobs for Americans, a less competitive  America in the medical device industry, and, potentially, an increase  in the medical cost for our constituents so that this industry can pay  for the tax.   It is time to make sure that we put money back into the hands of  Americans, American businesses, and out of the hands of government.
