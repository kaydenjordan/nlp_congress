 Mr. President, I want to take a minute to thank Senator  Collins and our staff for their hard work on the THUD bill. Their  professionalism and dedication to a thoughtful, bipartisan process has  been key to moving this bill smoothly through committee markup and the  floor.   Specifically, I want to thank Dabney Hegg, Clare Doherty, Christina  Monroe, Nathan Robinson, Jordan Stone, Gus Maples, Rajat Mathur, Jacob  Press, and Jason Woolwine.   I would also like to thank the full committee staff: Chuck Kieffer,  Shannon Hines, Chanda Betourney, Jessica Berry, David Adkins, and  Jonathan Graffeo.    Madam President, I concur entirely with the comments of my  colleagues about the dangers and challenges presented by China in many  different dimensions.   I am not going to try to defend President Trump's decision to  overrule his administration's penalties on ZTE for violating our  sanctions, but the President's actions created facts on the ground. One  of the principal facts was that part of that arrangement was a billion- dollar payment by the Chinese Government to the United States Treasury,  creating for the conferees the issue of trying to find a billion-dollar  offset if we reimpose this penalty. That billion-dollar offset could  come only from military programs of our jurisdiction, end strength of  the military, platforms we might acquire; we found it difficult to work  our way through that issue.   More important, I think, is the notion that we did not simply drop  this issue. In fact, we imposed, by legislation, a government-wide  prohibition on the acquisition of ZTE and Huawei products going  forward. It is now the law that we prohibit the Federal Government and  government contractors from buying or using or providing grants and  loans to entities buying or using telecommunications equipment and  services provided by the Chinese companies, ZTE and Huawei. Huawei is  not ignored here. It is legislatively a prohibition in the bill for  future purchases.   We understand, also, that there are some Chinese companies in the  video surveillance equipment business that also are threats. They also  have been banned going forward with respect to government acquisition  or government contractor acquisitions. So we have recognized this  issue, and we have done, I think, what we could do to ensure that our  national security is not compromised in the future by ZTE or Huawei  equipment.   With that, I suggest that we move forward and pass this legislation,  which does a remarkable job of helping the men and women of our Armed  Forces.   I will save my further remarks for later.    Madam President, I also yield back the remainder of my time  and urge passage of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization  Act.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise to discuss the fiscal year 2019  National Defense Authorization Act.   I am very pleased that we were able to pass the conference report  with a bipartisan vote of 87 to 10. I think it represents the quality  of the work that was done by my colleagues Senator Inhofe; Congressman  Thornberry, the chairman of the House committee; and also Ranking  Member Smith. I thank them for their thoughtfulness and cooperation  throughout the conference.   The passage in the Senate follows the passage last week by a vote of  359 to 54 in the House of Representatives--another strong bipartisan  endorsement of the legislation on behalf of the men and women in  uniform and the national security of the United States.   Also, at this point, I would like to take a moment to recognize  Senator John McCain. He has been an extraordinary leader throughout my  tenure in the Senate, someone who has been committed to the welfare of  the men and women of the military, someone who has spent his life in  service to the Nation with courage, with valor, and with exceptional  self-sacrifice for all of us. I am sure he is very proud today that  this legislation, which bears his name, has passed and become law.  Senator McCain has also done something that some people would think  impossible; that is, to have a West Point graduate admit that, in many  cases, he is indispensable to the national security of the United  States. I say that with great affection and great sincerity.    Let me highlight several areas that I think are important in this  legislation. The bill includes important personnel funding and policy  provisions, including a 2.6-percent, across-the-board pay raise for our  men and women in uniform. It fully funds the military services' end- strength requests for fiscal year 2019. We are going to bring our  troops--particularly, the Army--to the desired strength of our military  leaders. It provides $50 million in impact aid for heavily impacted  local school districts all across the country. This is critical of the  quality of life for the families who serve us, as well as their  servicemembers.   There are a number of provisions updating the Officer Personnel  Management System to enhance recruitment, promotion, and retention of  highly skilled officers.   With respect to the Army, the bill fully funds a number of critical  Army programs, to include the Abrams battle tanks, as well as Apache  and Blackhawk helicopters. The bill also makes targeted investments to  improve the range and lethality of Army artillery systems, and it  supports the fielding of active protection systems on our combat  vehicles in order to better protect our soldiers.   With respect to the Navy, the conference agreement provides  additional funds for vessels for the Navy, including two more littoral  combat ships, three more ship-to-shore connectors, and a cable repair  ship. The agreement also provides additional money to help second- and  third-tier contractors ramp up production to support our Columbia- and  Virginia-class submarine acquisition programs.   With regard to the Air Force, the bill provides for additional  funding to support the light attack aircraft, or the  [[Page S5545]]  OA-X. The agreement also ensures the Air Force will maintain the  current capability of the JSTARS aircraft fleet while they develop new  capabilities to replace, and perhaps even improve, the current ground  support capability of the JSTARS fleet.   This bill represents what has been the hallmark of Secretary Mattis's  strategic vision. It reflects the strategic shift toward prioritization  of the strategic competition between Russia and China. It supports the  President's budget request for resources to deter and, if necessary,  defend against aggression from near-peer competitors. This includes  $6.3 billion for the European Deterrence Initiative as a continuing  demonstration of our commitment to the security of our European allies  and the deterrence of Russian expansionism. It also requires a 5-year  plan from the Department for the Asia-Pacific Stability Initiative on  the necessary resources and activities that counter China's  destabilizing behavior in the region.   The bill also includes a provision calling on the administration to  urgently complete a comprehensive strategy to counter Russian malign  influence below the level of direct military conflict. Russia attacked  the heart of our democracy in 2016, and our intelligence experts warn  of even more sophisticated Russian attacks targeting this year's  midterm elections. Yet the administration has failed to bring together  our military and nonmilitary tools of national power to counter this  Russian aggression, despite a requirement in last year's NDAA to submit  to Congress a whole-of-government strategy to counter Russian malign  influence. This bill expresses the sense of the Congress that the  administration should complete a counter-Russian influence strategy  without delay.   The conference report also includes a provision that authorizes the  President to employ Department of Defense cyber forces to take actions  to disrupt the operations of Russian actors attempting to penetrate our  election systems and campaign organizations and to plant false and  divisive information on social media sites.   As I mentioned, the Secretary's national defense policy, which the  President endorses, focuses on the shift to the near-peer adversaries  of Russia and China. Our legislation reflects that, but we cannot  forget the threat from ISIS and extremist organizations. It persists.  This bill continues critical programs aimed at countering these groups.  Of note, it extends the Iraqi and Syrian train-and-equip programs at  the requested funding levels, while requiring appropriate information  with respect to the partner forces to be trained and the expected level  of engagement with U.S. forces. This is a prudent approach that  recognizes the continued threat from ISIS while ensuring appropriate  oversight of these authorities in a dynamic environment.   I am also pleased the bill includes provisions designed to  incorporate lessons learned from the campaign against ISIS that could  be more effectively used to account for and respond to allegations of  civilian casualties going forward.   The bill fully funds the request for U.S. Special Operations Command  and includes important provisions to enhance the ability of the  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity  Conflict to act as the ``service secretary-like'' civilian responsible  for the oversight and advocacy of the Special Operations forces that do  so much for us.   As we discussed before the vote, the bill also focuses on the issue  of the ZTE-Huawei issue that came before this Congress. The conference  agreement includes a provision that prohibits the Federal Government  and government contractors--this is governmentwide--from buying or  using or providing grants and loans to entities buying or using  telecommunications equipment and services provided by Chinese companies  ZTE and Huawei due to our serious concerns that these companies  represent security risks and have violated U.S. sanctions and export  control laws.   The provision also bans the use of video surveillance equipment from  several Chinese companies due to concerns about security risks and  infringement of intellectual property rights. The conferees recognize  the burden this ban will place on some telecommunications providers,  particularly in rural areas, and included direction that government  agencies shall prioritize available funding to enable these providers  to replace the equipment they have procured from Chinese companies.   I am also particularly pleased the conference agreement includes a  Senate floor amendment that I authored to ensure that as we proceed to  develop new or modified nuclear weapons, the Congress is in a position  to provide rigorous oversight to any such request. Given the powerful  nature of these weapons, it is essential we maintain our oversight  capability on this subject matter.   The conference report also contains important oversight language to  ensure our Nation can produce the plutonium pits the Department of  Defense requires. Los Alamos is our Nation's center of excellence in  research and manufacturing of plutonium, and we need to maintain our  focus on this laboratory in order to ensure the Department of Defense  meets their stockpile requirements with respect to pit production.    The conference report contains a number of important provisions  related to Turkey. I want to acknowledge the valuable leadership of  Senators Shaheen and Tillis in this regard. Turkey is an important NATO  ally, and the U.S.-Turkey defense cooperation is multifaceted and deep.  However, Turkey's announcement of its intent to buy the Russian S-400  air defense system threatens the integrity of the NATO alliance and  would have a significant negative impact on defense cooperation between  the United States and Turkey.   In addition, the Turkish Government's unlawful detention of Pastor  Brunson and other wrongfully held Americans has raised serious  questions and concerns about its commitment to the shared values of the  NATO alliance and the rule of law. The NDAA conference report calls for  their immediate release and requires the Secretary of Defense, in  consultation with the Secretary of State, to report to Congress on the  status of the U.S.-Turkey relationship, including the impact of  Turkey's potential purchase of the S-400 system on the bilateral  relationship.   The report must also assess, should Turkey proceed with the S-400  purchase, what the impact would be of a significant change in Turkey's  participation in the F-35 aircraft program, including reduction or  elimination of Turkey's participation. The assessment must include the  steps required to mitigate the negative impact of such a change on the  United States and other international partners in the F-35 program. The  provision also prohibits the Department of Defense from delivering any  F-35 aircraft to Turkey until the required report is submitted to the  appropriate congressional committees.   One issue in this year's NDAA conference negotiations related to  Russia sanctions is the Countering America's Adversaries Through  Sanctions Act, or CAATSA. CAATSA was an excellent piece of legislation,  and the Presiding Officer knows very well because he was the chief  author and architect of this bill.   I want to take a moment to explain exactly what the conference report  does with respect to CAATSA and how the Defense Department intends to  use the limited waiver for secondary sanctions provided in this year's  NDAA.   As I said, I strongly support CAATSA. It was a remarkable piece of  work, passing this Senate by 98 to 2. Again, it is a tribute to the  leadership not only of the Presiding Officer but Senator Menendez of  New Jersey and all of our colleagues on the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee.   Its sanctions are powerful tools for holding Russia accountable for  its interference in our elections and its aggression in Ukraine and  elsewhere. As I said, the Senate passed it overwhelmingly, 98 to 2. We  have found that the Trump administration has been resisting fully  implementing the tough sanctions against Russia that are found in  CAATSA, and I urge those sanctions be vigorously enforced.   During Senate consideration of the fiscal year 2019 defense budget  request, Defense Secretary Mattis raised a concern about one aspect of  CAATSA, relating to the secondary sanctions in section 231 on countries  or entities  [[Page S5546]]  that do business with the Russian intelligence or defense sectors.  These mandatory sanctions restrict U.S. arms sales and certain  financial dealings with countries or entities that engage in a  significant transaction to purchase major Russian weapons systems.   As Secretary Mattis testified, these secondary sanctions can,  however, have the unintended consequence of punishing certain strategic  partners that have legacy Russian weapons systems but are looking to  transition away from Russia and toward increased purchases of U.S.  major defense equipment. Because these countries may buy Russian  systems to maintain current capabilities, section 231 sanctions would  block U.S. arms sales to them, effectively pushing these countries  closer to Russia and making them more dependent on Russian weapons  systems. This is the opposite effect of what CAATSA is intended to  achieve and undermines our efforts to isolate Russia globally.   To address these concerns, Secretary Mattis requested a straight  national security waiver to section 231 mandatory sanctions. While  CAATSA, as enacted, does include a broad national security waiver, the  waiver is subject to CAATSA's expedited review procedures, which  provides Congress between 30 and 60 days to review the waiver request.  If Congress objects, Congress can try to pass a joint resolution of  disapproval under the expedited procedures. If Congress fails to enact  a resolution of disapproval within the review period, then the waiver  takes effect.   The administration contended that CAATSA's national security waiver,  subject to the expedited review procedures, was unworkable. They  claimed that because the mandatory sanctions that would kick in while  Congress reviewed the waiver request for up to 60 days or more--this  would cause significant harm to our defense partnerships with these  countries and drive them away from purchasing major U.S. defense  equipment.   In response, the House bill included authority for the President to  waive section 231's mandatory sanctions on countries or entities buying  major Russian defense equipment if the President makes certain  certifications, primarily that the purchaser is reducing its reliance  on the Russian defense sector.   The House bill was a very wide-open waiver. The only representation  of certification the President would make is that the Nation was  attempting to move away from Russian influence and Russian supplies.   We worked very closely with House colleagues. The Senate version of  the NDAA did not have any language with CAATSA, but we had to respond  to the House because it was a legitimate issue in conference. Indeed,  one of the reasons we avoided any sort of discussion with respect to  CAATSA in the Senate was the feeling that there might be a negative  impact on the ongoing bilateral relationship with Turkey to persuade  the Turkish Government to reverse its decision to buy the Russian S-400  air defense system. Turkey's purchase of the S-400 would almost trigger  mandatory sanctions under section 231 and put our defense cooperation  with Turkey at risk, including on the F-35 aircraft.   The final conference outcome, after discussions back and forth, in a  very serious and very thoughtful way, was a very narrow waiver for  section 231 sanctions only and reflects a number of important changes  to the House provision that raised the bar for the President even to be  able to invoke this waiver.   First, the conference outcome preserves all existing CAATSA sanctions  currently in effect against Russia, including sanctions for Russia's  election interference and aggression against Ukraine.   Second, the waiver is not available for any transactions with  entities in the Russian defense and intelligence sectors that were  directly involved in Russian cyber intrusions, including the Russian  military intelligence, or GRU. This preserves the purpose of section  231 sanctions, which is to impose costs on the Russian defense and  intelligence sectors for cyber intrusions.   Third, the waiver is limited in order to keep the pressure on Turkey  to reverse its decision to purchase the Russian S-400 air defense  system. The waiver is not available for any deals to purchase Russian  weapons systems that would harm the integrity of NATO or other  alliances in which the United States participates or that would  adversely affect ongoing U.S. or coalition operations or that would  harm U.S. defense cooperation with the country involved or that would  significantly increase the risk of compromising U.S. defense systems or  operational capabilities, including through the diversion of sensitive  U.S. defense technology.   These restrictions are intended to let the Government of Turkey know  that the waiver is not a get-of-jail-free card for section 231's  mandatory sanctions if Turkey goes ahead and purchases the S-400.   Fourth, the conference outcome allows for continued defense  cooperation with countries transitioning away from Russia. Secondary  sanctions may be waived only if the country is reducing its dependence  on Russian major weapons systems or is cooperating with the United  States on security matters critical to our strategic interests.   This restriction should be narrowly understood to mean that the  country involved is cooperating with the United States in the strategic  competition with Russia or China, consistent with the administration's  national defense strategy authored by Secretary Mattis. As set in the  national defense strategy, the central challenge to U.S. security today  is the ``re-emergence of long-term strategic competition'' by  revisionist powers--specifically Russia and China.   Fifth, the conference outcome provides for congressional review under  a 30-day notice-and-wait period as an alternative to expedited  congressional review procedures provided under CAATSA. Congress would  still have 30 days to review the President's certifications with regard  to any sanctionable activity and to weigh in with its concerns.   Sixth, the conference outcome also enhances congressional oversight  of CAATSA's secondary sanctions by adding a report. This report will  provide an important baseline for measuring the extent to which  countries are reducing their reliance on Russia and requires updated  information for the next 5 years on which countries are reducing their  transactions with the Russian defense sector.   Some of my colleagues have expressed concern that the conference  report's waiver for section 231 sanctions is delinked from CAATSA's  expedited review procedures. They are concerned that Congress may be  giving up its ability to conduct oversight on administrative attempts  to invoke waivers.   First, let me try to clear up one thing. The authority under CAATSA,  as enacted, for a broad national security waiver--subject to an  expedited congressional review process--remains unchanged under the  conference report and continues to apply to the vast majority of  sanctions against Russia under CAATSA.   More importantly, we should keep in mind how the Department of  Defense intends to use the limited waiver to section 231 provided in  the NDAA. As Secretary Mattis wrote to Chairman McCain on July 24, the  Department seeks a ``limited exception'' that would ``allow the United  States to sell military equipment and enable countries pulling away  from the Russian orbit.'' Secretary Mattis further noted that U.S. arms  sales are subject to congressional notification in advance. In other  words, Secretary Mattis is seeking to avoid the disruption to U.S. arms  sales to key strategic partners that would result under section 231  sanctions and to prevent the negative impact such sanctions would have  on our strategic relationships with these countries as they transition  away from Russia.   Even with the limited exception provided under this bill, Congress  will still have significant oversight of any U.S. arms sales to  countries being exempted from section 231 sanctions. Any sale of U.S.  major defense equipment to these transitioning countries--like India,  for example--will continue to be subject to congressional review under  the well-established requirements of the Arms Export Control Act.   That means that Congress typically will have at least 30 days, and  often more, to review and approve any foreign military sale for major  defense  [[Page S5547]]  equipment to a country that has received the waiver to  secondary sanctions under section 231. Large arms sales are likely to  be subject to the FMS review process, but significant direct commercial  sales must also be notified to the Foreign Relations Committee 30 days  in advance of the export license being issued. The result is that  Congress has the ability to conduct oversight of these transactions.    Furthermore, under the Arms Export Control Act, Congress has  procedures for pursuing a resolution of disapproval prohibiting or  modifying the proposed arms sales. Congress's oversight of any major  U.S. arms sales that might flow from a waiver of secondary sanctions  under section 231 provides us an additional ability to revise and  supervise the administration's implementation of this waiver authority.   There are specific cases that one could talk about in terms of  countries that we are actually trying to engage, such as India,  Indonesia, and other countries, but I think what we have tried to do is  to structure a very discrete and, in the terms the Secretary of Defense  has used, very stringent conditions to the exercise of the sanctions.   Let me conclude by again thanking Senator Inhofe, Chairman  Thornberry, Ranking Member Smith, and all of the conferees for their  bipartisanship throughout the process. This process has been collegial,  and this is an example of a strong piece of legislation that addresses  concerns of Members on both sides of the aisle.   I would also like to thank the staff of the Senate Armed Services  Committee and the House Armed Services Committee for all of their hard  work on drafting a thoughtful and comprehensive bill. Their diligent  work is a tribute to us all.   I would be remiss if I didn't single out these extraordinary  individuals. I thank Senator McCain's staff director, Chris Brose, who  did a superb job; Senator Inhofe's staff director, Luke Holland, Tony  McLain; on my staff, Jody Bennett, Jon Clark, Gary Leeling, Creighton  Greene, Jonathan Epstein, Ozge Guzelsu, Jon Green, Kirk McConnell, John  Quirk, Arun Seraphin, Carolyn Chuhta, Maggie McNamara, Mike Noblet,  Jorie Feldman, Bill Monahan, and my staff director, Elizabeth King. I  also want to thank Jen Stewart and Paul Arcangeli. They are the staff  directors for Chairman Thornberry and Ranking Member Smith,  respectfully. They did a superb job.   With their work and with the inspiration of Senator McCain, we were  able to pass an extraordinary and I think very effective piece of  legislation.   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.    I will be happy to.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
