 Mr. Speaker, in 2015, Russian authorities arrested Oleg  Sentsov, Ukrainian filmmaker and human rights activist, for protesting  the occupation of Crimea and sentenced him to 20 years in prison.   On May 14 of this year, he began a hunger strike that has lasted over  130 days. Russia has unjustly imprisoned over 150 individuals. They  suffer psychiatric confinement, closed trials, and harsh prison  conditions. Russia also threatened to strip dissidents and members of  religious minorities their parental rights.   Oleg is in prison north of the Arctic Circle. He receives IV  treatments of saline, amino acids, and vitamins. His sister reported in  September that he thinks he will die soon.   Mr. Speaker, I call upon Russian authorities to release Oleg Sentsov,  and I call upon them to protect political free speech, religious  liberty, and the sovereignty of international borders.                            ____________________
