 Mr. President, I have enjoyed the colloquy here between  our colleagues on election interference. I am privileged to serve on  the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that has undertaken a 3\1/ 2\-year-long investigation of the election interference that occurred  in 2016, and I think the five-volume report of the Select Committee on  Intelligence--bipartisan report--is indicative of the seriousness with  which we all treat this subject.   But I appreciate the Senator from Idaho, the chairman of the Banking  Committee, for his comments, for refreshing all of our memories about  the huge amounts of money that we have spent in assistance to State and  local election authorities, as well as the good work being done by the  Department of Homeland Security to help them secure their networks  against cyber attacks, as well as other elements of the U.S.  Government, including our intelligence community, the National Security  Agency, and others.   This is important work, but I agree with him--this is not how we  actually build bipartisan consensus here, by coming and asking for  unanimous consent without going through the appropriate procedures and,  frankly, the hard work that it takes to build consensus.                       Nomination of Amy Coney Barrett    Mr. President, on another matter, today the Senate Judiciary  Committee advanced the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to serve  on the Supreme Court.   Throughout her hearing last week, Judge Barrett wowed America and  certainly my constituents in Texas with her impressive knowledge of the  law and her clear understanding about the limited but important role  that judges play in our Republic.   She followed the precedent set down by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the so- called Ginsburg rule, and refrained from answering questions on how she  would rule in future cases or commenting on contentious political  issues. I think she was correct to do so. We shouldn't embroil judges  in the political controversies that we debate here. Judges are not  policymakers, primarily. They are certainly not accountable to the  voters. They have lifetime tenure. That is why their responsibilities  are limited but important at the same time. Nor by asking her questions  back in 2017 about her religious beliefs, whether she is an orthodox  Catholic, having to listen to statements like ``Well, the dogma lives  loudly within you'' because she is a woman of faith, suggesting that  somehow she would violate her oath as a judge and impose her own views  instead of the law from the role--from the bench.   Well, I think Judge Barrett took all of us to school a little bit and  reminded us very clearly that it is a judge's job to impartially apply  the law as written, whether it is the Constitution itself or the laws  that Congress passes. She not only stated her commitment to this most  basic principle, but she also has a record to back it up. During her  time on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Barrett has sided  with her colleagues 95 percent of the time in more than 600 cases.   It is no surprise that the American Bar Association, which the  minority leader has called the gold standard, gave Judge Barrett its  highest rating, saying she is well qualified to serve on the Supreme  Court. But we all knew that.   As I looked around the room during the first day of questioning, I  noticed all the binders that people like me and my other colleagues  had--notebooks, piles of paper, books, reference books on both the  desks of Republican and Democratic members of the committee. If my  colleagues' materials preparing for this historic hearing were anything  like mine, they included previous decisions by Judge Barrett, academic  writings, letters of support, and detailed background information about  her career.   But I noted that, as Judge Barrett was answering our questions, she  seemed to be doing so without even glancing down at any notes. So I  asked Judge Barrett--I violated the No. 1 rule that you learn as a  lawyer not to ask a question you don't know the answer to. I did it  anyway because I had a hunch. I asked her to hold up the notepad  sitting in front of her to show us what materials she had been using  during the hearing. It was a memorable moment. She held it up and  smiled, and it was blank. I think that spoke volumes about her  competency, her preparation, her intelligence--all things that would  commend her confirmation.   Well, with each question she answered, Judge Barrett demonstrated her  vast knowledge of the law. She made clear she understood, as I said,  the limited role of judges, and she showed compassion and heart as she  poured herself into her work each and every day.   Numerous Senators have noted that, under ordinary circumstances, a  nominee like this would get overwhelming support, but unfortunately  these aren't normal circumstances. Our colleagues on the other side  made clear from the get-go that, for them, this confirmation process  wasn't even about the nominee or her qualifications. They attempted to  hijack the hearing and use it for--well, it is a harsh word, but it is  true--fearmongering.   Last week's hearing was like split-screen TV. On one half, Republican  Senators asked the judge about her judicial philosophy, prior rulings,  and a range of constitutional doctrines. On the other half, our  Democratic colleagues delivered monologues about ObamaCare--about a  future case that she may be called upon to participate in. They  attempted to convince the American people that if she was confirmed,  she would somehow take away their healthcare. Well, that is, at bottom,  an insult to the judge. It somehow presumes that she is essentially  auditioning for the job based on her ruling in a future case. That  would violate every aspect of a judge's oath.   As Judge Barrett noted, judges don't make policy pronouncements; they  decide cases. And she very carefully described the case that is pending  in front of the Supreme Court. It is not about ObamaCare writ large; it  is about a technical doctrine called severability: If one part of a  statute is deemed unconstitutional--and this one, I believe, is, the  individual mandate, because we zeroed out the penalty under the Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act--the question is, Does the rest of the legislation-- does the rest of ObamaCare stand, or does it all have to be struck  down?   Well, she noted that there had been a number of cases decided  recently by the current Supreme Court that seemed to treat severability  with particular care. Indeed, as a scholastic, as an academic, I think  she and others noted that it is not exactly appropriate for judges to  go out and strike down statutes except to the extent that they are  unconstitutional.   They said: If she is not coming for your healthcare, she will serve  corporate interests, destroy the environment, somehow chip away at our  liberties.   These are nothing but baseless scare tactics and stunts from our  Democratic colleagues. The latest one came this morning, when they  actually boycotted the Judiciary Committee vote on Judge Barrett. They  couldn't even be bothered to show up and vote against the nominee they  claim is a threat to our democracy. So do you know what? Judge Barrett  was confirmed unanimously by the Senators present today.   Instead, in their chairs, they had large photographs, much like we  have seen at sports arenas and ballparks in the wake of the pandemic,  since we have had to socially distance. You can't have a large crowd at  the ballpark. So people have these cutouts.  [[Page S6394]]  That is what it looked like in the Judiciary Committee today.   As I said, because of their antics, because of this stunt, Senator  Graham asked for unanimous consent to proceed with the markup, and, of  course, there was no objection because any potential objector had  voluntarily absented themself.   The truth of the matter is, Judge Barrett's qualifications speak  louder than the unsubstantiated claims made by her opposition. She  graduated at the top of her class from Notre Dame Law School. She held  two prestigious clerkships, including on the Supreme Court. She has  litigated in the trenches before transitioning into academia, where she  wrote and taught constitutional law, about our Federal courts and  statutory interpretation. And, as I said, for the last 3 years, she has  put all of that great experience and training to work on the Seventh  Circuit.   This is an exceptional judge with a clear record of faithfully and  impartially applying the law, and she will bring additional value to  the U.S. Supreme Court.   One of the things I thought was so remarkable is that Judge Barrett  is also an incredible role model. I think her elevation to the highest  Court in the land should be an encouragement to young women who aspire  to professional success and as a great role model on how to balance  what we all try to figure out how to balance, which is your  professional and your personal life. She and her husband do a marvelous  job with their seven children, both being full-time professionals.   If confirmed, she would be the first mother of school-aged children  to serve as a Justice and only the fifth woman to serve on the high  Court. She would also be the first Justice on the current Court with a  degree from a law school other than Yale and Harvard and bring much  needed educational diversity to the bench.   Judge Amy Coney Barrett will serve our country well on the high  Court, and I have full faith in her ability to faithfully and  impartially apply the law as written.   I want to thank Chairman Graham for leading a fair and respectful  hearing. The ranking member, Senator Feinstein, made that observation,  and I thought that was very generous and civil of her. I would note  that many of the more radical folks on the left have attacked Senator  Feinstein for her civility, and they are just wrong. I think she  remains a good role model for all of us. We can have our disagreements  without being rude or uncivil or disagreeable. I think Senator  Feinstein is a model for that.   I am proud to support Judge Barrett's nomination in the Judiciary  Committee, and I look forward to voting for her next week on the Senate  floor
