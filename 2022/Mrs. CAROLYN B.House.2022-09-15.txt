 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House  Resolution 1339, I call up the bill (H.R. 302) to impose limits on  excepting competitive service positions from the competitive service,  and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials on the bill before  us.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 302, the Preventing a  Patronage System Act, introduced by Government Operations Subcommittee  Chair Gerry Connolly along with Representative Brian Fitzpatrick.   This straightforward bill affirms Congress' role in making major  changes to the civil service system and ensures that no President can  do so unilaterally.   Now, that may sound simple, but this is critical to upholding the  merit system principles that have been in place for almost 140 years  and fortify the civil service of America.   Career Federal workers serve both Democratic and Republican  administrations. They do their jobs guided by their expertise and best  judgment, not by allegiance to any political agenda.   In 2020, former President Trump issued an executive order creating a  new Federal employee classification in the excepted service called  schedule F. Employees transferred to schedule F would have been  stripped of workplace protections and converted to at-will employees.  If the order had been fully implemented, it could have harmed tens of  thousands of Federal employees.   Agencies were directed to identify civil service positions with a  policymaking function to convert to schedule F who would be more easily  removed from their jobs for not rubberstamping the President's  political agenda. Presumably, those positions could then be filled with  people who would be more loyal to the President.   Fortunately, one of the first things that President Biden did upon  taking office was to revoke the schedule F executive order. But the  order still shocked the Federal workforce.   Such an attack against the integrity of the civil service should  shock us all, particularly as Members of Congress. We depend on the  Federal workforce to serve impartially and in accordance with the law.  Schedule F would have instead put immense pressure on Federal workers  to bend to the political whims of the President, even if it meant  violating the law or Federal regulations.   But this bill is not just about the past. It applies the lessons we  learned from schedule F to prevent similar efforts to undermine the  Federal workforce in the future, whether from a Republican or  Democratic President.   There are some who are ready and waiting to reinstitute a system like  schedule F if given the opportunity. We must prevent that, and we can  take a big step toward that today by passing the Preventing a Patronage  System Act.   Mr. Speaker, I commend Chairman Connolly for his leadership on this  bill and for making it a bipartisan bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support it, and I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H7849]]                                     time  1230     MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume to respond to my colleagues who mentioned a  problem with poor performers in the Federal workforce. Federal managers  have tools now to remove poor performers when appropriate. In fact,  over 10,000 Federal employees were removed last year from their jobs  for poor performance.   This bill does not change the removal process for employees who are  not performing their jobs well, and schedule F was never about removing  employees who are performing poorly. That policy was designed to  intimidate and remove career employees who dared to provide impartial  advice that may be perceived as contrary to an administration's  political agenda. Civil servants are supposed to help administrations  follow the law.   So let's set the record straight about schedule F. It was intended to  punish Federal employees doing their jobs ethically and legally.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Connolly), the chairman of the Government Operations  Subcommittee, and the author and sponsor of this bill.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield an  additional 1 minute to the gentleman from Virginia.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to  the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished majority  leader of the House of Representatives.                                time  1245     MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   I would like to respond to the gentlewoman who may not have been here  when I made my previous remarks, because I point out that this is not  about making it hard to remove poor performers. The Federal Government  can and does remove poor performers where appropriate. And there is a  process for that.   According to data from the Office of Personnel Management, the  Federal Government removed 10,687 employees in Fiscal Year 2021.   It is in the public's best interest to ensure that the President  cannot take action that would politicize the civil service and threaten  the integrity of the work that we depend on civil servants to perform  every day.   One expert on Federal human resources, Jeff Neal, has explained that  the tension that can exist between career employees and political  appointees  [[Page H7853]]  usually reflects the ``need to ensure that proposals are legal'' and  that ``statutory and regulatory requirements, such as the  Administrative Procedure Act, are met.''   In other words, this tension is actually a sign that the system is  working, and procedures are being properly followed. That is certainly  not poor performance or cause for removal.   Schedule F would have improperly targeted those who ensure legality,  equity, and appropriate stewardship of taxpayer dollars.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from the District  of Columbia (Ms. Norton), a distinguished member of the Committee on  Oversight and Reform and a champion for workers.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume to respond to the gentleman's statement.   Schedule F was never about removing employees who were performing  poorly. That was not the purpose. There is already a procedure in place  for that.   It aimed to strip workplace protections away from Federal employees  so that anyone who didn't adhere to an ideology aligned with the  President, the former President, could be easily replaced with someone  who did.   That is a violation of the impartiality with which the civil service  is meant to operate. It is supposed to be an independent, merit-based  system not tied to ideology.   If changes that consequential are to be made to the civil service,  they shouldn't happen without the approval of Congress. That is what  this bill does. This bill preserves Congress' authority in civil  service policy. People can't come in willy-nilly and change the system  and make it a partisan system overnight.   If implemented, schedule F would have placed Federal employees'  careers in the hands of political appointees who could fire them for  presenting data, evidence, or views that contradict the political whims  of an administration.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from the great State  of Virginia (Mr. Beyer), the distinguished chairman of the Joint  Economic Committee.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I refer to my prior  statements and reiterate that schedule F was never about removing  employees who are performing poorly. There is a whole process to do  that.   This is about protecting the integrity of a merit-based system, so  people are not retaliated against and fired because they are not doing  what somebody is dictating them to do.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Green), the distinguished Representative and chairman of the  Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the Financial Services  Committee.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time, and I will respond to my very good friend, who I  have tremendous respect for.   I do not represent the Washington workforce. I represent New York  City. I represent the private sector, the private-sector capital of the  world, New York City, Manhattan. That is who I represent.   I also represent taxpayers, a lot of them, and they want their money  to be spent for good government. They want the people working in the  government to be impartial and dedicated to doing the best job possible  without political influence. That is exactly what this bill we are  talking about today is about.   Schedule F, as I repeat, was never about removing employees who were  performing poorly. We have a whole system to do that. We removed over  10,000 last year. This is about protecting employees who are doing a  good job from political influence.   I reiterate the crucial role of the people who make up the  professional and nonpolitical civil service in delivering government  services to our constituents, protecting our democracy, and carrying  out agency missions across the Federal Government.   Injecting undue political influence into that system, as schedule F  would have done, would be disastrous for the merit system we have in  place.                                time  1315    When we pass this bill today, we are making sure that no President of  either party, Democrat or Republican, can ever unilaterally take such  destructive action in the future.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support a merit system, to support the civil service system that has  served us so well, to vote to keep politics out of the civil service  system, and to support the important underlying bill.   I congratulate my colleague and very good friend, Mr. Connolly, on  his excellent work on this bill. It is bipartisan. We have three  Republicans. But I hope that we will pick up more, because this is  about voting for freedom, democracy, independence, good government, you  name it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support this important bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in  opposition to the amendment offered by my good friend, Representative  Hice.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 302 preserves  congressional authority to make sure that no President can establish a  destructive policy like schedule F in the future without the approval  of Congress.   The amendment would do the exact opposite. It opens the door for an  administration to implement the revoked schedule F executive order and  dangerously politicize the Federal workforce.   For all the reasons this was bad policy in 2020, it remains bad  policy today.   Schedule F evaded congressional oversight in an attempt to make the  civil service an instrument of partisan politics rather than the  nonpartisan professional, independent workforce that Congress intended  it to be.   Schedule F would replace a professional system with a patronage  system, discouraging civil service employees from providing impartial  advice based on the facts or reporting waste, fraud, and abuse.   Reviving this attack on Federal employees also makes it harder to  retain and hire qualified employees, which further erodes the ability  of the agencies to carry out their mission.   I strongly oppose this amendment, and I urge Members on both sides of  the aisle to vote ``no.''   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes  to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly), the chairman of the  Subcommittee on Government Operations, and the sponsor and author of  this bill, H.R. 302.
