 Madam Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to report  some very sad news that late last week Kentucky lost a champion, and my  congressional office lost a friend and a true warrior with the passing  of our beloved field representative, Amelia Brown Wilson, at the young  age of 39.   Amelia was born and raised in Monroe County. Like me, she graduated  from Monroe County High School and her family and my family go back  many generations through Monroe County.   Amelia was someone that I noticed coming up along the public school  system as someone who was going to be a future superstar, someone who  had class, who had brains, who had a work ethic, who had charisma. And  I followed Amelia through her educational career. Amelia's older sister  Kelly and I played ball together on the varsity girls' and boys'  basketball team of Monroe County. We also went to Western Kentucky  University at the same time. Amelia obviously was a little younger.   Amelia went to the University of Kentucky because she was the biggest  University of Kentucky fan in the history of Kentucky. She got three  degrees from the University of Kentucky. I don't know anyone else that  can say that. Amelia got her bachelor's degree, her master's degree,  and her Ph.D. all from the University of Kentucky.   Amelia worked right out of the University of Kentucky in the  Cooperative Extension Service as the family consumer scientist for  Fayette County, which is Lexington, Kentucky, for many years.   Amelia and I always kept in touch, and I knew she was someone with a  very bright future.   But while Amelia was at University of Kentucky, she had to receive a  liver transplant, and she went through that battle. And for the 20  years after her liver transplant she battled sickness almost daily, but  you would never know that because Amelia always had a positive  attitude.   Amelia was one of the kindest, most sincere people that you would  ever meet. Amelia is someone that everyone who met her loved her,  respected her, and was inspired by her, especially if they heard her  story.   Amelia was very active in the Kentucky Organ Donor Program. She was a  spokesperson for that program and gave speeches around the State and  got thousands and thousands of people to sign up on the back of their  Kentucky driver's license to be a Kentucky organ donor.   So we will never know how many lives Amelia saved because of her  testimony and her story that she would deliver all over Kentucky.                                time  1230    When I was elected Commissioner of Agriculture in Kentucky, I asked  Amelia to come join me at the Department of Agriculture and be my  Kentucky Director of Agriculture Tourism. She did that.   Madam Speaker, I had about 275 employees. I can say with confidence  that Amelia was the most popular employee in the Kentucky Department of  Agriculture. Everybody loved her. And when I got elected to Congress in  2016, Amelia followed me. She was the one employee who I asked to go  from the Kentucky Department of Agriculture in Frankfort, Kentucky,  with me to create my new field office in Madisonville, Kentucky. Amelia  was my field representative for the northwestern part of the First  Congressional District of Kentucky.   Madam Speaker, every county judge and every mayor--every elected  official--Democrat and Republican--in those counties worked with  Amelia, respected Amelia, loved Amelia, and are saddened by the tragic  loss of Amelia's life this past week.   I can't say that I have ever met a person who was more sincere and  more inspiring than Amelia Wilson. She is a Christian. She is someone  who lived a purpose-driven life, and she is someone who we will all  greatly miss.   Heaven gained an angel last week with Amelia Brown Wilson. Our  prayers go out to her husband, Allen; and her mother, Sarah Faye; and  her sisters, Kellie and Keri Jo.                            ____________________
