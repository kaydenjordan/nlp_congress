 Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this amendment.   I would like to point out that oftentimes the opposition party talks  about States' rights, but when it comes to fighting for climate,  cleaning up our air and our water, making sure that people can combat a  climate crisis, then: Do you know what? We are going to get involved.  We are going to stop these States from doing something that they have  been doing.   California is a leader in combating climate change--a leader. We have  reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and we are on target to implement a  lot of our top goals: 100 percent renewable energy and carbon  neutrality by 2045, zero-emission vehicles, and curbing greenhouse gas  emissions.   I also, when I was in the State legislature, passed a law that said  that more of the money from greenhouse gas emission fees must go to the  most disadvantaged and the most impacted communities of climate change.  That means that not only are we reducing our carbon footprint, but we  are also giving resources directly back to these communities.   So let's not get in the way. Let's not stop California's progress,  because it is a leader for not only the country, but the world.
