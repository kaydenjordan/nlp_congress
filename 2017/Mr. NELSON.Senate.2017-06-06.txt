Mr. President, it is fitting that today, June 6, the  anniversary of D-day in Europe and the Battle of Midway in the Pacific,  we are talking about our country's veterans in the debate that is going  on in the Senate. The brave men and women who have served our country  deserve the very best care our Nation can give them. That is why I rise  today in support of the VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection  Act, which I believe will pass by a voice vote in the Senate later this  afternoon.   This bipartisan bill will help improve the quality of care our  veterans receive by reforming the Department of Veterans Affairs and  making it easier for the Secretary of the VA to fire poorly performing  employees. The legislation will allow the VA to hold its employees more  accountable. It will also create new protections for whistleblowers-- those who report wrongdoing. And it would ensure that any employee who  is terminated has an adequate opportunity to appeal their dismissal.   For years, the VA has been plagued by reports of inefficiency and  long wait times. I might say that often we find those reports are true,  but that is completely separate from the quality of medical care that  is given through the VA healthcare system. If you talk to almost any  veteran, they are very pleased with the quality of that medical care.  It is the administrative stuff getting in the way, and that is what  there has been such an outrage about.   Well, this VA bill is going to help the VA get rid of the bad actors  while protecting the good ones. I want to make it clear that the vast  majority of VA employees perform their work admirably in an often  thankless environment. These dedicated public servants work hard to  provide the day-to-day care our veterans deserve, and they should be  protected. That is why, while I believe it is important to hold poorly  performing employees accountable, I also believe that it is important  to protect the rights of the employees who may have been wrongly  terminated, especially at the lower levels, by giving them the  opportunity to appeal a supervisor's decision to fire them. This bill  we are going pass does that. It is supported by dozens of veterans  service organizations, the Office of Special Counsel, the Secretary  himself. So I urge our colleagues to join me and join so many of us in  voting in favor of the bill.    I would also say that on this very famous day, this anniversary, June  6, I have been to the beaches of Normandy, I have been to Omaha Beach.  As a matter of fact, while there, it is impossible to walk into that  cemetery on the cliff overlooking the beach--it is impossible to walk  into that beautiful, beautiful American cemetery and not become very,  very emotional, realizing what happened in 1944.   I felt so strongly about this that at one point I wanted to put on my  jogging shoes and run the 4 miles of that Omaha Beach. I wanted to  reach back into time, having been there where so many sacrificed so  much.   Then, of course, the Battle of Midway, the time which turned the  battle in the Pacific, where a young admiral showed his courage and his  superiority in planning. As a result, that battle turned around the  course of the war in the Pacific with Japan. What a day to remember,  June 6.   I yield the floor.   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam President, we are all united in support of a  strong and effective VA that is able to provide topnotch services and  support to the veterans who have served our country nobly. None of us  can be satisfied with the current state of the Department, and I share  the frustration of constituent veterans who are unable to get the basic  care and treatment they need, from widows and families who have lost  loved ones while under the care of the VA, and from dedicated VA  employees who are frustrated with the waste and inept management that  prevent them from providing the care they believe our veterans deserve.  The revelations about the continuing problems at the District of  Columbia VA medical center should serve as a new wake-up call that  immediate attention is needed to make the VA right.   I supported the nomination of Dr. David Shulkin to be VA Secretary  and gave him my full support to make changes to the organization to  address the management problems and lapses in care that plague the VA.  There is no question that the VA needs reforms that will make it more  responsive to the needs of our veterans, and more accountable when it  does not adequately serve them.   The VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act attempts to  address these issues by making it easier for management to discipline  and remove VA employees. It is essential that managers have this  authority to remove employees who violate their duty to care for our  veterans. It is also important that our removal process be implemented  in a fair and impartial manner. The House bill failed to provide those  protections, and I appreciate Senator Tester's work on this issue and  his efforts to improve the bill that the House passed. I am concerned,  however, that some provisions in the bill weaken the worker protections  that are necessary to avoid arbitrary or politically motivated  disciplinary actions. Our Nation's civil service protections are  intended to allow Federal workers to do their jobs free of intimidation  or political interference. Employees can be disciplined or removed, but  only with due process that exposes the full facts of the case. Reforms  that rely on fear of arbitrary discipline or removal are not truly  reforms, but will create a toxic environment within the agency. While I  have concerns about some of the provisions of this bill, we must  provide veterans the care and support they need from the VA.   I admire the dedication and commitment of our Federal workers at the  VA, many of whom are veterans themselves. Most care deeply and go the  extra mile to serve those who have served. I know that Secretary  Shulkin  [[Page S3277]]  recognizes the enormous talent in our Federal workers, and I believe he  should strive to create a stronger team by rapidly filling the 45,000  vacant civil service positions currently at the VA and by building on  the strong sense of purpose that motivates our VA Federal workforce and  cares for our veterans.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I ask consent that LCDR Michael Chesnut,  U.S. Navy, a defense legislative fellow in my office, be granted floor  privileges for the duration of his fellowship.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________
