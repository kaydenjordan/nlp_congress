 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to raise awareness of a plague  affecting our Nation and our world. It is called human trafficking.  There are more than 40 million victims worldwide, and it happens in our  backyards right here in congressional districts throughout the country.  My district, because of the geographic location in California's Central  Valley, sees a disproportionately high amount of human trafficking that  takes place.   Fighting this atrocity requires all of us to come together with a  comprehensive strategy. Organizations like Breaking the Chains in my  district are needed to support survivors. Law enforcement needs to hold  perpetrators accountable.   This week as the co-chairs of the bipartisan Congressional Victims'  Rights Caucus, Congressman Pete Olson and I are introducing a  resolution in the House to support the observation of National Slavery  and Human Trafficking Prevention Month. It is sad that we have to bring  this kind of recognition, but it is the reality.   This resolution calls for the Federal Government to coordinate its  efforts and fight human trafficking between agencies and State and  local governments as well as other organizations. We in the  Congressional Victims' Rights Caucus will continue to lead and push  this effort. We need to work together.                            ____________________
