 Madam President, on Friday, our country received another  extraordinary bit of news about the state of our economic recovery.  Last month, the economy created 467,000 new jobs, far exceeding all  expectations. This comes on the heels of news that our economy grew at  its fastest rate in decades last year.   With last week's jobs numbers, the U.S. economy now has added a total  of 6.6 million jobs in President Biden's first year in office. Let me  say that again. In 1 year alone, the economy has added a whopping 6.6  million jobs back to the economy--the most ever recorded for a  President's first year. This includes the creation of 367,000  manufacturing jobs--the most in 30 years.   For all the difficulties of the past 2 years and for the real  challenges our economy faces today, this jobs number is a remarkable  milestone. It is a reminder that who gets elected to office makes a big  difference.   A year ago, Democrats promised to fix the mess our country was in  after President Trump botched our pandemic response. We promised to  lift our economy out of the abyss, to get people back to work, back to  the classroom, and to do it safely by following the science. It is why  Democrats worked furiously last year to pass the American Rescue Plan.  It is why the Senate came together to pass USICA, which we will work to  enact into law in the near future. It is why we came together to pass a  historic, bipartisan infrastructure package that is now putting people  back to work fixing our roads, bridges, internet, lead piping, and so  much more.   With 6.6 million jobs gained and record economic growth in our first  year, Democrats are delivering on our promise. And it is not just that  job creation exceeded expectations; wages for American workers grew in  2021, and indications from top forecasters are that wages will continue  to grow in 2022.   A year into executing our Democratic agenda, the American economy is  in the midst of a historic turnaround, but the job is not over. Even as  wages are up, Democrats are taking action to lower costs. We need to  help everyday families afford the daily essentials, just as we need to  relieve our supply chains and rebuild American manufacturing, including  by focusing on critical technologies like semiconductors.  [[Page S530]]    We took an important step in the right direction last week after the  House passed the companion legislation to USICA. I applaud the House  for passing this legislation, and I join my Senate colleagues from both  sides of the aisle in saying we were pleased to have gotten the ball  rolling when we passed the USICA bill--formally known as Endless  Frontiers--last summer.   There is a lot of work to do to enact USICA into law, so I look  forward to moving quickly to a conference so the House and Senate can  bridge the differences between our proposals.   Once again, I want to thank my colleagues from both sides of the  aisle for leadership on this very important legislation.   This will continue to be Democrats' focus: lowering costs, increasing  wages, and bringing jobs back from overseas, while creating more jobs  right here at home. It is what Democrats have worked on for the past 12  months as we have helped Americans get back to normal, and it is what  we will continue to focus on as we enter year 2 of the Biden  administration.                            ____________________     Madam President, now on forced arbitration.   On a different matter, later today, the House is expected to pass  bipartisan legislation to end forced arbitration for sexual assault and  sexual harassment. Once this important bill passes the House, the  Senate will move as soon as this week to quickly take up this bill and  send it to President Biden's desk. Congress can finally act to empower  victims of sexual assault and sexual harassment to speak openly by  nullifying forced arbitration clauses that push survivors into an often  secret and biased process. We will not waste this historic opportunity.   There are numerous good proposals that we can address here in the  Senate on a bipartisan basis, and this is one good example. We hope to  do more. The Senate's forced arbitration proposal, the Ending Forced  Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021, passed  unanimously out of the Judiciary Committee. Every Democrat and every  Republican voted for it. I expect there will be strong, bipartisan  support for it on the Senate floor. I want to thank my colleagues  Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and Senator Lindsey Graham for their  leadership on this important legislation.                            ____________________     Madam President, next, bomb threats at HCBUs.   All of us in the Senate are disturbed, sickened, and outraged,  frankly, at the wave of anonymous bomb threats that have recently  arisen across dozens of historically Black colleges and universities.  Since the start of this year, at least 26 HBCUs in a dozen States and  the District of Columbia have received such threats, including a dozen  schools last week. These bomb threats are clearly racially motivated,  and I join my colleagues in condemning these acts of hatred in the  strongest possible terms.   Bomb threats against HBCUs have an especially malevolent place in our  country's history. Black Americans don't need to think that far back to  when bombs were set off in the middle of the campus at Florida A&M  University in 1999. To see these threats today is a reminder of the  hatred we have yet to overcome.   Nothing can be more sickening than efforts to use fear, violence, and  White supremacy in hopes of stealing the promise of a good education  for millions of Black Americans. HBCUs are a vital part of our economy  and education system, educating some of our Nation's greatest leaders,  innovators, and activists.   I want to commend all the presidents, faculty, and staff across the  country's HBCUs for responding to these acts of hatred with resolve and  strength. And to all the students who attend HBCUs, this should never  happen. Those responsible must--must--be prosecuted to the fullest  extent of law.   My colleagues and I have been in communication with the FBI, Homeland  Security, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Education on  steps the Agencies and the Senate can take to address these violent  threats. We are confident those responsible will be held accountable.                            ____________________     Madam President, on an entirely different matter,  normally I don't make a point of remarking upon actions and statements  of the Republican National Committee, which by now has completely  fallen under the control of former President Donald Trump and his inner  circle, but last week, they crossed a line, issuing a statement that  censured two Republicans who stood up to the Big Lie, while also  describing the insurrection of January 6 as ``legitimate political  discourse.'' Their statement didn't even make mention of the violence  that day.   There is no debate to be had here. January 6 was an armed  insurrection. It was an attempt to reverse through violent means the  outcome of a free and fair election, and it was fundamentally rooted in  Donald Trump's Big Lie that the election of 2020 was illegitimate,  which now the RNC seems to be giving its blessing officially.   For the national committee of one of America's two major political  parties to officially sign on to the Big Lie--and more than that, to  excuse the attack itself by attributing even a shred of legitimacy to  it--is chilling and plainly dangerous. It puts us on a road where our  democracy is at risk.   It is a sad commentary on how far the political arm of the GOP has  gone that the RNC will go out of its way to punish its own Members who  spoke out against the former President's lies, while defending the  rioters who tried to undo an election with mob rule. Theirs will be  nothing less than everlasting shame.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 498.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 362.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum calls for the cloture motions filed today, February 7,  be waived.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
