 Mr. Speaker, this week, horrific anti-Semitic flyers were  distributed across my district in Pennsylvania. I heard from friends  and neighbors who found flyers in their front yards or in their  driveways. These hateful flyers were found in some cases by children.   I am not going to show nor repeat the flyers' disgusting words  because that is what those who spread hate want, for people to amplify  their insidious message, one that is on the rise as the Anti-Defamation  League records year-to-year increases in anti-Semitism.   I am a proud Jewish American, but anti-Semitism isn't just a threat  to those of us who are Jewish. It is a threat to all of us because  anti-Semitism, like other forms of bigotry that spread lies and stock  hatred, is an existential threat to our values as Americans.   It takes all of us, drawing strength and community from one another,  to stand up to those who want to divide us. Let's keep standing  together so that, united as neighbors, we can root out the anti- Semitism and hate that endangers our fundamental American values.                            ____________________
