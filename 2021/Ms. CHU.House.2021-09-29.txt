 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of doing what every  adult is expected to do: pay their bills. That means raising the debt  limit.   Let's be clear: this is not about new spending. This has nothing to  do with any of our plans for new investments in infrastructure. Those  plans are all paid for through other means. When we raise the debt  ceiling, it is so we can pay the bills for money we have already spent.  That means the reason we need to raise the debt ceiling right now is to  pay Donald Trump's bills--which, as usual, he would rather leave  unpaid.   Under the last administration, the deficit grew every year, totaling  over $7 trillion in debt increases, requiring Congress to raise the  debt ceiling three times.   And why was that?   Because the 2017 GOP tax scam used the reconciliation process to  spend $2 trillion on tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy that  were not paid for. The American people were told that the tax cuts  would pay for themselves, but that was a lie. And now the bill comes  due. Again.   But this time the Republicans are refusing to even allow a vote. It  is not that they are choosing to vote ``no'', which would be their  prerogative, even if it is political and insincere. Instead, they are  filibustering to prevent us  [[Page H5531]]  from even voting to stop the U.S. from defaulting; something they all  said would be terrible.   We are not children who flip a game over when we lose. It is our  responsibility to pay the government's bills no matter who is in  charge.   Madam Speaker, if you can vote to give tax cuts to billionaire  amateur astronauts like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, then you can vote to  pay the bill for it. It is that simple.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
