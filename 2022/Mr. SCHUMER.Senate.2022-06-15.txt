 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, we continue a productive week here on the  Senate floor.   Today, the Senate will take another step closer to passing the  largest veterans' healthcare bill in decades, the Honoring our PACT  Act. In a few moments, the Senate will vote to adopt the substitute  amendment and then immediately vote on cloture on the bill, bringing us  to the brink of passing this long-sought piece of legislation.   Frankly, the Senate should come to an agreement to finish the PACT  Act work A-S-A-P. We should pass this bill as soon as we can and  finally tell our veterans that the long wait for their well-earned  benefits is over.   Let me say it again.   There is no reason not to finish the PACT Act A-S-A-P. Our Nation's  veterans have waited long enough for this bill. Since 9/11, nearly 3.5  million veterans have been exposed to toxic burn pits in the line of  duty. Scores of Americans went off to serve our country in perfect  health only to come back home and get sick from toxic exposure, and  when many of these veterans applied to the VA for healthcare benefits,  they oftentimes discovered that they didn't qualify.   It is a confounding indignity for our Nation's heroes to sacrifice  everything for our country only to come home, get sick, and discover  that the VA ain't there for them--they have to fend for themselves.   What kind of message does it send to future veterans when we can't  guarantee they will get the healthcare benefits they rightfully deserve  and when the VA will not deal with injuries that occurred on the  battlefield because of toxic burn pits and other issues? With the PACT  Act, we have a chance to answer that question with a resounding yes.   Question: Well, if I enlist, am I going to really be taken care of  when my service is complete?   We are going to have a chance to answer that question with a  resounding yes. Yes, we will take care of you. Yes, we will make sure  you can live healthy and dignified lives. Yes, we will keep our promise  to protect our veterans just as they have sacrificed everything for us.   No great nation can dare afford to turn its back on the multitudes  who have served our country. No veterans  [[Page S2949]]  should ever have to carry the burden of treating complications from  toxic exposure all by themselves, and we can change that simply with a  vote on this bill.   Let us pass the PACT Act with all due haste. We have a moral  obligation in the Chamber to get this done.                                 Nominations    Now, Mr. President, on the nominations front, we are moving ahead  with confirming President Biden's critical and well-qualified nominees.   Later today, we will vote on the confirmation of Alan Leventhal to  serve as the U.S. Ambassador to Denmark.   Later this week, once we conclude the PACT Act, we will also move  forward on the nomination of Mary Boyle for the Consumer Product Safety  Commission, whose confirmation would give that Agency a Democratic  majority.   We will also soon vote to confirm another historic judicial nominee,  Ana Isabel de Alba, to serve as a district judge for the Eastern  District of California. Judge de Alba will be the first ever Latina to  serve as a Federal judge in California's Eastern District, joining the  more than 65 qualified judicial nominees that this majority has  confirmed under President Biden.   I am proud of the historic progress this Senate Democratic majority  has made in confirming well-qualified and diverse nominees to the  executive branch, to independent boards, and to the Federal bench, and  we are going to keep going.                               Gun Legislation    Mr. President, on gun safety, Democrats and Republicans continue  negotiations over the legislative text for the first major gun safety  bill to pass the Senate in 30 years.   Just a few weeks ago, such an effort would have seemed unimaginable.  If there were any issue that encapsulates the gridlock of the past few  decades, gun safety would be near the very top of the list. For too  long, Americans have gotten used to a frustrating pattern--tragedy  strikes; families grieve; but gridlock in the Senate ensues.   Perhaps this time--hopefully, this time--it will be different. Many  in this Chamber are working, right now, in the hopes that it will be  different. We are not over the finish line yet, but there is a real  hunger to finally accomplish what has escaped the Senate for far too  long: passing meaningful gun safety reform.   Again, not too long ago, this debate would have been hard to have  fathomed, but despite the long odds, we gave negotiators space to do  their work. I am glad we did because we now have the best chance in  decades to act on gun violence. I spoke to both Senators Murphy and  Cornyn this morning. They are eager to get the text completed. There  will be meetings all day long in the hopes that we can get the text  done so we can put it on the floor as soon as possible and get it  passed. If we can prevent even one death from gun violence in the  future, our efforts at this moment will have been worth it.   Gun safety is near and dear to my heart. As the Acting President pro  tempore knows, three decades ago, I was a proud author of the Brady  Bill in Congress, which won the support of many Republicans and even  law enforcement. Back then, I argued we had to get something done  because the American people were sick and tired of the insanity and  inaction of gun violence as much as they are today. After years of  trying, we succeeded back then, but it wasn't on the first try. Yet we  enacted a bill that, very likely, saved tens of thousands of lives.  There are many, many people--thousands or tens of thousands in all  likelihood--walking the streets today because we passed the Brady Law.    Today, the American people are similarly sick and tired of the  insanity of the gun violence happening every day across the country.  Just thinking about all of the shootings we have suffered over the  years is exhausting and debilitating: Columbine, Virginia, Sandy Hook,  Parkland, Las Vegas, Orlando, El Paso, Charleston, Atlanta, Buffalo,  Uvalde. The list keeps going on and growing. The American people have  had enough. They want us to move forward.   If the Senate can come up with a bill that embraces the bipartisan  framework, we are going to save lives. I promise that, once the text is  done, I will put it on the floor as soon as possible, so I encourage my  colleagues to keep working. As I mentioned, our Senators on both sides  of the aisle will be working diligently all day to try and come up with  the final text as soon as possible. We don't know the next time we will  have a chance to make meaningful progress on gun violence, so we have  every reason in the world to get to yes.                                  Elections    Mr. President, on the elections of last night and election deniers, a  year and a half after the 2020 election, Donald Trump's Big Lie is  alive and well, unfortunately.   Last night, hard-right candidates who believe the last Presidential  election was stolen--it is so incorrect, with no factual basis. But  these people with these beliefs were elevated into the general  election. Many of these candidates are running in critical swing States  and running for offices that will have outsized influence in managing  future elections.   The example of Nevada's secretary of state race is especially bone  chilling. Jim Marchant--a far-right radical, who openly believes that  the 2020 election results were illegitimate, who believes the Big Lie-- is now running to be the top elections official in Nevada. Mr. Marchant  is someone who openly thinks Donald Trump should be the President right  now, and if he wins in November, he will be Nevada's most important  election official and would pose a direct threat--a direct threat--to  the democratic process in that State.   He must be rejected by the people of every political persuasion. It  doesn't matter if you are a Democrat or a Republican or an Independent,  a liberal or a conservative or a moderate. Democracy is at risk if we  elevate individuals who don't believe in the sanctity of elections.  That is the road to authoritarianism, to dictatorship. This isn't a  partisan argument. Undermining democracy endangers all of us-- Democrats, Republicans, Independents. If the proponents of the Big Lie  are elected to office, they pose a direct threat to our democratic way  of life.   The January 6 hearings have made it abundantly clear that even Donald  Trump's inner circle knew the Big Lie was utter garbage, so it is  nothing short of horrifying to see that radicals who profess the Big  Lie are gaining strength across the country.   I urge the American people to reject the credo of lies pushed by  Donald Trump and his cronies and, whatever your party, to vote this  November for men and women who will safeguard our democracy and  preserve the sanctity of our elections. Without it, our country could  be on the road to ruin.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
