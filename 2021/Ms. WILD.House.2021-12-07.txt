 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a local hero from my  district in the Greater Lehigh Valley who served at Pearl Harbor when  it was attacked 80 years ago today.   Dick Schimmel was 19 when, on the morning of December 7, 1941, he was  roused from sleep by fellow servicemembers with the sound of explosions  striking the American Naval base in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.   Mr. Schimmel is a lifelong resident of Allentown, and a consummate  American hero who joined the Army in August of 1940, serving as a radar  specialist as part of the 580th Signal Aircraft Warning Company, before  returning to Pennsylvania, where he sold appliances for Sears for 34  years.   Today is a solemn day as we reflect on the legacy of a day that  President Roosevelt wisely said would ``live in infamy.'' We lost 2,335  servicemembers that day and an additional 68 civilians, not to mention  countless more with injuries, both visible and invisible.   As the daughter of an Air Force veteran, I want to thank Mr. Schimmel  for his heroism in Pearl Harbor 80 years ago.                            ____________________
