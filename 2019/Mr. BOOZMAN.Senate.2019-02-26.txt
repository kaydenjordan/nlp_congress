 Madam President, today I wish to recognize and  congratulate the Fort Smith Noon Lion's Club on its centennial  celebration.   The Fort Smith Noon Lions Club first met on March 8, 1919, only 2  years after the creation of Lions Club International. With 25 charter  members, the club's mission was to encourage fellowship and civic  participation by local businessmen. Many prominent business leaders  were part of that founding group, including Dr. Charles Holt, founder  of Holt Crock Clinic; Fagan Bourland, who served as the city's mayor  for many years; and W.E. Harding, the founder of Harding Glass, one of  the city's largest companies at the time.   The club met for many years at the historic Goldman Hotel in downtown  Fort Smith and, later, at the Ward Hotel on Garrison Avenue. Among its  earliest projects was supporting the Victory Loan Campaign designed to  pay off debt from WWI. In the early days, it held festivals, hosted  free concerts, and played an annual baseball game against the local  Rotary Club.   In addition to supporting local causes and providing a networking  tool for businessmen, the club's mission came into focus after Helen  Keller spoke at the Lions Club International convention in 1925. She  concluded her speech by saying, ``I appeal to you Lions, you who have  your sight, your hearing, you who are strong and brave and kind. Will  you not constitute yourselves Knights of the Blind in this crusade  against darkness?'' Her eloquent plea transformed the Lions and made  sight conservation the organization's primary mission.   Throughout its 100-year history, the Fort Smith Noon Lions Club has  contributed greatly to this mission by raising money to provide eye  exams and glasses to local students and adults. Lions Club members have  also collected thousands of pairs of glasses which are donated to the  Southern College of Optometry in Memphis where students take the  glasses on international mission trips.   In recent years, the Fort Smith Noon Lions Club has donated more than  $100,000 to help local residents with sight preservation and provided  support to many local children's organizations including the Fort Smith  Boys Club, Good Samaritan Clinic, Clearinghouse Backpack Program,  Special Olympics, and the Children's Emergency Shelter.   In addition, the club has provided all of the equipment and support  needed for the Safety Patrol program in the Fort Smith Public Schools  since 1946.   As an optometrist whose hometown is Fort Smith, AR, I am proud of the  great work done by this club and Lions chapters around the world.   I congratulate the Fort Smith Noon Lions Club on its 100th  anniversary and hope that these Knights for the Blind continue to  prosper in their mission.                            ____________________
