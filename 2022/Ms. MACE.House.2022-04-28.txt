 Madam Speaker, today I rise to recognize and commend two of  my young constituents from Daniel Island, South Carolina, Ella and Owen  Rogers--Ella is 14 and Owen is 17--and their efforts in support of  Ukraine and standing in solidarity with the Ukrainian people during one  of the toughest times in Ukraine's history.   They are both descendants of their great-great-grandfather, Joseph,  who was born in Galicia, Ukraine. Joseph was forced to flee to the  United States during the early 20th century due to the armed conflict  between Austrian and Russian Empires trying to occupy the region.   The story of their family history shows similarities to what the  world has witnessed in the last few months during the beginning of the  unconscionable and illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces in  late February.   As Ella and Owen Rogers have witnessed these atrocities, as my  teenage kids who are very similar in age, these kids have seen these  atrocities; have witnessed these war crimes. They have seen it all over  social media and television.    But they have spoken with their uncle recently who had been providing  humanitarian and military intelligence aid in Warsaw, Poland at the  time, and they decided the best way to make a difference was through  providing nourishment to mothers and children who are fleeing their  home country of Ukraine.   I was recently in Warsaw and in Poland a few weeks ago witnessing the  women and children fleeing Ukraine and coming into the country. There  are millions of families, particularly women and kids, who have been  displaced because their fathers and husbands and partners are staying  back home in Ukraine to fight this war.   But they rallied their relatives, their friends, their neighbors, the  amazing community of Daniel Island in the  [[Page H4581]]  Lowcountry. Ella and Owen have raised over $7,000 for the World Central  Kitchen, which is an organization that provides food and nourishment to  communities around the world in times of conflict, crisis, and war.   Ella and Owen are just one example of the type of compassion and  empathy that we see each and every day in the Lowcountry. The great  people of the Lowcountry show, not only to their fellow citizens, the  State of South Carolina, our Nation, and around the world, there are no  strangers they have ever met, and everyone is witnessing great hope for  the future of Ukraine.   I hope that the story of Ella and Owen can serve as an inspiration to  others who stand up for what is right, even when it seems like there is  nothing that can be done in the face of hardship. They have shown hard  work; they have shown that we need to do the right thing; and they have  shown people that they care.   And now, more than ever, it is important that we do all we can to  support our friends in Ukraine to help them during this critical  crisis.   I again thank the Rogers family and the incredible work ethic that  Ella and Owen have shown the Lowcountry and the State of South  Carolina.                            ____________________
