 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, ``sexist,'' ``a disaster for women,''  ``totally unacceptable''--these are just a few of the ad hominem  attacks the far-left special interest groups hurled at a Federal  circuit court judge whom a Republican President nominated to the  Supreme Court. The name of the Federal judge--Anthony Kennedy.   After President Reagan nominated then-Judge Kennedy to the Court in  1987, these far-left special interest groups impinged his character.  They cooked up apocalyptic warnings about all of the terrible things  that would happen to Americans if he were to be confirmed to the Court.  Of course, the American people didn't buy it, and a majority of  Senators saw through the hyperbole and hysteria and confirmed that  qualified nominee. Believe it or not, the sky didn't fall, but decades  later, our Democratic colleagues still haven't tired of crying wolf  whenever a Republican President nominates anyone to the Supreme Court.  We have seen this same movie time after time.    Less than 3 years after Justice Kennedy's confirmation, President  Bush nominated David Souter to the Supreme Court. Guess what leftwing  pressure groups said about David Souter right after President Bush  selected him. That is right, the very same things we are hearing today.  The same things you have heard from these same corners about every  Supreme Court nominee named by a Republican President.   One organization proclaimed that Justice Souter might ``undo the  advances made by women, minorities, dissenters and other disadvantaged  groups.''   That was about Justice Souter.   Back in 1975, they assailed the nomination of John Paul Stevens. They  said he lacked impartiality and opposed women's rights. That is what  was said about John Paul Stevens. So these far-left groups have been at  these same scare tactics for over 40 years. The consistency is really  quite amazing. Decade after decade, nominee after nominee, the far-left  script hardly changes at all.   Anyone and everyone the Republican President nominates to the Supreme  Court is some kind of threat to the public, according to the hysterical  press releases that inevitably follow. No matter their qualifications,  no matter their record, no matter their reputation, it is the same  hyperbole, the same accusations, the same old story.   Tonight, President Trump will announce his nominee to fill the  current Supreme Court vacancy. We don't know whom he will name, but we  already know exactly what unfair tactics the nominee will face. They  will not be new, and they will not be warranted. We can expect to hear  how they will destroy equal rights or demolish American healthcare or  ruin our country in some other fictional way.   Justice Kennedy's resignation letter had barely arrived in the  President's hands before several of our Democratic colleagues began  declaring their blanket opposition to anyone and all--anyone the  President might name. One Democratic Senator stated she would resist  any attempt to confirm any nominee this year: ``It doesn't matter who  he is putting forward.'' It doesn't matter who.   Earlier today, just today, another Democratic Senator issued a press  release declaring preemptively that he plans to oppose whomever the  President nominates tonight, no matter who they are.   Another of our Democratic colleagues offered this assessment: ``We  are looking at the destruction of the Constitution of the United States  as far as I can tell.''   It is hard to keep a straight face when you hear stuff like that.  There is not even a nominee yet. Justice Kennedy just announced his  retirement, and they are talking about the destruction of the  Constitution? Please, give the American people some credit. This far- left rhetoric comes out every single time, but the apocalypse never  comes.   Americans see beyond this far-left fearmongering they have tried over  and over again for 40 years, and Senators should do the same. We should  evaluate this President's nominee fairly based on his or her  qualifications, and we should treat the process with the respect and  dignity it deserves.   The Judiciary Committee under the able leadership of Senator Grassley  will hold hearings, and the nomination will come to the full Senate for  our consideration. One more round of 40-year-old scare tactics will not  stop us from doing the right thing.    Mr. President, today I am proud to recognize a  remarkable woman who has been a constant presence in Hardin County for  many years. Barbara Proffitt has meant so much to this community, and  as she begins her long-awaited retirement, I would like to thank her  for her decades of care and support.   For 30 years, Barbara represented Hardin Memorial Hospital as its  community/guest relations coordinator. In her own description, she  helps ``get the word out about the hospital,'' but for someone like  Barbara, that meant a lot more than sitting behind a desk sending  emails. Throughout Elizabethtown and the surrounding area, Barbara  seemed to be everywhere, attending community meetings, special  functions, and even driving the health group's car during parades.   Beyond her work at the hospital, Barbara supported her community and  her neighbors in so many ways. Although she hasn't had a child  attending North Hardin High School since the late 1970s, Barbara  proudly continues to be the ``team mom'' of the boys' basketball team.  Usually carrying bags of candy to share, she rarely misses a game and  always seems to have a hug ready for every player, manager, and coach.   The close proximity between Barbara's home in Vine Grove to the U.S.  Army installation at Fort Knox inspired another form of community work.  Crediting her father's service in World War I and the service of her  brother and husband in Korea, Barbara has made it her personal mission  to support our Nation's men and women in uniform stationed at Fort  Knox. She packs boxes of food for soldiers deployed overseas who are  serving in Fort Knox's 1st Theater Sustainment Command. Barbara also  bakes pecan pies for those at the installation, earning her the  nickname she treasures: ``Pie Lady.'' Having tasted one of her pies  myself, I can confirm just how delicious they are. Because of her  longstanding generosity to those at the installation, Fort Knox awarded  Barbara and her family with its Gold Neighbor Award. In her retirement,  she has chosen to join a new mission called ``No Vet Dies Alone,''  providing comfort to our Nation's heroes in their final hours.   Barbara has also passed on her love of community service to her  children,  [[Page S4838]]  Rhonda and Blake. As the current mayor of Vine Grove, Blake credits his  mom's passion for others as what helped inspire his decision to enter  public service.   After her last day at Hardin Memorial Hospital, Barbara began a well- deserved vacation. When she returns, however, no one expects her to  slow down too much. As a local columnist wrote when he heard about her  retirement, ``For Barbara the word retire is a word, that's it. I am  certain we still will see her around, everywhere we seem to go.'' I  certainly hope we will. Today I am proud to join with the people of  Hardin County in thanking Barbara Proffitt for taking care of so many  in her community throughout the years. I ask my Senate colleagues to  help me wish her a wonderful retirement.   Mr. President, the News-Enterprise in Elizabethtown recently  published an article on Barbara's legacy of service to her community. I  ask unanimous consent that a copy of the article be printed in the  Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the News-Enterprise, May 6, 2018]             Barbara Proffitt: One of Hardin County's True Gems                            (By Jeff D'Alessio)         The first time I saw Barbara Proffitt I was standing in a       hallway outside of the boys' basketball coaches office at       North Hardin High School after a game in 1988.        I stood there, probably with a notebook and pen in hand.       She stood there with candy bags in her hands--Tootsie Roll       Pops and gum.        She saw me and scooted closer and said, ``Are you the new       guy?'' I told her I was and best I can recall, now 30 years       later, she told me to be nice to her boys and to Ronnie--the       now legendary coach Ron Bevars.        And then she asked me if I wanted a Tootsie Pop and some       gum.        Then I would see her at road games and tournaments, candy       bags in tow, without fail, as was a hug for each player--star       player or bench warmer--plus the managers and coaches.        I wondered what the deal was with this woman showing up at       all these games with candy. The deal was this: That's who she       is--kind to the core.        She would cheer, and boo occasionally, at games and she       also was there to encourage and comfort. That's one of my       Barbara Proffitt stories.        Here's another one or two. Those who know her, have many.        If she likes a column I write, she calls me. If she       disagrees, she calls, I think she has once.        When our third granddaughter was born on New Year's Day       2017, she sat in the waiting room with my wife and me for a       few minutes wanting to know how everything was going.        She parted with a hug, as she so often does.        The next day, she was there with gifts when McKenna was the       first baby born for the year. Again, more hugs.        You see Barbara everywhere--dinners and parades, meetings       and announcements.        She has plenty of energy for someone of any age, and for       someone who gives and is on the go so much.        She has lived life at a quick pace and now it's time for       her to slow down as she ``retires'' from Hardin Memorial       Hospital after 30 years. For Barbara the word retire is a       word, that's it. I am certain we still will see her around,       everywhere we seem to go.        It is who she is. She's a doer, not someone who stands on       the sideline waiting for others to pitch in. I don't think       she could stand to be sitting there watching others do what       she is capable of doing.        When you talk about community gems in the people that make       Hardin County what it is, Barbara is near the top of the       list.        I remember Bevars telling me once she was as much apart of       his highly successful program as anyone he could think of.       She was there for her genuine love and concern for kids and       coaches.        When I heard Barbara was retiring, I have to admit, I       chuckled. I'm not sure how that word really applies to the       most involved person I know.        Whatever it will mean to her, I hope it starts with years       of good health and life fulfillment.        Aside from the Tootsie Pops, gum and hugs, there is much       more to learn from Barbara: Being nice and genuinely kind-      hearted are character traits that are hard to beat.        And you won't find many people, no matter where you go,       nicer than Barbara.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to  congratulate Alan Watts, an indispensable broadcaster in western  Kentucky, who will soon celebrate his 25th year with WKDZ/WHVO Radio in  Cadiz. When the listeners of Caldwell, Christian, Lyon, Todd, and Trigg  Counties tune in for the news, a trusted voice provides them with the  information important to their lives.   Even before he graduated from high school, radio broadcasting had  piqued Alan's interest. He worked part-time at WHOP in Hopkinsville  through college, and he proudly remembers that his news career began  when he attended a rally featuring Presidents Ronald Reagan and George  H.W. Bush.   Alan's time at WKDZ began in 1993 not with a formal contract, but  rather with a handwritten agreement with the owner, D.J. Everett. He  started by answering phones, writing stories on an electric typewriter,  and delivering the weekend news. As the station has grown and expanded  during the last 25 years, Alan has taken on more responsibility and has  become a well-known local figure.   On weekdays at 5 a.m., Alan goes on air for his ``Morning Ag  Report.'' The program debuted in 2008 with the mission to tell the  southern Pennyrile region's agriculture story. In his own words, ``Each  morning I start my day at 3 with a much-needed cup of coffee and a  fresh outlook on life.'' Bringing the latest news to farm families,  Alan and his team have earned the strong support of the community, but  he doesn't sign off after a single program. Alan also hosts the ``WKDZ  Country Club'' program for 3 hours, sharing news and local events and  hosting a number of guests. It is his way to help listeners throughout  the region begin their day.   As if 4 hours of daily broadcast weren't enough, Alan doesn't stop  there. This January, he became the host of the Kentucky Farm Bureau's  ``Across Kentucky'' program that airs on more than 140 radio stations  across the Commonwealth. He is also a frequent guest on RDF-TV, the  first 24-hour TV network with programming focused on agribusiness and  rural lifestyles. Winning such praise as the 2007 Kentucky Farm Bureau  Communications Award and the 2018 Christian County Friend of  Agriculture, Alan has clearly earned the respect of his listeners and  his peers.   I have enjoyed my many opportunities to join Alan's program over the  phone, in studio, and here in my office in the U.S. Capitol. Covering  everything from farm bills to tax reform and the Supreme Court, we have  discussed the issues that are important to western Kentucky. When I  join his show, I know that my constituents in the region are listening.   I would like to thank Alan for his years of dedication to his  agricultural community and, once again, to congratulate him on this  milestone accomplishment. As he continues his impressive career, I send  my best wishes to him, his wife, Susan, and their daughter Jennie. I  urge my Senate colleagues to join me.   Mr. President, the Kentucky New Era recently published a profile on  Alan's career. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                 [From the Kentucky New Era, June 20, 2018]     Alan Watts: Interviews Behind the Camera Set Stage for Career in                                Broadcasting                            (By Tonya S. Grace)         As a youngster, Alan Watts used to go to LaFayette and drop       into Jimmy Landers' general store.        He recalls the seeds, which, much like the familiar penny       candy sought by eager kids in past decades, were scooped up       by the pound by families who bought them for planting on the       farm.        ``Jimmy Landers had a store (where you) dipped seeds out of       a bucket,'' remembers Watts, a Herndon farm kid who grew up       to become the news and farm director at WKDZ/WHVO Radio in       Cadiz. ``He had a dipper, and you would dip out however much       you wanted, a pound or whatever.''        Landers operated his store until 2003.        Five years later, Watts' Morning Ag Report debuted on the       air, and it has gained a following of folks as nearby as       Christian and Trigg counties, as far away as Stewart and       Montgomery counties in Tennessee.        Now a resident of PeeDee in south Christian County, Watts       has made a living apart from his life on the family farm; in       almost three decades in broadcast journalism, he's seen four       presidents in person, met Fox news journalist Geraldo Rivera       (a tiny little guy, Watts says) and followed his fellow       broadcaster and late mentor Dink Embry into the Washington,       D.C.,-based National Association of Farm Broadcasting.        Only 150 or so people are members of the organization whose       programs and services promote agriculture throughout the       country,  [[Page S4839]]       and Watts says he is honored to be counted among their ranks.        He considers the countless people whose stories he has       shared with his broadcast audiences through the years and       says it is those stories about people that he enjoys the most       about what he does.        ``I really care about the people I talk about and the       people I do stories on,'' notes Watts, who celebrates his       25th year with WKDZ come August. ``I really love to tell the       story of people. It's nothing about me, but about the people       you meet, the average common people who are wonderful       people.''        Some of the stories hurt, the one about the murders of       three children in 2008 in Roaring Springs, for example, or       more recently, about the murders four years ago of Trigg       Countian Lindsey Champion, his wife and daughter.        Champion had been a listener as well as a guest of Watts'       Morning Ag Report and was just ``a genuinely nice man,''       Watts recalls, He has fond memories of Champion, who had been       retired from the Farm Credit Services office in Hopkinsville       and was active in his family's Champion Farms in Cadiz.        Through the years, Watts has gained an affinity, a       closeness, with the people he speaks with in his capacity as       a broadcaster, the folks who are the subjects of the stories       that are his livelihood. There are those who know him even       though he may actually have never met them before, Watts       muses.        Worth it every day.        They feel like they're a part of my life and I'm a part of       their life,'' observes Watts, who is the second-longest       tenured employee at WKDZ. ``And that's what makes it worth it       every day.''        Seated recently inside the studios at the Cadiz station,       Watts recalls how Embry, a longtime radio man at WHOP in       Hopkinsville, and colleague Bob McGaughey at rival WKOA,       first piqued his interest in the medium. The older men       frequently interviewed Watts, then a teenager showing his       family's cattle and sheep at the Western Kentucky State Fair,       for their farm programs.        Watts found the process an intriguing one        ``Where I really got my interest was watching Dink Embry,''       Watts explains. ``What Dink Embry did on the radio fascinated       me.''        He eventually began hanging out with Embry, helped him set       up equipment and ``enjoyed seeing what was going on and       learning from him.''        He began working part-time at WHOP in 1985 or 1986,       conducting farm interviews for the station. Graduating from       high school in 1986, he went on to Hopkinsville Community       College before transferring to Western Kentucky University in       Bowling Green, where he received a degree in mass       communications with a minor in animal science. Were it not       for radio, Watts says, a career in animal genetics would have       captured his attention.        He continued to work at WHOP throughout college and, after       graduating in 1990, began his career with the station,       working as a disc jockey and announcer. For a brief time, he       left radio for the insurance business.        But he discovered sales was not for him and so, in 1993,       Embry made a phone call on Watts' behalf and spoke with owner       D.J. Everett at WKDZ.        Watts came on board in August of that same year, just four       months after Cindy Allen Lax, who is now the station's senior       marketing specialist.        Watts says he likely is one of the few people who do not       have a contract.        ``D.J, never had me sign a contract,'' he recalls of the       agreement handwritten on a piece of paper that signified his       hiring at the radio station.        Everett, he notes, had great expectations of his new       employee and was tough, but he also became a great friend and       mentor to Watts. From Everett, Watts learned a ``tremendous       amount of knowledge'' that taught him how to look for news,       how to gather it and how to report the news to listeners.        In his early days with the station, Watts wrote his news on       a typewriter in the newsroom, and, at a time when the station       had only four employees, he also helped answer the telephones       and did things in the business office.        ``In those days, you did everything,'' Watts recalls.        Agriculture is big.        At the time, he said he didn't address agriculture much but       did incorporate it into his regular newscasts, something he       made a point of doing because ``agriculture is such a big       industry here,'' he explains.        In 2007, Watts received the Kentucky Farm Bureau       Communications Award, recognizing his efforts to highlight       the work that farmers do while also helping others understand       the importance of agriculture.        His Morning Ag Report with Alan Watts began the following       year, its beginnings taking shape with the germ of an idea       after he attended a meeting.        The Ag Edge website was developed not long after the       morning show.        Watts and David Fourqurean, an ag extension agent in McLean       County, were returning from a Farm Bureau meeting, and Watts       decided WKDZ should do something, given agriculture's impact       in the area and his knowledge of it.        The program airs from 5 to 6 a.m. Monday through Friday.        Fourqurean and other agents have been frequent guests on       the popular program. Watts interviews local farmers, features       agriculture-related things going on in the community and       highlights other current news events.        People comment about how the program reminds them of       growing up on the farm, and they talk about how much they       enjoy the conversation.        Watts is mindful of listeners who live on the farm and       elsewhere, and for those who are not involved in agriculture,       there's a need to explain what that load of tobacco they're       following down the highway means to them, he notes.        This past January Watts saw President Donald J. Trump when       the president was a featured speaker at the American Farm       Bureau Federation's annual convention in Nashville; Trump was       interesting to see, noted Watts, who said the president       connected so well with his rural audience on that day.        ``He reminded me a lot of (former President Ronald) Reagan,       with less finesse,'' Watts said of the 40th president known       as ``the great communicator.''        Watts saw Reagan speak at Western's Diddle Arena, and he       recalled the president's reaction when a balloon popped       during his presentation.        Reagan, who was shot by attempted assassin John Hinckley       Jr. in 1981, ducked upon hearing the noise and called out       ``Oh, you missed me.''        In the ensuing years, Watts also saw former presidents       Barack Obama and George W. Bush and interviewed former U.S.       Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, These days, Watts is a       frequent guest on RFD-TV, where he shares what is going on in       agriculture in western Kentucky with viewers.        He has taken over as host and producer of Kentucky Farm       Bureau's ``Across Kentucky'' broadcast and, in Cadiz, he co-      hosts the Trigg County Farm Tour.        Earlier this year, Watts was named the 2018 Christian       County Friend of Agriculture by the Christian County       Agribusiness Association.        He notes that there are so many neat people to meet in       agriculture, and Watts, who rises early every morning to       prepare for his Morning Ag Report, declares that he looks       forward to those early mornings every day.        ``I don't think there's anything I'd rather do,'' he says       of his love of agriculture and of the people he meets in his       local community. ``It's still fun and exciting every day.''        Watts and his wife Susan Watts have a daughter, 10-year-old       Jennie Watts, who continues to work on her family's farm in       south Christian County.                            ____________________
