 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  two high school honors students from Pennsylvania's Fifth Congressional  District chosen to represent the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as  delegates at the Congress of Future Science and Technology Leaders.   The following students were selected to attend the event, which will  take place June 29 to July 1 in Lowell, Massachusetts: Jacob Hulse of  Tidioute and Brett Kelly of Lewis Run. These outstanding students were  required to achieve a 3.5 GPA to be nominated for this prestigious  honors-only program by their teachers or the National Academy of Future  Science and Technology Leaders.   The event aims to encourage and guide the top students in our country  who wish to devote their lives to the sciences and technology. Chosen  delegates represent all 50 States and Puerto Rico.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Jacob and Brett on this tremendous  accomplishment, and I wish them the best of luck as they continue their  career paths to be future leaders in the science and technology field.                            ____________________
