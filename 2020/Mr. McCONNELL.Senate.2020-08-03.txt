 Mr. President, the Senate mourns the tragedy that we  now know took place Thursday, off the coast of Southern California.   According to official reports, nine American servicemembers--eight  marines and one sailor--died during a training exercise. These young  servicemembers were all between the ages of 19 and 23. It is absolutely  heartbreaking. The units involved are among our most unique and  specialized amphibious forces. Their training is what allows them to  deploy at a moment's notice, under the harshest conditions, in the most  remote and unsupported locations.   As the search for survivors turned into a recovery mission, the  Nation was reminded that even what our men and women in uniform may  consider to be routine still involves serious risk and personal  sacrifice.   I extend the Senate's sympathies to the families of those lost and  our gratitude to the Marine Corps, Navy, and Coast Guard personnel who  are searching to bring their comrades home.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, this  week,  [[Page S4654]]  officials from the intelligence community, the FBI, and the Department  of Homeland Security will brief us on foreign efforts to influence our  politics and elections and how the administration is defending us.  Every one of our colleagues should attend one of these sessions.   Sharing sensitive threat information with Congress is just one of the  ways this administration has outperformed its predecessor. The  intelligence community kept Congress much more closely informed about  these threats in 2018 and now in 2020 than it did in the runup to 2016.  I am sure these briefings will contain details that might seem ripe for  cherry-picking and partisan leaks from both sides, but it is essential  that Congress remain a place where the word ``classified'' actually  means something. Leaking intelligence jeopardizes sources and methods.   If we learned anything from studying Russian interference in 2016, it  is that our adversaries' ultimate objective is to leave America more  divided and less confident in our institutions. Members of Congress  must take special care not to do Putin's work for him.   Foreign adversaries have long sought to interfere in our politics and  elections. That didn't start in 2016, and it will not end in 2020, but  this administration has put us in a far, far better position than in  2016. There is, simply, no comparison. The intelligence community is  better aware of the threat. Government agencies are more transparent  with Congress, the State and local jurisdictions that actually run  elections, the private sector, and the public.   In 2016, the Obama-Biden administration had to lean on congressional  leadership to act as a bridge to the States because the States so  distrusted their Department of Homeland Security. Over the last 4  years, this administration's DHS has develop its own deep relationship  with State officials. In 2016, only 14 State or local jurisdictions had  received high-tech Albert sensors to alert them to cyber intrusions.  They are deployed in all 50 States today. There were 14 States that had  them in 2016, and every State has them today. It was this  administration that stood up the new Elections Infrastructure  Information Sharing and Analysis Center, with participation from more  than 2,600 local jurisdictions and counting.   This administration has imposed real, hard costs on election  interference and Russia's other misdeeds: shuttering the Kremlin's  consulates in San Francisco and Seattle; kicking out intelligence  officers; sanctioning oligarchs; helping European partners defend their  own elections against Russia; and sending weapons to Ukraine and  Georgia, which the Obama-Biden administration did not supply.   This administration has also confronted China for what the State  Department described as ``massive espionage and influence operations,''  including closing Beijing's consulate in Houston.   As the Democratic vice chairman on the Senate Intelligence Committee  stated in 2016, ``We were caught flatfooted.'' Not anymore. Congress  has provided more than $800 million for States and localities to shore  up election security and has passed a number of targeted new laws.  Since foreign political interference is so often aimed at private  sector platforms, like social media sites, we have encouraged those  businesses to step up vigilance as well.   Through all of this, we have also carefully avoided things that look  like quick fixes but which would undermine our own institutions. In the  United States of America, it is the States and localities, not the  Federal Government, that run elections--period. Our lack of a one-size- fits-all national system isn't just constitutionally appropriate; it  also acts as a further safeguard. We lack a single point of failure   So, in closing, I urge all of our colleagues to attend these  important briefings with an eye toward our real adversaries--not our  fellow Americans but the foreign agents who love to see us at one  another's throats.   Back during the impeachment trial, a leading House Democrat asserted  that, if President Trump were to win reelection, the people's vote  would be presumptively invalid.   Just a few days ago, it was reported that a leading Democratic  strategist who was war-gaming this election decided to experiment with  what would happen if Vice President Biden were to lose the election but  were to, simply, fail to concede.   Once again, this kind of recklessness achieves our adversaries'  missions for them. So I urge my colleagues to listen to the civil  servants who are defending our democracy. Let's stay united, focus on  the real dangers posed by foreign intelligence, and resist the urge to  politicize these vital subjects.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on one final matter, last week, the  Senate Democratic leader brought an end to the additional Federal  benefit for unemployed workers. The Republicans tried multiple times to  extend the money, including at the same dollar level that our colleague  himself said he wanted, but the Democratic leader blocked it all.   This is the dynamic on the Democratic side that killed the subject of  police reform back in June, and it has now jeopardized more coronavirus  relief as well. The Democratic leaders insist publicly that they want  an outcome, but they work alone, behind closed doors, to ensure a  bipartisan agreement is, actually, not reached.   We are about a week into the Speaker's and the Democratic leader's  discussions with the administration--a week into the Democratic  leadership's cutting out all of their Members--all of them--cutting out  all of their committees, and saying that only they can participate.   So how is it going?   Well, the Democratic leader is still refusing to let struggling  Americans get another dime unless he gets a massive tax cut for the  wealthy people in blue States that has nothing to do with the  coronavirus. I am not kidding. This is his position. There is nothing  for schools, nothing for kids, nothing for the PPP, nothing for the  healthcare fight. Nobody gets a dime unless the Democratic leader gets  a massive tax cut for the rich people in New York and California. That  is what he is saying.   The Speaker of the House and the Democratic leader are continuing to  say ``our way or the highway'' with the massive wish list for leftwing  lobbyists they slapped together a few weeks ago and called a  coronavirus bill--stimulus checks for illegal immigrants, diversity  studies for the legal pot industry, and on and on.   When they put out this proposal, even the media and their fellow  Democrats pronounced this thing dead on arrival.   Here was one report: ``Neither this bill nor anything resembling it  will ever become law--it's a Democratic wish list filled up with all  the party's favored policies.''   Remember how Speaker Pelosi's own Members felt about this absurd  proposal: ``Privately, several House Democrats concede their latest  bill feels like little more than an effort to appease the most liberal  members of the caucus.''   Even Democrats knew Speaker Pelosi's bill was unserious.   But now, with the additional unemployment benefit disappearing, with  families still struggling, they are going back to this unserious  position and refusing to budge.   I can't imagine this is how Democratic colleagues really all want  this to play out.   In March, we built the CARES Act by Republicans and Democrats working  together at the committee level. This time, again, Republicans  introduced a serious proposal written by our own chairmen and our own  Members. But this time, the Democratic leader has cut Senate Democrats  out entirely. He has forbidden their committees from even talking to  Republicans. He is digging in on a House messaging bill, written with  no input from his own Members, that even House Democrats themselves  called absurd.   These are not the tactics that would build a bipartisan result. These  are not the tactics that will get more cash in Americans' pockets, more  help to the unemployed, more assistance for schools to reopen.   It is time for the Democratic leadership to get serious about making  a law--making a law--for the American people.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
