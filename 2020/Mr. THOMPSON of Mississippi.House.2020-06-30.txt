 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of  H.R. 2, the Moving Forward Act. As amended by the manager's amendment,  this bill includes language identical to my bill, H.R. 1140, the Rights  for Transportation Security Officers Act of 2020.   For over a decade, Representative Nita Lowey and I have worked to  provide TSA frontline security workers the basic rights and civil  service protections they deserve.   On March 5 of this year, this body passed H.R. 1140 with 230 ``yes''  votes, including all Democratic Members present and 14 Republican  Members.   Transportation Security Officers remain among the lowest paid Federal  workers, and they do not receive regular salaries or basic civil  service protections afforded to most other Federal employees.   In recent years, TSOs have faced government shutdowns, staff  shortages, increased passenger volumes, and increasingly difficult job  responsibilities.   Mr. Speaker, this is a good deal. I thank Chairman DeFazio for  including this critical language in the manager's amendment. I urge  support of the bill.
