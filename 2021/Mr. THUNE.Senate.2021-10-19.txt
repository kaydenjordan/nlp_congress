 Mr. President, as I begin this morning, let me just start  by reacting to a couple of things that have been said here on the floor  this morning already by my Democrat colleagues.   You know, the leader, Republican leader, when he was down here  earlier, talked about the impact of inflation on the economy, and I  have to tell you, that is very real. The inflationary impact is being  felt all across this country. Energy costs are up, gasoline costs are  up by huge amounts. Food costs are up in this country. Housing costs  are up.   There isn't hardly any area of our economy where people aren't being  impacted by inflation, meaning that the dollars that they earn are  stretching less all the time. That is not a fake thing; it is not a  temporary thing; it is a real thing. People are experiencing it in  their economic lives on a daily basis, and to hear the Democratic  leader say, well, you know, all the spending they are going to do is  not going to cost anything, that it is going to be covered by tax  increases and those tax increases are just going to hit people in the  higher income categories, also is something that just isn't accurate.   Now let me just for a minute suggest something that I think is sort  of fundamental when it comes to economics, and that is, when you have  too many dollars chasing too few goods, you get inflation. The demand  for a product goes up, and when the demand goes up, the price usually  follows along with it.   Well, we have right now a lot of government dollars that have been  swirling around the economy for some time, which is why I think in many  respects we are seeing this inflation--the highest inflation that we  have seen literally in 30 years in this country, affecting, as I said  earlier, kind of all sectors of the economy and things that people have  to purchase in their daily lives.   If you put more dollars out there, which is what is being talked  about by our Democratic colleagues--another $3.5 trillion that would  flood the economy--I think the expectation is a very real one that you  are going to see that inflationary pressure accelerate, intensify,  because when you have that much money, that many dollars chasing too  few goods, inflation is an inevitable result. The idea that we need to  spend another $3.5 trillion and that somehow that is going to be a  solution right now also is not consistent at all with the facts and the  data.   We saw here just recently the Congressional Budget Office come out  with a report that suggested that government revenues are at the  highest level--biggest increase, I should say, year over year since  1977. We are now over $4 trillion this last year in revenues--$4  trillion. It has never happened before in this country. It is the  biggest 1-year increase in revenues since 1977, paid for largely by  corporate tax receipts, which were up 75 percent year over year, and  also by individual income tax receipts, much of which was coming from  high-income earners. A lot of that increase that we have seen in income  tax receipts in this country in government revenues comes from those  people who are high-income earners.   All that to say, if you have that much revenue coming in to the  government in this country, why, then, would you need to go out and  raise taxes even more and spend even more when you have an economy that  is in the process of recovering and people concerned about inflation?  And the Democrats' solution to that is to spend more, put more money  out there, and raise taxes even higher at a time when you have historic  revenue coming in to the Federal Government. It is the first time  ever--ever--in our Nation's history that we have had over $4 trillion  in revenue come in.   The other thing that was mentioned by my colleague from Illinois just  a minute ago is that the issue of the tax gap, which was alluded to  earlier this morning on the floor by, again, the Republican leader--the  Democratic solution is to go after people, essentially shake them down,  and get them to pay more in taxes.   I am not suggesting for a minute that there aren't people out there  who aren't paying the taxes that they should under the law and that the  law needs to be enforced. What I am suggesting is that in the effort to  close that so-called tax gap, there are huge differences of opinion  about what effect that would have, how much could be generated, and who  is ultimately going to pay for that.   Well, now there is additional research out coming from the Joint  Committee on Taxation that, in fact, the Democratic efforts to close  the tax gap will hit lower income taxpayers the most.   To say that none of the tax increases or none of the tax policies  that are being proposed by the Democrats in their $3.5 trillion tax- and-spending spree proposal won't harm people who are making less than  $400,000 a year is laughable under any--any--plausible review of these  tax policies and proposals, but this one in particular hits hardest at  low-income taxpayers.   According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, people making less than  $50,000 a year will pay anywhere from 40 to 57 percent off all the  revenue that is generated off of that one proposal. People making less  than $100,000 a year will pay somewhere between 65 and 78 percent of  all the taxes that are generated under that particular proposal in the  Democratic plan. People making less than $200,000 a year would pay up  to 90 percent of the amount generated under that particular proposal in  the Democrats' plan. So people making less than $200,000 a year are  going to be paying tens of billions of dollars more in taxes just on  that one proposal which is out there, allowing the IRS essentially to  snoop into people's personal transactions up to the $600 level. I don't  think there is any way you can get around the fact that under that  scenario, people in the lower income categories are going to end up  paying the lion's share of the cost of that.   So this isn't going to be without cost. This isn't going to be  without consequence. This is not going to be without impact on lower  income taxpayers in this country. They are going to get hit and they  are going to get hit hard under this Democratic proposal.   So when we talk about it, we are talking about real impacts, real  economic impacts on the American people's lives. And we are going to  continue to do everything we can to fight against really bad tax  policies being put in place to finance massive amounts of spending,  expansion, and growth of government at a time when government revenues  just hit a historic high; never seen before; biggest year-over-year  increase in revenue since 1977. And Democrats want to raise taxes-- taxes--on everybody, including those in the lower income categories.
