 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Commander  James Christian Duncan of the 31st Combat Training Squadron of the  United States Air Force.   Lieutenant Colonel Duncan joined the Air Force in 2003 and trained at  Columbus Air Force Base where he finished with distinction, flying both  the T-6 and the T-38.   He has a distinguished training career, training other pilots on both  the F-15E and the F-35. Before the 31st was activated in April of 2021,  Duncan served as commander of Detachment 1 of the 29th Training Systems  Squadron.  [[Page H5479]]    In his career, Commander Duncan had received many honors and awards,  including the Transition Top Gun Award, Military Training Award, Flying  Excellence Award, and the Order of Daedalians AETC Commander's Trophy.   On November 1, he retired from the armed services and is looking  forward to opportunities with his family, Amy, Elliana, Micah, and  Sarah.   I thank Commander Duncan for a career of service to our country and  wish him the best in retirement.                            ____________________
