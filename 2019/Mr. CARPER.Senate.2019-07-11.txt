 Mr. President, I rise in opposition today to the  nomination of Peter Wright to serve as the Assistant Administrator for  EPA's Office of Land and Emergency Management.   I take little joy in opposing the nomination but do so for three  reasons. Before I say those three reasons--I stood on this floor right  up until the end of the last Congress, trying to get Peter Wright  confirmed with a unanimous consent approach, and we failed at the very  end.   The irony of it is, having stood here and tried to get him confirmed  at the end of the last Congress and today being in a position in which  I am asking for us to postpone, at least for today, his nomination-- there is an irony there, and I don't have the time to go into all of  the reasons, but I will mention a few of them.   In the last Congress, I worked with the EPA to negotiate a set of  significant policy concessions that I believe would have allowed the  Senate minority to agree to a more expeditious confirmation process for  Mr. Wright.   I worked diligently until the closing of the last Congress--right  until the bitter end, if you will--to achieve that objective, as I have  done in good faith for other EPA nominees.   In fact, the very last nominee confirmed in the last Congress was an  EPA nominee to head the Agency's Tribal Office, Chad McIntosh. My staff  and I and others were very much involved in getting him confirmed.   In this Congress, EPA has refused to reengage with my office, with  our committee staff, or with me on this nomination. The Agency no  longer agrees to the policy concessions that I previously secured and  to which they had previously committed in the last Congress. While this  has been a real disappointment for me, unfortunately, it is hardly a  surprise, given the increasingly extreme policy and tone of this EPA.   Second, EPA, under Mr. Wright's leadership for the past year, has  failed to advance an area of policy that is critical to me and to many  other Senators, and that is the regulation of PFAS chemicals known as  permanent chemicals. Per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances, known  as PFAS, are a class of manmade chemicals that includes something  called PFOA, PFOS,  [[Page S4791]]  GenX, and many other chemicals. Developed in the 1940s, PFAS can be  found across industries in many products, including food packaging,  nonstick pans, clothing, furniture, and firefighting foam used by the  military.   Just this week, Donald Trump said: ``We have the cleanest water we  have ever had.'' The President has often made this statement while  asserting his commitment to ensure that our drinking water is safe.   In his confirmation hearing, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said:         It is these Americans that President Trump and his       Administration are focused on, Americans without access to       safe drinking water or Americans living on or near hazardous       sites, often unaware of the health risks that they and their       families face. Many of these sites have languished for years,       even decades. How can these Americans prosper if they cannot       live, learn, or work in healthy environments? The answer is       simple. They cannot. President Trump understands this and       that is why he is focused on putting Americans first.    That is from Andrew Wheeler, now our EPA Administrator.   Yet under Peter Wright's leadership for the past year, EPA's Office  of Land and Management has failed to heed these words. Peter Wright  serves on a temporary basis without confirmation.   I think we have a poster here that is relevant.   A study released today by the Environmental Working Group identified  712 locations in 49 States that are contaminated with PFAS--712  locations in 49 States that are contaminated with PFAS--from coast to  coast, from our Canadian border to the Gulf Stream waters.   Just last year, the town of Blades in the southern part of Delaware  alerted its 1,250 residents to stop using public water for drinking and  cooking because of PFAS contamination at nearly twice the Federal  health advisory level.   Just an hour from Blades, up north on Route 13, officials at the  Dover Air Force Base found that 36 of the 37 sampled ground water wells  showed dangerously high levels of PFOS and PFOA, related to, we  believe, the use of chemicals in firefighting foam at the base.   It is not just Delaware. PFAS contamination is widespread, in red  States, in blue States, in small water systems and large ones, on  military sites and in residential areas, from Maine to Alaska.   While industrial manufacturers and users of these chemicals are  responsible for much of the contamination, it turns out that a  principal user of PFAS was our military.   I speak as a retired Navy Captain speaking here to a Presiding  Officer who is a marine, and for us it is personal and part of our  history in the military.   But it turns out that a principal user of PFAS was the military,  which used it as a firefighting foam, as I said earlier.   In 1973, I was a young naval flight officer stationed at Moffett  Field naval air station in California, and on a sunny April day, as I  was driving into work from my home in Palo Alto, I saw a big, black  plume of smoke rising above my base after, as it turned out, a massive  NASA Convair jet descended on runway. We had parallel runways, and air  traffic control had directed two aircraft to land on the same runway at  the same time. As a result, the large NASA Convair jet descended on a  runway where a P-3 aircraft--my sister squadron's aircraft--had already  landed and was taxiing, and the larger aircraft literally landed on top  of the smaller aircraft.   It took over an hour for firefighters to control the blaze. Sixteen  people died, and only one crewman on the P-3 survived. These were my  brothers and sisters. These were my sister squadron mates.   I understand that PFAS-containing foam has supported our military  readiness and saved lives better than most, but the cruel irony is that  when PFAS winds up in a glass on the kitchen table, these same  chemicals endanger lives.   The Environmental Working Group--that is the name of a group--has  identified 117 military sites, including 77 airfields, with PFAS  contamination because of the use of PFAS-containing foam to both train  for and fight fires involving highly flammable jet fuels.   Yet in many States, cleanup of these sites has been stalled, and the  military has shockingly been part of the problem.   In May of last year, 2018, then-EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt held a  PFAS National Leadership Summit and proudly announced four ``concrete  steps'' that EPA would take to address PFAS contamination. The second  of these four steps was that EPA would propose designating PFOA and  PFOS--two of the most dangerous, troubling elements in this class of  chemicals--as hazardous substances under the Superfund law. That was  more than a year ago.   Making that designation would compel the Defense Department to stop  fighting cleanups in States all across the country. Indeed, in some  cases, the Defense Department has justified its refusal to clean up  PFAS contamination on grounds that the Superfund designation has not  yet been made.   Designating these substances as hazardous would also unleash EPA  resources to address cleanups of orphan sites where there is no  identified liable polluter.   Despite Scott Pruitt's commitment to move forward with the  designation of PFAS as a hazardous substance under the Superfund law,  under Peter Wright's watch, EPA hasn't even proposed--has not even  proposed--to do that, let alone finalize the action. At this rate, it  will be at least another year, maybe longer, before this vital step  will be taken. Americans deserve better than this, and they deserve  greater urgency on this issue.    Last month, the U.S. Senate, right here, passed its National Defense  Authorization Act, which included several important bipartisan  provisions to address PFAS contamination. Notably, I could not even  secure an agreement to allow a vote on my amendment that would  designate PFAS as hazardous substances under the Superfund law. I did  not get a vote on my amendment, despite the fact that 35 Democratic and  Republican cosponsors on bipartisan legislation clearly signaled their  support for this policy. Meanwhile, EPA continues to drag its heels,  acting with far more urgency to repeal environmental regulations than  to clean up the water our government's own activities have  inadvertently contaminated. Mr. Wright will have the ability to make  this hazardous substances designation for PFAS if he is confirmed. Let  me say that again. Mr. Wright will have the ability to make this  hazardous substance designation for PFAS if he is confirmed. He should  hear strongly from this Senate our collective desire that he urgently  do so.   It was my hope that, despite the many disagreements my colleagues and  I have had with the Trump EPA on their views on climate change and some  environmental rollbacks, there could at least be some commonsense  agreement on the need to clean up widespread PFAS contamination. That  has not been the case, at least thus far.   Third, and finally, a late-breaking matter came to the committee's  attention this week regarding an ethics investigation into Mr. Wright's  financial disclosures. Chairman Barrasso and I received news from the  White House Office of Government Ethics, known as OGE, that Mr. Wright,  despite numerous written assurances to the contrary, held stock in  DowDuPont at the time he filed his nominee financial disclosure report  and continued to do so until this March 12, a couple of months ago.  Although EPA believes that Mr. Wright has complied with all applicable  ethics laws during that period of time, OGE, the Office of Government  Ethics, asserts that it currently lacks the information necessary to  make such a determination or to send a completed amendment to his  ethics agreement and financial disclosure report to our committee.   OGE, Office of Government Ethics, felt compelled to share this  information with the EPW Committee because of its direct relevance to  the Senate's consideration of Mr. Wright's nomination today.   In light of the ongoing OGE investigation, I would implore my  colleagues to delay the Senate's consideration of Mr. Wright's  nomination for the time being. I don't suggest delaying consideration  of this nominee lightly. Again, I was one of the key people standing in  this Chamber back at the end of December trying to get this man  confirmed. In fact, any delay in the Senate's confirmation and the  Senate's consideration of Mr. Wright's  [[Page S4792]]  nomination would not prevent him from continuing to serve in his  current capacity, as he has done since he first arrived at EPA in an  acting capacity on July 9, 2018.   I strongly believe we must afford OGE--Office of Government Ethics-- and EPA the opportunity to complete their investigations into this  matter and fully share all relevant information, for both the sake of  Mr. Wright and for the Agency. If the facts are as described by EPA,  then a completed investigation would be to Mr. Wright's benefit. Let me  say that again. If the facts are as described by EPA, then a completed  investigation would be to Mr. Wright's benefit.   Let me close by saying, if, however, OGE and EPA reach a different  conclusion, such information would be directly relevant to every  Senator's deliberation when voting whether to confirm Peter Wright to  the position of Assistant Administrator in the Office of Land and  Emergency Management at EPA.   From conversations I had with EPA yesterday, it is my understanding  that EPA is working to get the relevant information to OGE to provide  to the Senate. Proceeding with the consideration of this nomination  while resolution of this ethics matter between EPA and OGE is pending I  think deprives the Senate of important and relevant information. I have  urged delaying this vote today. I would do so again. In the absence of  that delay, along with the other reasons I mentioned, I will vote no on  the motion to proceed to the nomination of Peter Wright. I urge my  colleagues to do the same.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two  congressional fellows in Senator Udall's office, Caitlin Keating- Bitonti and Lindsay Coughtry, be granted floor privileges for the  remainder of the 116th Congress.
