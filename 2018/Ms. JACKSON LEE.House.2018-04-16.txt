 Mr. Speaker, as my colleague has already mentioned,  this is Sexual Assault Awareness Month, a very important statement for  preventing violence against women, men, boys, and girls. I rise today  to say that it is still of great concern to all of us, and particularly  young women.   One in five women in this country have been raped, and four out of  five rape victims are under the age of 25. Girls and young women  between the ages of 16 and 24 experience the highest rate of intimate  partner violence, almost triple the national average.   This is the time for us to join together. In a few weeks, I will be  introducing the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. It  is legislation that has drawn bipartisan support.   I look forward to the support of my colleagues, Republicans and  Democrats, because it will emphasize critical services such as  transitional housing, legal assistance, and supervised visitation  services, but, more importantly, working with the police and law  enforcement community's preventative measures and working with outreach  for boys and men.   Prevention is part of this legislation as well as protecting our  survivors, as well as educating people against this dastardly act. I  look forward to the introduction of this legislation and those who will  join me--men and women--to support the reauthorization of the Violence  Against Women Act for 2018.                            ____________________
