 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize three extraordinary  women: Nouf Abdulaziz, Loujain Al-Hathloul, and Eman Al-Nafjan.   For nearly 2 years, these women have been imprisoned, placed in  solitary confinement, and tortured by the Saudi Government, all because  they used their voices to express the need for the government to  recognize the fundamental rights and dignity of women.   Under Saudi Arabia's male guardianship system, which requires women  to obtain permission of their male guardians in healthcare, employment,  and travel decisions, the very notion of women's rights or, for that  matter, human rights, is effectively nonexistent.   Despite the Saudi Government's recent claims of social reform, an  unacceptably oppressive status quo continues to dominate virtually  every aspect of life for women in Saudi Arabia.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me as a cosponsor of H.  Res. 129, a resolution which calls for the immediate release of these  activists and calls on the administration to impose sanctions on Saudi  officials responsible for human rights violations.   Let us come together, Democrats and Republicans alike, in demanding  the release of these courageous women.                            ____________________
