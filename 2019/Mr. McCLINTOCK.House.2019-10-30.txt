 Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Chairwoman, when I chaired the Federal Lands Subcommittee a few  years ago, the ranking Democratic member was from Massachusetts. She  shared the Democrats' goal of having the Federal Government acquire as  much land in the west as it possibly could. Try as I might, I could  never impress upon her the difference between a State like  Massachusetts, where the Federal Government owns only 1.2 percent of  the land, and a State like mine, California, where it controls 46  percent. I have got one county in my district where the Federal  Government owns 93 percent of the land.    And I tried in vain to get her to understand the dire economic  implications for her district if the Federal Government one day seized  46 percent of her State, took it off the tax rolls, restricted public  access, and forbade any productive use on it. What would that do to her  State's economy? Yet, that is precisely what the Federal Government has  done to the west.   Now, the Federal Government owns 39 percent of the State of Arizona.  Our  [[Page H8611]]  holdings include the largest deposit of high-grade uranium ore in the  United States, one of the largest in the world. Its development is  critically important to our future defense and energy needs at a time  when 93 percent of the uranium we use comes from foreign governments.   Now, the Federal Government not only owns these critical deposits, it  is responsible to the American people for their wise management and  productive use.   Now, a rational person might say, well, thank God we can be  independent of foreign governments and develop these reserves for the  benefit of taxpayers and the economy. A rational person might say that.   But, of course, this bill is anything but rational. It would close  these Federal lands, a million acres of them, far from the Grand  Canyon, I might add, just to be clear, and forbid the American people  from benefiting from these rich uranium deposits on the land that the  American people own.                                time  1245    This bill imposes a completely irrational total prohibition on the  development of these resources and devastates the economic potential  for the communities nearby.   Indeed, this bill is most strongly opposed by the local  representative from these communities, Congressman Gosar. The elected  county supervisor from Mohave County came to Washington to plead with  the Democrats not to hobble the economy of their rural district in this  way. Once again, the Democrats dismissed the pleas of local residents  in order to scratch their own ideological itch to seize as much land as  they can and put it off-limits to the American people.   Madam Chair, I would remind the Democrats that this was the practice  of the early Kings of England. They set aside one-third of the English  countryside, declared them to be the King's Forests, off-limits to the  common people. This practice so enraged the English people that no  fewer than five clauses in the Magna Carta were written to redress  their grievance.   Not content to limit such devastating restrictions to the Federal  lands, this measure would also hamstring mining on tens of thousands of  acres of State trust fund lands, which help fund Arizona's public  schools and hospitals.   The Democrats have waged a war against agriculture and mining for  many years now. This bill is just their latest ham-handed example.   I think the American people need to wake up to what a devastating  future these policies will produce. Think about this: Everything that  we touch, everything that provides for our survival, our comfort, our  quality of life, absolutely everything, is either mined or is grown. I  don't know of any exceptions.   I think it is time we carefully consider the nihilism of the modern  left and where it would take our communities and where it would take  our country before it is too late.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Chairwoman, when I chaired the Public Lands Subcommittee, we  set three overarching principles for the management of our public  lands: to restore public access to the public lands, to restore good  management to the public lands, and to restore the Federal Government  as a good neighbor to those communities directly impacted by the public  lands.   This bill appears to me to be the opposite of all of these  principles. It closes off public use and access, it consigns our lands  to a policy of neglect, and it thumbs our nose at the wishes of many of  the people in the affected region.   H.R. 823 is a lopsided bill that offers a comparatively small, 28,000  acres, for motorized access versus roughly 400,000 acres of new  wilderness enclosures. So 7 percent of the land is provided for  motorized access and 93 percent of the land is closed to that access.  That means, Madam Chair, you can't drive in to enjoy a family camping  trip, and you can't even bring bicycles.   It withdraws all these lands from any kind of resource development,  which means that taxpayers will not have the benefit of revenues that  these lands could produce. Much of the acreage designated for  wilderness restrictions does not even meet the legal requirements under  the Wilderness Act, and yet they are imposed in disregard of that law.  So, so much for the public's right to use the public lands.   As the growing menace of wildfires attests, 45 years of neglect of  sound forest management due to the so-called environmental laws of the  1970s has abandoned our forests to themselves, and like any untended  garden, an abandoned forest will grow and grow and grow until it chokes  itself to death, and it is then consumed by catastrophic wildfire.  Modern forest management broke this cycle of morbid overgrowth followed  by catastrophic wildfire. I can tell you, in a State with a significant  wildfire risk, this bill would further reduce the acres that have been  identified as suitable for active forest management by approximately  8,000 acres. So, so much for good management of the public lands.   This bill flies in the face of significant local opposition, as  expressed by many of the locally elected representatives of the  communities affected by this legislation, as we have heard from Mr.  Tipton. Rural county commissioners have warned that this bill will harm  the economies of their local communities by removing multiple-use  designations from these lands. In fact, when Republicans offered an  amendment calling for consultation with the local communities that have  been ignored by this legislation, that amendment was rejected on a  party-line vote. So, so much for being a good neighbor to communities  most affected by the Federal lands.   Now, in the past, the Natural Resources Committee has prided itself  on attempting to forge bipartisan consensus on its bills. Those days  appear to be over. In fact, 65 percent of the lands affected by H.R.  823 aren't even in the author's district. They are in the district of  Mr. Tipton, who has just expressed his significant concerns over this  legislation, who was never consulted before the bill was introduced,  and who was barred from engaging the bill's sponsor during the  committee's consideration of the bill on April 2. In this kangaroo  proceeding, the bill's author acted as a witness, an advocate, and the  chairman of the proceeding all at the same time.   Every Republican Member from Colorado opposes this bill, and the bill  is reported to us on a straight party-line vote. It is obvious that the  majority has no interest in balancing the concerns of local residents,  taxpayers, recreational user groups, and conservation groups, but  instead feels entitled to impose its will over the pleas of the people  most directly impacted. Fortunately, our system of government assures  that such legislation, while it might pass one House, as I am sure it  will tomorrow, but it will have no chance of becoming law--and rightly  so.
