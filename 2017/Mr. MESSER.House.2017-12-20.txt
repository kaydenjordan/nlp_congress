 Mr. Speaker, today is an exciting day for the people of  Indiana. With the passage of President Trump's tax plan, working  Hoosiers will see more jobs, bigger paychecks, and a fairer, simpler  Tax Code.   The scare tactics of my Democratic colleagues come from a tired  playbook written decades ago. It is old-style  [[Page H10257]]  class warfare politics and tired arguments that are just not true.   The proof is in the paycheck. The truth is, an average Indiana family  will see tax cuts of between $1,000 and $2,000 under this plan.   Let me say that again. Despite the rhetoric, working families will  see a tax cut of between $1,000 and $2,000 under today's tax plan.  Child tax credits will double to $2,000 per child. The standard Federal  deduction will double, too.   We get rid of the unpopular and unfair Obama individual mandate tax.  Now, Hoosiers will not be taxed depending on their healthcare  decisions.   Job creators will see tax cuts, too, making America's small  businesses and big businesses competitive in the global economy and  better able to create good-paying jobs.   All of this is good news for Indiana's working families. With today's  tax cut, help is on the way. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
