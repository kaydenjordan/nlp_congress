 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor my friend and fellow  Hoosier, Sidney Eskenazi. He will be celebrating his 90th birthday this  March 25.   Sidney is a true philanthropist and civic leader. He and his loving  wife, Lois, serve as pillars of our Hoosier community and role models  for future generations. Without their charitable efforts, many Hoosiers  would not have access to higher education, the fine arts, and quality  healthcare.   Indiana is indebted to the Eskenazis for their leadership and  generosity over the past five decades.   The Pence family, my wife, my children, are truly blessed to consider  Sidney and Lois close friends, and we thank them for serving our  communities with a true servant heart.   God bless Sid and Lois, and I look forward to continuing to work with  them for the benefit of Hoosiers everywhere.   Happy birthday, Sid.
