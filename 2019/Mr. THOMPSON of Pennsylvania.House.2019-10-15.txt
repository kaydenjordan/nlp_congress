 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  recognition of the organization SkillsUSA.   Last month, I had the pleasure of joining more than 550 students and  advisers from 29 different States at SkillsUSA's annual Washington  Leadership Training Institute program, which culminated in a rally at  the Capitol.   SkillsUSA is a partnership of students, teachers, and industry  leaders working together to ensure America has a skilled workforce that  is capable of closing our Nation's skills gap through career and  technical education, otherwise known as CTE.   There are more than 7 million job openings in the United States  today. Many of these jobs don't require a 4-year college degree, but  they do require skills-based training in any number of fields,  including STEM, nursing, information technology, cybersecurity, and so  much more.   CTE is an investment in learners at every stage of life that empowers  students to take control of their futures with valuable training that  can lead to well-paying and rewarding jobs. SkillsUSA is a leader in  this movement.                            ____________________
