 Mr. Speaker, the Biden proposed surveillance scheme is  an ill-advised power grab, which is turning trusted local financial  institutions into IRS reporting agents infringing upon the privacy of  everyday Americans.   The IRS already knows how much you earn. Now they want to know  exactly how you spend it. This is a total breach of personal financial  privacy with a presumption of guilt that I am not okay with.   How can we expect our citizens to place trust in their government  when their government is keeping tabs on their every single  transaction?   A lot of people wonder how people come to Congress and become  millionaires while they are serving in Congress.   This is just another push by the government to exercise control over  our everyday lives. It is also a disincentive for people to save and  keep money in banks and credit unions because they don't want to have  every single thing tracked. Do we want to have our savings kept in  coffee cans or mattresses? That is a pretty bad way to go.   Whether it is $600 per transaction or up to $10,000 per year  cumulative, it is an invasion of privacy. We don't need another 80,000  IRS agents tracking us when we have a border that is like a sieve and  other problems of much greater magnitude than what you or I are saving  or spending our personal wealth on.   It is a wrongheaded policy. The Biden administration and this House  needs to take back such ideas.                            ____________________
