 Madam President, 108 years ago on April 24, 1915,  Ottoman Turkey began the systematic killing and deportation of Armenian  intellectuals and community leaders in Constantinople. Between 1915 and  1923, an estimated 1-and-a-half million Armenians fell victim to one of  history's most ruthless and notorious genocides. Most who survived  eventually emigrated to different parts of the world, forming a  widespread diaspora. The American people have a proud history of  recognizing and condemning the Armenian genocide and have provided  relief and a new home to many of the Armenians, Greeks, Assyrians,  Chaldeans, Syriacs, Arameans, Maronites, and other Christians who  survived this campaign of mass extermination. Today, Armenian Americans  are a vital part of the cultural fabric of the United States.   As we commemorate this dark period, I would encourage my colleagues  to remember that atrocities like the Armenian genocide are almost never  spontaneous events. They typically follow a period of human rights  violations, discrimination, and violence against specific groups who  often share a racial, ethnic, religious, or social identity. Most  recently, we have seen this in the Chinese Communist Party's inhumane  treatment of ethnic minorities, including the persecution of Uyghurs,  Tibetans, and Mongolians and dissenters in Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan,  and further abroad. Our foreign policy should recognize this, fight  denialism of past and current crimes, and emphasize the preservation of  human rights rather than relying on eleventh hour action that comes far  too late for vulnerable populations.   On behalf of all Tennesseans, I offer this solemn recognition of the  Armenian genocide and ask my colleagues to join me in pledging to fight  the forces of evil still causing so much pain and suffering around the  globe.                            ____________________
