Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms.  Scanlon), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, we have a crisis at our southern border that  has captured the attention of the American people but has fallen on  deaf ears among my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and, much  more importantly, the President and the administration at the other end  of Pennsylvania Avenue.   Just yesterday, I received a text from multiple law enforcement  officers along the southern border, whether it is with the Department  of Public Safety from Texas or whether it is with Border Patrol. For  example, this is a quote:         As of last night, the radios went crazy for west and south       Laredo, waves of folks, literally just group after group,       bum-rushing the border. The agents were spread thin as hell.        In my precinct, we are literally all doubled up because our       units are breaking down every other day. Ranchers are calling       every other day, stating there are folks on their property,       but we can't get there fast enough.        I hate to say this, but we are getting our rear-ends handed       to us. I used to have patterns, trends, and knew the dropoff,       pickup areas, but now it is an ``expletive'' free-for-all.        Approximately 600 bodies at the gate just half a mile east       from Yarbrough happening right now in El Paso.    I have hundreds of these texts right now flooding into my phone, like  every other Member of Congress, because what is happening is an abject  failure at the border. It is a humanitarian crisis for Americans and  for migrants.   Mr. Speaker, 5 million have been encountered at the southern border,  and 2 million have been released into the United States, incentivizing  more to come.   Over 1.5 million have evaded apprehension--i.e., got-aways evading  detection from Border Patrol since the beginning of this  administration.   Fentanyl is pouring into our communities. Border Patrol has seized  over 35,000 pounds of fentanyl. Just last Thursday morning, I met with  three fentanyl moms out of dozens of moms that I met with because their  children have died from fentanyl.   Eight children in the school district in the county in which I reside  southwest of Austin have died of fentanyl poisoning since last August.  Over 10 have had to be resuscitated, revived with Narcan.   Just last summer, 53 migrants were effectively cooked in a tractor- trailer in the hot Texas heat in San Antonio, Texas.   Mr. Speaker, 856 dead migrant bodies were found along the Rio Grande,  in south Texas, and on ranches. Little girls are sold into the sex  trafficking trade, held in stash houses in Laredo, Brownsville, El  Paso, San Antonio, Houston, and throughout this country.   We know this to be true. It is documented to be true. Now, the  administration can't even keep up with the children that we have, with  85,000, according to The New York Times, not able to be contacted.   My colleagues just blindly wipe that away, saying: That is not true.  It was a phone call. They didn't get them. They must be with a family  member.   What Member of this body would treat their child that way? Oh, I  called and didn't get ahold of them. Oh, well.   We do that with 85,000 children. I guess that is not nearly as  effective as a photo op in white pantsuits sitting next to kids in  cages, allegedly, despite that those cages were created by the previous  administration specifically for the protection of children. Oh, no. It  doesn't look as good to have a photo op when you have 85,000 missing  children.   Tomorrow, title 42 expires. Now, for the average American, title 42,  they don't know what that is. What it is, is a part of our health code  that allows us to say that we are going to turn people away in the  middle of a pandemic.   Yet, the administration has been using that as effectively their only  means of managing the border, to the extent you can call it managing  the border.   In March, for example, there were approximately 200,000  apprehensions. We are going to blow right through that right now  because we are at 10,000, 11,000, 12,000 apprehensions a day.   When you add those 200,000 apprehensions, not even counting all the  parole, half of those are being turned away under title 42.   When title 42 expires tomorrow, more will come. There is an explosion  at the border. None will be turned away because this administration has  specifically chosen to ignore the law. This administration is refusing  to do their job to defend the border of the United States.   The least compassionate, the least Christian, the least empathetic  thing that a country could do is to allow human beings to be used as  political pawns by cartels for profit while Americans die by the  thousands, while migrants get raped, abused, and put in stash houses by  cartels for profit by the thousands, while migrants die along the  southern border by the hundreds, if not the thousands now, while our  own people get overrun on their own ranches.   I sat and met with ranch owners in south Texas who had run across the  dead body of a young woman, a mother with a baby, on their ranch.   Imagine the most powerful Nation in the history of the world thinking  it is compassionate to have a system that allows that. Yet, that is  precisely what we do.   Unfortunately, what my colleagues' response will be is, oh, we are  going to have to do something about our immigration system and future  flow in, figuring out what we are going to do to make sure that we  reform immigration.   Don't you know that if we had comprehensive immigration reform, this  would all just magically evaporate? That is completely not true.   The fact of the matter is, the starting point for any sensible border  and immigration plan is a secure border in which you actually enforce  the laws of the United States. Why? So people know what the rules are.  We allow 600,000 to 1 million, 1.2 million, depending on the year,  people to come into this country legally, as we should.    Yes, we need to reform our immigration system, but none of it matters  if  [[Page H2185]]  we are going to embrace lawlessness and wide-open borders and ignore  the rule of law to the detriment of people and to the detriment of the  very system that attracts people from around the world.   We should be exporting the rule of law rather than importing  lawlessness, fentanyl, death, and destruction. The legislation we have  before us would be a giant step toward ensuring that we can hold this  administration accountable to make sure that we secure our border,  protect our citizens, and protect migrants who seek to come here.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, just a couple of points.   First of all, this tired talking point of 90 percent of narcotics  being captured at the ports of entry; well, of course, that is the only  place where we have Border Patrol. Because they are overwhelmed doing  processing, we don't have anybody patrolling the border between the  ports of entry. So, of course, you are collecting and finding a higher  percentage of narcotics at the ports of entry.   The second point, is this idea that this is treating kids inhumanely.  Let's be very clear that what we do in this policy is treat children  from other countries exactly as we treat them from Mexico and Canada  under current law.   More importantly, President Obama, that radical, MAGA extremist,  President Barack Obama asked for this fix in his bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Burgess).    Mr. Speaker, I have to address, at least for a minute, this  disparaging commentary about the Governor of Texas busing migrants.   Well, I guess my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would like  to ignore the fact that the Democrat mayor of El Paso was teaming up  with Governor Abbott to do that. The Democrat mayor of El Paso was  teaming up with the Governor of Texas, Governor Abbott, to do just  that. Walk a mile in our shoes in the State of Texas where we have  hundreds of thousands of people pouring into our communities throughout  the State of Texas. Welcome to the party.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina  (Mr. Norman).                                time  1645     Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentleman from South Carolina.    Mr. Speaker, I would just remind my colleagues that it was  in December when we got a $1.7 trillion omnibus spending bill that was  4,000 pages long around 1 a.m., and then we voted on it the next day.  In that bill there was specific language that prohibited the Department  of Homeland Security from actually securing the homeland by securing  the border.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr.  Alford).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Good).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this crisis has taken an unimaginable toll on the State  of Texas, my home State, and the citizens there as well as the migrants  seeking to come into this country. I get contacted every single day,  like my colleagues from Texas.   In 2022, more than 2,000 Texans died from fentanyl poisoning, a 500  percent increase from 2019. I have already talked about the 53 migrants  killed in a tractor-trailer in the Texas heat.   Texas has been forced to deal with it on their own, spending $4  billion of their own budget, $3 billion last cycle because we are  having to deal with a job the Federal Government is supposed to do. El  Paso, state of emergency; Laredo, state of emergency; Brownsville,  state of emergency; San Antonio, beefing up to try to deal with the  surge. We are dealing with it every single day in Texas.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas  (Ms. Van Duyne).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Brecheen).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   What we offer today through this rule will be legislation that will  strengthen our southern border, secure this country, protect Americans,  protect migrants, and ensure that our communities can be safe,  particularly along our southern border in States like Texas where the  Speaker pro tempore and I and many of our colleagues reside and other  friends of ours in Arizona, New Mexico, and California, that are  dealing with this every single day.   This bill is pretty simple. It strengthens and requires the  administration to enforce existing law and closes the asylum and  detention loopholes that have been exploited for years. It curbs  release into the interior, a massive pull factor, by requiring DHS to  detain, remove, or place in a safe third country, but in doing so  allows a path for migrants to be able to pursue asylum claims and just  simply follows current law to not be released into the United States.  Again, it is pretty straightforward.   It reimplements the asylum deals that were working and ends the bogus  asylum claims. It keeps families together while asylum claims are being  processed.   It protects unaccompanied children by reforming TVPRA, a request from  the Obama administration. It requires DHS to immediately resume border  wall construction, which President Biden has halted.   The fact is the American people are very well aware of the crisis at  the border that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle seem to  ignore.   I had some friends send me, while I was speaking here, the comment  section from The New York Times. I am not talking about Breitbart or  something. I am talking about The New York Times. Page after page after  page of citizens saying, for example: Though I have always voted  Democrat, my vote in the next Presidential election will go to  whichever candidate has the best, most seemingly effective plan for  securing our border. It is the most pressing issue for our country.   If only the President and my Democratic colleagues would agree.                                time  1715    The fact of the matter is we have a devastating crisis that is  killing Americans and killing migrants. Right now, to be very clear,  our Border Patrol agents and law enforcement community along the  southern border are overwhelmed. They are crying out for help.   I had a man text me just a minute ago that works with Border Patrol  and DPS. He said:         We are in a Broken Arrow moment. We are overrun. We have no       place to go. We have a crisis.    This body needs to respond, and we need to take action as we speak.   Mr. Speaker, shortly, I will be offering an amendment to the rule.  The amendment is a very short, one-page modification that makes clear  that Congress will address, within 60 days, the dangerous cartels  confronting our country. It will add a sense of Congress to clarify  certain language involving agricultural issues relating to E-Verify.                         amendment offered by mr. roy     Mr. Speaker, I offer an amendment to the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the resolution, as amended.   The material previously referred to by Ms. Scanlon is as follows:     An Amendment to H. Res. 383 Offered By Ms. Scanlon of Pennsylvania         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       resolution (H. Res. 178) affirming the House of       Representatives' commitment to protect and strengthen Social       Security and Medicare. The resolution shall be considered as       read. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on       the resolution and preamble to adoption without intervening       motion or demand for division of the question except one hour       of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means or       their respective designees.        Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H. Res. 178.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move  the previous question on the amendment and on the resolution.
