 I will just say  Godspeed to someone who, to me, will always be the dean of the House  and represent what this body is supposed to be: down to Earth and  sophisticated at the same time, highly principled, and expert at making  the sausage.   This is the people's House, and John Dingell was the people's  Representative.
