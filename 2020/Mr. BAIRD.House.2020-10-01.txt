 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the heroic efforts  of West Lafayette Police Officer Brian Danosky.   On the morning of August 27, Officer Danosky found 22-year-old Troy  Moffitt, who was bleeding from a gunshot wound. Not knowing if the  shooter was still in the area, Officer Danosky ignored the danger to  his life and rushed to save Mr. Moffitt. Officer Danosky applied a  tourniquet to Moffitt's leg, an act that saved Mr. Moffitt's life.   Officer Danosky went above and beyond the call of duty and risked his  own safety to save the life of a citizen he swore to protect and serve.  For that, Officer Danosky will be the third officer in the last 10  years to receive the Silver Merit Award.   I commend Officer Danosky for his act of bravery, and on behalf of  all Hoosiers in the Fourth District, I thank him for his service.   Mr. Speaker, I offer Officer Danosky's story to my colleagues not  only to highlight his heroic actions, but to remind them that our  police officers are dedicated public servants who want to protect their  communities.   Unfortunately, there is a growing movement to disparage and defund  our law enforcement officers. There are even some in this Congress who  advocate defunding police departments. We are already seeing the  disastrous effects happening over our country in cities where they  slice police budgets.   New York City took $1 billion from their police budget amid rising  crime. In July, the city saw a 59 percent increase in murders compared  to last year.   The city of Minneapolis is pushing to eliminate their police  department at a time when they are seeing a spike in murders.   What makes this rise in crime even more tragic is that the victims  are often from underserved communities, the same communities, we are  told, that will benefit from fewer police officers in their  neighborhoods.   These communities are no different from the communities in my  district. They want the same thing: good jobs, good schools, safe  communities, and a place to raise their families.   I will continue to support our police officers and oppose any efforts  to defund them.                       Supporting the Second Amendment     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the millions of  Americans who are exercising their Second Amendment right and becoming  law-abiding gun owners.   As people across our Nation and across our country watch riots and  crime consume our cities and the elected leaders in those cities do  little or nothing to stop it, people will ensure they have the means to  defend themselves and their family. These millions of Americans who are  purchasing these firearms are exercising their God-given and  constitutional right to self-defense.   Since March of this year, at least 1.5 million firearms have been  sold every month. I pledge to these new gun owners that I will not only  work to restore law and order to our communities, but also protect the  Second Amendment and make certain every American has the right to  protect themselves and their families.                               E Pluribus Unum     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remind my fellow citizens  that, despite our differences and beliefs and our deep divisions, we  can still come together as one nation under one flag.   We remember the words stitched on our Nation's first seal, ``e  pluribus unum,'' ``out of many, one.'' No matter where you came from,  what creed you follow, or the color of your skin, we are one nation  united under the banner of freedom.   This great experiment in self-government that we call the United  States of America has been able to achieve great things like defeating  Nazi Germany and landing a man on the Moon because we came together as  one. When we stand shoulder to shoulder, there is no obstacle our  country can't overcome.   I ask every American to reflect and remember the bonds that unite us  and  [[Page H5119]]  that they are stronger than those that divide us.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to call up H.R.  8265 to extend the Paycheck Protection Program to keep millions of  employees on the payroll of America's small businesses.
