 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a one-of-a-kind, remarkable  man and consummate researcher and teacher, Dr. Douglas Neckers of  northwest Ohio, who passed away just last week at the age of 84.   Dr. Neckers had an accomplished career as a photochemical scientist.  He was a true Renaissance man: a lover of history, the arts, and the  written word. He shared his wisdom in the opinion pages of newspapers  across our State.   Doug served as the head of Bowling Green State University's chemistry  department, founded its Center for Photochemical Sciences, and was a  pioneer of 3D printing technologies and so many successful companies  that were born from that. Even in later years, he raised awareness and  kept learning about topics such as the mindset of Nazi scientists who  invented chemical weapons during World War II. He was seeking always to  build understanding and to promote and uplift humankind.   When thinking of Dr. Neckers, I call to mind the words of Mahatma  Gandhi:        Strength does not come from physical capacity. It comes       from an indomitable will.   [[Page H8781]]     An indomitable will coursed through every fiber of Doug's spirit. He  was a force of nature in every one of his days.   Today, as we mourn Doug's passing, may his family and we find comfort  in the knowledge that his legacy lives on in all who knew him: every  institution that he built, every student he influenced, and every  person blessed to call him friend.                            ____________________
