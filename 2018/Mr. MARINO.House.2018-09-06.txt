 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Arrington for providing  this opportunity to talk about term limits, and I thank my colleagues  who were here to comment on it.  [[Page H7913]]    First of all, I would like to take a moment to pay tribute and thank  our veterans, our law enforcement, our emergency service people, and  their families for how they protect us. If it weren't for them, we  would not be able to be in this Chamber doing what we are doing  tonight.   Now, I am probably, in years, age, the oldest Member here who is  talking about term limits. I am in my eighth year, so it is my fourth  term. When I first ran for Congress in 2010, I advocated for term  limits, and I have introduced legislation in the past three election  cycles for term limits.   President Trump ran on draining the swamp, and I believe that term  limits are the exact way to ensure that we drain the swamp and  effectively serve the American people. I can remember when I was on the  campaign trail many, many months with the President, and one of the  things he asked me, he said: What would you do to change Congress?   I said: Term limits.   He said to me: You would be putting yourself out of a job.   I said: It wasn't designed to be a lifetime career.   When he went out and spoke to the people, he raised that issue of  term limits.   Now, I am not criticizing my colleagues who have been here longer  than 12 years, because my term limit legislation is 12 years. But times  have changed, and we have to change with the times to improve the  quality of life for people.   As I said, my legislation would limit any Senator or any House Member  to 12 years in office. Now, let me explain something on this concept.  First of all, we use the word ``Congress''; we use the word ``House  Member''; we use the word ``Senator.'' Most of my colleagues know this,  and most of the people know it, but Congress represents the House and  the Senate.   The Members of the Senate are Members of Congress. The Members of the  House are Members of Congress. For some reason, the Senate goes by  ``Senate,'' and we go by ``Congress'' or ``House Members.''   But I don't mean 12 years serving in the House and then 12 years in  the Senate or vice versa. I mean 12 years and you are out. That would  be six terms for Congressmen and two terms for a Senator, or vice  versa, however they wanted to do it.   I was once told by a reporter who asked a Member, and I won't mention  that Member's name in Congress, and you don't know if it is in the  House or in the Senate: What do you think of Marino's term limit  legislation of 12 years?   The reporter told me that the elected official responded by saying:  Well, we are only beginning to learn what is going on here and how it  works in 12 years.   So my term limit legislation would hinder Congress' ability to get  things done. How's that been going? I completely disagree.   Opponents say we will not have the experience. Wrong, and that is a  lame excuse.   They say that staff members will be making the decisions. Well, if  there is a Member in the House or the Senate who is letting their staff  members make the decisions, that elected official shouldn't be here.   Part of my background is that I worked in a factory until I was 30,  started sweeping floors and worked my way up. I started college 2 weeks  after my 30th birthday and then went on to law school. Having a  background in the private sector, I can tell you that if a person in  the private sector or who worked for someone in business were to argue  that I need 12 years to start being successful or doing my job  correctly, they would be fired in the first week.                                time  1815    The President is limited to two terms, 8 years. Many governors are  limited to two terms. State House and Senate elected officials in some  States are limited in their terms.   Why not Congress? It is not a lifetime career.   I am only advocating for term limits at the Federal level, not at the  State level. It is completely ridiculous for a lawmaker to state that  they are unable to serve their constituents unless they are here for  longer than 12 years. Knowing that one is limited to 12 years, or a  variation of that, then the elected official knows what they have to do  to get the job done, what they promised.   We need to change the culture here in Congress, and term limits is  the only way to accomplish this.   According to the most recent clear politics polling average, 18.4  percent of the American public approves of the job that Congress is  doing. What does that tell us?   This certainly seems like a good argument for why we need turnover in  Congress and new ideas consistently coming through the doors.   CEOs, chief executive officers, presidents of companies, chairmen and  women of corporations leave or are asked to leave their position after  8 to 10 years, on average. And why is that? That is because the company  wants fresh ideas. That is because that person who is in that position  feels that they have accomplished all that they can and they move on to  their next goal.   Serving in Congress was originally never viewed as a career or a  lifetime appointment. We need new ideas from new Members, women and  men, young and not so young.   There is a great deal of talent here in Congress and, with term  limits, newer Members will have the ability to chair committees,  instead of waiting for 15 or 20 years to be a chairman or a chairwoman.   We have, in the House, a person can serve 6 years on one committee as  the chair, and then move to another committee for 6 years. That is 12  years. I understand that that is the Republican side. I understand, and  someone correct me if I am wrong, on the other side of the aisle it is  lifetime in situations.   That doesn't give the talent, the new talent, the ability to move up  and have a say of how things are run. It gives the new talent ability  to get into leadership without having to be here 20 years.   The framers of the Constitution were not full-time legislators. They  were businessmen, they were entrepreneurs, they were farmers, they were  inventors, et cetera. They spent very little time actually in  Philadelphia and in New York. They went back home with their  constituents, and back home to their jobs.   See, there was a difference there between representing the people,  putting together a Constitution, and then going back to your job.   There was also never supposed to be a permanent class that would rule  over the citizens and without term limits that is what we have.   In 2016, 97 percent of all House Members who were seeking reelection  won their races. We also must change, in Congress, the rules. They are  outdated; they are old; they are inefficient, in both Chambers, in the  House and in the Senate. But to do this, we need term limits.   As I said, I have brought up term limits the last three elections. I  can't even get a hearing on it.   It is not healthy for our republic or for our constituents who  deserve better.   I ask my constituents every time I am out in my district, and when I  am speaking around the State, and in other States: Do you support my  term limit of 12 years? And overwhelmingly, overwhelmingly, it is a  resounding yes. I have had people say to me, I never used to support  term limits, but now I do.   I want to, again, thank Congressman Arrington and the other Members  that were here for holding this Special Order Hour to discuss this very  important issue. I would encourage all of my colleagues to join us in  supporting term limits to help drain the swamp and maintain a healthy  legislative branch, or at least get it to a debate. This is a game- changer, term limits, and will improve the quality of life for  Americans.
