 Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the en bloc amendment,  which includes my amendment to support Vermont's recovery from this  summer's catastrophic flooding.   Vermont farmers are hurting. With government funding running out on  Saturday, the Republicans' Agriculture appropriations bill is too  little too late. Vermont's recovery needs are urgent.   My amendment urges USDA to ensure disaster assistance is deployed as  quickly as possible.   It has been a rough year in Vermont. Vermont producers have sustained  millions and millions of dollars in damages, impacting nearly 30,000  acres of land.   Vermont's farmers are essentially the heart of our communities, the  fabric of our State, and I will do everything in my power to make sure  they have the resources they need to make sure that they are able to  recover and build back better from this horrible flooding.   A government shutdown would be devastating for Vermont and other  States like mine that are recovering from disasters this summer.  Vermonters need Federal recovery dollars to continue to flow so that  towns and households can get back on their feet. We must turn our  attention to serious matters.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of this amendment.
