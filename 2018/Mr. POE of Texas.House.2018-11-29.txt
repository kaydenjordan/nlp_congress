 Mr. Speaker, the First Amendment is first for a  reason. It is the most important right we have as Americans and at the  very core of who we are.   Without the First Amendment, freedom of religion, free speech,  freedom of the press, freedom in assembly, the rest of the Amendments  are meaningless.   The purpose of the First Amendment is to permit free and open  discussion about the important issues of the day. It protects the right  to speak freely about the two most controversial subjects of the day:  religion and politics. This is exactly what was forbidden under King  George, and it is exactly why our Founding Fathers chose to make it  first among the original 10 in the Bill of Rights.                                time  1015    But, somehow, the speech police have decided to replace free speech  with their self-determined fair speech. If it is not fair to them, then  it must be banned.   What does fair mean?   Fair means different things to different folks. In some places in our  country like Texas, fair is where you take the chickens or prized pig  to sell it or eat anything you want to on a stick when it is deep  fried.   Fair means different things to different folks. But the word ``fair''  is not in the Constitution. The Constitution protects free speech, not  fair speech. It says Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the  freedom of speech, and the Constitution applies to the elitist speech  control police whether they think that is fair or not and whether they  like it or not.   Our Founding Fathers established individual rights to protect our  liberties, not our feelings. We have become so caught up in the  politically correct restriction that everyone has the right not to be  offended that we are, in fact, losing the right of free speech.   Where does the Constitution say you have the right not to be  offended?  [[Page H9695]]    The right of free speech belongs to the speaker and cannot be  regulated by the listener because it may be offensive and certainly  cannot be regulated by government because it is not fair--fair in the  eyes of government.   But our most important freedom is being replaced by fear: the fear to  speak openly. Some wish to prohibit the voice and speech of others they  disagree with or if the opposing view may be offensive. So the  controlists want speech regulated or, to put it bluntly, it must be  politically correct.   It is interesting that the one place where diversity of thought,  ideas, and speech should be promoted is at our universities. But  universities are prohibiting free speech in the name of protecting the  students, while at the same time professors say anything they want to  say about all issues--the doctrine of free speech for me but not for  thee.   To make matters worse, the controlists want government to regulate  speech. That is a Stalinist concept. Stalin used government to silence  all opposing views, views that offended the government and the  elitists. It is not just those in the public eye. Everyone feels they  must weigh every thought and decision against who and how it could  possibly be offensive to someone, somewhere, somehow. It is ridiculous,  and it is a threat to our freedom and our prosperity.   We cannot live in fear of speech. We cannot live in fear to speak.   The Founding Fathers intended free speech to include criticism of the  government and to advocate unpopular ideas, including controversial  ideas. Freedom of speech allows individuals to express themselves  without interference of the government and truly debate all issues. But  we must not allow that to be lost to this out-of-control, politically  correct crowd that only wants to allow speech that agrees with their  agenda and, literally, destroys anyone who disagrees.   Law professor Alan Dershowitz said: ``Freedom of speech means freedom  for those who you despise, and freedom to express the most despicable  views. It also means that the government cannot pick and choose which  expressions to authorize and which to prevent.''   Voltaire, who lived at the time of our Revolution, said: ``I  disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right  to say it.''   Lively disagreements are the foundation of a free republic.   George Washington said it very well when he said: ``If freedom of  speech is taken away, then dumb and silent we may be led, like sheep to  the slaughter.''   America must always remain a free and open space where the  marketplace of ideas--even those we detest or disagree with--are freely  expressed. It seems our very founding document is at risk of fading  into the abyss of history.   The irony of it all is that free speech is becoming anything but  free, and that ought not to be. We should all speak out against the  controlling speech police.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand  a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground  that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum  is not present.    Mr. Speaker, as we remember the 100th anniversary  of the great World War I, it is vital to honor American pilots who  fought for freedom in Europe before the United States officially  entered the war.   Under the French Air Service, the Lafayette Escadrille was formed. It  was an all-American, all-volunteer squadron.   In 1916, 224 Americans formed the unit. They wore French uniforms,  and assembled on their biplanes was a courageous Native American chief.   Being a pilot in World War I was deadly dangerous. The life  expectancy of an Allied pilot was 11 days. Daily combat operations saw  casualty rates of 400 percent. Fifty-one Americans were killed in  combat, and the Americans downed 199 enemy planes. They flew in all the  major battles over the Western Front's bloody trenches of no man's  land.   In 1918, when the United States entered the war, these men of the  Lafayette Escadrille were incorporated into the United States Air  Service. These young flyboys of World War I were some of America's  best. They went over there and flew the skies fighting  [[Page H9702]]  for freedom, proudly proclaiming, ``Lafayette, we are here.''   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
