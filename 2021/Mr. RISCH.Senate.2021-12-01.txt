 Madam President, as a member and former chairman of  the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each month  I recognize and celebrate the American entrepreneurial spirit by  highlighting the success of a small business in my home State of Idaho.  Today, I am pleased to honor Trails West in Preston as the Idaho Small  Business of the Month for December 2021.   Trails West, renowned for its world-class craftsmanship and  innovative designs, is the No. 1 manufacturer of horse, living quarter,  and stock trailers in the United States. Founder Steve Reeder worked in  RV manufacturing before returning to his hometown of Weston to raise  his family. After several years of working on his family's farm, Steve  saw an opportunity to revitalize a struggling local manufacturer. Armed  with expertise in RV manufacturing and business acumen, Steve hired the  former business' laid-off employees and established Trails West in  1987.   Trails West manufactures with customer experience in mind. The  company was one of the first to recognize women as the largest  demographic of horse trailer owners, prompting them to incorporate  consumer-friendly innovations into their designs. In addition, Trails  West stands out in the industry by utilizing steel frames to deliver a  long-lasting and reliable product to their customers. Thanks to their  success and devotion to crafting the best trailers possible, Trails  West has grown to employ more than 160 Idahoans and is recognized as  the premier manufacturer of horse trailers in the country.   While the company has gained national fame and recognition, Trails  West has stayed true to its Idaho roots. Both the Reeder family and  Trails West have donated generously to local schools, supported the  construction of athletic facilities, and sponsored the purchase of  books and playground equipment. Through their entrepreneurship and  philanthropy, Trails West has become a testament to Idaho's thriving  small business culture and shines as one of the State's many local  gems.   Congratulations to the entire Trails West team on being selected as  the Idaho Small Business of the Month for December 2021. You make our  great State proud, and I look forward to your continued growth and  success.                            ____________________
