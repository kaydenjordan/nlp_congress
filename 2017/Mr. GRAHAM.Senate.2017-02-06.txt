 Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of  Senator Sessions to be Attorney General of the United States. Let me  make a few comments about the process. I would expect that the Attorney  General nominee know the President before they are chosen. This idea  that Senator Sessions was close to President Trump during the campaign  and that it is somehow a disqualifier makes absolutely zero sense to  me.   The bottom line is, that is exactly the kind of people you would  expect a President to pick--someone who has been on their team, someone  they know, someone they believe in to carry out the duties of the  office that they are nominated for.   I don't have the time to go through history, but I would assume that  in past nominations--particularly for Attorney General--there has been  some kind of relationship between the President who nominated him and  the person who is seeking the job. If that is going to be the new  standard, I suggest that nobody in this body ever endorse anybody for  President because apparently you can't serve in the Cabinet. That would  be kind of silly.   I look at this as are you qualified for the job? Our friends on the  other side look at it as if you don't agree with their liberal agenda,  you can't do the job. Big difference. There has been an absolute  wholesale attack on everything Trump when it comes to the nominations,  with a few exceptions.   The basis of the attack is that they don't share the world view of  our friends on the other side. That world view was litigated pretty  thoroughly and you lost. What do you expect Donald Trump to do after  his campaign? I expect him to do what he said he was going to do. Some  of it I agree with, some of it I don't. Where I don't agree with him, I  will challenge him.   The one challenge I will not make against this President is to deny  him the ability to pick somebody who is clearly, in my view, qualified,  even though I may have differences with him on particular issues.   I would say this about Senator Sessions. I have known him for 20  years almost. I have traveled throughout the world with Senator  Sessions and his family. Most of the time I agree with Jeff Sessions.  Sometimes I don't, but I found him to be an incredibly honorable man  worthy of the job of being U.S. Senator from the great State of  Alabama, reflecting the values of the people of Alabama. That is what  he got elected to do, by the way.   I think he will be uniquely qualified to be the Attorney General of  the United States at a time of great challenge. He has been a U.S.  attorney. He has been Attorney General of his State. He is a man  steeped in the law. His biggest crime, I think, is that he is very  conservative. That, to me, is not a disqualifier any more than being  very liberal is a disqualifier.   How do you think we felt when Barack Obama basically turned ObamaCare  upside down with one Executive order after another every time it  started stinking up in public? He would unilaterally change the law to  avoid a political consequence or granting millions of people legal  status with a stroke of a pen, well beyond his lane, struck down by the  Court as being outside his ability as President to do.   Not once did anybody on that side raise an objection. Eric Holder is  a fine man. I can't remember a time when Eric Holder stood up to this  runaway train in the Obama administration. Loretta Lynch is a fine  woman. I can't remember one time she expressed doubt about President  Obama's agenda. When it was left up to the courts to express  [[Page S831]]  doubt in this election, believe it or not, that had a lot to do with  the way the last 8 years rolled out.   This was a check-and-balance election, and you are not going to be  able to undo the consequences of this election unfairly. I think it  would be unfair to say that Senator Jeff Sessions is not qualified for  the job at hand.   Most of the attacks against Senator Sessions could be levied against  almost everybody on this side of the aisle. The NAACP, according to  Jeff Sessions, is one of the premier civil rights organizations in the  history of the country. I think that is a fair characterization. Mr.  Cornell Brooks, CEO of the NAACP, said of Senator Sessions: Senator  Sessions' record throughout his career, whether in the Office of the  U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama, as attorney general  of the State of Alabama or, most recently, as the junior U.S. Senator  from Alabama evinces a clear disregard, disrespect, and even disdain  for the civil and human rights of racial and ethnic minorities, women,  the disabled, and others who suffer from discrimination in this  country--a damning indictment.   Apparently, he doesn't stay in contact with the NAACP chapter in  Alabama. In 2009, the NAACP gave Jeff Sessions--Civic and Human Rights  Convention, April 23 to 26, 2009, NAACP Governmental Award of  Excellence, Senator Jeff Sessions: For the outstanding work you do.   That is one of the awards he forgot to tell us about, so I hope he  will amend. Another attack on Senator Sessions, he received an award  from a David Horowitz group that was labeled by the Senator from  Connecticut as being some rightwing extremist organization. All I can  say is that the Annie Taylor Award is named for a lady who went over  Niagara Falls in a barrel. They give it to conservatives who stood up  under difficult circumstances. I actually received the award as an  impeachment manager. Chris Matthews was there to moderate the dinner.  So I don't know what Mr. Horowitz said after I was there, before he was  there; all I can say is that I received the award, too, and I sure as  hell don't consider myself a bigot.    Voting against the Violence Against Women Act authored by Senator  Leahy--I won't give you a long rendition. I voted against it, too, for  reasons I will be glad to explain to you at a later time.   The bottom line here is that most of the things said about Jeff  Sessions and the way he acted as a Senator could be said about almost  all of us on this side who consider ourselves conservative.   Back to our friends at the NAACP, I asked Mr. Brooks, ``Do you have a  legislative scorecard how you rate people in the Body?'' He said,  ``Yes. And Senator Sessions has been historically low rated.''   Here is what I want the body to know: that in the report card of the  113th Congress, the first half, here are the ratings. Senator  Grassley--all Republicans here, 11 percent; Hatch, 25 percent; Graham,  25 percent; Cornyn, 11 percent; Lee, 11 percent; Cruz, 11 percent;  Sasse, he wasn't in Congress; Blake, 29 percent; Crapo, 14 percent;  Tillis and Kennedy were not rated yet. On the Democratic side of the  Judiciary Committee, Feinstein, 100 percent; Leahy, 100 percent;  Whitehouse, 100 percent; Klobuchar, 100 percent; Franken, 100 percent;  Coons, 96 percent; Blumenthal, 100 percent; Hirono, 100 percent. Not  only did Jeff Sessions have a poor rating, all of us did.   So to my friends on the other side, you are making arguments that I  don't think are good for the future of this body and the country as a  whole. You are basically saying: You did not vote for the legislation I  supported. You voted against ideas I embrace that I think make America  a unique place; therefore, you cannot have this job.   Here is what I would say: Senator Sessions voted as a very  conservative Senator from the State of Alabama who has conducted  himself honorably his entire life. And I really regret that we have  gotten to this point. All of us in here know Jeff, and I have been on  this floor fighting with him tooth and nail about immigration reform. I  worked with Senator Durbin, who is going to speak next, and our chief  antagonist most of the time was Senator Sessions. Never in my darkest  day will I ever believe Jeff Sessions said one word on this floor that  he did not truly believe. And he reflects the views of millions of  Americans.   As to the status of the LGBT community, I think Jeff Sessions was  representing the values of his State. And all I can say is, that is  what we are sent up here to do. If we disagree, we disagree, but it is  a big leap from the policy disagreement to not qualified.   I asked the NAACP chairman: Name one Republican you would recommend  to be Attorney General.   I have yet to get a name.   So what we are talking about here, unfortunately, is an attack on  conservatism more than it is Jeff Sessions because almost everything  said about Jeff could be said about me and most of my colleagues over  here. Why did I vote for Holder? Why did I vote for Lynch? Why did I  vote for Sotomayor and Hagel? And the list goes on and on and on.   I expect that when a liberal President wins, they will pick people  who are qualified, who share their view to represent their  administration. When it comes to the Attorney General, you can be  liberal and you can be conservative, but you also still can be fair to  the public as a whole.   I don't believe for 1 second that Jeff Sessions, as Attorney General  of the United States, will take any of his political positions and jam  them down your throat if the law says no. I have never seen that about  the man.   The minority leader of the Alabama Senate, Senator Ross, an African- American Democratic minority leader, said:         I have worked with Jeff Sessions. I know him personally,       and all of my encounters with him have been for the greater       good of Alabama. We have spoken about everything, from civil       rights to race relations. We agree that as Christian men, our       hearts and minds focus on doing right by all people.    That is the Jeff Sessions I know. That is why I am lending my support  to his nomination.   I have some serious differences with President Trump, and those  differences will materialize over time. And I hope I have the courage  of my convictions to stand up for what I believe even when my party has  the White House. That is a very hard thing to do for all of us. I  intend to do it to the best of my ability, and I will get a lot of  coverage for doing that because that makes for good political  reporting. But what will not be covered is the fact that on the really  big issues, mostly, I agree with President Trump and Jeff Sessions  about what we need to do to change the dynamic regarding crime. I will  work with Senator Durbin to bring about sentencing reform, but it is  now time to go in on the offense against crime.   One of the things that pleases me most about this nomination of  Senator Sessions is that we have been very strong allies in fighting  the War on Terror. Jeff Sessions understands the difference between  fighting a crime and fighting a war. It will be welcome news for me to  have an Attorney General who understands that Bin Laden's son-in-law  who is captured on the battlefield should be treated differently than  somebody who tried to steal your car. Under Jeff Sessions, the Justice  Department will look at enemy combatants for who they are--warriors in  a cause to destroy our lives--and they will be held consistent with the  law of war, not domestic criminal law. And the days of terrorists being  read the Miranda rights as if they were common criminals will soon be  over. That will make us all safer.   I look forward to voting for Senator Sessions and working with him.  And if we have disagreements, the one thing I know for sure is that  Jeff will at least listen to me.   This body is adrift. The country is really divided. I hope that once  this confirmation process is over, we can get back to doing the  business of the American people.   To the extent that Donald Trump becomes the problem, we will push  back. Right now, people are pushing back against everything all the  time, and you are going to hurt yourself, as well as this body, because  there is no way you can ever convince me that Jeff Sessions is not  qualified to be the Attorney General. I can understand why you wouldn't  pick him, but there is no doubt in my mind that he is somebody a  Republican conservative President would pick, and they did.   I yield the floor   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). The Senator from Arizona.  [[Page S832]]        Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois for his  courtesy. I think this will take about 7 or 8 minutes, I would say to  my colleague from Illinois.   I ask unanimous consent to address the Senate as in morning business.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
