The Democratic leader.                              Amendment No. 1958         (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute.)     Mr. President, some of what I just heard, I can readily  agree to. Certain things, such as that we are a nation of immigrants-- no doubt about that. We need immigrants. We take roughly 800,000 to 1  million legal immigrants a year. They are welcomed. We also, though,  are a nation of laws, and as a nation of laws, we want people to come  here according to our laws and abide by the laws.   We are working with a group of people. If you call them DACAs, it  would be about 800,000. If you refer to them as Dreamers, it is maybe  1.8 million. We obviously have sympathy for them because as a baby  brought here in diapers by a person or family who crossed our border  without papers, hence entering our country illegally--we don't  attribute the sin and the unlawfulness of the parent to the baby. A lot  of that has happened.   There is a general agreement--maybe not everybody in my political  party agrees with this, but I think 80 percent of them do--that we need  to deal with people who are here through no fault of their own and give  them legal status. That is the compassion we are showing for people who  broke our laws by their parents doing it but not the kids doing it.   I also didn't ever think we would be here today debating this because  I went through the 2013 debate on immigration. The Senate passed a  bill; the House of Representatives didn't take it up. I was in the  minority at that time, both in the caucus that was in the minority as  well as in the minority that voted against that bill, because I didn't  think it did things the way I would do them. Everything died in the  House of Representatives. Then, 2 years later, I became chairman of the  Judiciary Committee. We have jurisdiction over immigration legislation.  I could have spent 3 months on immigration during 2015 or 2016 and sent  a bill to the House of Representatives that probably would have died,  but I made up my mind early in my chairmanship that I wanted to do  things that we could get passed. So over the period of the last  Congress, my committee voted out 31 bills, all bipartisan, and 18 of  them got to a Democratic President. In 2015 and 2016, I felt, why go  through that process if it is going to die in the House of  Representatives?    Now, a year later, after the election of a President who campaigned  so much against anything dealing with immigration and legalization of  people who are here--even young people, whom he has now come to the  conclusion we ought to legalize--I didn't think we would be having this  debate, and somehow I think Members of the Democratic Party didn't  think we would be having this debate. I think they probably were  shocked 2 or 3 weeks ago when the government shut down and when the  majority leader decided to make an agreement to bring up this issue.  But here we are, debating an immigration bill that, quite frankly, I  didn't think we would be debating. Here we are.   Then, of course, we didn't do anything Monday. We didn't do anything  on this issue Tuesday. I don't know whether we are going to have any  votes today, but here we are debating immigration. We have a chance to  do what Members of the other political party, as advocates for Dreamers  and DACA kids--and we have them on this side but maybe not as vocal or  as loyal as Democrats are on this issue. Somehow, we are now having a  difficult time getting the issue up and getting something passed.   I offer to my 99 colleagues something the President said he would  sign. Maybe you don't like exactly what is in that proposal. Then get  it up and amend it, and let's see what sort of compromise we can  accomplish. But we are here because the leader said that we are going  to work on this issue. It was something that the minority demanded. We  ought to reach a conclusion on it and get something to the President of  the United States.   Once we knew that this issue was going to come up--and we knew that  on September 5 when the President said that he was not going to  continue the illegal approach to the DACA kids that President Obama  did. We have reason to believe this from court decisions on older  people where they ruled that the President didn't have the authority to  do what he did with the DACA kids. In fact, at least a dozen times  before he made that decision, he was telling the entire country he  didn't have the authority to do it, and then he went ahead and did it.   So this President comes in, takes an oath to uphold the Constitution  and the laws of this country, and he decides that he can't continue  what was considered illegal activity by the previous President. This is  a congressional decision that needs to be made, and Congress ought to  make it. We were told on September 5 to do something by March 5, and  here we are.   I heard from the previous speaker--and maybe a lot of speakers--that  this is the President's plan. Yes, this is something that the President  said that he is going to support and will sign, but I want to say to  you that the work that a group of us Senators have put into this issue  over a period of the last 3 months, with about 18 meetings, 4 meetings  with the President of the United States to discuss the issue--most of  what is in the proposal that is put before you are things that a group  of Senators put together. I would say that as our group met, we  probably had subgroups of three who had different views, and some of  them felt strongly about their positions, but everyone came together in  a compromise that you see here before us in my amendment.   In some of those meetings, we discussed these things with the  President, and I want to give the President credit. In a January 9  meeting that he had where he called together 23 of us--bipartisan and  bicameral--we were able to dial down all the things that we would be  discussing on immigration, and we came to the conclusion that there  were four main points that we ought to be dealing with. You have heard  of these as the four pillars, but let me repeat them.   No. 1 was legalization of these children who were brought here by  their parents; No. 2 was border security; No. 3 was chain migration;  and No. 4, diversity visa. We discussed these things with the  President, and I suppose the President probably emphasized citizenship  to a greater extent than maybe we did in our deliberations, but we have  something that has been put together by Members of this body who have  compromised, with none of us getting everything we wanted. We are  fortunate enough to have the President's backing on this.   So I hope that you see this, not as we have heard from the other side  as the President's plan--as if seven of us who introduced this proposal  somehow just took something from the White House and put our names on  it, and it is here before the U.S. Senate--because that isn't how it  worked.    I want to address some of the issues that have been put before us by  people on the other side. I want to express--as you probably have seen  me expressing already in my remarks so far--my frustration with the  current status of the immigration debate here in the U.S. Senate. It  amazes me that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle simply  aren't ready to have a serious immigration debate. They have been  demanding to have this debate for months. They have even shut the  government down to get to this point, and now we are actually on this  issue that they have been demanding that we debate for months during  this Congress--some on the other side of the aisle for  [[Page S951]]  years--and now when it is time to put up or shut up, they have come up  emptyhanded. Despite having weeks to prepare, Senate Democrats are  still rushing to put some plan together.   Let that sink in. Think about this just for a moment. The Senate  Democrats recklessly shut down the Federal Government over immigration,  and they did it over plans that they still largely haven't drafted.  That should be very frustrating, not only to this Senator but to most  of my colleagues, and it is exactly why the American people seem to  have less faith in this process in Washington, DC. Even more  frustrating is that for 2 valuable days, they have refused to allow the  Senate to debate immigration measures.   I do understand why the Democrats are afraid to vote on ending  sanctuary cities. Those policies of sanctuary cities are massively  unpopular with the American people. In other words, the American people  feel that when the Constitution says that immigration law is one of the  18 powers of the United States, then no local or State government  should be able to interfere with what the Constitution says is the  supreme law of the land.   I can't understand why, for 2 days, Democrats have refused to allow  us a debate on an issue like sanctuary cities. That amendment would  help us keep our communities safe from dangerous criminals, besides  carrying out the intent of the Constitution that the Federal Government  has complete authority over immigration.   Who could be against an approach to send a signal that sanctuary  cities aren't justified when that is how to protect the American people  from the criminal elements that some sanctuary cities protect?  Apparently, the Democrats are, since they don't seem to be for  outlawing sanctuary cities.   I guess another way to say it is that they could do more to protect  hard-working Americans from the criminal element that is, albeit, a  small part of the immigration community we are talking about, but it  still creates havoc for people like the Steinle family, for example,  where Kate was murdered by an alien who was a felon who had returned to  this country not once but five times.   In other words, I have to ask my colleagues whether enforcement  issues are legitimately a part of the immigration debate, and that is  what the sanctuary city situation is all about. Isn't border security  more than just throwing money at infrastructure? Shouldn't we be  discussing how to reform our Nation's laws so that dangerous criminal  elements can't inflict harm on innocent families?   I am pretty sure--I am actually 100 percent confident--the answer to  those questions is yes. Those are important issues to the American  people. Those issues used to be discussed here.   I have already mentioned the name of Kate Steinle, who was murdered  by one of these people. I could add the names of Sarah Root and Jamel  Shaw. These people all had dreams, too, but they had their lives ended  by felons who had been deported but had come back into this country.   If my colleagues were actually serious about debating this issue, we  would be discussing border enforcement. Sadly, it seems as though the  plans that I have seen so far from my colleagues fall short of that  goal.   Legalizing Dreamers--yes, who is going to argue with that? A little  bit of money for border security--there is a lot to argue about there.  But not doing something about criminal aliens who are a threat to law  enforcement in this country and to the safety of our country--it seems  to me that ought to be a part of it.   So we get all the people in this room who say they want to do  something about border security by throwing money at it; yet they  refuse to actually give our law enforcement the legal tools that they  need to protect Americans. Just a wall or whatever you want to call  it--electric surveillance, more border patrol--it is all border  security, but it is more than a wall. It takes more than just those  things to protect the American people.   I am here to tell you that it is a tragedy that some people in this  body just want to legalize some people for 1 year, 2 years, or 3 years  and put maybe a little bit of money into border security with no  commitment to the future. Then all we have done is kick the can down  the road.   Worse still, none of my colleagues' proposals are being developed in  a way that they can actually become law. Maybe for them, simply passing  a partisan bill is enough. Leader Schumer said that this morning, and I  was here listening to him. But that is not enough for this Senator.  This Senator actually wants to see something passed into law that will  provide real protection for DACA kids.    That is why I have offered an amendment that could actually pass the  House of Representatives, and we know the President would sign it.  Polls show that the framework a number of us developed, along with the  President's input, is overwhelmingly popular. A Harvard Harris poll  showed that 65 percent of the voters agreed with our plan, including 64  percent of Democratic voters. So despite the hyperbole we hear from our  colleagues, the plan that the President said he would sign is not only  popular, but, again, it is the only plan that has any chance of  becoming law.   It is time for all of my colleagues to get serious about fixing DACA.  It is time to stop posturing, to stop showboating, and to stop simply  trying to pass a bill out of the Senate that will not get considered in  the other body and will not be signed by the President of the United  States.   The focus ought to be on making actual law. If all of us here in the  Senate, particularly those who are in the Democratic Caucus, focus on  those things, then the choice for them will be very clear. They will  vote for the amendment that the seven of us have put before the Senate  called the Grassley amendment, they will back the President, and they  will provide real security and real certainty to the DACA recipients  and the American people.   In fact, it is so simple for some on the other side who have been  promising DACA certainty for years and some for a few months, but, more  importantly, really strongly over the last three or four months. It is  an opportunity for everything you have told those kids, including that  you are going to get them legal and even give them a path to  citizenship that you can deliver.   I yield the floor.
