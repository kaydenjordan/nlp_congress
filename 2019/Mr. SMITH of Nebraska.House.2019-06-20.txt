 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Frank  LaMere, who died last Sunday night.   A member of the Winnebago Tribe, Frank was proud of his heritage and  worked tirelessly for the Native American community. Frank spent the  majority of his life fighting for Native American causes and, as a  result, was known across Nebraska and other States for his determined  efforts.   I had the opportunity of interacting with Frank for several years and  was always impressed by the civility he showed, his respect for others,  and, most of all, how considerate and thoughtful he was.   Frank had an interest in politics and policy and sought to build  relationships with folks on both sides of the aisle. He was devoted to  making life better for others and was a role model in his civic  engagement.   Frank will be dearly missed, but the people of South Sioux City,  Nebraska, and the entire State will remember him for his loyalty, his  passion, and his ability to build friendships along the way.   Madam Speaker, I offer my condolences to his family and community.                            ____________________
