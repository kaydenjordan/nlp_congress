 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong  support of H.R. 4 for the people, the Voting Rights Advancement Act. I  thank my colleagues, Representatives Sewell, Fudge, Nadler, and many  others, for their extraordinary work on this critical legislation that  protects the most basic and fundamental of American rights, the right  to vote.   Ever since the 2013 Supreme Court Shelby decision threw out the  preclearance requirement, undermining the Voting Rights Act, States and  localities with histories of racial injustice have again started  discriminatory voting practices, like requiring IDs, which is  particularly harmful to  [[Page H9324]]  Hispanic voters; moving voting places so it is more difficult to vote;  and many other steps that disenfranchise countless Americans,  particularly men and women of color.   This bill restores the Voting Rights Act in its entirety, repeals the  Shelby decision, and gives the Federal Government the tools to hold  local election officials accountable for discriminatory practices that  deny Americans of this fundamental right.   So many brave Americans have made the ultimate sacrifice to protect  this right for our people. By passing this legislation, we honor their  sacrifice by protecting the right to vote for every single citizen.
