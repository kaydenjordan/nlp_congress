 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Massachusetts for  yielding to me, and I want to strongly identify with his remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I led the Foreign Affairs Committee Democrats last week  urging President Trump to cancel his meeting with Vladimir Putin  because I knew this was going to turn out badly, but, frankly, I didn't  know how bad it would be. It turns out President Trump embarrassed  himself and disgraced our Nation.   Standing on foreign soil, the President of the United States  questioned America's intelligence community; he attacked America's law  enforcement with bizarre conspiracy theories; he lobbed petty political  insults; and he did it all while standing next to America's chief  rival, Vladimir Putin.   When faced head-on with the question, ``Who do you believe?''  President Trump sided with Putin and affirmed Putin's brazen lies. This  is the tyrant who directed attacks on America's democracy in an effort  to elect Donald Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton. And, as Director of  National Intelligence Dan Coats said, these attacks are still ongoing.   As we all know, Putin is a ruthless leader who seeks to tear down our  alliances, undermine Western unity, and destroy democracy. With the  eyes of the world on them, it is plain that the President of the United  States is now Putin's willing accomplice, Putin's poodle. It is  outrageous; it is disgusting; it is dangerous; and it has been met with  near universal condemnation.   Here is what Speaker Ryan said just yesterday, and I agree with the  Speaker:         There is no question that Russia interfered in our election       and continues attempts to undermine democracy here and around       the world. The President needs to understand that Russia is       not our ally. There is no moral equivalency between the       United States and Russia, which remains hostile to our most       basic values and ideals, and that Russia must be held       accountable.    That is what our Republican Speaker said, and I agree with him.   I have introduced this resolution so that the entire House can go on  record agreeing with the Speaker, affirming that we stand with the  Speaker. I deeply regret that a member of the Speaker's own party just  blocked the House from speaking with one voice and taking up this  resolution by unanimous consent.   We must reject the President's capitulation to Putin; we must stand  up for American leadership on the global stage; and we must demand that  this administration treat Russia like the enemy it is.   How can you treat Putin better than U.S. intelligence? It just  boggles my mind.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent for the immediate consideration  of the resolution I have just introduced, which is H. Res. 999.    Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to defeat the previous  question.
