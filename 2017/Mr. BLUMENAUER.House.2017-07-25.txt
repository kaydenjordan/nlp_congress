 Mr. Speaker, we begin an unusual week here on Capitol  Hill, although unusual is sort of the new usual in Washington, D.C.   The Senate begins deliberations on an 8-year Republican mission to  repeal the Affordable Care Act, and they don't fully know what it is  exactly they are voting on.   There is uncertainty in the House over both the budget and  appropriations, but, you know, there is an opportunity for Congress to  take a step back, to do something that will make a huge difference for  everybody from coast to coast, something that can bring together a wide  coalition of support and meet unmet needs.                                time  1015    I am talking about addressing the unmet infrastructure needs for a  country that is falling apart as we fall behind.   We haven't raised the gas tax in 24 years. And in the course of that  24 years, we have watched the value of the Federal gas tax actually  erode 40 percent, due to inflation and increased fuel efficiency, while  our needs continue to go up each and every year.   Congress has put together a series of stopgap measures--gimmicks here  and there--which have not adequately met those needs, and they have  actually increased the budget deficit.   I think back to Ronald Reagan making his Thanksgiving Day speech in  November of 1982, when he called on Congress to come back from their  recess and more than double the gas tax because, he pointed out, it  would put people to work and improve road conditions that were actually  damaging people's cars more than what modest increase they would pay.  Well, Congress did it, and we were better off as a result. I think each  of us would do well to look back at that speech that Ronald Reagan  gave, calling on Congress to step up and do its part.   The States are not sitting back. Since over the last 5 years, more  than half of the individual States have gone ahead and raised their  transportation funding. So far in 2017 alone, California, Indiana,  Montana, Oregon, Tennessee, West Virginia, and South Carolina raised  the gas tax. In fact, South Carolina raised the gas tax by overriding a  Republican Governor's veto.   There are opportunities here for us to be able to step forward and  build on this vast coalition. It really isn't a profile in courage to  support legislation that is endorsed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,  the AFL-CIO, contractors, a variety of labor unions, road builders,  engineers, trucking companies, and AAA. The widest coalition of people  supporting any major issue before us deals with increasing the fuel  tax.   And it is interesting, for those who are worried that maybe there is  some political downturn, despite the fact that the States have been  able to summon the courage. The American Road and Transportation  Builders Association did an extensive survey about who were those  intrepid legislators that voted to raise the gas tax since 2012. What  they found is that those legislators who had the courage and the vision  to do what was right for their States were reelected by an over 90  percent rate.   But this shouldn't be about elections. It should be about what is  right for the American people. Stepping up, meeting our obligations, so  that the Federal Government is a full partner, working with State and  local governments, working with the private sector, to be able to meet  the over $1.1 trillion of critical transportation needs between now and  2025 ought to be the order of business.   I would hope that my friends in Republican leadership would allow us  to have just 1 week of hearings on this issue so that we can hear from  the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the president of the  AFL-CIO, the truckers, AAA, Republican legislators of principle, people  across the country who talk about the need to rebuild and renew  America, make our communities more livable, our families safer,  healthier, and more economically secure.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, today I voted for H.R. 3364, the  Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (Roll no. 413).  This legislation is an important step forward in punishing Russia for  its annexation of Crimea in 2014 and for the country's alleged  interference in the 2016 United States presidential election.   The bill also updates and expands sanctions on North Korea at a time  when the country continues to pursue dangerous weapons programs.   Further, I commend leadership and committee members in the House and  Senate for ensuring that the Iran sanctions portion of this legislation  does not violate the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) reached  between Iran, the United States, and five major world powers, including  Russia and China. While the Iranian ballistic missile program is deeply  concerning and must be addressed, undermining the nuclear agreement,  which has forced Iran to remove thousands of centrifuges from service  and halt all uranium enrichment, would be a mistake of tragic  proportions.   The bipartisan support for the bill should be a signal to the  administration to refrain from taking action that would encourage Iran  to change course.   To be sure, Iran has some unsavory hardline people in key positions  of leadership, but these hardliners just suffered a major defeat in the  Iranian elections. President Hassan Rouhani has been a voice of and a  force for moderation--and people voted for him.   We must proceed with the utmost caution and develop a thoughtful  approach to ensure we continue to keep Iran away from the nuclear  threshold, while also countering the regime's nefarious activities.
