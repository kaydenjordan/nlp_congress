 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 50th  anniversary of the city of Sterling Heights, MI. Sterling Heights is a  community built on industry and entrepreneurship, and this celebration  is a historic benchmark for the community.   While it was the Clinton River that initially brought settlers to the  area, it was a boom in manufacturing during the 1950s that brought a  large amount of growth to what is now the city of Sterling Heights.  Manufacturers like Ford Motor Company and Chrysler Corporation, along  with their plant workers, began moving north and settled in what was  then known as Sterling Township and their new state-of-the-art  subdivisions.   This sudden surge of new residents did not come without problems  though. There was flooding due to lack of sufficient drainage systems  and residents threatening to declare their neighborhoods their own  separate community. In 1960, a portion of Sterling Township, Clinton  Township, and Harrison Township all came together with a proposal to  incorporate the three communities into the city of Moravian Hills. The  proposal would be soundly defeated.   In 1966, a charter commission was formed to draft a city charter to  present to voters in 2 years. The commission faced many issues and  tasks early on, one of which was what to name their newly proposed  city. Due to the already existing village of Sterling in northern  Michigan, the commission would eventually settle on Sterling Heights.  In December of 1967, the proposed charter of a strong mayor government  was voted down. The people of Sterling Township made their voices heard  and installed a new commission chair, one who shared their vision of a  city management form of government.   On May 25, 1968, voters overwhelmingly passed a new city management  charter and simultaneously elected seven new councilmennbers, defeating  all previous township officials. The city's first council consisted of  an elementary school teacher, four employed in the automotive industry,  an education representative for school supplies, and an attorney. They  faced incredibly challenging tasks and high expectations in their first  days. Whether it was zoning restrictions, infrastructure, new projects,  or public safety, the council came together and worked toward a common  goal: a stronger future for their new city and her citizens. The  council would hire Leonard Hendricks as city manager and Paul O'Reilly  as city attorney, and together, they would help the council create a  city that has continued to grow and prosper to this day.   Upon that vote of approval in 1968, Sterling Heights became the  second largest city in size in Michigan. Since then, it has only  continued to grow and develop. Today, it is a prospering community  covering over 36 square miles and has a population of over 130,000  residents. The automotive and manufacturing industries have been and  continue to be the cornerstone of Sterling Heights' local economy. The  city is home to four OEM vehicle production plants, and the top  employers are all automotive and manufacturing companies.   The city of Sterling Heights has become an important and prosperous  city in its relatively short time since being incorporated. The first  mayor pro tem of Sterling Heights, F. James Dunlop, said it best, ``Her  only heights will be how high we set our goals and how much, we, her  citizens, are willing to give of ourselves to achieve them.''   I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the citizens,  elected officials, and businesses of the city of Sterling Heights as  they celebrate this milestone. I wish the city continued growth and  prosperity in the years ahead.                            ____________________
