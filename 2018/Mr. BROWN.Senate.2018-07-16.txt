 Mr. President, it has been a good year to be a Wall Street  banker. Barely a day goes by that doesn't bring news of another  consumer protection rollback, another unraveling of taxpayer  protections, or another handout to Wall Street. The man at the center  of many of these decisions is right now, on this floor, up for  nomination to a 14-year term as Governor on the Board of the Federal  Reserve.   When Randy Quarles' nomination to serve as Vice Chair of Supervision  at the Fed--the first person ever to serve in that position--when it  came before the Senate last year, I urged my colleagues to vote no.  Quarles' record worried many of us that he wasn't interested in doing  actual supervision. I said he seemed far too ready to swallow financial  industry talking points, once again, and relax the rules for Wall  Street.   Since then, his record at the Federal Reserve his confirmed the worst  fears so many of us held. In just 10 months under Mr. Quarles'  leadership, the Fed has taken steps to systematically unravel Wall  Street reform.   Let's look at what happened. Start with the stress test. The Fed  allowed the seven largest banks to redirect $96 billion that should  have been used to pay workers, to reduce fees for consumers, and to  protect taxpayers from bailouts. Instead, they plowed that money into  share buybacks and dividends that do what? Of course, they reward  wealthy executives and the biggest investors. Two banks, Goldman Sachs  and Morgan Stanley, had capital below the required amounts. Those banks  failed the test, but they got passing grades anyway because they are  Wall Street. The Fed reportedly called them up and let them haggle over  the test results. Imagine this happening in school--when you were at  school growing up in Oklahoma or I in Ohio--to allow them to proceed  after haggling over the test results. They allowed them to proceed with  buybacks and dividends that would drain the required capital.   Under Quarles' leadership, the Fed wants to make funneling money back  into stock buybacks even easier. The Fed's pending proposal on Big Bank  capital will allow the eight largest banks in this country--banks each  worth hundreds of billions of dollars--to redirect up to $121 billion  into share buybacks and dividends. This is money that could be used to  protect taxpayers from bailouts.   Remember, share buybacks and dividends juice stock prices. They do  little to increase long-term growth or to reward the workers who make a  company's success possible. Going forward, the Fed also wants to make  stress tests even easier. Apparently, haggling with the megabanks over  the scores wasn't lenient enough.   Quarles has proposed letting bankers comment on the tests before they  are administered. That is like letting the students write the exams,  and the Fed is considering dropping the qualitative portion of the  stress test altogether. That is the part of the test that examines  banks' risk management processes, data systems, and the fitness of its  board of directors.   I understand these board of directors are all paid--I believe in  every single case of the eight largest banks--at least $200,000 a year.  The Fed plans changes for the Volcker rule, the rule that stops big  banks from taking big risks with Americans' money. That rule requires  the banks make investments in the real economy, not casino-style trades  using families' checking and savings accounts.   Lest you think only American banks are getting a handout, soon  foreign banks will be getting in on the action. This spring, Mr.  Quarles said the Fed wants to loosen the rules on foreign megabanks. We  are talking about Deutsche Bank, Santander, UBS, Credit Suisse, and  Barclays. You have read about those banks. In most cases, those banks  have broken our laws. These foreign banks have broken our laws time and  again. Yet we are going to loosen the rules on these foreign megabanks.   The question I have with all these weakening of protections for  American taxpayers and American consumers is, What problem exactly is  the Fed, under Mr. Quarles' watch, trying to solve? Banks increased  their profits by 13 percent last year. That is before you account for  the windfall in the tax cut. When you add in the tax benefits, it was a  28-percent increase in their profits. The banking sector bought back  $77 billion worth of stock last year. The CEOs of the six largest banks  got an average raise of 22 percent. So what exactly is Mr. Quarles  trying to fix? What is not going all the banks' way day after day? The  CEO of Wells Fargo got a 36-percent raise, even as scandal after  scandal mounted at the bank under his watch.   I don't think these megabanks are really the people who need Mr.  Quarles' help. Maybe you ought to look elsewhere. Maybe look at the  tellers. The average teller in this country makes $12.50 an hour. Wages  for ordinary Americans simply aren't moving up.  [[Page S4971]]    Mr. Quarles was in a very similar position a decade ago in the Bush  administration. The financial sector was booming, but average Americans  were sitting around their kitchen tables, feeling less and less secure,  wondering what they were going to do next.   During this time when Mr. Quarles served in the Bush administration,  the Treasury Department's foreclosure filings in Ohio doubled--from  around 40,000 at the beginning of 2002 to 80,000 by the end of 2006.  Mr. Quarles just brushed off concerns about the growing troubles in the  mortgage market. Famously, he said in those days, in 2006, that the  future looked bright. His actions today suggest he ain't learned a lot  since. His amnesia and the collective amnesia of this body are just a  little too familiar in this town. We can't afford any more nominees who  fail American workers, who fail American homeowners, or who fail  American taxpayers.   It always comes back to, whose side are you on? Are you going to  fight for the little guy, whether she punches a time clock or whether  he works in a diner, or are you going to fight for the 1 percent? Are  we here to serve American workers in the middle class, or are we here  to serve Wall Street? Randal Quarles has made it clear whose side he is  on. I urge my colleagues to reject his nomination.                            ____________________     Mr. President, first, I want to say how much I appreciate  Senator Sasse's words. I hope that other people in his political party  will have the courage he has to stand up and speak out on some of these  things.   This week, the President of the United States went overseas. Instead  of standing up to America's enemies, the President of the United States  went out of his way to attack the American free press.   As Senator McCain described today's press conference with Russian  President Putin: ``The President made a conscious choice to defend a  tyrant against the fair questions of a free press and to grant Putin an  uncontested platform to spew propaganda and lies to the world.''   Let me repeat that. Senator McCain--once a Republican nominee for  President of the United States and one of the most respected Senators  of our lifetimes--said: ``The President made a conscious choice to  defend a tyrant against the fair questions of a free press and to grant  Putin an uncontested platform to spew propaganda and lies to the  world.''   We are talking about a man--President Putin--who presides over a  regime in which journalists are killed. According to a 2016 PolitiFact  article, Russia ranks 180 out of 199 countries for press freedom,  behind, not ahead of, Iraq, Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the  Congo, and others. This is according to the international watchdog  Freedom House. After all, Putin was a KGB agent.   Yet the President didn't just defend a dictator against the press; he  openly attacked the American free press. While heading to meet with the  leader of a country that tramples on the rights of journalists, our  President, President Trump, said: ``Much of our news media is, indeed,  the enemy of the people.'' That is Soviet talk. That is Putin kind of  talk. That is KGB talk. That has never been the talk of an American  President. ``Much of our news media is, indeed, the enemy of the  people.''   Everybody in this body knows a lot of reporters. Nobody in this body  believes that the media are enemies of the people. Unfortunately,  almost nobody on this side of the aisle will stand up to the President  and say: No, Mr. President. No, FOX News. The media are not enemies of  the people; they are doing work that is essential to our democracy.   A journalist's entire job is to ask tough questions to challenge  powerful interests. In church, we comfort the afflicted. Journalists  afflict the comfortable. We know that reporters put their safety and  sometimes their lives--we see that--on the line, whether when they are  covering floods and hurricanes at home or when they are transversing  the globe to bring us war zone stories. We depend on reporters in Ohio  and around the world to bring us the stories that have an impact on our  day-to-day lives and to tell the stories that might not otherwise be  told. Yet, too often today, we see reporters restricted, vilified, and  threatened--all for doing their jobs. We can't dismiss these threats as  just empty rhetoric.   Think of the anguish and the heartbreak and the terrible sight that  happened at the newsroom at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis. We all  know too well how dangerous a job it has become to report the news.  Just last Thursday, the Herald newspaper--the daily paper south of  Columbus in Circleville, OH--received an unmarked letter in the mail.  Inside, it threatened physical harm to all of the workers there. Think  about that--just for doing their jobs at a local newspaper in covering  football games, in covering a business that might have cheated a  customer, or in covering a politician who might have cut corners. In  serving their community, these workers had their safety threatened.   This is personal to me, and I apologize for making this personal. My  wife, Connie Schultz, is a Pulitzer Prize winner from the Cleveland  Plain Dealer. She writes a weekly column for the Creators Syndicate in  150 newspapers. She is about as far from being an enemy of the people  as anyone I know.   She was a working-class kid who grew up in Ashtabula, OH. Her dad  carried a union card, which saved her life because she had health care  at the Cleveland clinic that other people would have not been able to  have benefited from whose dads didn't have insurance. She worked her  way through Kent State University, and she became a reporter.   Do you know why she won the Pulitzer Prize? She won the Pulitzer  Prize because she has written about servers--servers in restaurants  where sometimes management skims their tips. She has written about  single parents who struggle every day and oftentimes get little help  from anybody. She has written about workers and a system that is so  often rigged against them. They work every bit as hard as we all do  here, but they get so little for it.   She teaches at Kent State. She teaches millenials. She teaches young  men and women who are mostly working-class kids, most of whom will  graduate with tens of thousands of dollars in debt, which is something  the President of the United States has never faced. They work part time  and some of them full time. They struggle to get through their classes.  They want to be reporters because they want to go out and comfort the  afflicted and afflict the comfortable because they care about truth and  care about honesty. Again, they are as far as can be from being enemies  of the people. How shameful it is the President of the United States  says that.   The job of the President of the United States and the job of our  political leaders is to set an example--to respect our democratic  institutions, including the press, and to bring Americans together and  not divide us.   Please, Mr. President, won't you do that?   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
