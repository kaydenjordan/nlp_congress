 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                                  Paid Leave     Mr. President, we hear a lot in this Chamber about  family values. We hear from Democrats and we hear from Republicans  about the need to support and improve the strength of families across  our Nation. What are the things that really do provide the foundation  for a family to thrive? Jobs, education, and healthcare. Good-paying  jobs and jobs with good working conditions, certainly, are extremely  valuable, but the issue of good-paying jobs and good working conditions  has been caught in a struggle between ``we the people'' and the  powerful and privileged of this Nation. Our Constitution starts out  with these three beautiful words: ``We the People.''   The whole entire setup was to avoid the type of situation that was in  so many places in Europe, where the privileged and powerful families  ran everything for their own benefit and not for the benefit of the  people of the United States of America--in that case, the people of  Europe.   Our vision is different. Yet, time and again, we see this struggle  played out, where the powerful and privileged are trying to ride right  over the top of ordinary people--ordinary working Americans, ordinary  middle-class Americans.   That certainly is the case when we take a look at the issue of the  Family and Medical Leave Act, FMLA. This is an act passed 25 years ago.  It was a major step forward in striking a better balance for good  working conditions.   Let's revisit a little bit of the debate that occurred 25 years ago  in preparation for the consideration of that act. Many folks today  don't realize that the opportunity to take unpaid time off to be with a  child or be with a loved one who is very sick or a family member who is  dying is something that came out of the FMLA 25 years ago. They assumed  this is just a fair, decent, and right way to treat your employees;  that it produces more productive, more loyal team members, and it is  just part of an appropriate consideration of the human condition.   Before we had the FMLA 25 years ago, oftentimes people couldn't take  time off to have an operation for a medical condition. Being sick a day  might mean you are fired. Tending to a newborn child might mean you  lose your job. Decent, ordinary interaction with family was something  that was not prioritized by the companies around this country. It is a  system that big, powerful, and privileged individuals and organizations  fought to preserve.   It took 7 years of congressional debates. It took overcoming two  Presidential vetoes. It took overcoming entrenched opposition from  special interests that said it would be a disaster for workers to be  able to address their medical conditions or their family medical  conditions. They predicted all types of catastrophes.   The chamber of commerce back then called FMLA--that is simply family  and medical leave--a dangerous precedent. The National Federation of  Independent Business said it was the greatest threat to small business  in America. One Member of Congress, Representative Cass Ballenger of  North Carolina, described FMLA as essentially ``nothing short of  Europeanization,'' and he didn't mean that in a complimentary fashion.   We know better today. There is no partisan debate over the FMLA  today. There is no organized corporate opposition to the Family and  Medical Leave Act. Companies have found, treating their employees with  the opportunity to address medical conditions of their own or their  family members or to be with a new baby is simply a win-win for the  company and for the employer. More than 200 million working Americans  have taken leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act to care for a  newborn child, to sit at the bedside of a sick loved one, or to  recuperate after a major surgery. What has been the result? According  to a Labor Department survey released 5 years ago on the 20th  anniversary, 91 percent of employers said the law had either a positive  impact or at least no negative impact on the business. Whenever you get  9 out of 10 on anything in America, we should pay a lot of attention to  that.   The FMLA has been so successful and so popular, it has been expanded  twice. In 2008, we expanded it to allow military families to take up to  26 weeks of leave to care for injured servicemembers. Then again, in  2009, we expanded it to cover flight attendants and airline flight  crews. It is time we consider, on the 25th anniversary, that we need to  go from a system of simply unpaid leave to a system of paid leave. We  need to join the rest of the developed world and say: It makes so much  sense for family members to have this flexibility. It makes so much of  an improved worker and an improved family that it is a win-win for  America.   It is time to recognize that while the FMLA--Family and Medical Leave  Act--was powerful, it is only powerful for those who could afford to go  without income. That leaves out a great, vast swath of America.   President Trump said he wants to fight for working families, so I  would expect him to be down here lobbying for the improvement of this  act. We haven't heard from him yet, and I am not really expecting we  will because what we have seen in the course of the past year is, while  talking about strengthening families, time and again, the President is  simply about diminishing the support for working families and  undermining them.   We saw that most recently with the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau, by assigning someone to go over there and head it up and then  proceed to undo the protections for fair financial deals that are the  foundation for  [[Page S682]]  the financial success of our families. Really? Turn the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau into a bureau to support financial  predators? No, that does not help our families.   In fact, it will help our families to advance Senator Gillibrand's  FAMILY Act because the time has come for national paid family and  medical leave insurance in the United States. We know this because a  number of States have already enacted their own paid leave law. This  isn't some big experiment that we have no foundation for understanding  the pros and cons because States have already acted. We can evaluate  how that has gone.   When California was debating paid leave before its passage in 2002-- yes, 16 years ago--the chamber of commerce described it as a coming  disaster, and the National Federation of Independent Business predicted  it would be the biggest financial burden for business in decades, but a  study looking back on California's paid leave found that after 1.4  million leave claims were paid--that is 1.4 million times that a worker  was able to take care of a medical condition, was able to care for a  newborn, was able to sit by the bed of a dying family member--the law  has helped reduce turnover. That is good for business. It has increased  employee loyalty, which is also good for business.   New Jersey passed paid family leave in 2008. They offered workers 6  weeks, at two-thirds their salary, funded through a payroll tax. At the  time, the mayor of Bogata, NJ, railed against it saying, ``The basic  argument for this . . . is to subsidize an army of breastfeeding single  mothers.'' Well, I must say what a misunderstanding that is of the  importance of a mother to be with a newborn or a father to be with a  newborn. That bonding, that support--those are family values. Don't  talk about family values to me and then talk about a mother having zero  days to be with a newborn or a father zero days to be with a newborn.   After 2 years, New Jersey has a leave fund that has a surplus, and  they did a reduction in the payroll tax that pays for it. Between 2009  and 2015, 200,000 paid leave claims were approved, paying out $507  million in benefits, resulting in employee retention of over 90  percent. Business is humming in New Jersey and in California. In fact,  businesses are doing well in each of the States and the District of  Columbia where paid leave has already been established by law.   I celebrate what we accomplished 25 years ago with the Family and  Medical Leave Act, but I am saddened we restricted it to only those who  could afford to take time off with no pay. Strengthening families is  something we should want to happen with families who are doing well  enough to go without pay, but we should also assist families who are  struggling and living paycheck-to-paycheck. I want those moms and dads  who are living paycheck to paycheck to be able to spend a moment with  their newborn. I want them to get the operation they need, which causes  them to miss time from their job. I want them to be able to sit by the  bed of a loved wife or a husband or child as they are dying. That is  strengthening the families in America. That is putting people ahead of  the powerful and the privileged. And putting people ahead of the  powerful and privileged is what our Nation is all about. So let's get  it done and pass this bill.    Thank you, Mr. President.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Young). The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
