 Mr. President, I move to table the Paul amendment, but I  just want to say a few words.   This continuing resolution before the Senate holds spending at the  fiscal 2019 levels. An arbitrary 1-percent across-the-board cut on top  of this--although it sounds good--would be extremely harmful to our  agencies, particularly our military.   The Senate handily defeated similar amendments just recently, and I  hope we will do this today.    Mr. President, I move to table the Paul amendment and ask  for the yeas and nays.
