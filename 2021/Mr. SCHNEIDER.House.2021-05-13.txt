 Mr. Speaker, tonight, because of Hamas terror rockets,  millions of people in Israel, Gaza, and the West Bank, including frail  seniors and young children, are huddled in fear, worried about their  loved ones, and uncertain about what tomorrow will bring.   Hamas and other terrorist groups are relentlessly attacking Israel,  launching more than 1,500 rockets just since Monday, targeting  Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Be'er Sheva, and every community in between.   Israel is rightfully responding to these attacks, protecting its  citizens and defending its borders. Civilians are dying, Arabs and  Jews. My heart breaks for all innocents killed and injured. It is true  that more have died in Gaza, but Israel goes out of its way to minimize  civilian casualties. Hamas, conversely, goes out of its way to target  civilians in Israel, while launching its rockets from civilian areas in  Gaza.   Israel has overwhelming resources to defend herself, yet shows  restraint. Hamas has rockets intended only for death and terror.  Thankfully, with Iron Dome, Israel has the technology to protect the  lives of its citizens, which, in turn, protects Palestinian lives as  well.   The U.S. stands with Israel, and we must do all we can to end Hamas'  terror attacks and swiftly restore calm to the region.                            ____________________
