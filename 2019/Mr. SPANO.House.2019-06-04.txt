 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of nine young men and  women who have accepted the call to serve our Nation, beginning with  their nominations to one of our prestigious U.S. service academies.   Each has excelled academically and has shown strong leadership  through extracurricular activities. Today, I applaud the following  nominees.   Harry Combs, Gabriel Compres, Rayna Drigo, Jackson Pepe, and Carlton  Potter will be attending the United States Military Academy.   Treyvon Poe and Zane Richardson will both be attending the United  States Naval Academy.   Kenya Smith will be attending the United States Air Force Academy.   And Andrew Campbell will be attending the United States Merchant  Marine Academy.   This group of students reflects one of the best and brightest in  Florida's 15th  [[Page H4297]]  District. I congratulate them. I am honored to nominate them to our  service academies, and I am confident that they will serve our country  with distinction.                            ____________________
