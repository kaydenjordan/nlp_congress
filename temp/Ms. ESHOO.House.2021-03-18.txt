 Madam Speaker, I'm proud to support H.R. 6, the American  Dream and  [[Page H1526]]  Promise Act to ensure that millions of young Americans can remain in  the only country they've ever known and loved.   The bill provides a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, young people  who came to the U.S. as children without legal status. It provides  conditional legal status for ten years to those with a high school  diploma or equivalent credential, and they must pay a fee and pass a  background check. They can also earn permanent legal status if they  attend college, work lawfully, or serve in the military.   I supported President Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals  (DACA) program which provided temporary legal status and work permits  to over 650,000 young people, but only Congress can provide permanent  legal status and a pathway to citizenship through statute. After  putting their faith in the government when they registered for DACA and  enduring the Trump Administration's three-year legal battle to end this  program, these young people deserve the certainty of a permanent  solution.   The American Dream and Promise Act also provides permanent legal  status to recipients of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Deferred  Enforced Departure (DED), programs that provide temporary legal status  to immigrants from countries experiencing war, natural disasters, or  other ongoing crises.   Many of the individuals I've described are longtime U.S. residents  who contribute to their communities and our economy and are Americans  in all but name. Our legislation provides them with an earned pathway  to citizenship so they can be legally recognized as full members of  society and no longer live in fear of deportation. They deserve this,  and I urge all Members to support the American Dream and Promise Act.
