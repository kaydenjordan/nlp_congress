 Thank you, Mr. President.   I rise in support of the Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization  Act that we are now considering. Let me begin by commending Chairman  Alexander and Ranking Member Murray of the Senate Health, Education,  Labor, and Pensions Committee for their leadership in bringing this  important legislation to the Senate floor. This bill is the product of  bipartisan, bicameral work and is proof that we can make progress when  we work together on the areas where we can find agreement.   FDA user fees, which are reauthorized under this bill, are critical  to moving the most advanced research from a promise to a cure and  ensuring that new treatments reach patients in need. User fees, where  companies fund a portion of the premarket review of their products,  account for more than one-quarter of all FDA funding. Yet the FDA's  authority to collect these fees will expire at the end of next month  unless Congress acts, thus the urgency of getting this bill across the  finish line.   That is why it is imperative that we advance this bill now and ensure  that work on these promising new pharmaceuticals continues  uninterrupted.   In May, the HELP Committee, on which I am pleased to serve,  overwhelmingly approved bipartisan legislation to extend and  reauthorize the FDA fees in order to support the public health of our  Nation. The bill before us also incorporates many provisions that were  advanced by individual Committee Members. It is a great example of how  a committee process should work. It was collaborative. We each brought  ideas to the table, and during our markup, those ideas were offered as  amendments and in many cases incorporated into the legislation.   I thank the chairman and the ranking member for including in this  important legislation provisions that I authored with Senator Claire  McCaskill. Those provisions seek to accelerate the review process for  prescription drugs in cases where there is limited or no competition.  Our purpose is to lower or at least moderate the escalating  prescription drug prices that are one of the key cost drivers in our  healthcare system today.   During the last Congress, our Senate Aging Committee, which I chair-- and at that time Senator McCaskill was the ranking member--had a  bipartisan investigation into the causes, impacts, and potential  solutions to the egregious price spikes for certain off-patent drugs  for which there were no generic competitors.   Now, let me explain this situation a little more.   What we found was happening is that in cases in which the patent on  the  [[Page S4786]]  original brand name pharmaceutical had expired, there were these  companies that were not traditional pharmaceutical companies--they were  not firms that had invested hundreds of millions in R&D in order to  develop a new prescription drug. That is not what we are talking about.  We are talking about these pharma companies--I call them hedge fund  pharmas--that wait until the patent has expired, then buy the  pharmaceutical drug and virtually overnight impose egregious price  increases. One of the executives of these companies, when asked why he  did so, answered simply ``because I can.''   Obviously, that has a very detrimental impact on patients, on  healthcare providers, on insurers, and on Federal programs such as  Medicaid and Medicare.   So building on our investigation, Senator McCaskill and I sponsored  legislation, called the Making Pharmaceutical Markets More Competitive  Act, to foster a more competitive generic marketplace and to improve  access for affordable medicines. That is key. If we can have more  competition in the prescription drug marketplace, that is what drives  down costs, and that is what drives down prices. We know that from our  experience when generic drugs come on the market.   The bill that we are considering today that is based on our  legislation includes key provisions which were adopted unanimously as  an amendment that I sponsored during the committee markup.   First, our provisions would require the FDA to prioritize the review  of certain generic applications. It would set a clear timeframe of no  more than 8 months for the FDA to act on such applications where there  is inadequate generic competition. This would help to resolve  situations in which there are drug shortages, as well as circumstances  in which there are not more than three approved competitors on the  market.   The Aging Committee's investigation into sudden price spikes found  that older drugs with only one manufacturer and no generic competitor  are particularly vulnerable to dramatic and sudden price increases.   One company that we investigated, Turing Pharmaceuticals, increased  the price of a drug called Daraprim, which is a lifesaving drug for  serious parasitic infections, from $13.50 a pill to $750 a pill--an  increase of more than 5,000 percent--and they did so literally  overnight. Now, keep in mind that this company, Turing Pharmaceuticals,  had nothing to do with the costly research and development that brought  about this lifesaving drug, known as Daraprim, but after they bought  the drug--after the patent had expired and they saw that there was no  generic competitor--they increased the price overnight by 5,000  percent. This price hike for a drug that has remained unchanged since  1953 is unacceptable and underscores the urgent need for legislation to  prevent bad actors from taking advantage of a noncompetitive  marketplace.   Second, the bill would improve communications between the FDA and the  eligible sponsors prior to the submission of an application for the  approval of a generic drug. That would improve the quality of  applications from the beginning, increasing the chances of successful  approval by the FDA.   Third, new reporting requirements would provide increased  transparency into the backlog of applications for drug approvals and  pending generic and priority review applications.   Fourth, this bill would provide the public with accurate information  about drugs with limited competition. Drug manufacturers would be  required to notify and provide rationale when removing a drug from the  market, and the FDA would publish a list of off-patent brand name drugs  that lack generic competitors, so that if you were a generic drug  company, you would know that this would be an opportunity to develop a  competitor drug.   I give the new FDA Commissioner a great deal of credit for his  incorporating some of our provisions. He cares deeply about this issue.   Finally, this bill would streamline the regulatory process to address  incidents in which the delayed re-inspection of manufacturing  facilities becomes a barrier to generics entering the marketplace.   By taking these steps, we will enhance regulatory certainty for  generic drug companies, help to prevent shortages, increase competition  to lower prices and prevent monopolies, and deter practices that can  lead to unjustifiable, exorbitant price hikes.   I am pleased that the legislation also includes another bill that  resulted from our Aging Committee's investigation. This provision will  help to prevent bad actors from receiving unwarranted vouchers under  the Tropical Disease Voucher Program.   This program was intended to incentivize the development of medicines  for neglected diseases, yet was exploited by the notorious Martin  Shkreli, the founder of Turing. After spiking the price of Daraprim, he  purchased another decades-old drug--one, once again, without a  competitor--that is used to treat a life-threatening infection that is  rare in the United States. Mr. Shkreli sought to use the Tropical  Disease Voucher Program to gain exclusivity and hike the price for a  drug that is not, in fact, a new drug.   Our legislation revises the program to better ensure that it achieves  its intent, which is to spur the development of therapies that are  truly new in order to treat and cure neglected diseases.   Drug companies should not be able to increase their prices  dramatically by thousands of a percent overnight without any  justification--without the development of modifications in the drug  that improve its effectiveness, for example.   Our legislation will help to foster a much healthier and more  competitive generic marketplace as the best defense against such  exploitation. I am pleased that our bipartisan plan will increase  generic competition, which is so important for American families and  our seniors, particularly, who take a disproportionate number of the  prescription drugs that are prescribed in this country.   Before closing, let me briefly mention another important provision in  the bill before us, the Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act of 2017.  Approximately 30 million Americans experience age-related hearing loss.  Yet only about 14 percent of those with hearing loss use assistive  hearing technology, often because they simply cannot afford the price  of costly hearing aids.   We know from a hearing that we recently held in the Aging Committee  that social isolation among our seniors can be exacerbated by hearing  loss that is left untreated. That, in turn, increases that social  isolation and increases the risk of serious mental and physical health  outcomes. By making some types of hearing aids available over the  counter, just as people buy readers to see with, which are over-the- counter eyeglasses, this legislation will help increase access to and  lower the cost of the products for the consumers who need them.   The legislation we are considering today will help to bring  lifesaving drugs to the marketplace and will ensure that the FDA  continues to operate smoothly and, most importantly, that promising  therapies make it to the American people.   Again, I commend Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray for  their leadership, and I encourage all of our colleagues to join me in  supporting this important legislation.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, Richard Dudman, one of our Nation's most  esteemed journalists, passed away at his Maine home last night. I rise  today in tribute to a great American reporter and engaged citizen.   After serving in the Merchant Marine and U.S. Navy Reserve during  World War II, Mr. Dudman began his journalism career at the Denver Post  in 1945 and joined the St. Louis Post-Dispatch 4 years later. In his  more than three decades at the Post-Dispatch, he covered Fidel Castro's  Cuban revolution, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, the  Bay of Pigs invasion, the Watergate and Iran-Contra scandals, as well  as armed conflicts from the Middle East and Asia to Central and South  America.   In 1970, while covering the Vietnam war, Mr. Dudman was captured by  the Viet Cong and held prisoner in Cambodia, a harrowing experience he  wrote about in his acclaimed book, ``Forty Days With the Enemy.'' In  1981, on his last day as Washington bureau chief for  [[Page S4824]]  the Post-Dispatch, he ran up Connecticut Avenue to cover the attempted  assassination of President Ronald Reagan. For some of the most  momentous events of the second half of the 20th Century, Richard Dudman  wrote the first draft of history.   After retiring and moving to Ellsworth and Little Cranberry Island in  Maine, Mr. Dudman continued to contribute to the Post-Dispatch and  wrote more than 1,000 editorials for the Bangor Daily News. Among his  many accolades are the prestigious George Polk Career Award in  Journalism and induction into the Maine Press Association Hall of Fame.   Mr. Dudman combined his journalistic professionalism with a spirit of  serving others. In 2014, he and his wife, Helen, were presented with  the Golden Eagle Award from the Boy Scouts of America for their  commitment to community service, a quality that ran through their  remarkable 69 years of marriage.   In this time of sorrow, I offer my deep condolences to Helen and  their family. I hope they will find comfort in Richard's inspiring  legacy and in a life well-lived. It has been said that we all have a  birth date and a death date, with a dash in between. It is what we do  with our dash that counts. Richard Dudman's dash was extraordinarily  long, and he made it count. He filled it with passion, professionalism,  and dedication. May his memory inspire us all to do the same.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise today to introduce legislation  with my colleague from Montana, Senator Tester, that would extend an  important program to fund Teaching Health Centers, which support the  health and well-being of families in rural and medically underserved  communities. I am pleased that Senators Cochran, Manchin, Daines,  Harris, and Boozman, have joined us as cosponsors.   In the background of the health care debate, there is another crisis  that looms. We are facing a severe shortage of doctors. By 2025, we  will need more than 100,000 new primary care doctors to meet the  growing demand for health care services across the Country. The  shortage is especially critical in rural and underserved communities,  which are often those that have been hit hardest by the opioid  epidemic. The most significant shortages are in family medicine,  general internal medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology,  psychiatry, and dentistry.   These shortages have reached crisis levels in many places. In clinics  and health centers in Aroostook County, Maine's northernmost county  where I grew up, I hear stories about vacancies forcing Mainers to  travel many miles simply to see a primary care doctor or dentist.   For the past six years, one program, the Teaching Health Centers  Graduate Medical Education Program, has worked to fill these gaps. This  program helps to train medical residents in community-based settings,  including low-income, underserved rural and urban neighborhoods. For  example, since 2011, the Penobscot Community Health Care Center has  trained 31 residents and served more than 15,000 dental patients in  Bangor, Maine.   We need to meet people in the communities in which they live and  work. This program is training the next generation of physicians, and  has produced real results. When compared with traditional Medicare  graduate medical education residents, those who train at teaching  health centers are significantly more likely to practice primary care  and remain in underserved or rural communities. The numbers speak for  themselves: 82 percent of Teaching Health Center, or THC, residents  choose to practice primary care, compared to 23 percent of traditional  Medicare Graduate Medical Education residents; and 55 percent of THC  residents choose to remain in underserved communities, compared to 26  percent of traditional Medicare GME residents.   Teaching health centers are serving Americans from coast to coast. A  total of 742 THC residents are serving in 27 states and the District of  Columbia. The program is competitive, and trains the best of the best.  For each residency position, THC programs receive more than 100  applications. In 2017, THC residents and faculty will provide more than  one million primary care medical visits to underserved communities.   Teaching Health Centers have demonstrated a record of success, and it  is imperative that we support them. Our legislation would reauthorize  the Teaching Health Centers Graduate Medical Education Program for  three years. It would also allow new programs to expand within existing  centers and the creation of entirely new teaching health centers.   This bill is widely supported by leading community health and  physician organizations, including the American Association of Teaching  Health Centers, National Association of Community Health Centers,  American Academy of Family Physicians, American Association of Colleges  of Osteopathic Medicine, American Osteopathic Association, American  Council of OB/GYNs, Society of Teachers of Family Medicine, and Council  of Academic Family Medicine. We have also received letters of support  from teaching health centers in Maine, Montana, Tennessee, Iowa,  Oklahoma, North Carolina, California, Mississippi, Pennsylvania,  Washington, Texas, Connecticut, New York, Illinois, Massachusetts, and  Idaho.   In the face of nationwide physician shortages, our legislation would  provide a solution for communities today and a path forward to train  the physicians of tomorrow. I urge all of my colleagues to join in  support of this important legislation, the Training the Next Generation  of Primary Care Doctors Act of 2017.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  letters be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                Penobscot Community Health Care,                                                     August 2, 2017.      Hon. Susan Collins,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of Penobscot Community       Health Care's General Practice Dental Residency program, a       Teaching Health Center training 3-6 residents a year (with       over 28 residents trained since 2011) and serving 15,000       dental patients in Bangor, Maine, I want to express our       appreciation for your relentless efforts to develop       legislation to continue funding and expand the Teaching       Health Center Graduate Medical Education (THCGME) program. We       know that you and your staff have worked long and hard with       multiple stakeholder organizations, including the American       Association of Teaching Health Centers, to create the best       possible legislation that will fund  [[Page S4832]]       adequately this vital program for at least another three       years and provide for expansion to additional medically       underserved areas of our country.        THCs currently train more than 742 residents nationally and       are providing more than a million patient visits in       underserved rural and urban communities. The continuation of       this program is vital in all of the communities they are       located, and preserving this program is critical to the       health of hundreds of thousands around the country. This       investment of federal funding in the THCGME program, coupled       with private, nonfederal resources, guarantees that every       dollar is used exclusively for primary care training, all in       community-based settings. Residents trained in community-      based settings are three times more likely than traditionally       trained residents to practice primary care in a community       based setting ensuring that doctors trained in these settings       remain in communities where they are needed most.        Penobscot Community Health Care appreciates your leadership       on this important issue and is pleased to support your       legislation, which is helping to address the doctor and       dentist shortage that plagues so many communities, both urban       and rural. You have always championed Community Health       Centers, and concurrently Teaching Health Centers,       recognizing the need for accessible, affordable health care       for all no matter if you live in Caribou, Maine or New York       City.        Thank you for your tireless efforts and leadership in the       United States Senate as you strive to preserve and improve       health care for all Americans.            Sincerely,                                              Kenneth Schmidt, MPA,      President and CEO.                                   ____                                     Resurrection Family Medicine,                                        Memphis, TN, August 1, 2017.      Hon. Susan Collins,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of Resurrection Health       Family Medicine Residency, a Teaching Health Center training       25 residents and providing 15,000 patient visits per year in       Memphis, TN, I write to express our appreciation for your       relentless efforts to develop legislation to continue funding       and expand the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical       Education (THCGME) program. We know that you and your staff       have worked long and hard with multiple stakeholder       organizations, including the American Association of Teaching       Health Centers, to create the best possible legislation that       will fund adequately this vital program for at least another       three years and provide for expansion to additional medically       underserved areas of our country.

Resurrection Health Family Medicine Residency appreciates       your leadership on this important issue and is pleased to       support your legislation, which is helping to address the       doctor shortage that plagues so many communities, both urban       and rural.            Sincerely,                                                 Jeremy Crider, MD,      Residency Director.                                   ____                                            The American Congress of                                 Obstetricians and Gynecologists,                                     Washington, DC, August 3, 2017.      Hon. Susan Collins,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Jon Tester,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senators Collins and Tester: The American Congress of       Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), with more than 58,000       physicians and partners dedicated to advancing women's       health, is pleased to endorse the Training the Next       Generation of Primary Care Doctors Act of 2017. Your bill       would help improve access for women in rural and underserved       areas to timely, high quality health care by training primary       care physicians, including obstetrician-gynecologists.        Today, women living in half of all US counties are in areas       without an ob-gyn, including one of Maine's 16 counties, and       35 of Montana's 56 counties. Furthermore, the ob-gyn       workforce is aging and a large number of ob-gyns are retiring       at a time when the female population is expected to increase       36% by 2050. ACOG projects an ob-gyn shortage of 18% by 2030.        Your bill will help alleviate these workforce challenges by       ensuring the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical       Education (THCGME) program can continue to train ob-gyns and       other primary care physicians in an efficient and effective       manner. Community-based THCGME medical training programs are       critical to filling workforce shortages, as physicians       trained through this program are more likely to practice in       underserved communities. According to the Health Resources       and Services Administration (HRSA), primary care residents       trained in community-based settings are three times more       likely to practice in an underserved community-based setting.       An investment in THCGME to improve access to care in rural       and underserved communities has a long-term impact positive       impact.        Thank you for introducing this legislation to improve       access to high quality care for women. Should you have any       questions or if we can be of assistance in any way, please       contact Mallory Schwarz, ACOG Federal Affairs Manager.            Sincerely,                                       Haywood L. Brown, MD, FACOG,      President.                                   ____                                 American Osteopathic Association,                                     Washington, DC, August 3, 2017.      Hon. Susan Collins,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Jon Tester,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senators Collins and Tester: On behalf of the American       Osteopathic Association (AOA) and the nearly 130,000       osteopathic physicians and osteopathic medical students we       represent, thank you for introducing the ``Training the Next       Generation of Primary Care Doctors Act of 2017.'' This       important bipartisan legislation renews the commitment to the       continued development of the Teaching Health Centers Graduate       Medical Education (THCGME) program to help ensure a robust       primary care workforce in our nation's rural and underserved       communities. We are grateful for your leadership on this       critical issue.        The THCGME program is a vital source of training for       primary care residents to help expand access to care in rural       and underserved communities throughout the country. These       programs, located in 59 teaching health centers in 27 states,       currently train 742 residents in much-needed primary care       fields including family medicine, internal medicine,       pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, psychiatry,       geriatrics, and dentistry. The majority of these programs are       accredited by the AOA or are dually accredited (DO/MD)       programs, supporting nearly 800 osteopathic resident       physicians through their training since the program began.       And true to the intent of the THCGME program, residents who       train in these programs are far more likely to practice       primary care and remain in the communities in which they have       trained.        As osteopathic physicians, we are trained in a patient-      centered, hands-on approach to care that focuses on the whole       person, including the physical, mental, and psychosocial       aspects of health. Our training and philosophy includes a       strong emphasis on primary care--in fact, approximately half       of all osteopathic physicians practice in primary care       specialties. Given this strong presence in primary care,       osteopathic medicine aligns naturally with the mission and       goals of the THCGME program that has proven successful in       helping address the existing gaps in our nation's primary       care workforce.        Your legislation provides much-needed stability through       continued funding for the THCGME program, and also creates a       pathway for the expansion of existing centers as well as the       creation of entirely new teaching health centers. We deeply       appreciate your commitment to training the future of the       primary care workforce and thank you for introducing this       important legislation. The AOA and our members stand ready to       assist you in securing its enactment into law.            Sincerely,                                                 Mark A. Baker, DO,      President.                                   ____                                              Council of Academic                                                Family Medicine,                                     Washington, DC, August 3, 2017.      Hon. Susan Collins,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Jon Tester,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senators Collins and Tester: On behalf of the Council       of Academic Family Medicine (CAFM), including the Society of       Teachers of Family Medicine, Association of Departments of       Family Medicine, Association of Family Medicine Residency       Directors, the North American Primary Care Research Group, we       thank you for introducing the Training the Next Generation of       Primary Care Doctors Act of 2017. This legislation is an       important step to providing sustainable funding and growth       for a critical program that helps address the primary care       physician shortage in our country. We appreciate your       leadership on this issue and give you our whole-hearted       support for the legislation.        To help sustain this important program the proposed       legislation provides suitable funding for current Teaching       Health Center Graduate Medical Education (THCGME) programs to       help address the crisis-level shortage of primary care       physicians. The funding level included in the bill will allow       for a per resident amount to be paid for training that is on       par with the Heath Resources and Services Administration       (HRSA) funded study identifying a median cost of       approximately $157 thousand per trainee. Evidence shows  [[Page S4833]]       that the THC program graduates are more likely to practice in       rural and medically underserved communities. We are pleased       that the proposed legislation supports ten new THC programs,       with a priority for those serving rural and medically       underserved populations and areas, recognizing the importance       of growing this successful program.        The Council on Graduate Medical Education (COGME), an       advisory body empaneled by Congress, has urged Congress to       continue of the THCGME program stating that ``THCGME programs       deliver excellent value in physician training,'' and that the       program encourages training in ``delivery systems that       emphasize team-based care in Patient Centered Medical Homes       that maximize quality at a moderate cost''; Additionally, the       Institute of Medicine (IOM), [now National Academy of       Medicine] in a 2014 report identified the THCGME program as       helping meet the need for primary care physicians, especially       those who provide care to underserved populations and worthy       of a permanent funding source.        The current authorization for this vital program expires at       the end of this fiscal year. Without legislative action, the       expiration of this program would mean an exacerbation of the       primary care physician shortage, and a lessening of support       for training in underserved and rural areas. We are grateful       to you both for your exceptional leadership in supporting and       sustaining this vital program by introducing this bill and       helping to shepherd it toward enactment.        The CAFM organizations and our members are pleased to work       with you to secure this legislation's enactment.

Hon. Susan Collins,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the Montana Family       Medicine Residency and RiverStone Health Clinic, one of the       nation's original eleven teaching health centers training 24       family medicine residents and serving over 15,000 residents       or Yellowstone and Carbon County, NIT, I want to express our       appreciation for your relentless efforts to develop       legislation to continue funding and expand the Teaching       Health Center Graduate Medical Education (THCGME) program. We       know that you and your staff have worked long and hard with       multiple stakeholder organizations, including the American       Association of Teaching Health Centers and the National       Association of Community Health Centers, to create the best       possible legislation that will fund adequately this vital       program for at least another three years and provide for       expansion to additional medically underserved areas of our       country.        THCs currently train more than 742 residents nationally and       are providing more than a million patient visits in       underserved rural and urban communities. The continuation of       this program is vital in all of the communities they are       located and preserving this program is critical to the health       of hundreds of thousands around the country, particularly       those who lack access to healthcare absent their local       community health center and its providers. This investment of       federal funding in the THCGME program, coupled with private,       nonfederal resources, guarantees that every dollar is used       exclusively for primary care training, all in community-based       settings.        Residents trained in community-based settings are three       times more likely than traditionally trained residents to       practice primary care in a community based setting ensuring       that doctors trained in these settings remain in communities       where they are needed most. Some 70% of our residency's over       100 graduates practice in MT, a state with widespread       provider shortage areas and multiple counties with no medical       care provider at all.        RiverStone Health and Montana Family Medicine Residency       appreciate your leadership on this important issue and are       pleased to support your legislation, which is helping to       address the doctor shortage that plagues so many communities,       both urban and rural.            Sincerely,                                      John Felton, MPH, MBA, FACHE,                                  President & CEO / Health Officer.                                  ______                                         By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Johnson, Mr.          Tillis, Mr. Heller, Mr. Scott, and Mr. Inhofe):   S. 1757. A bill to strengthen border security, increase resources for  enforcement of immigration laws, and for other purposes; read the first  time.    Madam President, I rise today to introduce legislation  with my colleague from Montana, Senator Tester, that would extend an  important program to fund Teaching Health Centers, which support the  health and well-being of families in rural and medically underserved  communities. I am pleased that Senators Cochran, Manchin, Daines,  Harris, and Boozman, have joined us as cosponsors.   In the background of the health care debate, there is another crisis  that looms. We are facing a severe shortage of doctors. By 2025, we  will need more than 100,000 new primary care doctors to meet the  growing demand for health care services across the Country. The  shortage is especially critical in rural and underserved communities,  which are often those that have been hit hardest by the opioid  epidemic. The most significant shortages are in family medicine,  general internal medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology,  psychiatry, and dentistry.   These shortages have reached crisis levels in many places. In clinics  and health centers in Aroostook County, Maine's northernmost county  where I grew up, I hear stories about vacancies forcing Mainers to  travel many miles simply to see a primary care doctor or dentist.   For the past six years, one program, the Teaching Health Centers  Graduate Medical Education Program, has worked to fill these gaps. This  program helps to train medical residents in community-based settings,  including low-income, underserved rural and urban neighborhoods. For  example, since 2011, the Penobscot Community Health Care Center has  trained 31 residents and served more than 15,000 dental patients in  Bangor, Maine.   We need to meet people in the communities in which they live and  work. This program is training the next generation of physicians, and  has produced real results. When compared with traditional Medicare  graduate medical education residents, those who train at teaching  health centers are significantly more likely to practice primary care  and remain in underserved or rural communities. The numbers speak for  themselves: 82 percent of Teaching Health Center, or THC, residents  choose to practice primary care, compared to 23 percent of traditional  Medicare Graduate Medical Education residents; and 55 percent of THC  residents choose to remain in underserved communities, compared to 26  percent of traditional Medicare GME residents.   Teaching health centers are serving Americans from coast to coast. A  total of 742 THC residents are serving in 27 states and the District of  Columbia. The program is competitive, and trains the best of the best.  For each residency position, THC programs receive more than 100  applications. In 2017, THC residents and faculty will provide more than  one million primary care medical visits to underserved communities.   Teaching Health Centers have demonstrated a record of success, and it  is imperative that we support them. Our legislation would reauthorize  the Teaching Health Centers Graduate Medical Education Program for  three years. It would also allow new programs to expand within existing  centers and the creation of entirely new teaching health centers.   This bill is widely supported by leading community health and  physician organizations, including the American Association of Teaching  Health Centers, National Association of Community Health Centers,  American Academy of Family Physicians, American Association of Colleges  of Osteopathic Medicine, American Osteopathic Association, American  Council of OB/GYNs, Society of Teachers of Family Medicine, and Council  of Academic Family Medicine. We have also received letters of support  from teaching health centers in Maine, Montana, Tennessee, Iowa,  Oklahoma, North Carolina, California, Mississippi, Pennsylvania,  Washington, Texas, Connecticut, New York, Illinois, Massachusetts, and  Idaho.   In the face of nationwide physician shortages, our legislation would  provide a solution for communities today and a path forward to train  the physicians of tomorrow. I urge all of my colleagues to join in  support of this important legislation, the Training the Next Generation  of Primary Care Doctors Act of 2017.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  letters be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                Penobscot Community Health Care,                                                     August 2, 2017.      Hon. Susan Collins,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of Penobscot Community       Health Care's General Practice Dental Residency program, a       Teaching Health Center training 3-6 residents a year (with       over 28 residents trained since 2011) and serving 15,000       dental patients in Bangor, Maine, I want to express our       appreciation for your relentless efforts to develop       legislation to continue funding and expand the Teaching       Health Center Graduate Medical Education (THCGME) program. We       know that you and your staff have worked long and hard with       multiple stakeholder organizations, including the American       Association of Teaching Health Centers, to create the best       possible legislation that will fund  [[Page S4832]]       adequately this vital program for at least another three       years and provide for expansion to additional medically       underserved areas of our country.

This       investment of federal funding in the THCGME program, coupled       with private, nonfederal resources, guarantees that every       dollar is used exclusively for primary care training, all in       community-based settings. Residents trained in community-      based settings are three times more likely than traditionally       trained residents to practice primary care in a community       based setting ensuring that doctors trained in these settings       remain in communities where they are needed most.        Penobscot Community Health Care appreciates your leadership       on this important issue and is pleased to support your       legislation, which is helping to address the doctor and       dentist shortage that plagues so many communities, both urban       and rural. You have always championed Community Health       Centers, and concurrently Teaching Health Centers,       recognizing the need for accessible, affordable health care       for all no matter if you live in Caribou, Maine or New York       City.        Thank you for your tireless efforts and leadership in the       United States Senate as you strive to preserve and improve       health care for all Americans.

Hon. Susan Collins,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of Resurrection Health       Family Medicine Residency, a Teaching Health Center training       25 residents and providing 15,000 patient visits per year in       Memphis, TN, I write to express our appreciation for your       relentless efforts to develop legislation to continue funding       and expand the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical       Education (THCGME) program. We know that you and your staff       have worked long and hard with multiple stakeholder       organizations, including the American Association of Teaching       Health Centers, to create the best possible legislation that       will fund adequately this vital program for at least another       three years and provide for expansion to additional medically       underserved areas of our country.

Sincerely,                                                 Jeremy Crider, MD,      Residency Director.                                   ____                                            The American Congress of                                 Obstetricians and Gynecologists,                                     Washington, DC, August 3, 2017.      Hon. Susan Collins,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Jon Tester,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senators Collins and Tester: The American Congress of       Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), with more than 58,000       physicians and partners dedicated to advancing women's       health, is pleased to endorse the Training the Next       Generation of Primary Care Doctors Act of 2017. Your bill       would help improve access for women in rural and underserved       areas to timely, high quality health care by training primary       care physicians, including obstetrician-gynecologists.        Today, women living in half of all US counties are in areas       without an ob-gyn, including one of Maine's 16 counties, and       35 of Montana's 56 counties. Furthermore, the ob-gyn       workforce is aging and a large number of ob-gyns are retiring       at a time when the female population is expected to increase       36% by 2050. ACOG projects an ob-gyn shortage of 18% by 2030.        Your bill will help alleviate these workforce challenges by       ensuring the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical       Education (THCGME) program can continue to train ob-gyns and       other primary care physicians in an efficient and effective       manner. Community-based THCGME medical training programs are       critical to filling workforce shortages, as physicians       trained through this program are more likely to practice in       underserved communities. According to the Health Resources       and Services Administration (HRSA), primary care residents       trained in community-based settings are three times more       likely to practice in an underserved community-based setting.       An investment in THCGME to improve access to care in rural       and underserved communities has a long-term impact positive       impact.        Thank you for introducing this legislation to improve       access to high quality care for women. Should you have any       questions or if we can be of assistance in any way, please       contact Mallory Schwarz, ACOG Federal Affairs Manager.            Sincerely,                                       Haywood L. Brown, MD, FACOG,      President.                                   ____                                 American Osteopathic Association,                                     Washington, DC, August 3, 2017.      Hon. Susan Collins,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Jon Tester,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senators Collins and Tester: On behalf of the American       Osteopathic Association (AOA) and the nearly 130,000       osteopathic physicians and osteopathic medical students we       represent, thank you for introducing the ``Training the Next       Generation of Primary Care Doctors Act of 2017.'' This       important bipartisan legislation renews the commitment to the       continued development of the Teaching Health Centers Graduate       Medical Education (THCGME) program to help ensure a robust       primary care workforce in our nation's rural and underserved       communities. We are grateful for your leadership on this       critical issue.        The THCGME program is a vital source of training for       primary care residents to help expand access to care in rural       and underserved communities throughout the country. These       programs, located in 59 teaching health centers in 27 states,       currently train 742 residents in much-needed primary care       fields including family medicine, internal medicine,       pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, psychiatry,       geriatrics, and dentistry. The majority of these programs are       accredited by the AOA or are dually accredited (DO/MD)       programs, supporting nearly 800 osteopathic resident       physicians through their training since the program began.       And true to the intent of the THCGME program, residents who       train in these programs are far more likely to practice       primary care and remain in the communities in which they have       trained.        As osteopathic physicians, we are trained in a patient-      centered, hands-on approach to care that focuses on the whole       person, including the physical, mental, and psychosocial       aspects of health. Our training and philosophy includes a       strong emphasis on primary care--in fact, approximately half       of all osteopathic physicians practice in primary care       specialties. Given this strong presence in primary care,       osteopathic medicine aligns naturally with the mission and       goals of the THCGME program that has proven successful in       helping address the existing gaps in our nation's primary       care workforce.        Your legislation provides much-needed stability through       continued funding for the THCGME program, and also creates a       pathway for the expansion of existing centers as well as the       creation of entirely new teaching health centers. We deeply       appreciate your commitment to training the future of the       primary care workforce and thank you for introducing this       important legislation. The AOA and our members stand ready to       assist you in securing its enactment into law.            Sincerely,                                                 Mark A. Baker, DO,      President.                                   ____                                              Council of Academic                                                Family Medicine,                                     Washington, DC, August 3, 2017.      Hon. Susan Collins,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Jon Tester,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senators Collins and Tester: On behalf of the Council       of Academic Family Medicine (CAFM), including the Society of       Teachers of Family Medicine, Association of Departments of       Family Medicine, Association of Family Medicine Residency       Directors, the North American Primary Care Research Group, we       thank you for introducing the Training the Next Generation of       Primary Care Doctors Act of 2017. This legislation is an       important step to providing sustainable funding and growth       for a critical program that helps address the primary care       physician shortage in our country. We appreciate your       leadership on this issue and give you our whole-hearted       support for the legislation.        To help sustain this important program the proposed       legislation provides suitable funding for current Teaching       Health Center Graduate Medical Education (THCGME) programs to       help address the crisis-level shortage of primary care       physicians. The funding level included in the bill will allow       for a per resident amount to be paid for training that is on       par with the Heath Resources and Services Administration       (HRSA) funded study identifying a median cost of       approximately $157 thousand per trainee. Evidence shows  [[Page S4833]]       that the THC program graduates are more likely to practice in       rural and medically underserved communities. We are pleased       that the proposed legislation supports ten new THC programs,       with a priority for those serving rural and medically       underserved populations and areas, recognizing the importance       of growing this successful program.        The Council on Graduate Medical Education (COGME), an       advisory body empaneled by Congress, has urged Congress to       continue of the THCGME program stating that ``THCGME programs       deliver excellent value in physician training,'' and that the       program encourages training in ``delivery systems that       emphasize team-based care in Patient Centered Medical Homes       that maximize quality at a moderate cost''; Additionally, the       Institute of Medicine (IOM), [now National Academy of       Medicine] in a 2014 report identified the THCGME program as       helping meet the need for primary care physicians, especially       those who provide care to underserved populations and worthy       of a permanent funding source.        The current authorization for this vital program expires at       the end of this fiscal year. Without legislative action, the       expiration of this program would mean an exacerbation of the       primary care physician shortage, and a lessening of support       for training in underserved and rural areas. We are grateful       to you both for your exceptional leadership in supporting and       sustaining this vital program by introducing this bill and       helping to shepherd it toward enactment.        The CAFM organizations and our members are pleased to work       with you to secure this legislation's enactment.

Hon. Susan Collins,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the Montana Family       Medicine Residency and RiverStone Health Clinic, one of the       nation's original eleven teaching health centers training 24       family medicine residents and serving over 15,000 residents       or Yellowstone and Carbon County, NIT, I want to express our       appreciation for your relentless efforts to develop       legislation to continue funding and expand the Teaching       Health Center Graduate Medical Education (THCGME) program. We       know that you and your staff have worked long and hard with       multiple stakeholder organizations, including the American       Association of Teaching Health Centers and the National       Association of Community Health Centers, to create the best       possible legislation that will fund adequately this vital       program for at least another three years and provide for       expansion to additional medically underserved areas of our       country.        THCs currently train more than 742 residents nationally and       are providing more than a million patient visits in       underserved rural and urban communities. The continuation of       this program is vital in all of the communities they are       located and preserving this program is critical to the health       of hundreds of thousands around the country, particularly       those who lack access to healthcare absent their local       community health center and its providers. This investment of       federal funding in the THCGME program, coupled with private,       nonfederal resources, guarantees that every dollar is used       exclusively for primary care training, all in community-based       settings.        Residents trained in community-based settings are three       times more likely than traditionally trained residents to       practice primary care in a community based setting ensuring       that doctors trained in these settings remain in communities       where they are needed most. Some 70% of our residency's over       100 graduates practice in MT, a state with widespread       provider shortage areas and multiple counties with no medical       care provider at all.        RiverStone Health and Montana Family Medicine Residency       appreciate your leadership on this important issue and are       pleased to support your legislation, which is helping to       address the doctor shortage that plagues so many communities,       both urban and rural.            Sincerely,                                      John Felton, MPH, MBA, FACHE,                                  President & CEO / Health Officer.                                  ______
