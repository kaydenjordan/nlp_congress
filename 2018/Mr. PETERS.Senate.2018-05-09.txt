 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, competition is the lifeblood of the  American economy. Competition is what makes capitalism work. It is  competition that has established the United States as the world's  dominant economic force for over a century.   American competition is driven by innovation. We created the light  bulb, the automobile, and the internet.   We all know that the internet has revolutionized the way we  communicate, learn, and do business. A free and open internet allows  students in Houghton, Lancing, and Mount Pleasant to access research  and to collaborate internationally. A free and open internet allows  startups in Detroit, Grand Rapids, and Flint to reach customers across  the globe. A free and open internet allows a small bed and breakfast in  Traverse City or Muskegon to reach millions of potential guests that  they couldn't otherwise reach.   While the internet has been a potent force for innovation and  economic growth in recent decades, our economy has been facing some  serious headwinds. I am deeply concerned that we are seeing increased  business consolidation--big firms are getting bigger--and we are seeing  fewer new small businesses and startups. A recent study found that  across 900 different industries, over two-thirds have become more  concentrated in the past decade. The formation of new companies is  falling. The number of jobs created by new businesses has fallen, even  as our workforce has grown.   We have seen a large national internet service provider acquire a  similarly large media company. We have recently seen the largest online  retailer acquire one of our Nation's most successful grocery chains.  Now we are seeing two of the four largest wireless carriers making  preparations to merge.   Certainly, consolidations and mergers are a part of our economy, but  we need rules of the road to level the playing field, to help small  businesses and startups to compete, and to drive innovation. This is  exactly why we need net neutrality.   Net neutrality protections prevented internet service providers from  blocking, slowing, or prioritizing web traffic for their own financial  gain. Without net neutrality, we could be subject to a two-tiered  internet. Without net neutrality, large corporations, which keep  getting larger and larger, can pay for a fast lane and buy the power to  slow down or to block content. Without net neutrality, consumers, small  businesses, and startups can be forced into the slow lane. Simply put,  net neutrality keeps America competitive.   Unfortunately, net neutrality is under attack by the Trump  administration. In December, the FCC voted to repeal crucial net  neutrality protections, despite the fact that 86 percent of Americans  wanted the rules to stay in place. The decision to scrap these net  neutrality protections is anti-consumer, anti-innovation, and anti- competitive. It disadvantages small businesses, startups, and families  all across our country.   While the FCC vote to repeal net neutrality rules is over, we are  still here in the Senate fighting. In fact, we are closer than ever to  reinstating the rules of the road that will keep the internet free,  open, and competitive.   Fifty Senators, including the entire Democratic caucus, have signed a  petition that would force a vote on legislation that would reinstate  these crucial protections. With 51 votes, we could overturn the FCC's  original repeal and move one step closer to restoring fairness.   Students, artists, advocates, entrepreneurs, and other visionaries  who could be inventing the future and creating the next big thing could  once again be on an equal playing field with multinational corporations  when it comes to using the internet.   We need net neutrality to keep our economy dynamic, growing, and  innovative. We need net neutrality to keep our startups and small  businesses competitive.   Five months ago, I stood here in this Chamber urging the FCC to  abandon their dangerous vote. Now I stand here urging my colleagues to  reverse this dangerous and disastrous decision.   We have the power to do it, and we must. We need one more vote.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today I wish to honor a lifelong  champion of the American labor movement, Mr. Charles Hall, director of  the United Auto Workers Region 1, on the occasion of his retirement  from the UAW. As a member of the U.S. Senate, it is both my privilege  and honor to recognize Mr. Hall for his lifetime of service and  contributions that have strengthened our community and State.   Chuck Hall has been a tireless advocate for his UAW brothers and  sisters throughout his career. He joined the UAW as a member of Local 3  when he began working at Chrysler's Winfield Foundry in Detroit, MI, in  1972. There, he worked in the inspections and heat-treat departments.  In 1977, Chuck accepted a job in timekeeping at Huber Foundry in  amalgamated UAW Local 889. He continued to work both there and at  Chrysler's Dodge main plant until it closed in 1980. He then returned  to work at the Winfield Foundry, where he worked until 1983 and was  also recalled to the timekeeping position.   In 1987, Chuck accepted a position at Chrysler corporate payroll and  in 1991 was elected as chief steward of his unit. Seven years later, he  was voted unit financial secretary and appointed civil rights  chairperson for his local. Shortly thereafter in 2001, Chuck was  elected as financial secretary for Local 889. He was voted to serve as  a delegate to the UAW constitutional convention in 2002 and served on  the credentials committee.   In February 2005, Chuck was appointed to the UAW international staff  and assigned to Region 1. In the beginning of 2010, he was named the  Region 1 assistant director on the recommendation of then--Region 1  director Joseph Peters. Chuck was elected director of UAW Region 1 at  the UAW's 35th constitutional convention on June 16, 2010, in Detroit,  MI. During his term, Chuck has served Region 1 and all of organized  labor with honor, integrity, and selflessness.   Chuck has spent his career and life in support of his community,  organized labor, and civil rights. He currently serves on the boards of  the Economic Alliance of Michigan, United Way for Southeastern  Michigan, Community  [[Page S2592]]  Caring, Delta Dental of Michigan, Care House, and is a member of the  Coalition of Black Trade Unionists and a lifelong member of the NAACP.   Chuck has spent his career in service to others, his UAW brothers and  sisters, his community, and his always growing family. I ask my  colleagues to join me today in honoring Mr. Charles Hall for his many  contributions to Michigan, the organized labor movement, and his  leadership at the United Auto Workers Union. I wish Chuck and his  family health and happiness in the years ahead.                            ____________________
