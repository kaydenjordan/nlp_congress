 Mr. Speaker, it has been a difficult week in northern  Illinois. A little over a week ago, torrential rains fell on Wisconsin  and northern Illinois. Four Illinois counties have been named disaster  areas: Lake County, McHenry County, Kane County, and Cook County.   As difficult as it is, it is an incredibly impressive thing to visit  these communities, particularly Algonquin, Port Barrington, and Fox  River Grove, among others, all in the Sixth Congressional District.  What you will witness is literally hundreds of volunteers following  through and filling thousands of bags of sand to help their neighbors.   Municipal employees, first responders, local leaders, the Governor of  Illinois, and members of the Illinois delegation have all come together  in order to meet our neighbors' needs at this time.   For those of you who are people of faith, I ask that you would pray  for these families as they are going through this difficult time. Also,  I commend those at home who have lent a hand.                            ____________________
