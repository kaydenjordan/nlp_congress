 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the University  of Michigan football team for winning the Big Ten championship.   This past weekend, the Wolverines capped off their dominant regular  season with a Big Ten title, earning themselves the number one rank in  the country and a trip to the coveted football playoffs.   However, this season for the Wolverines has been characterized by  more than just victories on the field. This program has a saying:  ``Those who stay will be champions.''   The team may be champions and are champions on the field, but they  will also be champions off the field and forever in their personal  lives.   This team faced challenges at every level with national ridicule of  their program and their coach, Coach Harbaugh, yet they persisted. The  young men of Team 144 took every bump in stride and held onto the words  of former head coach, Bo Schembechler, and they took those words to  heart: The team, the team, the team.   Team 144 is an embodiment of what it means to work as a team and  overcome adversity both on and off the field. We are so proud of these  young men and Coach Harbaugh and look forward to cheering them on in  the playoffs. Congratulations, Team 144, and Go Blue.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Foxx for yielding time.   I want to remind the American people that every time someone says the  government pays, the government will pay, it is not the government  because the government doesn't produce anything.   When they refer to the government, they refer to you, the American  taxpayer, will pay. The government doesn't pay. The American taxpayer  pays.   I want to clear that up just to make sure every time we hear the  government will pay, that is really the hardworking American people.  The government is just choosing how they spend the American taxpayers'  money.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this H.J. Res. 88, a Congressional  Review Act resolution of disapproval I introduced to block President  Biden's extreme student loan giveaway.   This new regulation, ironically dubbed the SAVE plan, is the most  expensive regulation in our Nation's history and is a backdoor attempt  to ram the administration's socialist free college fantasy down the  throats of hardworking taxpayers. It is their money.   According to the Penn Wharton Budget Model, this plan will cost as  much as $559 billion over the next decade, far exceeding the price tag  of the President's illegal student loan bailout ruled unconstitutional  by the Supreme Court.   Further, the Biden administration's plan would completely ruin our  postsecondary education financing system, putting higher costs on  taxpayers who never attended college in the first place.   I can't buy a house. I choose not to buy a house, but my neighbor  chooses to buy a house, and then I get to foot the bill. That is what  this administration is asking us to sign up for unconstitutionally.   Experts from across the political spectrum agree that Biden's income- driven repayment plan makes repayment the exception instead of the  norm.   Just 2 in 10 undergraduate borrowers will fully repay their loans,  and the average student will pay roughly half of what is borrowed from  taxpayers in the first place.   Not only does this plan shift the cost of loans from the borrower,  the person who actually took out the loan, it shifts the cost to the  person who never took the loan out to begin with, the hardworking  taxpayer.   It also will make college more expensive. Under the President's plan,  colleges will continue to increase prices and force students to  actually have to borrow more that they don't need to repay, knowing  that this is ultimately the hardworking taxpayers who will foot  the bill.    The Congressional Budget Office even estimates that the SAVE plan  will increase student borrowing by $100 billion over the next decade.  Increasing costs by $100 billion--I am not sure what is saved.   In other words, the President is forcing through the most expensive  regulation in history, increasing prices to attend college--well, that  doesn't make any sense--and then telling taxpayers, many of them who  didn't attend college, or if they already did attend college, they get  to pay off their loans and somebody else's loans. They need to  subsidize the ones who went to college even if they didn't go to  college. This is unfair and unconstitutional.   The Biden administration is more concerned with scoring political  points with his base through executive rule than actually fixing the  student loan issue.   Republicans actually have a plan, one that is fiscally responsible  like the FAIR Act that I introduced with Representative Owens and  Chairman Foxx, that would actually fix the Democrat-created problems  with our loan repayment system.   President Biden has attempted to write off as much as $1 trillion of  student loans since taking office without congressional approval.   It is clear that President Biden and the unelected bureaucrats he has  put in power have no respect for the hardworking taxpayers that he is  forcing to foot the bill time and time again.   This administration has ignored the will of Congress and the Supreme  Court, I might add, in his radical free college approach.   The Supreme Court said enough. The Education and Workforce Committee  said enough. Now it's time for the House to say enough.   I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.J. Res. 88,  reaffirm Congress' constitutional power of the purse, and defend  taxpayers across the country.
