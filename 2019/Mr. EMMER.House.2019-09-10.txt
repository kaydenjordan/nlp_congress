 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Father Columba  Stewart for being named the 2019 Jefferson Lecturer in the Humanities  by the National Endowment for the Humanities.   During my time in Congress I have had the honor of meeting with  Father Columba Stewart in his role as the executive director of the  Hill Museum & Manuscript Library at Saint John's University in  Minnesota's Sixth Congressional District.   During these meetings I learned about his work rescuing religious  heritage from sites across the world and the incredible mission he has  carried out to preserve the religious art, literature, and cultural  artifacts for the preservation of our shared history.   Father Stewart's work has taken him to war-torn countries, which  earned him the moniker ``the monk who saves manuscripts from ISIS'' by  The Atlantic magazine. He has dedicated the last 15 years to finding  and preserving the important religious documentation that built our  world history.   Thank you, Father Columba for all your great work and  congratulations.                  Recognizing Minnesota Recovery Connection     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Minnesota  Recovery Connection. September is National Recovery Month, but all year  long they strive to support care and provide the resources needed for  individuals to find freedom from addiction and remain in long-term  recovery.   Minnesota Recovery Connection's mission is to strengthen the recovery  community through peer-to-peer support, public education, and advocacy.  They work to eliminate the stigma that prevents treatment, and this  month it is important to remind everyone that recovery is possible.   Every year Minnesota Recovery Connection hosts Walk for Recovery,  which is an important event to bring people together from all over the  State to celebrate long-term recovery. It is the largest all-recovery  gathering in Minnesota.   Minnesota Recovery Connection, thank you for the work you do to  support long-term recovery for individuals struggling with addiction.  Thank you for being there for everyone in our community and for  bringing people together to celebrate recovery.                         Recognizing Amanda Lawrence     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Amanda Lawrence  of St. Cloud, Minnesota. This year at the age of 22, and after only 3  years of training, she has earned the coveted title of Champion of  Champions from the International Powerlifting Federation.   During her debut at the 2019 World Classic Powerlifting Championship  in Helsingborg, Sweden, she broke world records for the squat and  deadlift. Amanda's discipline and commitment to train and compete make  her a champion. We understand that Amanda is on her way to the U.S.A.  Powerlifting Raw Nationals on October 19 in Lombard, Chicago.   Good luck in Chicago, Amanda. You have made your community so proud  already.                Recognizing Brigadier General Johanna Clyborne     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Brigadier General  Johanna Clyborne for earning the rank of major general and becoming the  first female two-star general in Minnesota's National Guard.   For 30 years, Brigadier General Clyborne has risen through the ranks  and served her country with distinction. Incredibly, she did this while  having a family, earning a law degree, and becoming a successful  attorney. The example she has set for other women in the military and  beyond is a legacy to be proud of. I was honored to have Brigadier  General Clyborne participate on a panel for our annual Young Women in  Leadership Program for high school students in Minnesota. Her  leadership and life experience inspired not only the participants, but  me and my staff, as well.   Congratulations Brigadier General Clyborne on your outstanding  achievement. Thank you for your decades of service to our Nation and  thanks for being such a great role model for young women. We are lucky  to have individuals like you devoted to the safety and security of our  Nation.                           Recognizing Kathy Coles     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Kathy Coles of  Otsego, Minnesota. Kathy recently earned her eighth degree dan black  belt in Song Moo Kwan tae kwon do, which makes her the first female  grand master in the world after nearly 38 years in martial arts.   This is an amazing achievement, especially considering the  perseverance required. Each increased degree in black belt rank takes  roughly the same number of years to achieve. For example, a second  degree would take approximately 2 years, a third degree 3 years. Kathy  plans to test for and earn her ninth degree, which should take about  8\1/2\ years.   Congratulations, Kathy, on doing what no other woman has done, and  good luck on earning your ninth degree dan black belt.                            ____________________
