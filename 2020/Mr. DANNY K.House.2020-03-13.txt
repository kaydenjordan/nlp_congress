 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support  of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act which is designed to put  families first, protect and stabilize our economy, and provide  Americans with assurance that this House has their needs and interests  at the top of our priority concerns.   I support this measure because--during this period of uncertainty--it  helps provide critical paid sick and family leave for workers affected  by this public health crisis.   Approximately 80 million workers aged 16 and older are paid hourly,  which means they typically lack paid sick and family leave.   Around 75 percent of workers live paycheck to paycheck.   These benefits will help cover employees who are sick, quarantined,  or caring for loved ones who must remain at home.   If a worker is furloughed, laid off, or exhausts their paid leave, it  provides enhanced unemployment benefits and flexibility in eligibility  requirements to help.   The bill provides free testing to determine who is affected.   It provides substantial dollars to nutrition for low-income  individuals--including pregnant women, mothers with young children,  food banks, students receiving free and reduced lunch whose schools  have closed, and seniors.   It safeguards Medicare benefits and payments, protects frontline  health care workers, and directs special attention to the hardest hit  communities.   I am pleased to support this bill because it is an important step by  our country's leaders to say to the American people that we've got your  back. We are not done. This House will take further action when needed  to help our residents weather this crisis.
