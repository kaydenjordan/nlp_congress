 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R.  299, the blue water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act.   Mr. Speaker, this is really a great day in the United States  Congress, Mr. Speaker, and a great day for our heroes, our blue water  Navy veterans. This important piece of legislation will enable blue  water Navy veterans to receive the compensation benefits they have  earned and deserve.   In 2002, the VA unjustly removed the disability eligibility to almost  100,000 veterans who served in the territorial seas of Vietnam during  the Vietnam war. This bill restores the presumption of service  connection for those suffering from diseases that have been linked to  Agent Orange.   Our Nation's heroes have answered the call to protect the liberties  we enjoy on a daily basis. Today it is our turn to answer the call and  assist our veterans in return. I urge my colleagues to support this  very important bill.   I want to thank Chairman Roe and Representative Valadao for leading  the charge and not giving up. I know we didn't agree on the pay-for  initially. Chairman Roe did not give up. He worked tirelessly on behalf  of our veterans. I appreciate it so very much.   Mr. Speaker, I am so proud to serve on this committee. Let's pass  this good bill and get it to the Senate.                                time  1700
