 Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge all of my colleagues  in Congress to fulfill our obligation, not just to the people of our  districts, but to the people and the economy of our Nation.   Suspending and raising the debt limit simply lets our government pay  our bills. It is a very simple responsibility that has been done 78  times since 1960, including 49 times under Republican administrations,  and that includes three times during the Trump administration.   We raise the debt ceiling because we have to take into account the  spending that we have already committed to, including this time, where  97 percent of the spending was done during the Trump administration.   If my colleagues are concerned with fiscal responsibility, they  should know that breaching the debt ceiling will raise borrowing costs  and add hundreds of billions of dollars to our debt.   Failure to act on the debt ceiling will not just result in economic  catastrophe. It will affect every American family, as borrowing costs  and unemployment will rise and markets will crash.   Provoking such a financial crisis through such a sovereign default  would be self-sabotage, and it is flirting with brazen  irresponsibility. We are better than that. Let's act responsibly, do  our job, and raise the debt ceiling.
