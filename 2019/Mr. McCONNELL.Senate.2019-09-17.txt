 The American people deserve for the Federal Government  to spend their money in a considered, deliberate fashion, and until  very recently, we have been on a track to conduct a smooth, regular  appropriations process for this year.   More than a month ago, leaders in both parties, in both Chambers, and  at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue all agreed to terms that had been  negotiated by the Speaker of the House and the President's team. It  specified topline funding levels and put guardrails around the  appropriations process to keep out poison pills and all of our other  disagreements.   So yesterday, to keep us on track, I began the process to advance the  first set of appropriations bills. The next step is a vote tomorrow to  begin consideration of a package of House-passed funding bills that  Speaker Pelosi grouped together. They include several of the domestic  funding bills along with the legislation to fund the Department of  Defense. There should be no reason for Democrats to vote against this  first procedural step.   As Chairman Shelby and our committee colleagues continue to process  Senate legislation, proceeding to this floor action will help to keep  us on track toward passing as many of the 12 bills as possible this  month before we turn to a temporary continuing resolution.   So it has been distressing to hear troubling signals from the  Democratic side. We have heard that they may choose to filibuster the  Defense funding bill. They may block the very increase of defense  funding that they all just agreed to a month ago.   Progress on our shared priorities, good faith cooperation in areas of  disagreement--it seems all of this may be taking a backseat to a  familiar litany of partisan stumbling blocks. My Democratic colleagues  seem eager to bog down the funding process with all their outstanding  disagreements with the President, in other words, taking exactly the  kind of partisan approach we had successfully avoided last year and in  which both sides pledged just last month--just a month ago--to avoid  this time as well.   A couple of weeks ago, everyone at the table seemed to understand  that the world was too dangerous to leave funding for our military  vulnerable to poison pill riders or political copouts. I wish Democrats  would keep bearing that in mind today.   So whatever rationale my colleagues across the aisle may offer for  these new disruptions, let's get one thing straight: Holding defense  funding hostage for political gain is a losing strategy, not only for  Members of this body, not only for the appropriations process, but a  losing strategy for the safety and strength of our Nation.   As partisanship bogs us down here in Washington, Moscow and Beijing  are not exactly slowing down to wait for us. Our two most capable  great-power adversaries are expanding their own capabilities and  modernizing their forces by the day.   In the current international system, delivering on our promises to  America's men and women in uniform is not  [[Page S5500]]  a simple matter of routine maintenance on equipment. If we would like  the U.S. military of the future to remain the world's preeminent  fighting force, then, the stakes are much higher. As Russia rattles its  saber and develops weapons such as hypersonic cruise missiles and quiet  submarines, we need to continue funding for research and development of  our own cutting-edge capabilities.   We have to provide for the modernization of infrastructure and update  defenses against cyber threats so that China's ever-bolder meddling in  this domain cannot bring about the cyber hegemony it craves. We cannot  turn our back on our interests and partners in the broader Middle East.  In Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, and beyond, we face ongoing  terrorist threats. Iran's violent aggression certainly highlights the  need for vigilance and for strength. All of this is needlessly more  difficult if we don't fund the military's modernization and readiness.  The stakes are too high for us to fail.   We cannot afford to abdicate our responsibility to deliver timely  funding to the critical priorities of the Federal Government, least of  all to the men and women in uniform who keep us safe. So I would urge  each of my colleagues to engage in this process, honor our agreement  that we made just 1 month ago--just a month ago--and keep us on track  to deliver for our country.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.
