 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition of the so-called  Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act. I agree with the chairman of the  full committee that we don't want to take away Second Amendment rights  from our veterans. In fact, our veterans have the skills and  understanding of how to handle firearms. I think about this as a  doctor, though, who has served veterans and who has worked in the VA  system.   We have an epidemic on our hands right now. Every day, 20 veterans  commit suicide. That is 20 too many. As someone who has sat in the exam  room and listened to these veterans, if there is any evidence or risk  of suicidal ideations, if there is any risk of that, I  [[Page H2107]]  don't want to take doctors out of this process, and that is what I am  worried about here. My first job is to do no harm and to do good and  help protect these veterans.   Two out of three veterans who commit suicide do so with a firearm. We  have got to prevent this. This is an epidemic, and it is a national  crisis, and we know gun suicides are preventible.   When we see those risks, I want to make sure I, as a doctor, have the  ability to act and protect that veteran. We need to address this  problem like the public health issue that it is. We need to continue to  allow doctors to report the risks when they see them. It makes their  patients safer, their communities safer, and it is the right thing to  do.   I would love to work with my colleague, a fellow doctor and the  chairman of the full committee, on making sure we protect our veterans.
