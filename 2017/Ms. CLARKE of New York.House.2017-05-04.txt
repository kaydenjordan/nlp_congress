 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong  opposition to the American Health Care Act. This dangerous and  destructive bill leaves 24 million Americans without coverage. It will  cause the uninsured rate for my district in Brooklyn, New York, to  skyrocket to over 12 percent and leaves over 400,000 Brooklynites in my  district without coverage.   Because of the severe cuts to Medicaid, this bill will also put  people in the terrible position of having to choose between being able  to eat, being able to obtain life-sustaining medication, or visiting  their doctor.   Which one do you, Mr. Speaker, suggest they choose?   For most Americans, Medicaid benefits are not the end goal but,  rather, provide temporary support. For seniors, Medicaid can mean the  difference between nursing home care and dying alone.   I urge my colleagues to consider the harmful and deadly real-life  impact of this legislation, and I vehemently oppose it. I ask that we  resist this cynical reverse Robin Hood sham that takes from the poor  and gives to the rich.   As President Lincoln said: ``You can fool some of the people all of  the time, and all of the people some of the time, but you can't fool  all of the people all of the time.'' This is a sham, and we need to  vote it down.
