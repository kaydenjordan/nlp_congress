 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this is an unusual measure that is being brought forward  under unusual circumstances. To begin with, this measure would, believe  it or not, empower our Federal legislature to undo virtually every  regulation submitted to the Congress since mid-June of last year  through the end of 2016 last year. The bill accomplishes this--every  regulation--by authorizing Congress to disapprove these rules through a  single joint resolution, thereby depriving Members to consider the  merits of each individual regulation. This presents a number of  problems.                                time  1345    As the administration has stated, with a threat of veto of an  identical bill that was considered last November, the legislation  ``would create tremendous regulatory uncertainty, potentially impose  additional costs on businesses, and represent a step backwards for  applying sound regulatory principles to protect public health, safety,  the environment, and other critical aspects of society.''   This, in my view, is a cynical way of trying to legislate. For those  concerned about the continued improvement of clean air and clean water,  if we care about the safety of the toys we give our children, if we  care about the environment, then we must oppose this bill.   I urge my colleagues to join me. There hasn't been any deliberative  process on the bill recently. It is amazing to me that we have such  opposition to the bill. It would be overwhelming to put in the over 150  labor organizations, consumer organizations, environmental  organizations, and others who have openly asked us to oppose this bill.   If that isn't enough, we have the business community itself in  opposition. The American Sustainable Business Council, which represents  over 200,000 businesses--and I have a partial list of them--also  opposes this measure. It is one of the rare instances in which I have  brought to the floor legislation that is opposed by both labor and by  business as well.   It is a little bit of an insult that this bill is being considered,  on top of that, under a closed rule. There can be no amendments to this  measure.   I am in a state of surprise that on the second day of a new Congress  we would come forward with a measure that could potentially jeopardize  public health and safety in so many different ways.   I think that the opposition to this measure is so overwhelming that I  am surprised that without hearings, without an opportunity for  amendment, we are now considering a measure that has this much  opposition.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from Consumer Reports  dated January 3, 2017.                                               Consumer Reports,                                    Washington, DC, January 3, 2017.      U.S. House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: Consumer Reports and its policy and       mobilization arm, Consumers Union, strongly urge you to vote       no on H.R. 21, the so-called ``Midnight Rules Relief Act.''       This bill would severely undermine accountability to the       public regarding important protections and safeguards.        Although the rules targeted by this legislation were       finalized relatively recently, many have been under       development for several years. Consumers Union has provided       public comment on several of these regulations that were       designed to protect consumers against unsafe products,       dishonest business dealings, and other hazards in the       marketplace that place their health, safety, or well-being at       risk. Agency experts carefully examined these hazards and       considered various alternative approaches to address them.       They sought input and guidance from businesses, consumer       organizations, outside scientific and legal experts, and the       public at  [[Page H76]]       large, and ultimately developed final rules, explaining       publicly the basis and rationale for the adopted approach.        The federal law known as the Congressional Review Act (CRA)       already permits a regulation carefully developed over many       years to be erased by Congress, in a rushed process that does       not reflect the same level of expertise or careful       consideration. Congress could even rescind a rule for reasons       that might be based not on any broader interests of the       public, but on the narrower, private special interests of       those seeking to avoid having appropriate obligations imposed       on their profit-making activities.        The potential for the CRA to be employed in the service of       special interests is at least somewhat held in check by the       fact that the law currently requires separate congressional       action for erasing each regulation. A regulation considered       for erasure under the CRA must be brought to the House and       Senate in its own separate resolution, given its own debate       and vote, and sent to the President for its own signature or       veto. All officials involved in considering whether to erase       the regulation and its protections are thus put on record,       and can be held accountable for their positions and the       consequences. Perhaps for this reason, there has only been       one regulation rescinded under the CRA in its 20-year       history.        This important accountability check would be removed under       the ``Midnight Rules Relief Act.'' By allowing erasure of       multiple regulations en bloc, this bill would enable Members       of Congress and the President to evade public accountability       for what Gould be ill-considered, politically motivated       decisions that result in devastating consequences. Under the       bill, no Member would ever have to be on record regarding any       specific regulation being erased. In fact, any Member who       actually wants to cast a more selective vote, to erase       certain regulations but not others, would be unable to do so.        We are somewhat encouraged that the House Majority, after       initially acting behind closed doors to weaken the Office of       Congressional Ethics, has reversed course in light of major       concerns raised about the impact on congressional       accountability. We urge all Members to also recognize the       damaging effects that this bill would have on accountability       and on the ability of the American public to trust their       elected representatives. We strongly urge you to vote no on       the ``Midnight Rules Relief Act.''            Sincerely,      Laura MacCleery,        Vice President, Consumer Policy and Mobilization Consumer       Reports.      George P. Slover,        Senior Policy Counsel, Consumers Union.      William C. Wallace,        Policy Analyst, Consumers Union.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Nadler), a senior colleague, to speak on the measure before  us.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1  minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Johnson), a distinguished member of the Committee on the  Judiciary.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to thank the distinguished gentleman from California for  pointing out how innocent this measure is, and I am astounded by his  feeling that regulations shouldn't be examined one by one. Under this  measure, 61 regulations could be considered en bloc. To me, just trying  to put together two regulations to revoke them would be very, very hard  to handle.   What we are talking about here is a bill that would provide special  interests with yet another opportunity to block critical lifesaving  regulations, and I want to say I have never had so much opposition to a  bill brought to my attention before. 150 environmental organizations,  consumer organizations, and labor organizations have urged the Members  of this body to oppose H.R. 21. It is incredible. And then not only are  workers and consumers against this measure as well as  environmentalists, businesspeople are against it as well.   I feel like there is some missing part to this thing. The American  Sustainable Business Council has over 200,000 businesses. So here is  labor and commerce combined, urging Congress not to do this on the  second day of a new Congress with all the challenges that are before  us, and he says it wouldn't create any problems. It would be okay to  put in 1 or 2 or 3 or 5 or 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 or 60. This is  incredible. It is not that we are working so hard that we don't have  time to examine each one on a particular basis.                                time  1415    Can you imagine this Congress trying to block regulations which would  be offered in one bill that could be over 60 different regulations? I  mean, it is unthinkable. It is not very practical at all.   When we talk about meat labeling regulations and then in another  paragraph or another section there would be standards for school lunch  nutrition, they would be combined. My friend from California would say,  well, that is no problem. We will take them separately, but they will  all come in the same package.   So if you wanted to examine all of these things individually, we  could have an instance where the whole Congress could be consumed for  weeks or for months trying to figure out why they should block all of  these important and sensible safeguards.   Business and labor are joined with us, and, to me, it is beyond  comprehension for us to be concerned about not taking them up one at a  time. This is worse than a conservative point of view, which I haven't  found myself often agreeing with. But just to say let's have unlimited  numbers of these blocking provisions all into one is beyond my  comprehension.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.  Cohen), a distinguished member of our committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1  minute.    Mr. Speaker, how much time remains on each side?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Scott), who, up until recently, was a very active member  of the House Judiciary Committee. He is now the ranking member on the  Education and the Workforce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Castor).    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a CRS Report that  highlights the fact that it would be permissible under this proposed  bill that as many as 61 regulations could be bundled into one package  and blocked by this bill.                                 Congressional Research Service,                                                    January 3, 2017.                                 Memorandum       Subject: ``Major'' Obama Administration Rules Potentially           Eligible to be Overturned under the Congressional Review           Act in the 115th Congress.      From: Maeve P. Carey, Specialist in Government Organization           and Management; Christopher M. Davis, Analyst on Congress           and the Legislative Process; Casey Burgat, Research           Assistant.        This memorandum lists ``major'' rules issued by federal       agencies under the Barack Obama Administration that are       potentially subject to consideration under the procedures of       the Congressional Review Act (CRA) in the 115th Congress.       This is an updated version of a general distribution       memorandum released by CRS on November 17, 2016, and       previously updated on December 6, 2016.                  Background on the Congressional Review Act         The CRA is a tool that Congress may use to overturn a rule       issued by a federal agency, including, in some cases, rules       issued in a previous session of Congress and by a previous       President. The CRA requires agencies to report on their       rulemaking activities to Congress and provides Congress with       a special set of procedures under which to consider       legislation to overturn those rules. The CRA, which was       enacted in 1996, was largely intended to assert control over       agency rulemaking by establishing a special set of expedited       or ``fast track'' legislative procedures for this purpose,       primarily in the Senate.        Of the approximately 73,000 final rules that have been       submitted to Congress since the legislation was enacted in       1996, the CRA has been used to disapprove one rule: the       Occupational Safety and Health Administration's November 2000       final rule on ergonomics, which was overturned using the CRA       in March 2001. The primary reason the CRA has overturned one       rule in the 20 years since its enactment is that under most       circumstances, it is likely that a President would veto such       a resolution in order to protect rules developed under his       own administration, and it may also be difficult for Congress       to muster the two-thirds vote in both houses needed to       overturn the veto. However, under a specific set of       circumstances--a turnover in party control of the White       House, particularly a turnover in which the incoming       President shares a party affiliation with a majority in both       houses of Congress--the CRA is more likely to be used       successfully. The March 2001 rejection of the ergonomics rule       was the result of that set of circumstances. Similar       circumstances will take place in 2017 after the start of the       115th Congress and after President-elect Donald J. Trump is       sworn into office.                           CRA ``Reset'' Mechanism         Section 801(d) of the CRA provides that, if Congress       adjourns its annual session sine die less than 60 legislative       days in the House of Representatives or 60 session days in       the Senate after a rule is submitted to it, then the periods       to submit and act on a disapproval resolution ``reset'' in       their entirety in the next session of Congress'' The purpose       of this provision is to ensure that both houses of Congress       have sufficient time to consider disapproving rules submitted       during this end-of-session ``carryover period.'' This       provision applies in every session of Congress, but it is of       particular relevance in sessions of Congress that coincide       with presidential transitions. This provision allows, for a       limited time period, a new Congress to consider a joint       resolution disapproving a rule issued late in the previous       administration. If introduced and considered at the proper       time, such a joint resolution cannot be filibustered in the       Senate.        The projected second-session meeting schedules of the House       and Senate issued by each chamber's majority leader may be       used to estimate the date in 2016 after which final rules       submitted to Congress will be subject to the renewed review       periods in 2017 described above. The estimated start of the       reset period for all rules was determined by counting back       from the projected sine die adjournment in the respective       chambers--60 days of session in the Senate and 60 legislative       days in the House--then taking the earlier of the two dates.        Under this calculation, CRS estimates that agency final       rules submitted to Congress on or after June 13, 2016, will       be subject to renewed review periods in 2017 by a new       President and a new Congress. CRS day count estimates are       unofficial and non-binding; the House and Senate       Parliamentarians are the sole definitive arbiters of the       operation of the CRA mechanism and should be consulted if a       formal opinion is desired.        ``Major'' Obama Administration Rules Potentially Eligible for                    Consideration under the CRA in 2017         Using this estimated reset date of June 13, 2016, CRS       compiled a list of major rules that would fall under this       reset period--i.e., rules that could be overturned in the       115th Congress using the CRA.        Table 1 lists the major rules CRS has identified as of       January 3, 2017, that could be eligible for the reset       mechanism. To identify these rules, CRS used a two-step       process. First, CRS consulted the Government Accountability       Office's (GAO's) federal rules database to identify major       rules that were issued during calendar year 2016 and posted       on GAO's website as of January 3, 2017. Second, CRS used       LIS's ``Executive Communications'' database to identify when       these rules were received in Congress.    Major Rules Issued by the Obama Administration That Are Potentially    Eligible for Disapproval Under the Congressional Review Act in the                               115th Congress          major rules listed on gao's website as of january 3, 2017         Title of Rule (As Published in Federal Register) and RIN       Numbers are as follows:        Exemptions To Facilitate Intrastate and Regional Securities       Offerings, 3235-AL80; Investment Company Liquidity Risk       Management Programs, 3235-AL61; Retention of EB-1, EB-2, and       EB-3 Immigrant Workers and Program Improvements Affecting       High-Skilled NonImmigrant Workers, 1615-ACO5; Walking-Working       Surfaces and Personal Protective Equipment (Fall Protection       Systems), 1216-AB80; Waste Prevention, Production Subject to       Royalties, and Resource Conservation, 1004-AE14; Investment       Company Swing Pricing, 3235-AL61; Establishing a More       Effective Fair Market Rent System; Using Small Area Fair       Market Rents in the Housing Choice Voucher Program Instead of       the Current 50th Percentile FMRs, 2501-AD74; Medicare       Program; Revisions to Payment Policies Under the Physician       Fee Schedule and Other Revisions to Part B for CY 2017;       Medicare Advantage Bid Pricing Data Release; Medicare       Advantage and Part D Medical Loss Ratio Data Release;       Medicare Advantage Provider Network Requirements; Expansion       of Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program Model; Medicare       Shared Savings Program Requirements, 0938-AS81.
