 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   S. 7, the VAWA Technical Amendment Act of 2022, makes a very small  technical amendment to the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization  that was signed into law in March of this year.   The Violence Against Women Act provides resources to law enforcement  and others to address the needs of those who have survived domestic  violence, sexual assault, sex trafficking, and other crimes against  women. S. 7 ensures that Native Hawaiian survivors will also have  access to programs and resources provided under the act.   Currently, the Attorney General is directed to make Violence Against  Women Act grants to assist Indian Tribes. This bill makes Native  Hawaiian communities eligible for the same grants.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in October 2020, the Trump administration created the  Center for Countering Human Trafficking, or CCHT, to consolidate all  human trafficking-related DHS components into one law enforcement  operations center. This bill would codify this operations center within  DHS. Additionally, it would transfer the resources of the Blue Campaign  to the CCHT.                                time  1815    The Blue Campaign is a national public awareness campaign to educate  the public, law enforcement, and others about the indicators of human  trafficking and how to respond to potential cases.   Unfortunately, the Committee on the Judiciary has held no meetings on  the CCHT or any of the various programs it operates. We should be  evaluating the requirements and consequences of any piece of  legislation in the committee of jurisdiction before it is brought to  the floor. This is common sense.   Members should have an opportunity to ask important questions and  offer amendments to the bill before it is brought to the floor for a  vote. Unfortunately, that didn't happen here.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   S. 2899 requires the Director of the Bureau of Prisons to evaluate  the security camera, radio, and public address systems in all BOP  facilities and to submit a report to Congress with a plan to address  the deficiencies.   Once the report is submitted, BOP has 3 years to implement the system  upgrades as detailed in the report. The bill also requires the BOP to  submit annual progress reports to Congress on the implementation of the  submitted plan.   In 2016, the Office of the Inspector General at the Department of  Justice published a report identifying major problems with the BOP's  security cameras. These problems included security cameras with blind  spots, cameras that were inoperable, cameras with poor video quality,  and other serious deficiencies.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Keller).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 5230, the Help Find the Missing Act, authorizes the  National Missing and Unidentified Persons System.   The National Missing and Unidentified Persons System was created by  the Department of Justice 15 years ago to provide a missing persons and  unidentified remains database that the public can contribute to and  access.   S. 5230 would connect the National Missing and Unidentified Persons  System with the FBI's National Crime Information Center, which would  create more comprehensive missing persons and unidentified remains  databases. This would allow for a more streamlined reporting process  for law enforcement.   This bill would also require missing children be reported to the  National Missing and Unidentified Persons System. Currently, missing  children are only required to be reported to the National Crime  Information Center.   Finally, the bill would require the Department of Justice to issue  guidelines and best practices on handling missing persons and  unidentified remains cases for law enforcement, medical examiners, and  coroners to find the missing.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
