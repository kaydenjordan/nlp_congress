 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Office of the  Comptroller of the Currency's recently proposed rule to ensure fair  access to banking services.   The fair access rule is a welcomed development in a time when  political correctness and public relations pressure are driving the  Nation's largest banks' lending decisions rather than risk metrics  associated with an underlying loan.   Banks are deciding to cut off access to capital, divest their  holdings, or otherwise limit financing to legally operating businesses  just because those businesses are politically unpopular with outspoken  critics on the far extreme left. Politicizing access to capital needs  to end, and the Fair Access rule is a step in the right direction.   Mr. Speaker, the proposed rulemaking codifies longstanding principles  and OCC guidance that banks should provide access to capital and credit  based on the assessment of an individual borrower's risk as opposed to  making broad-based decisions impacting entire industries. It is guided  by fundamental principles of nondiscrimination and would ensure that  banks can't pick winners and losers in the marketplace. This rule will  have meaningful impacts on some of America's strongest industries and  the Americans they serve.    The prohibition against redlining based on race, ethnicity, or  neighborhood, regardless of an individual's qualifications and  creditworthiness, is a well-established principle in Federal law. That  prohibition and that principle should be extended to lawful  creditworthy businesses as well.   Mr. Speaker, over the last several years, we have witnessed many  cases of banks publicly committing not to do business with certain  legal companies. Some banks refuse to finance new coal-fired plants;  others have refused to provide credit for legally permissible drilling  operations; others boycotted firearms manufacturers.   But these decisions were not based on the creditworthiness of the  borrowers; they were based purely on politics.   Coal keeps the lights on. Oil and gas heat our homes and fuel our  vehicles.   Should coal or oil or gas companies be subjected to a different  lending standard just because of their public perception by a select  few? Of course not.   These industries should not be penalized simply because of the nature  of their business and private lenders' desire to placate the far left.  In fact, these are companies that provide the most affordable and  reliable forms of energy to the American people. They are being  punished only because they are politically unpopular.   Under the rule, banks can no longer make these qualitative decisions  to redline entire industries. Industries that play crucial roles in the  everyday lives of Americans deserve fair access to America's financial  system and should not be demonized as pawns in the politics of the day.   Banks are in the business of assessing, measuring, and managing  risks. Banks should be making lending decisions based on quantifiable  risks associated with a loan. If a legally operating business is a  sound credit risk by objective standards, banks should not be permitted  to cut off financing simply because the business isn't in the good  graces of certain politicians.   Many of the rule's detractors say it is an overreach by the OCC or  somehow motivated by partisan goals; but, in reality, the rule simply  implements directives under Dodd-Frank to promote fair access to  financial services and  [[Page H6055]]  fair treatment of customers. It codifies in regulation statements and  guidance from financial regulators under President Obama.   In 2014, then-Comptroller Tom Curry said to regulated banks:         You shouldn't feel that you can't bank a customer just       because they fall into a category that, on its face, appears       to carry an elevated level of risk. Higher risk categories of       customers call for stronger risk management and controls, not       a strategy of total avoidance.    Now, some critics of the OCC's rule have made the argument that it  would compromise financial stability to force lenders to extend credit  to dying industries, such as the fossil energy industry, that have no  future under leftwing policies like the Green New Deal.   Has it ever occurred to these politicians that the reason why these  fossil energy companies might face a challenging future is because of  their own policies and because of their unrelenting desire to deny them  the credit that they need to continue to operate.   Mr. Speaker, the debanking of certain legally operating industries is  one in a series of examples of corporate leaders succumbing to the  pressure of activists and far-left politicians. They have ceded the  primacy of shareholders and are now letting politics drive their  financing decisions.   Mr. Speaker, I commend Acting Comptroller Brooks on proposing this  thoughtful and timely rule of nondiscrimination. This rule will ensure  that all legal American companies have full access to the robust U.S.  financial system and the economic freedom they deserve, and it will put  an end to the misguided practice of banks playing politics with  American jobs.                            ____________________
