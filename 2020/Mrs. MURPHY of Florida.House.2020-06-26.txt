 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for  yielding to me.   Four long years have passed since a gunman walked into my community  and took the lives of 49 innocent people at the Pulse nightclub.   At that time, the events marked the largest mass shooting in this  country, and to this day, it remains one of the largest incidents of a  hate crime in our history.   Most of the victims were members of our LGBTQ community in Orlando, a  community that created Pulse to be a safe place to be themselves, a  place where hate and violence could not reach them.   It took one lone gunman to shatter that reality. But it is up to us  on this day, 4 years later, to take it back.   We owe it to those we lost to honor their memories by dedicating a  national memorial at Pulse, a memorial that reflects the same love,  acceptance, and spirit of community that embodied the victims and that  embodies the LGBTQ community at large, a place of healing for the  survivors and all those affected, a welcoming place for all those  seeking inspiration to act, to create a better, safer, and more  inclusive Nation.   By taking this important step, America is telling the world that we  will never let hate win, that we won't forget the victims, and that we  will fight to ensure no community will ever go through something like  this again.   God bless the Pulse victims and their families.
