 Mr. Speaker, this bill provides the necessary support  and direction for our national security. It also provides the necessary  support for our servicemembers' families, and I am particularly pleased  with the work completed by the Subcommittee on Readiness.   A big thank you to Ranking Member Waltz and Lamborn for their  partnership in the subcommittee and also to the staff and all the  members of the subcommittee, and particularly to Jeanine Womble, who  was the staff director in this effort.   The Readiness Subcommittee's broad scope means that we cover  everything from sustainment of weapons systems and facilities,  including the safety of the men and women, military construction,  climate change, energy, and environmental policy. While the readiness- related provisions are extensive, I would like to take a few minutes to  highlight just a few.   In line with the work over the last 2 years, we continue to address  vulnerabilities in installation and energy resiliency, both in response  to extreme weather events and to ensure the Department can continue to  accomplish its missions in the event of power disruptions. This bill  works also to mitigate the military's effect of climate change and  supports clean energy innovation, some of which you heard about just a  moment ago.   We also continue to focus on sustaining and modernizing the organic  industrial base. We cannot continue the readiness risk that neglect of  our ports, depots, shipyards, and arsenals create. This is essential to  ensuring that our state-of-the-art weapons systems can meet the  challenges of near-peer competitors, not only the first day they arrive  in the hands of the military, but in the days and years thereafter.   The health and safety of our military and civilian personnel will  continue to be a top priority. This means that we will continue to  address military housing, the PFAS contamination and mitigation issues,  and also safety.   I am proud to represent two of the key military bases, Travis and  Beale Air Force Bases and the men and women who work there.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Schakowsky for  this amendment. It is very important. This is about fairness in the  workplace. This is about the opportunity for workers to have a say in  their work life. This is about an opportunity for major companies that  want a contract with the United States Government Department of Defense  to stay neutral in any unionizing opportunity that a union may be  putting forward.   The rights of workers who support our defense industry would be  protected by this amendment, and the Department of Defense would  continue to have the flexibility in the contracting programs that they  have.   With billions of dollars that we are going to be spending as a result  of this and previous bills, let's be fair to the workers. If they want  to organize, fine. For the companies, it is time for them to be neutral  and not do the kind of practices that we have seen from companies such  as Amazon and a few others.    Mr. Speaker, Mr. Rogers well said why we should pass  this amendment.   We have played a bad game here. If it is so important, if General  McConville thinks it is so important, why didn't he fight vigorously  for it in the base budget?   Yes, the President does propose, but that proposal is a proposal that  comes from the Department, from all the various parts of the  Department, and it is put together at the White House. The President  doesn't just dream this up himself. It is, in fact, the priorities of  the Department, disciplined priorities.    The unfunded list is a game where we are being played. We are the  pawns in the game that they have. It was very well stated in the  previous opposition to this amendment.   Let's have some discipline here.   The unfunded priorities list is a way in which the Department's  various parts play us against each other and play the President. Let's  eliminate all of that.    Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am delighted by the last discussion, and I hope that  whatever eloquence I might have would be useful in this regard because  we are now debating some of the most important and profound issues that  will ever come before this Congress, as it has in the past Congresses  and in the future Congresses, and that is the role of nuclear weapons  in our lives.   Mr. Speaker, we are involved in a new nuclear arms race, and this one  is extremely expensive. But much more importantly, it is extremely  dangerous because this arms race is designed to provide weapons  delivery systems that are not observable and observation systems that  are totally unreliable in a conflict--basically the satellite systems.   So this amendment deals with one part of the triad, and that is the  ground-based missiles, some 400 or so, that are in silos in the  northern Midwest. Those are the Minuteman III missiles. They are armed,  they are ready, and the President, should there be an incident that  would cause him to make a decision about launching those missiles, has  something less than 15 minutes--probably less than 12 minutes--to make  a decision to literally end life on this planet as we know it.   Those are the use-it-or-lose-it missiles, the Minuteman III.   We have the proposal underway--a no-bid contract worth about $125  billion over the next decade or so--to replace the current Minuteman  III missiles and, quite possibly, the nuclear weapons that are on those  missiles. We don't need to do that now. The Minuteman III missiles are  viable for the next decade, almost the next two decades, if they are  maintained.   The Air Force made a decision some years ago--about 7 years ago--to  decide not to maintain them but rather to build a new missile system  that was then called the GBSD ground-based secure system--it is now  called the Sentinel--at a cost of about $125 billion in the next  decade.   This amendment simply pauses the development of that missile system,  calls for the refurbishment and maintenance of the current Minuteman  III missiles for the next decade, and at that time a decision will be  made by this Congress and future Congresses about what to do. It is  simple.   There has been a lot of talk in the last hour or two about unfunded  priorities or we ought to fund this and ought to fund that, I would  suggest to you, Mr. Speaker, that we probably have somewhere in the  range of $12 to $20 billion in the next couple of years and $120  billion in the next decade that we could easily spend on unfunded  priorities or funded priorities.   So with that, I will pause, as I would hope that the ICBM would  pause, and I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H6276]]         Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to my remaining time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Let's deal with two things here. First, with regard to the ability of  the Minuteman III to be serviceable for the next 17 years, in fact, it  has to be for the GBSD or the Sentinel to be put in place.   All the Sentinels will not arrive on day one. They will arrive year  by year, Sentinel by Sentinel, over the next 17 years. The Minuteman  IIIs will be maintained for that period of time, so it is not true that  they cannot be maintained. They, in fact, will be.   Secondly, are we talking about deterrence, or are we talking about  dominance? Do we have to have more to deter, or do we have a good  deterrence in the next decade with the Minuteman III, the submarines,  the aircraft, and the bombers of many different designs?   The fact of the matter is we have sufficient deterrence. The question  is, do we want to dominate simply with numbers? We don't need to do  that to deter, and we do have other priorities that we need to spend  money on, much of which was discussed here.   The issue for us, it seems to me, is should we delay, for a decade,  the development and placement of the Minuteman III replacement--that  is, the Sentinel. The answer is we have other things to do. We have  other priorities, and we will be quite safe enough. We will quite have  enough deterrence.   With regard to the 87-1, that is being delayed because it cannot be  developed in the near term.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, nobody has really said that we need 400.  It has never been said we need 400. Maybe we need 399. Maybe we need  even less than that.   The fact of the matter is that we have adequate deterrence without  any of these particularly very dangerous missiles because they have to  be used immediately upon threat. In 12 minutes, the President has to  make a decision.   Here is the point. We have more than enough deterrence. Now, if we  want to have more than they have, that doesn't increase the deterrence.  That just increases the cost of the number.    Mr. Speaker, the combination of the late hour together  with too much time to talk led to a really foolish discussion from my  colleague on the right.   This issue is of paramount importance to the military. I am just  going to cite three, four instances in which climate and resiliency  have impacted the military.   Let's talk about Tyndall Air Force Base. It was literally wiped off  the map by a hurricane. It would have been good to have some  coordination.   How about Camp Lejeune, another $2 billion problem, excessive rain  and flood.   Let's talk about China Lake, another $3 billion problem. We can go on  and on.   The fact of the matter is that climate changes are dramatically  affecting the military, and to have coordination from the White House  with the entire economy and the entire community of America focusing on  this issue is a direct problem that must be addressed, and the NDAA is  the place to do it.    Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   This amendment, 216, is cosponsored by Ms. Jacobs of California and  Ms. Lofgren of California, it is part of my Military Support for  Fighting Wildfires Act.   I think all of us are aware we have plenty of fires and we often do  not have enough firefighters. From time to time, the military can play  a very significant, important, and vital role in fighting fires.   This amendment essentially waives the current requirements for FEMA  and the Federal land management agencies--BLM, the Forest Service, and  the National Parks--to reimburse the Department of Defense for costs  incurred by the military during support for disaster response to major  fires.   Right now, the Economy Act of 1933 forces one government agency  requesting services from another government agency to essentially sign  a blank check for an unknown amount of money before they know the full  scope of services that may be required.   This reimbursement under the Economy Act does not cost the taxpayers  any extra money, it is an accounting between one agency and another,  trying to keep their books straight. And we have already heard enough  about the inability of the Department of Defense to keep its books  straight.   I want to make sure that Federal agencies are focusing on  firefighting and using every available government resource to  accomplish a successful fight and not have to worry about the needless  pencil-pushing back and forth between agencies, and what might  ultimately turn out to be a very significant amount of money, unknown  at the outset when the service is requested.   It is pretty simple. We are trying to make sure that we have maximum  services available. Presently, an agency that might need help from the  military might not even ask for it for fear that they might wind up  with a very, very serious account to be filled.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, enough has been said, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
