 Mr. President, it is my privilege to honor the  sesquicentennial of Missouri University of Science and Technology, as  Missourians know it, S&T.   Founded in 1870, Missouri S&T was the first technological institution  west of the Mississippi. Originally named the Missouri School of Mines  and Metallurgy, the school was primary focused on educating and  training those who would mine the mineral rich area on the eastern side  of the State.   By the 1920s, S&T had expanded into chemical, electrical, and civil  engineering, as well as physics, chemistry,  [[Page S808]]  mathematics, and geometry. After World War II, as the United States was  becoming the global leader in technological innovation, S&T stepped up  to do its part by adding graduate-level training and research. The  school was home to Missouri's first operational nuclear reactor. Across  the years, S&T has established itself as one of the premier technical  institutions in the Nation, excelling at teaching and research.   For 150 years, Missouri S&T has been providing the sons and daughters  of Missouri a close-to-home option for world-class technical education.  Congratulations on 150 years and here is to the next 150.                            ____________________
