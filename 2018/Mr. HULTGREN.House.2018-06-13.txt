 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Aurora's  Illinois Math and Science Academy as the first-ever U.S. host of the  International Student Science Fair.   This month, 35 STEM schools from 20 countries will focus particularly  on ``significantly influencing life on our planet through cooperation  and collaboration.''   IMSA began with an idea from Fermilab Director Leon Lederman and  leadership from its first president, Dr. Stephanie Pace Marshall. Its  own mission is to ignite and nurture creative, ethical, scientific  minds that advance the human condition.   IMSA knows that careers in STEM are not just about learning math and  science as isolated individuals. It is about how mastering these  subjects as a team can solve problems and improve lives, as I have seen  in the high school students that are part of my own STEM Scholars  program.   IMSA has consistently pushed students to work together in a  community, propelling their graduates to Silicon Valley and beyond.  This year's science fair is in good hands, and I congratulate IMSA on  this historic achievement                            ____________________
