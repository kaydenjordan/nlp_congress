 Mr. Speaker, I am so proud to support the  Build Back Better Act. It is time for us to pass this historic  legislation that invests in our communities, our workers, our children,  and our families, while asking the wealthiest among us, who have  benefited from our growing economy, to pay their fair share.   These investments will lower the costs of childcare, which has kept  women out of the labor force. It invests in our future workforce  through our children. It helps us tackle the climate crisis, bolsters  resilience, and creates economic and job opportunities and good-paying  jobs for millions. I could go on and on and on.   Mr. Speaker, I want to end by talking about the millions of people  who depend upon insulin, something that has been a bipartisan issue. It  is going to lower those costs to just $35 a month. That is reason  enough to pass the Build Back Better Act.
