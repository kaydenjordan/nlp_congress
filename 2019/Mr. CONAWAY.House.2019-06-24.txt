 Mr. Speaker, it is with a bittersweet heart today that I  rise to recognize my current chief of staff, Mark Williams.   Mark will finish 16 years of service with the House of  Representatives and be moving on to the private sector. He has been my  chief for 4\1/2\ years. He served, faithfully, Todd Rokita, Sam  Johnson, and myself. He is one of those quiet professionals who makes  this place work.   He is a consummate professional, and I am a better Member of Congress  because of his wise counsel, his advice, his hard work, and his  dedication to my team and our team.   I wish he and his wife, Noel; son, Nolan; and daughter, Katherine all  the best and Godspeed in this next endeavor. They will be missed.  Although we won't see them on a day-to-day basis, they are still a part  of Team Conaway and also my family.   Mr. Speaker, I wish Mark good luck. We love him.                            ____________________
