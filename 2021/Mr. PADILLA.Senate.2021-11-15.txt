 Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Veteran  Deportation Prevention and Reform Act.   This legislation would ensure that noncitizen servicemembers have  access to the information and resources they need to apply for  citizenship in the United States and avoid deportation from the country  they have served.   The Veteran Deportation Prevention and Reform Act includes important  changes to ensure that servicemembers are not removed from the United  States after leaving the military because they were never provided the  resources necessary to ensure they could adjust their status. The bill  would also protect servicemembers' spouses and children from  deportation.   Specifically, this bill would require the Department of Homeland  Security, DHS and the Department of Defense to create a program to help  ensure that servicemembers and their families have a pathway to  naturalization. The program must also include training for JAG officers  and recruiter training on the naturalization process for  servicemembers. These personnel must also work with the U.S.  Citizenship and Immigration Services Agency to ensure that all  noncitizen military servicemembers are naturalized before they leave  the service.   The bill would also create the Military Family Immigation Advisory  Committe that must provide recommendations to DHS on whether a  noncitizen who has served in the military or their family members  should be granted a stay of removal, deferred action, parole, or be  removed from the country.   ICE, CBP, and USCIS are directed to transfer case materials of  individuals in removal proceedings for individuals who are determined  to be a member of the Armed Forces, a veteran, or a covered family  member of the advisory committee. These individuals cannot be removed  until a recommendation is issued by the advisory committee.   Finally, the bill would require DHS to establish a program and  application to allow removed veterans and their family members to be  admitted back into the United States as lawful permanent residents and  would direct the Department of Justice to reopen their removal cases.   Our noncitizen servicemembers have risked their lives serving our  country.   For over a century, the United States has recognized the  contributions that noncitizens make in the military. They deserve a  clear path to citizenship for themselves and their spouses and  children.   Over the past several years, programs to help facilitate these  processes have diminished, and this lack of support from Federal  Agencies has made it more difficult for noncitizen servicemembers to  become U.S. citizens. Veterans who are unable to naturalize are at risk  of deportation if they commit certain crimes and are forced to leave  the country they served. Many of these individuals believe that they  are citizens already due to their service and are shocked they are not,  years later.   It is imperative that we work to protect our noncitizen veterans from  deportation and that we bring back those veterans who were removed from  the United States. These veterans have shown nothing but loyalty to the  United States, and they deserve to stay here, receive their benefits,  and live fulfilling lives alongside their family members.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Veteran  Deportation Prevention and Reform Act.
