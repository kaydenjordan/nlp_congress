 Mr. President, I would like to  wish Ms. Fay Brickman of Charleston, SC, a very happy and healthy 100th  birthday.   Ms. Brickman married her high school sweetheart, Jack, after he  returned from serving in World War II. They were married for 70 years  before his passing. Together, they touched the lives of countless  people in their community by generously supporting Charleston's  academic institutions and consistently devoting time to their  synagogue, Brith Shalom Beth Israel, where Fay was the president of the  sisterhood.   I would like to recognize Ms. Brickman for the impact she made on our  State and the legacy she built through her work and family. She is  blessed with six brilliant children, all of whom hold law degrees, and  11 grandchildren, who visit regularly. I wish the family a wonderful  time as they gather to celebrate Fay's 100th birthday.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I would like  to take a moment to recognize the great work of Dale Gilbert. Mr.  Gilbert served as a meteorologist for nearly 25 years at WYFF-TV, which  is a local station in Greenville, SC.   Dale Gilbert began his career at WYFF in the early 70s, becoming one  of the youngest people on the air for the network. During his time at  WYFF, he received many awards, including the South Carolina  Broadcasters Association Masters Award. Mr. Gilbert was well loved by  his community, and will be missed for the local legend that he has  become.                            ____________________
