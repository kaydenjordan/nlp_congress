 Mr. Speaker, thank you, Congresswoman Sheila Cherfilus- McCormick and Congressman Jonathan Jackson, for co-chairing tonight's  Special Order Hour.   I rise today with my colleagues of the Congressional Black Caucus to  address the recent Supreme Court ruling in Students for Fair Admissions  v. Harvard and UNC.   The Supreme Court determined in a 6-3 vote that race-based  affirmative action programs in college admissions processes violated  Title Six of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as well as the Equal  Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.   The Supreme Court's decision to strike down decades of precedent set  in the Bakke case in 1978, which gave students--regardless of their  race or ethnicity--a better chance at equal admissions to our nation's  top schools was a needless blow to America's promise of equal and fair  opportunity.   We have to be clear on what this decision means for the legacy of the  Court and what this decision will mean for race-conscious admissions  policies across our country.   By delivering a decision on affirmative action so radical as to deny  young people seeking an education equal opportunity in our education  system, the Supreme Court has thrown into question its own legitimacy.   By imposing these radical changes to college and university race- based admission policies, the Court has made clear that it does not  stand on the side of dismantling barriers to give our young people the  opportunity at a better life, which will only stand to benefit the  wealthy and well-connected.   Unfortunately, we have seen backlash to progress many times  throughout our Nation's history. During Reconstruction, we had a mere  12 years of Black achievement in policy, politics, the arts and  sciences, and education that were followed by 70 years of state- sanctioned Jim Crow.   We didn't stop fighting for equality then and we won't stop now  because too much is at stake to allow extremists to turn back the clock  on progress or to use Affirmative Action as a cultural wedge issue.   That is why the CBC is proud to work alongside our Tri-Caucus  colleagues to make clear that we will not be divided because our  Nation's diversity is our greatest strength.   I want to thank my colleagues of the CBC, including Representative  Bobby Scott, Ranking Member of the Education and the Workforce  Committee for their work on this issue and for being united in making  clear that decision does not take the responsibility off of colleges  and universities to do all they can to expand access to educational  opportunities for students coming from underrepresented communities.   The CBC is calling for colleges and universities to not only work  towards diversifying their campuses to more closely reflect America,  but also to reevaluate their legacy admissions programs because while  the Court went so far as to eliminate race-conscious admissions  practices, it did nothing about other determining factors such as  legacy status.   In fact, a lawsuit has been filed against Harvard University, saying  that the legacy admissions programs that give preferential treatment to  the children of wealthy donors and alumni discriminates against  students of color who have the academic merit to attend the school.   As such applicants with donor relationships, athletic recruitments,  employee relationships, and other special recommendations will continue  to receive preferential treatment.   Giving unequal opportunity to an education for legacy admissions  starkly contrasts the message we need to send our young people and  threatens any progress we have made in providing equal access and  diverse learning environments for students across our country.   And while no Nevada institutions of higher education implemented race  consideration in admissions, Nevadans of color who want to attend  schools out of state, like Harvard, MIT, Georgia Tech, or other  schools, will suffer as a result of this decision.   Let me be clear--our students have the merit, academic credentials,  knowledge, and drive to succeed at these schools. But we cannot turn a  blind eye to the history of our nation that has prioritized wealth and  access. At the same time, families of color have battled generations of  discrimination and racism that limited their access to quality  education and wealth building.   This decision specifically exempted military academies. Why?   Race can be a factor when police stop someone on the streets. Why?   But race cannot be a factor in deciding whether someone can pursue a  higher education. Why not?                            ____________________
