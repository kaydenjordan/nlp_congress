 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise in support of these amendments. Utah  ranks second in the country for percentage of land owned by the Federal  Government, so we understand the challenges and opportunities that come  with land designations.   Mr. Speaker, with Utah's interests in mind, I introduced a  commonsense amendment that would require local land officials to  approve wilderness designations, empowering the local communities to  work with the Federal Government on major land decisions, and the  previous comments actually emphasize the importance of that. And I  appreciate that, and I respect that, the local input that the  gentlewoman was mentioning.   Our system works best when there is close collaboration between all  levels in government. Our State and local governments see firsthand  obstacles to successfully managing their resources, and they are  experts in their communities' unique needs and concerns. As  policymakers, we have a responsibility to bring local officials to the  table so that we can make the most informed land decisions possible.   Wilderness areas can be beautiful, but these designations bring many  challenges. Our Federal lands will be best managed when we include our  constituents' perspectives. Unfortunately, this process has denied my  Republican colleagues and me the ability to do just that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for these very sensible and  reasonable amendments.
