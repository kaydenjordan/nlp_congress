 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in celebration of the first  100 years of the Charles A. Conklin American Legion Post 28 in Grand  Haven, Michigan.   But before I talk more extensively about Post 28, I do want to  acknowledge this past week that very auspicious ceremony and  anniversary that was recognized--D-Day.   I joined the bipartisan group, led by the Speaker of the House and  the minority leader, to the beaches of Normandy. To talk with those  family members, those veterans who served there on those beaches was an  incredibly moving thing, especially for me, the son of a disabled World  War II veteran who nearly perished in a B-24 crash in southern Italy,  and to just recognize and remember the sacrifices that not only those  men that stormed the beaches, but their families, endured in the years  after that.   I want to just highlight some of the connections that we have had in  west Michigan to those efforts. Whether it was the city of Grand Haven,  which is where Post 28 lies, which, upon the sinking of a merchant  marine ship, the Coast Guard cutter Escanaba, raised public funds  locally to literally build another Escanaba ship, one that has  continued that very special tie with Grand Haven and with those members  of VFW Post 28; the Silversides, a submarine that saw action in the  South Pacific; the LST that resides in Muskegon, that took 31 trips  back and forth during that D-Day invasion over those days, that history  that we have is rich.   And the history that Post 28 has is a history that comes out of World  War I, something that we had just celebrated the armistice of last  November, the 100-year anniversary. My namesake, Bill Huizenga, had the  privilege of fighting in that conflict and in that war as well.  [[Page H4439]]    I have, in my mind, this connection that all of those men at that  time over 100 years ago, that they were coming together as a community,  and they were going off to fight for their country. And for 100 years  now, this particular American Legion Post 28 had selflessly, admirably,  and honorably served the Grand Haven community with a special focus on  veterans and their families.   On June 12, 1919, how this came about was 35 local veterans returning  from this Great War gathered at the Grand Haven Armory and signed a  petition to become chartered as the Grand Haven American Legion Post  28.   They chose as their namesake, Charles A. Conklin, who was Grand  Haven's first fallen soldier of that war to end all wars. Well, shortly  after graduating high school, Charles joined the National Guard as a  machine gunner and was part of the prestigious 42nd ``Rainbow''  Division.   After ferocious fighting on the front line, Charles was wounded in  combat and died on May 7, 1918. He now rests in peace at Grand Haven's  Lake Forest Cemetery, where his courageous spirit continues to inspire  local veterans and all of our citizens to carry on his legacy of duty,  service, and valor.   After witnessing the positive impacts across west Michigan, more  veterans and their families wanted to join Post 28. The Post 28 family  first expanded April 9, 1920, when the Women's Auxiliary Unit 28  organized and was chartered; and then, for over a century, as they  continued to grow, the Sons of the American Legion Squadron 28 was  chartered in 1937 and again in 1990. Finally, the American Legion  Squadron 28 was organized in 2007, completing the Post 28 family.   The American Legion Post 28's steadfast commitment to serving  veterans, their families, and the Grand Haven community shines in every  act of service that they perform. The long list of charitable and  educational programs, including the annual Poppy Sale, the Boys State  and Girls State programs that they support, the Good Fellows Committee  for volunteerism, the food drives, and their famous Salmon Dinner Night  at Grand Haven's annual Salmon Festival--not to mention the thousands  of diners that they serve at the post's home on Harbor Drive in Grand  Haven--really has underscored their commitment to the community.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Second District of Michigan, we thank  the members of the Charles A. Conklin American Legion Post 28 in Grand  Haven for their service to our community over the past century, and I  look forward to working with them in the years to come.                            ____________________
