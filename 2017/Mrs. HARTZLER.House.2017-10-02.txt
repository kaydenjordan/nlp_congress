 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, my dear friend and  colleague, Mr. Trent Franks, who is certainly a champion of our time in  standing up for life, for our national defense, and has a heart so big  that comes through in everything he does. And certainly, tonight, I  think we see the gentleman's heart for unborn children, certainly at  the beginning of 6 months of age, who deserve to live.   The gentleman's bill, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act,  also known as Micah's Law, will do that, and I urge all of my  colleagues to support it tomorrow.   But tonight, Mr. Speaker, I want to share with you a heartwarming  story that puts a face to what we are talking about. It is one thing to  say 20 weeks old, a baby, unborn baby, but it is another thing to look  at the picture of Micah Pickering--and his picture is up there, as well  as up front.   Micah Pickering was born at 20 weeks' gestation. He was born at the  age of which we are talking about that you are trying to say we should  not allow for abortions at this stage because they can live, and Micah  is a living example of that.   You know, I want to share a little bit about what his mother shared  about his story, with Micah, her son. His mother's name is Danielle,  and she recalled that when Micah was born, he cried twice immediately,  and that was music to her ears and contrary to the worst case scenarios  for which Micah's parents were bracing.   This is what Danielle talked about during those first few moments.  She said: ``The second I was able to meet Micah changed my life. He was  so small. I didn't know what to expect. Would he look normal? Could I  bond with this baby? Those questions were a mess in my head as I was  wheeled into his room 2 hours after his birth. The sight I saw was a  perfectly formed  [[Page H7656]]  baby.'' At 20 weeks, at the beginning of 6 months, she says he was a  perfectly formed baby.   ``Lots of tubes and monitors all set up to be an artificial womb to  this baby born too soon. My husband and I stood there just staring at  this beautiful little boy who we were told we couldn't hold, as the  skin was so sensitive it would hurt him. We were told we could press  lightly on the skin, so we each put our hand near him.   ``He''--the baby, Micah--``reached up and held our fingers. This was  the strongest grasp I would ever feel. I never knew how strong a baby  was until that moment. He had a powerful grip on our hands and now''-- has a powerful grip on--``our hearts.''   This little miracle baby spent 4 months in intensive care. He  underwent heart surgery 2 weeks after birth, weighing a little over a  pound. He was on a ventilator for a while. He was on morphine to ease  the pain, and this was the size of the diaper that he wore.                                time  1945    Isn't that incredible?   But he wore a diaper that size, and this little preemie, when he was  born, he was the size of an M&M package. It is hard to believe that a  baby could be that small and live, but that is about the size of a baby  at this age, 20 weeks old, the beginning of 6 months, and he lived. His  name is Micah. Now he is a healthy, energetic kindergarten student.   Micah's story is beautiful. It is a miracle. And we thank God for  Micah's fighting spirit, for his parents' unwavering love for their  son, and for the team of doctors, nurses, surgeons, and medical  professionals who tended to Micah during those first few months.   But the point about Micah is he puts a face on this that, from the  moment of conception to the birth of a child, the growth and  development of the baby is miraculous. With advances in medical  science, we can better understand what is happening at each stage of  development.   When these little babies are just 4 weeks old, the basics of their  nervous system are developed. By 8 weeks after fertilization, the  unborn child reacts to touch. After 20 weeks, and that is the age of  the gentleman's bill, the unborn child reacts to stimuli that would be  recognized as painful if applied to an adult human, for example, by  recoiling.   We know that by the 20th week, the beginning of the sixth month,  unborn babies, children the same age as Micah when he was born, respond  to painful stimuli by flinching and jerking, just like you and I would  if we were burned or hurt in some way.   Micah's parents were told that they could not hold their little son,  that it would be too painful for the newborn. But babies at this stage  are actually hyperresponsive to pain since the neurological features  that inhibit or regulate pain sensations do not develop until much  later in pregnancy.   Certainly, these babies should not undergo this pain and, certainly,  not have to have their life snuffed out through abortion. When a mother  and her unborn baby undergo a surgical procedure, doctors give fetal  pain medication, or fetal anesthesia to the baby so that he or she does  not feel the procedure. This is common practice. It is common sense.   The legislation before the House tomorrow will ensure that unborn  children are not subjected to the excruciating pain of being euthanized  in the womb. And this is where I wish the story could end, that all  children be given a fighting chance like Micah. But that is not the  case for too many children whose lives are taken from them before they  can take their first breath.   Late-term abortion procedures, abortions performed on babies 20 weeks  and later in pregnancies, are graphic, detestable, and, tragically,  allowed in this country.   In a dissent opinion that Representative Smith just shared, and I  want to share it again, Justice Kennedy offered the insight into this  grizzly practice. He said: ``The fetus, in many cases, dies just as a  human adult or born child would: it bleeds to death as it is torn limb  from limb.''   Aborted, unborn babies endure unspeakable pain in the most horrific  manner possible. Knowing that innocent 20-week babies acutely  experience pain and endure inhuman dismemberment or poisoning should be  enough to pierce each of our hearts and prick our sensibilities.   Micah's Law, the legislation that would protect the lives of unborn  children halfway through pregnancy because of their ability to feel  pain, is our call to action.   In closing, Mr. Speaker, I would like to leave you with the words of  Micah's mom as she watched her tiny infant grow into the child he is  today, and it speaks to the potential of every one of these children  that we hope from now on will have a chance to live like Micah. She  said: ``He still had his eyes fused shut. You could see his chest  vibrate from the ventilators. It was heartbreaking. Here was a boy who  we would see get to take his first sneeze, his first smile. We would  get to see the hiccups from the outside. We would watch his eyes slowly  unfuse. We would watch his hair grow in and we would watch his body  develop. It was indescribably the most joyful time of our life.''   So as we anticipate tomorrow's historic vote, I ask my colleagues to  lend their support for Micah and thousands of children just like him  who want to live, who want to experience life, and who have so much to  give.
