 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise in support of Countering Iran's  Destabilizing Activities Act of 2017. For too long, a myopic focus on  the Iran deal blinded the United States to Iran's persistent campaign  to destabilize the Middle East and undermine America's national  security interests. Iran has been given a free pass to detain U.S.  sailors in clear violation of international law, conduct ballistic  missile tests in violation of the United Nations resolutions, support  terrorist groups across the region, and prop up the murderous Assad  regime in Syria.   It is long past time for the United States and the international  community to hold Iran accountable, not just for its commitments under  the nuclear deal but for its destabilizing behavior across the Middle  East. This legislation begins to do just that by imposing new sanctions  on Iran's ballistic missile program, applying terrorism sanctions to  the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, imposing sanctions on Iranians  engaged in human rights abuses, and tightening enforcement on arms  embargoes on the Iranian regime.   I thank the chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Relations  Committee, Senators Corker and Cardin, for ringing this bill to the  floor. They recognize that the United States must not stand idly by  when hostile regimes undermine and attack our interests and that of our  allies. They recognize that regimes that aid and abet crimes against  humanity must be held accountable. They recognize that weakness in the  face of aggression is provocative.   These are the reasons we must pass this legislation, but these are  also the very same reasons this legislation must be amended to  strengthen and expand sanctions against Vladimir Putin's Russia.   In just the last 3 years under Vladimir Putin, Russia has invaded  Ukraine, annexed Crimea, threatened NATO allies, and intervened  militarily in Syria,  [[Page S3315]]  leaving a trail of death, destruction, and broken promises in its wake.   Last year, Russia attacked the foundations of American democracy with  a cyber and information campaign to interfere in America's 2016  election. It has been 8 months now since the U.S. intelligence  community publicly concluded that the Russian Government had attempted  to interfere in our last Presidential election.   On October 7, 2016, the Department of Homeland Security and the  Office of the Director of National Intelligence stated that the ``U.S.  intelligence community is confident that the Russian government  directed the recent compromises of e-mails from U.S. persons and  institutions, including from U.S. political organizations.'' The  statement concluded that ``only Russia's senior-most officials could  have authorized these activities.''   On January 6, 2017, the U.S. intelligence community went even  further, concluding:         Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence       campaign in 2016 aimed at the United States presidential       election. Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in       the United States democratic process, denigrate Secretary       Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency.    The intelligence community ``did not make an assessment of the impact  that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election,'' but  they did warn that ``Moscow will apply lessons learned from its Putin- ordered campaign aimed at the U.S. Presidential election to future  influence efforts worldwide, including against U.S. allies and their  election processes.''   Since January, months of congressional hearings, testimony, and  investigative work have reinforced these conclusions: that Russia  deliberately interfered in our recent election with cyber attacks and a  disinformation campaign designed to weaken America and undermine faith  in our democracy and our values.   Vladimir Putin's brazen attack on our democracy is a flagrant  demonstration of his disdain and disrespect for our Nation. This should  not just outrage every American, it should compel us to action. But in  the last 8 months, what price has Russia paid for attacking American  democracy? Hardly any at all: modest sanctions against a few Russian  individuals and entities, some Russian diplomats and spies sent home to  Russia, two spy compounds have closed, at least for now--and all of  this reversible and at the discretion of the President.   What has Russia's reaction been to America's tepid response and  reaction to its aggressive behavior? More of the same. More aggression,  more meddling. Russia attempted to overthrow the democratically elected  Government of Montenegro and murder its Prime Minister. Russia  attempted to interfere in France's election. We have already seen  attempts to influence German public opinion ahead of the elections in  September, and there is every expectation that Russia will do the same  thing in the Czech Republic, Italy, and elsewhere in future elections.    Sooner or later, my friends, there will be another American election  that captures Russian attention and interest. The victim may be a  Republican or a Democrat. To Putin, it won't matter because his targets  are not Republicans or Democrats but Americans and all that we stand  for as a people. He seeks to sow dissent amongst us and divide us from  one another, to erode our resolve to resist his dark and dangerous view  of the world, and to undermine our confidence in ourselves and our  belief in our own values.   We must take our own side in this fight--not as Republicans, not as  Democrats, but as Americans. It is time to respond to Russia's attack  on American democracy with strength and resolve, with common purpose,  and with action. Together with Senator Graham and a number of other  Senators, I am prepared to offer an amendment to this legislation that  will begin to do just that. It incorporates some of the best ideas from  different pieces of legislation already introduced in the Senate, ideas  that have broad bipartisan support.   The amendment we are talking about would impose mandatory sanctions  on transactions with the Russian defense or intelligence sectors,  including the FSB and the GRU, the Russian military intelligence agency  that was primarily responsible for Russia's attack on our election.   The amendment would impose mandatory visa bans and asset freezes on  any individual who undermines the cyber security of public or private  infrastructure and democratic institutions. It would impose mandatory  sanctions on those who assist or support such activities.   The amendment would codify existing sanctions on Russia by placing  into law five Executive orders signed by President Obama in response to  both Russian interference in the 2016 election and its illegal actions  in Ukraine, and it would take new steps to tighten those sanctions. For  example, Russia's ability to issue new sovereign debt essentially  allows Russia to borrow money from global capital markets to offset  pressure from existing U.S. and European sanctions. So this amendment  would impose mandatory sanctions on U.S. and third-party investment in  sales of Russian sovereign debt as well as in the privatization of  Russian state-owned assets.   The amendment would target the Russian energy sector, which is  controlled by Vladimir Putin's cronies, with sanctions on investments  in Russian petroleum and natural gas development as well as Russian  energy pipelines.   We also need to put additional pressure on the ability of Putin and  his cronies to move money they have looted from the Russian state. So  this amendment would mandate that the Secretary of the Treasury  establish a high-level task force within the Department's Financial  Crimes Enforcement Network that would focus on tracing, mapping, and  prosecuting illicit financial flows linked to Russia if such flows  interact with the U.S. financial system. The task force would also work  with liaison officers in key U.S. Embassies, especially in Europe, to  work with local authorities to uncover and prosecute the networks  responsible for the illicit Russian financial flows.   Finally, recognizing that Russia seeks to undermine not just American  democracy but Western democracy altogether, this amendment would  provide support to the State Department, the Global Engagement Center,  and USAID to help build the resilience of democratic institutions in  Europe against Russian aggression exerted through corruption,  propaganda, and other forms of political interference.   We need a strong Russia sanctions amendment. We need it now. We need  it on this piece of legislation. We need this amendment because we have  no time to waste. The United States of America needs to send a strong  message to Vladimir Putin and any other aggressor that we will not  tolerate attacks on our democracy. There is no greater threat to our  freedoms than attacks on our ability to choose our own leaders free  from foreign interference. So we must act accordingly, and we must act  now.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
