 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6735) to direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to  establish a vulnerability disclosure policy for Department of Homeland  Security internet websites, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6735         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Public-Private Cybersecurity       Cooperation Act''.       SEC. 2. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY DISCLOSURE OF                     SECURITY VULNERABILITIES.         (a) Vulnerability Disclosure Policy.--The Secretary of       Homeland Security shall establish a policy applicable to       individuals, organizations, and companies that report       security vulnerabilities on appropriate information systems       of Department of Homeland Security. Such policy shall include       each of the following:  [[Page H8747]]         (1) The appropriate information systems of the Department       that individuals, organizations, and companies may use to       discover and report security vulnerabilities on appropriate       information systems.        (2) The conditions and criteria under which individuals,       organizations, and companies may operate to discover and       report security vulnerabilities.        (3) How individuals, organizations, and companies may       disclose to the Department security vulnerabilities       discovered on appropriate information systems of the       Department.        (4) The ways in which the Department may communicate with       individuals, organizations, and companies that report       security vulnerabilities.        (5) The process the Department shall use for public       disclosure of reported security vulnerabilities.        (b) Remediation Process.--The Secretary of Homeland       Security shall develop a process for the Department of       Homeland Security to address the mitigation or remediation of       the security vulnerabilities reported through the policy       developed in subsection (a).        (c) Consultation.--In developing the security vulnerability       disclosure policy under subsection (a), the Secretary of       Homeland Security shall consult with each of the following:        (1) The Attorney General regarding how to ensure that       individuals, organizations, and companies that comply with       the requirements of the policy developed under subsection (a)       are protected from prosecution under section 1030 of title       18, United States Code, civil lawsuits, and similar       provisions of law with respect to specific activities       authorized under the policy.        (2) The Secretary of Defense and the Administrator of       General Services regarding lessons that may be applied from       existing vulnerability disclosure policies.        (3) Non-governmental security researchers.        (d) Public Availability.--The Secretary of Homeland       Security shall make the policy developed under subsection (a)       publicly available.

(iv) The average length of time between the reporting of       security vulnerabilities and mitigation or remediation of       such vulnerabilities.        (f) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) The term ``security vulnerability'' has the meaning       given that term in section 102(17) of the Cybersecurity       Information Sharing Act of 2015 (6 U.S.C. 1501(17)), in       information technology.        (2) The term ``information system'' has the meaning given       that term by section 3502(12) of title 44, United States       Code.        (3) The term ``appropriate information system'' means an       information system that the Secretary of Homeland Security       selects for inclusion under the vulnerability disclosure       policy required by subsection (a).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Public-Private  Cybersecurity Cooperation Act.   Strengthening our cybersecurity must be a top national priority.  International hackers and nation-states are waging a war against us in  cyberspace.   These threats are aimed at our economic, political, and national  security institutions.   Between 2011 and 2013, Iranian hackers attacked dozens of American  banks and even tried to shut down a dam in New York.   In 2014, Chinese hackers stole over 22.5 million security clearances,  including my own, from the Office of Personnel Management.   In 2016, Russia meddled in our presidential election.   Because we use computer networks in our personal and professional  lives, almost everyone is a target.   With each passing day, cyber threats continue to grow, but the  government cannot face these threats alone. We need help from the  private sector.   Today's legislation will direct the Department of Homeland Security  Secretary to develop and implement a vulnerability disclosure program  that will allow threat researchers from the private sectors to identify  and report cybersecurity flaws found in the Department's information  systems.   Currently, there is no legal avenue that allows them to do so. This  legislation solves that problem.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Leader McCarthy for his years of  commitment to innovation and cybersecurity, and for his work on this  bill in particular.   He truly understands the nature of this threat and why it is so  important to have a strong cyber partnership between the public and  private sectors.   Mr. Speaker, I believe that this bipartisan legislation will help DHS  better protect its vital networks, and I urge my colleagues to support  it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support this bill. It  is at a time when there is a lot of partisanship going on. I think it  is healthy to see a truly bipartisan bill on such an important issue  regarding our national security.   I think, as the gentleman from Louisiana pointed out, this is modeled  after a program that the Department of Defense successfully deployed,  and I am proud of the record my committee has had on passing, I think,  close to 110 bills now, and almost all of them are bipartisan.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my Senate colleagues to at least take up some of  them and do the same, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6740) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to  establish Border Tunnel Task Forces, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows                                 H.R. 6740         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Border Tunnel Task Force       Act''.       SEC. 2. BORDER TUNNEL DETECTION.         (a) In General.--Subtitle B of title IV of the Homeland       Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 211 et seq.) is amended by       adding at the end the following new section:       ``SEC. 420. BORDER TUNNEL TASK FORCES.         ``(a) Establishment.--The Secretary shall establish Border       Tunnel Task Forces in jurisdictions in which such Border       Tunnel Task Forces can contribute to border security missions       after evaluating--        ``(1) whether the areas in which such Border Tunnel Task       Forces would be established are significantly impacted by       cross-border threats; and        ``(2) the availability of Federal, State, local, and Tribal       law enforcement resources to participate in such Border       Tunnel Task Forces.        ``(b) Purpose.--The purpose of the Border Tunnel Task       Forces under subsection (a) is to enhance and integrate       border security efforts by addressing and reducing cross-      border tunnel related threats and violence by--        ``(1) facilitating collaboration among Federal, State,       local, and Tribal law enforcement agencies to execute       coordinated activities in furtherance of border security and       homeland security; and        ``(2) enhancing information-sharing, including the       dissemination of homeland security information, among such       agencies.        ``(c) Composition and Establishment of Border Tunnel Task       Forces.--Border Tunnel Task Forces may be comprised of the       following:        ``(1) Personnel from U.S. Customs and Border Protection,       including the U.S. Border Patrol.        ``(2) Personnel from U.S. Immigration and Customs       Enforcement, including Homeland Security Investigations.        ``(3) Personnel from other Department components and       offices, as appropriate.        ``(4) Personnel from other Federal, State, local, and       Tribal law enforcement agencies, as appropriate.        ``(5) Other appropriate personnel at the discretion of the       Secretary.        ``(d) Duplication of Efforts.--In determining whether to       establish a new Border Tunnel Task Force or to expand an       existing Border Tunnel Task Force in a given jurisdiction,       the Secretary shall ensure that the Border Tunnel Task Force       under consideration does not unnecessarily duplicate the       efforts of other existing interagency task forces or centers       within such jurisdiction.        ``(e) Coordination Among Components.--The Secretary shall--        ``(1) establish targets and performance measures for the       Border Tunnel Task Forces that include consideration of       whether border barriers impact cross-border tunnel threats;        ``(2) direct leadership of each Border Tunnel Task Force to       monitor progress on such targets and performance measures for       each such task force; and        ``(3) periodically report to the Committee on Homeland       Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on       Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate       regarding progress on such targets and performance       measures.''.        (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents in section       1(b) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended by       inserting after the item relating to section 419 the       following new item:  ``Sec. 420. Border Tunnel Task Forces.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Border Tunnel Task Force  Act.   Mr. Speaker, some of the most dangerous threats to our homeland are  coming across our southern border. Drug smugglers are bringing  dangerous narcotics and fueling America's epidemic of opioids. Human  traffickers and transnational gangs like MS-13 are infecting our  neighborhoods and endangering our kids. Even potential known or  suspected terrorists are trying to make their way into America by  exploiting our weak borders.   All of these groups are a serious national security concern. They are  also very determined and creative, and one of the ways they avoid  detection is by digging cross-border tunnels.   In August, a tunnel the length of two football fields was discovered  below a closed fast-food restaurant in Arizona. This pathway was used  to smuggle cocaine, heroin, fentanyl, and methamphetamines.   In 2016, 7 tons of marijuana and 1 ton of cocaine were found in a  tunnel not far from San Diego. In my home State of Texas, a tunnel was  discovered under the Rio Grande in El Paso back in 2010, also for  smuggling drugs.   Unfortunately, the problem is not new. Authorities have discovered  nearly 200 cross-border tunnels since 1990. We must do more to shut  these tunnels down. This legislation will establish Border Tunnel Task  Forces to enhance the ability of DHS to detect these tunnels and  identify criminal networks.   These teams will be made up of ICE, CBP, and other Department  personnel. They will be assisted by State, local, and Tribal law  enforcement agencies. These teams will deploy to locations along the  border where the greatest  [[Page H8749]]  risks to our national security exist. In working together, they will be  able to better secure our border and protect Americans from a growing  list of threats.   This bill will minimize a unique, but serious, threat to our  homeland. I want to thank my very dear friend and colleague,  Congressman Sessions, for all of his hard work on this issue, and I  urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions), the distinguished chairman of the  Rules Committee and the author of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, every day, we are seeing drugs coming in from Mexico,  known or suspected terrorists, and dangerous opioids. We see fentanyl  coming in from China into Mexico where they mix it with  methamphetamines and heroin. It is really toxic, poisonous stuff.  Fentanyl is so toxic that our canines die when they sniff it, yet that  is being put into drugs coming across the U.S.-Mexico border into the  United States to pollute and infect our children and our veterans. It  is time for this to stop.   I hope that we will be able to take up, perhaps in November, our  border security bill, which I think would go a long ways to getting  this job done. In the meantime, this bill, I think, will go a long ways  to stopping a very organized, sophisticated route of drugs, bad people,  and bad things into the United States, and that is shutting down these  tunnels.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6620) to require the Department of Homeland Security to  prepare a threat assessment relating to unmanned aircraft systems, and  for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6620         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Critical       Infrastructure Against Drones and Emerging Threats Act''.       SEC. 2. DRONE AND EMERGING THREAT ASSESSMENT.         (a) In General.--Not later than 120 days after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Under Secretary for Intelligence       and Analysis of the Department of Homeland Security shall--        (1) in consultation with other relevant officials of the       Department, request additional information from other       agencies of the Federal Government, State and local       government agencies, and the private sector relating to       threats of unmanned aircraft systems and other emerging       threats associated with such new technologies;        (2) in consultation with relevant officials of the       Department and other appropriate agencies of the Federal       Government, develop and disseminate a security threat       assessment regarding unmanned aircraft systems and other       emerging threats associated with such new technologies; and        (3) establish and utilize, in conjunction with the Chief       Information Officer of the Department and other relevant       entities, a secure communications and information technology       infrastructure, including data-mining and other advanced       analytical tools, in order to access, receive, and analyze       data and information in furtherance of the responsibilities       under this section, including by establishing a voluntary       mechanism whereby critical infrastructure owners and       operators may report information on emerging threats, such as       the threat posed by unmanned aircraft systems.        (b) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Under Secretary for Intelligence       and Analysis of the Department of Homeland Security shall       prepare a threat assessment and report to the Committee on       Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the       Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of       the Senate on the threat posed by unmanned aircraft systems,       including information collected from critical infrastructure       owners and operators and Federal, State, and local government       agencies.        (c) Definitions.--        (1) Critical infrastructure.--The term ``critical       infrastructure'' has the meaning given such term in section       1016(e) of Public Law 107-56 (42 U.S.C. 5195c(e)).        (2) Unmanned aircraft system.--The term ``unmanned aircraft       system'' has the meaning given such term in section 331 of       the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (49 U.S.C. 40101       note; Public Law 112-95).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this legislation that will  help protect the American people from threatening drones. Drones are  being used to cross America more and more every year. News outlets use  drones to capture footage for a breaking story. Photographers use them  to take photos and videos at weddings, sporting events, and rock  concerts. They also are used by law enforcement to help document crime  scenes or assist with search and rescue operations. Those are all good  things.   However, drones or other unmanned aerial systems can also pose a  threat if they are controlled by terrorists or criminals. For example,  ISIS used them to carry out attacks and conduct reconnaissance  overseas. Here at home, criminals are using drones to smuggle drugs  across our borders and surveil law enforcement. The FBI even disrupted  a plot to attack the Pentagon with a drone loaded with grenades.   The threats we face from drones are constantly evolving as the  technology becomes more accessible across the globe. We need to do more  to confront these dangers.   This legislation requires the Under Secretary for Intelligence and  Analysis at DHS to develop a drone threat assessment with information  gathered from Federal, State, local, and private sector partners.   It also directs the Under Secretary to establish a secure  communications infrastructure for receiving and analyzing such threat  information.   Further, this bill sets up a voluntary mechanism for critical  infrastructure owners and operators to report information on similar  emerging threats.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Richmond and Congressman Ratcliffe  for their hard work on this issue. I think this bill will allow us to  strengthen our intelligence gathering and stay one step ahead of our  enemies.   I am pleased that the Senate and House were also able to include the  Preventing Emerging Threats Act, legislation I introduced with  Congressman Chabot, in the FAA bill that will be on the floor tomorrow.  This will give DHS the authority to counter drones in our airspace if  they are determined to be a threat to national security.   This bill provides DHS and DOJ with the ability to act quickly and  effectively when a drone poses a security risk to large-scale events,  national security events, and government facilities.   Secretary Nielsen described this legislation as ``a critical step in  enabling the Department to address this threat.''   Let's provide DHS with the tools it needs to confront these threats  before they get worse.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support these bipartisan bills,  and I reserve the balance of my time.           Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of             Representatives,                                Washington, DC, September 21, 2018.      Hon. Michael McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul: I write concerning H.R. 6620, the       Protecting Critical Infrastructure Against Drones and       Emerging Threats Act. This legislation includes matters that       fall within the Rule X jurisdiction  [[Page H8751]]       of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.        In order to expedite floor consideration of H.R. 6620, the       Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will forgo       action on this bill. However, this is conditional on our       mutual understanding that forgoing consideration of the bill       would not prejudice the Committee with respect to the       appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional       claim over the subject matters contained in the bill or       similar legislation that fall within the Committee's Rule X       jurisdiction. I request you urge the Speaker to name members       of the Committee to any conference committee named to       consider such provisions.        Please place a copy of this letter and your response       acknowledging our jurisdictional interest in the       Congressional Record during House Floor consideration of the       bill. I look forward to working with the Committee on       Homeland Security as the bill moves through the legislative       process.            Sincerely,                                                      Bill Shuster,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                 Washington, DC, September 21, 2018.      Hon. Bill Shuster,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Shuster: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 6620, the ``Protecting Critical Infrastructure Against       Drones and Emerging Threats Act.'' I appreciate your support       in bringing this legislation before the House of       Representatives, and accordingly, understand that the       Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will forego       further consideration of the bill.        The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual       understanding that by foregoing consideration of this bill at       this time, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure       does not waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter       contained in this bill or similar legislation in the future.       In addition, should a conference on this bill be necessary, I       would support your request to have the Committee represented       on the conference committee.        I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional       Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor.       I thank you for your cooperation in this matter.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, on September 11, a United Airlines flight was headed  towards the Capitol. Thank God those heroes that day brought down that  airliner in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, and this great building that we  are standing in today was not destroyed with an image I don't think the  American people could accept.   However, those terrorists are exploiting these drones. We have seen  them in Iraq and Syria with explosives and chemical weapons. We have  also disrupted plots for the use of drones against both the Pentagon  and the United States Capitol. A drone, unlike an airplane, could hit  the United States Capitol very quickly. We need to give the Department  the tools and the authorities necessary to protect our American  institutions.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6742) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to ensure  that appropriate officers and agents of U.S. Customs and Border  Protection are equipped with secure radios or other two-way  communication devices, supported by system interoperability, and for  other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6742         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Secure Border Communications       Act''.       SEC. 2. SECURE BORDER COMMUNICATIONS.

(b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents in section       1(b) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended by       inserting after the item relating to section 419 the       following new item:  ``Sec. 420. Secure border communications.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Secure Border  Communications Act.   Every day our CBP agents and officers serve on the front lines in the  fight to secure our homeland. They face threats from armed drug  cartels, dangerous gangs like MS-13, human traffickers, and potential  terrorists.   These brave individuals take pride in serving with vigilance,  integrity, and professionalism in order to keep us safe.   To be successful, however, they must be equipped with the tools they  need to do their jobs well. Too often, the communications devices and  radios used by CBP officers and other agents are outdated and  unreliable.   For instance, Border Patrol agents patrolling on the ground may not  have direct radio contact with CBP air assets or other law enforcement  officers working the area. This hinders interagency communications and  jeopardizes their mission and safety.   At a subcommittee hearing earlier this year, a Border Patrol agent  stated that she had been issued a radio that often failed. At times,  she would need to communicate with a fellow agent but was forced to use  her personal cell phone.   We cannot allow these kinds of technical failures to endanger the  lives of our agents and weaken our national security. We must do  better.   Fortunately, we can begin to fix this problem today. This legislation  will ensure that CBP agents and officers are equipped with  interoperable and secure radios or two-way communication devices.   In addition, this bill highlights the importance of reliable  encrypted communications that will prevent powerful cartels from  intercepting sensitive information, such as our CBP agents' and  officers' locations.   Passing this bill is a simple step that we can take to help our CBP  agents do their jobs and protect our homeland.   I would like to thank Congressman Mast for all his hard work on this  issue. Congressman Mast is no stranger to service and sacrifice,  serving overseas in our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and he has the  scars to prove it. We thank him for his service. It is a great honor to  have him sponsor a bill from our committee.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time                                       Committee on Ways and Means,                                        House of Representatives,                                 Washington, DC, September 24, 2018.      Hon. Michael T. McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul: I write to you regarding H.R. 6742,       the ``Secure Border Communications Act'', on which the       Committee on Ways and Means was granted an additional       referral.        As a result of your having consulted with us on provisions       in H.R. 6742 that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the       Committee on Ways and Means, I agree to waive formal       consideration of this bill. The Committee on Ways and Means       takes this action with the mutual understanding that we do       not waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained       in this or similar legislation, and the Committee will be       appropriately consulted and involved as the bill or similar       legislation moves forward so that we may address any       remaining issues that fall within our jurisdiction. The       Committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an       appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate       conference involving this or similar legislation, and       requests your support for such request.  [[Page H8753]]         I would appreciate your response confirming this       understanding with respect to H.R. 6742 and ask that a copy       of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during consideration of the bill on the       House floor.            Sincerely,                                                       Kevin Brady,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                 Washington, DC, September 25, 2018.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Brady: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 6742, the ``Secure Border Communications Act.'' I       appreciate your support in bringing this legislation before       the House of Representatives, and accordingly, understand       that the Committee on Ways and Means will not take further       action on this bill.        The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual       understanding that by foregoing consideration on this bill at       this time, the Committee on Ways and Means does not waive any       jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this bill       or similar legislation in the future. In addition, should a       conference on this bill be necessary, I would support a       request by the Committee on Ways and Means for conferees on       those provisions within your jurisdiction.        I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional       Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor.       I thank you for your cooperation in this matter.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, this ensures that not only are communication devices  operable but that they are interoperable between agents down on the  border risking their lives day in and day out.   I can't thank them enough. I have been down to the border so many  times, and I see the harsh conditions that they operate under. I just  want to send a message of gratitude from the United States Congress and  our Committee on Homeland Security, and thank them for the work that  they do tirelessly. Honestly, I think we don't thank them enough for  what they do.   The encryption issue is vitally important because the drug cartels  are getting so sophisticated that they can pick up communications of  our law enforcement. This bill will go a long way to help protect those  communications and make sure that they can do their job in a more safe  and efficient manner in protecting the American public.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
