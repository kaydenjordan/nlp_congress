 Madam Speaker, last week, a report from  Moody's found that the average American is now spending an extra $460 a  month on everyday items like gas and groceries. Because of this  staggering inflation caused by President Biden's failed policies, the  average American family is being impacted.   The burden of this out-of-control inflation has fallen on working  families, who can least afford to pay for the skyrocketing price of  goods.   Now, instead of addressing the root causes of inflation, President  Biden and Vice President Harris are once again championing their build  back broken agenda, an agenda that would pour gasoline on a fire that  is already far out of control.   Americans cannot afford this reckless spending, and we cannot afford  to allow radical socialist policies to further destroy our Nation's  economy.   It is time to return to fiscal restraint. It is time to stop spending  money that we don't have. It is time to stop spending money on things  that we do not need.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Oklahoma for holding this incredibly important Special Order, and I  thank him for yielding.   Since day 1 of his Presidency, Joe Biden has chosen to weaponize his  power to attack the energy industry and raise the price of gasoline for  Pennsylvania drivers. This impact financially, for every Pennsylvanian,  and in fact, for every American citizen, is being felt tonight as we  hold this Special Order.   By canceling the Keystone XL pipeline, by canceling new drilling  leases, and by suggesting that the energy beneath the feet of my  constituents is not an acceptable source of power, President Biden has  turned his back on American energy. Sadly, he has turned his back on  the American people. Because of the President's policies, America right  now is drilling less oil than before the start of the COVID-19  pandemic.   To counter this war on American energy, I am proud to be working with  my colleagues to introduce the Blueprint to Save America and to help  return our Nation to energy dominance. Not just energy independence,  but energy dominance.   It is time to reverse President Biden's executive actions to stop new  drilling. It is time to produce the coal, the oil, the natural gas, and  the Marcellus shale that is needed to power our cities, our  communities, and our grids.   I thank the gentleman for holding this Special Order tonight to bring  attention to the roadmap that we have built to return our country to  that needed energy dominance.   President Ronald Reagan once said that we maintain ``peace through  strength.'' By rebuilding our energy infrastructure and once again  becoming a net energy exporter, we can help our allies while at the  same time lowering the price of energy right here in America.   I look forward to continuing to advocate for this budget that will  help my constituents back home in Pennsylvania.   Mr. Speaker, again, I thank my colleague, Representative Hern, for  holding this Special Order.
