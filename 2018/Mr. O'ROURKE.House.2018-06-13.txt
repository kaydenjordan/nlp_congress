 Mr. Speaker, on Monday of this week, I was in McAllen,  Texas, a beautiful community comprised of some incredibly courageous,  strong, kindhearted people in the Rio Grande Valley in the State of  Texas, connected by the Rio Grande River to Reynosa, Mexico, forming  one of these extraordinary binational communities that distinguish our  connection with Mexico with the State of Texas for the United States of  America.   I was able to visit the Border Patrol station in McAllen, Texas,  which is the busiest Border Patrol station in the country. I happened  to be there during the busiest shift during that day in that busy  station, and I was able to spend some time with the amazing women and  men of the Border Patrol, who have one of the toughest jobs that I can  imagine: keeping our country safe, protecting our communities and the  families within our communities, and meeting those who are at their  most desperate, most vulnerable moment in their lives, people who have  fled terror and violence, death and deprivation in their countries to  come to ours, to seek asylum, to seek safety, to seek refuge.    In that Border Patrol station I had the ability to meet a family, a  young mother and her young child, who had fled Honduras and had  traveled more  [[Page H5146]]  than 2,000 miles to come to this country. And because they presented  themselves to Border Patrol agents, didn't try to flee from them, went  to those Border Patrol agents seeking asylum in between the ports of  entry and didn't do it at the international bridge, didn't do it at the  port of entry, that young mother and her child were arrested. They were  being held in that cell comprised of cinder blocks, sitting on a hard  concrete bench with a number of other mothers and young children, had  just been arrested within the last 24 hours and were about to go to the  Border Patrol Processing Center. Through tears, that young mother was  able to tell me about her journey.   When I asked her why she didn't choose to cross at the port of entry,  where she could have lawfully petitioned for asylum, she said: ``I was  scared.'' She didn't know where to cross.   And, frankly, those crossing areas in Reynosa on the Mexican side of  the U.S.-Mexico border are controlled by the cartels. The cartels  determined where she and her 7-year-old daughter were going to cross.   Not lost on me was the fact that her daughter was gripping her  mother's hand for dear life, as I imagine she had been for the last 3  weeks when they made that 2,000-mile journey, where, if they were  lucky, they made it on foot.   They also made it atop, not inside of, a train, known as La Bestia,  or the Beast, and where they were fortunate enough to survive that  journey and come to our front door of the United States at the Texas- Mexico border, and where she was arrested and, unbeknownst to her and  to that little girl who was clutching her hand, they would, within  hours, be separated and might not know when they would be joined again,  if ever.   One hundred percent of the young women and men who travel with those  young children in between our ports of entry are arrested, are  detained, imprisoned, jailed in those Border Patrol stations, where  they next go to the next place that I went to in McAllen, which was the  Border Patrol processing center, a gigantic warehouse, where I saw the  children who had just been separated from their moms and dads behind  cyclone fencing, sleeping on polished concrete floors with a mattress 5  or 6 inches thick directly on the ground, Mylar blankets keeping them  warm, again, with Border Patrol agents who were as humane and  professional as possible, given the circumstances and the conditions.   Men separated in other holding pods, women behind cyclone fences in  other holding pods. There was another cyclone-fenced area open for  public view where you went to the bathroom and where we had to be able  to see your head or your feet. Those are the processes and procedures  and the laws under which those people are being held.   After that, I went to the international bridge at Reynosa and, on the  Mexican side, was able to talk to three different people who were  seeking asylum. Two of them had made the trip from Guatemala. When they  got to Reynosa, they were kidnapped by cartels, held for 12 days,  without clothes, without access to the outside world, with the  exception of being able to make calls to family members who could cough  up the $7,500 that would purchase their freedom, allow them to leave  captivity and make their way to the international bridge, literally 10  feet away from the international line and the United States of America,  where, if they could step foot on our soil, they would be able to  lawfully petition for asylum.   But standing there were four officers of Customs and Border  Protection who would not let them pass, who told them we do not have  capacity within our country and, therefore, they could not lawfully  petition for asylum, therefore, perversely providing the incentive for  them to try to cross in between the ports of entry illegally, where  they will be arrested, criminally prosecuted, and sent back to  countries from which they are fleeing certain death.   After that, I went to a detention center run by a private prison  corporation, where I met a man who had left his home country with his  12-year-old daughter, whom he has not seen for the last 5 days. And in  between 4-inch-thick Plexiglass, behind which I could barely hear what  he was saying, he told me about the horrific journey that he had  endured.   He took off his shirt and showed me the bullet wounds that he had  suffered that had caused him to make the desperate decision to leave  his family, his home country, his language, whatever he knew in life,  and take that 12-year-old girl and try to bring her to safety.   Again, just as with that mother, he was arrested. He now was in  criminal proceedings. He would now be moved to Immigration and Customs  Enforcement's Enforcement Removal Operations, ERO facility, where he  would be sent back to his country of origin; and he had no clue where  that 12-year-old girl that he had risked everything for was at that  moment.   Thank God for Rochelle Garza, his pro bono attorney, next to whom I  was sitting, who was doing everything in her power to provide him the  strength, reminding him to keep his faith and saying that she was going  to do everything in her effort, in her power to track down that 12- year-old girl.   Mr. Speaker, who are we to be doing this right now?   I know that every single one of us, to a person, if we were standing  here in this Chamber in 1939 when this country was sending back the St.  Louis, which had set sail on May 13, 1939, from Hamburg, Germany, with  more than 900 German Jewish refugees, including children, that all of  us, to a person, would like to say, if I were here, I would have made  the case to accept the St. Louis and those 900 passengers and make sure  that they could find refuge and asylum in this country. Instead, this  country chose not to, and we sent that ship back to Europe, where more  than 250 of those 900 passengers would be slaughtered in the Holocaust.   This is our opportunity to do the right thing. We will be judged by  our conscience, by our children, and by history. This is our moment of  truth.   So I join my friend from California, with every Member in this  Chamber, Republican and Democrat, in calling upon ourselves, our  country, to do the right thing at the moment that we still have the  chance to do the right thing.   Tomorrow, legislation will be introduced to end the practice of  family separation. As an original cosponsor of this bill, I am calling  on my colleagues to rush the decision, the debate, and to pass this  overwhelmingly so that we can send it to the Senate and, ultimately, to  the President's desk for his signature and do the right thing while we  still have the chance to do that.                                time  1815
