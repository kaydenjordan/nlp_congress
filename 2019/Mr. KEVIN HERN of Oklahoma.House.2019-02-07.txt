 Mr. Speaker, my constituents have been  calling the office in overwhelming numbers. They tell me to stand with  our President to get the funding our Customs and Border agents have  asked for.   I got a call from a police recruit in Tulsa just this week who has  seen firsthand the impact that illegal immigration has on the safety of  our citizens. It places a huge burden on our law enforcement agents who  are already putting themselves in harm's way for our safety every day.   With unregulated borders, we open our country up to the tragedy of  human trafficking. Undocumented women and children are especially  vulnerable to traffickers. Ninety percent of the heroin in our country  comes illegally from Mexico.   With dangerous drugs like cocaine, methamphetamines, and heroine come  gun activity, violent crime, and the serious problem of addiction.   In December, Tulsa law enforcement officers found 2 pounds of heroin  and 16 pounds of methamphetamines in connection in the Sinaloa drug  cartel smuggled into the States from Mexico. These dangerous and  illegal drugs are finding their way into communities across the  country.   There is a fix for all of this: Build the wall.   A physical barrier--which I might add, most of my friends from the  other side of the aisle have historically supported--will stop illegal  entry in its tracks. There is no replacement for a physical barrier.   Last month, the President told the American people that we need a  wall, not because we hate the people on the outside, but because we  love the people on the inside.                                time  1715    Mr. Speaker, I agree. How can we keep our people safe when we don't  know who is coming into this country? Let's start prioritizing the  American people and their safety.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to rise above partisanship for the  sake of our citizens. We can stop the human trafficking crisis. We can  catch the drug smugglers. We can keep our people safe. At the end of  the day, the only thing that will truly help us is to pass bipartisan  legislation to secure our borders and build a wall.
