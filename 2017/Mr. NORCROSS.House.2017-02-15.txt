 Mr. Speaker, I thank Brendan--Representative Boyle--and  Marc for putting together a Blue Collar Caucus just to remind ourselves  what we should be doing here is focusing on jobs. Jobs, which is the  best social program I have ever been with.   I entered my professional life as an electrician, as an electrical  apprentice. I went through the other 4 years of school. It was called  an apprenticeship. I worked on bridges, refineries, pipelines  throughout the Delaware Valley. I understood how tough it is sometimes  for people to make it. When work got slow, we got laid off. We  collected unemployment. Those are the struggles that men and women in  our great country are going through each and every day. If anything,  this last election cycle reminded us of that, that sometimes the  dignity of being able to take care of your family, send your kids to  school, and retire with dignity is the most important thing we can do.                                time  1815    I have seen firsthand what happens with minimum wage. They tend to  think it is all a bunch of kids flipping hamburgers. Well, it is much  more than that. It is a woman I spoke to, who had a child 8 years old,  who had to work two jobs just to make sure that in the winter, when her  daughter needed a coat for winter, that she could take care of her. And  she recalled to us how badly she felt that her daughter's teacher for  PTA wanted her to come in and help. She had to decide whether or not to  keep food on her table or participate in her child's school. That is a  tough decision when we both want to help.   When we look at what we have done as a country, as compared to  elsewhere in the world, it is very different when we look at the blue  collar, particularly in the building trades where I came from.  Throughout Europe, particularly in Switzerland and Germany, they look  at working with your hands with just the same dignity as going through  college. This country doesn't always do that. Guidance counselors tend  to push them into college as the only measurement.   College isn't for everybody. I have three brothers. They went the  traditional college route. I decided I really enjoyed working with my  hands. I went and became an electrician. Those jobs, we are on over 20  years ago, I still talk to my kids about it today--the dignity of  working with your hands.   This country is starting to change, particularly when you need an  electrician. When Mr. Boyle's lights in his house go out, who does he  call? That electrician is worth his weight in gold, isn't he?   And I know Mr. Boyle's story. His parents came over here as first  generation and are living the American Dream. They have to be so proud  of him.   And in Mr. Veasey's district, those refineries are important for  jobs, as they are in mine. I think we absolutely have to keep the focus  on making sure that we have renewables, that we have clean energy. But  we also understand with each of those decisions comes whether or not  somebody is going to be able to go home and say: Honey, I lost my job  today.   Today was a remarkable day--the first withdrawal of a nominee for the  Department of Labor. And I guess this is where, during the election  cycle, I see the difference.   It is very clear that the President wanted to talk about jobs, good  jobs, putting America back to work. And then we have the secretary  nominee put up--who talks about minimum wage is a bad thing, talks  about robots are things you don't have argument with. He wants to  outsource. That is not the way to rebuild the economy.   Mr. Boyle talked about the discrepancy between those who work for a  living, the average worker on the line, and those who are the CEOs.  When I grew up, there was an implied partnership with so many of those  companies. Those who went to work in a first-generation company, that  CEO knew every employee's name. But time after time, when that company  gets sold, that disconnect comes in. They forget about that. And that  is where those relationships, that partnership that is so important,  starts to break down.   We had a conversation in our Education and the Workforce Committee  the other day about the NLRB, which is the group from the Department of  Labor that judges whether or not elections with unions are done fairly.  There was a suggestion somehow that they are not being treated fairly.  It couldn't be any further from the truth. If workers want to have a  voice, they should have that voice and choose whether or not they want  to join with the union. That is the American way--that democracy. Yet,  the nominee for Labor wanted to do away with the NLRB. In fact, when we  look at the total case history, it is like putting the fox in charge of  the henhouse, unless, of course, you own the henhouse, and then it is  okay.   I want to finish up by saying to Mr. Veasey and Mr. Boyle how  appreciative I am of keeping this focus on the forefront of what we do  here in Congress. I created a Building Trades Caucus, along with a  colleague, Mr. McKinley, out of West Virginia. We could try to move  this forward, create an infrastructure package that puts America back  to work and keeps our roads, our bridges, and our grid safe.   Let's remember one thing: a fair day's pay for a fair day's work and  the dignity of a job. I appreciate what you have done.
