 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2872, the Promoting  Hydropower Development at Existing Nonpowered Dams Act.   Iowa has become a national leader in renewable energy. Currently, my  State provides over 40 percent of its electricity from renewable  sources, including over 37 percent from wind power alone. But there is  a lot of potential.   In 2012, the U.S. Department of Energy found that there is over  12,000 megawatts of untapped hydropower potential in the Nation's  existing dams. That is enough electricity to power 4 million homes.  That same report ranked Iowa 10th in available energy capacity in the  United States if these nonpowered dams were converted, with the  potential to generate 427 megawatts.                                time  1400    Renewable energy development like hydropower has created thousands of  good-paying jobs across Iowa. My district is the home of three  hydroelectric generation plants and will soon be the home of the second  largest hydro plant in the State, the Red Rock Hydroelectric Project.  Upon completion, Red Rock will produce upwards of 36 megawatts of  energy. That is enough electricity to power the nearby city of Pella,  and it has led to hundreds of jobs across the State of Iowa.   However, projects like Red Rock and others have been slowed by a  cumbersome licensing process as has been mentioned by folks on both  sides of the aisle here. Congress must work to streamline the  hydropower licensing processes so that more clean, renewable energy and  domestic energy can be brought onto the grid for the American consumer,  while also ensuring that these projects do not harm the environment.  This is why I am proud to have worked with Mr. Bucshon and my  colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee to bring this  commonsense, job-creating, bipartisan legislation to the floor today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.
