 Madam Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    Madam Speaker, I am in its current form.    Madam Speaker, my motion this morning moves $15 million  from an unauthorized program that provides free legal assistance to  illegal immigrants at the southern border to the Byrne Justice  Assistance Grant program.   The Byrne Justice Assistance Grant program--or Byrne JAG, as it is  commonly known--is a leading source of law enforcement assistance  funding to State, local, and Tribal jurisdictions across the United  States.   Its namesake was Edward Byrne. He was a New York City police officer.  He was known by Eddie to his family and his friends. He was outgoing.  He was a friendly individual who wanted to make his city a safer place.   In 1987, Officer Byrne joined the New York City Police Department. He  was well liked by his fellow officers, and he was passionate about his  work.   However, in the early morning hours of February 26, 1988, Officer  Byrne was on detail protecting a witness who had testified against  local drug dealers. Officer Byrne was in his patrol car outside the  witness' home when armed gunmen crept up to his car and shot him five  times in the head. He died of his injuries.   The NYPD lost one of its finest that day, and Eddie's family lost a  cherished son and a brother. He was only age 22.   In honor of Officer Byrne, Congress subsequently created the Edward  Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program. In 2019 alone, Byrne  JAG assisted nearly 1,000 State, local, and Tribal jurisdictions.   Many Members of this body know that Byrne JAG provides critical  funding, but Byrne JAG does a lot more. The program that memorializes  Eddie Byrne also supports indigent defense programs, drug treatment  programs, and mental health programs.   In our Nation, the fair administration of justice demands that  competent and effective public defenders are a part of our system. Our  annual Byrne JAG appropriations help to uphold just that.   As I noted, the Byrne JAG grants also support drug treatment  programs. Research shows that drug treatment is more effective than  imprisonment at reducing drug use and related crime.   In addition, Byrne JAG supports crisis intervention initiatives.   Sadly, the lack of mental health services across the United States  often results in police officers serving as the first responders in the  case of a mental health crisis.                                time  1045    However, crisis intervention teams that are supported by Byrne JAG  reduce arrests of people with mental illness while improving the  likelihood that individuals will receive that mental health treatment  they need.   I think Officer Byrne would be pleased with this. These are just a  few of the reasons to support this motion.  [[Page H4199]]  If you need more, please consider this: Current immigration law affirms  an illegal immigrant's right to counsel at no expense to taxpayers.   Moreover, under this bill, even illegal immigrants who are ineligible  for asylum, such as criminals and those who have had their asylum  applications denied, could benefit from taxpayer-funded lawyers.   And despite what you may hear from the other side of the aisle,  having a lawyer won't automatically improve someone's likelihood of  being granted asylum. It doesn't change the facts.   Madam Speaker, our immigration laws are clear, and they prohibit  taxpayer funds from being used to provide lawyers for those who are  here illegally.   Furthermore, this annual appropriations bill is no place to debate or  overturn immigration law.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this motion. It rejects the  calls of any defunding of any police programs, and it increases the  support for the many vital and compassionate missions of State and  local law enforcement officers who, like Eddie Byrne, are dedicating  their lives to bettering their communities across the United States of  America.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
