 Mr. Speaker, as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I  have worked long and hard to preserve the availability of fair,  affordable arbitration to consumers. Hearings before the Judiciary  Committee have demonstrated repeatedly that arbitration allows  consumers to resolve disputes quickly, fairly and at lower costs than  litigation. It also helps consumers to preserve relationships with  companies with whom they contract, by avoiding the acrimony of  litigation.   The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Arbitration Rule threatens  to undo all of that, not to benefit consumers, but to benefit one  special interest--the plaintiffs class-action trial bar.   By prohibiting consumers and companies from contracting to arbitrate  individual matters, rather than litigate disputes through class  actions, it ensures a steady stream of class-action litigation--and  handsome class-action attorneys' fees--for the trial bar. But for  consumers, it burdens their freedom of contract, subjects them to long,  drawn-out class-action litigation, and sets up scenarios in which large  portions of any recoveries they obtain will go, not to them, but to  class-action lawyers with whom they are forced to deal.   For companies, meanwhile, the Rule threatens to force them into  choosing whether to continue to fund their arbitration programs or,  instead, to shutter those programs to preserve funds for high-dollar  class-action defense.   I urge my colleagues to vote for this resolution and against the  CFPB's special-interest, anti-consumer rule.
