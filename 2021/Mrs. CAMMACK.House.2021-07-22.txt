 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for  yielding. It is an honor and a privilege to serve alongside  Representative Gohmert, and I look forward to many more conversations  on so many different topics, and I thank him for allowing me to be part  of this Special Order today.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to stand up for and in support of our  Border Patrol agents, our National Guard, the officers of the Texas  Department of Public Safety, our local law enforcement officers  protecting our hometowns, and all those that have made securing our  border their mission.   In fact, my own Florida National Guard and several of our Florida  officers and deputies have become part of the mission to secure our  southwest border. For our Border Patrol agents, they have been trained  to do a job that this administration will not let them do. They have  dedicated their lives and careers to upholding the rule of law,  something that this administration will not do.   They have continually put themselves in harm's way, keeping their  heads down and continuing to follow orders. And their reward to date?  Well, just look at the facts. Look at the numbers.   Approximately 40 percent of our Border Patrol agents are babysitting  and processing, not patrolling, not securing, and certainly not  defending the homeland because that is not their mission today.   Eleven agents are currently in the hospital fighting COVID from  contact with untested migrants, three of whom are in the ICU today; two  are intubated.   Just last month, the month of June, Border Patrol agents apprehended  188,829 migrants. Let me repeat that: 188,829 migrants. That is the  highest number in over 21 years. It is staggering. It is shocking. And  it should frighten every single American today.   And that doesn't even include the got-aways. The got-aways are the  people actively seeking to avoid detection by Border Patrol or National  Guard or Texas DPS or any number of resources and assets that we have  on the border.   The got-aways right now are about 200,000. And these are just the  folks that have been seen by an agent or caught on camera running away.  These are the people who are criminals, registered sex offenders, gang  members, cartel members. These are people who are now in our country  and we don't know where, doing God knows what.   And, of course, let's not forget the drugs, the narcotics that have  been seized at the border but also the ones that have made it across.  You know, just in the month of June the fentanyl seized--keep in mind,  only 20 percent is what they estimate is caught coming across the  border--the amount of fentanyl in pounds, over a thousand, is enough to  kill every man, woman, and child in the State of Florida 10 times over.  And that was just in the month of June. And that was just fentanyl.  That doesn't include the cocaine, the heroin, the meth, the weed, and  any other narcotics that come.   When you talk about the money that is being made by the cartels every  single month, last month, based on the number of apprehensions, that  188,829 that were apprehended, on average, each one of those paid the  cartels $6,000. You do the math. That is over $1 billion in human  smuggling. Human smuggling. That doesn't include the narcotics. And  believe me, as those narcotics get across the border and into our  communities, they get more expensive and more valuable, and the crime  and violence that comes along with them gets bigger and tougher and  scarier.   The numbers are pretty staggering, and as we stand here, I mentioned  the agents that are currently in the hospital fighting for their lives  because they came into contact with people who come from countries that  don't test, don't vaccinate, and now today we have a 900 percent  increase in COVID cases along the southwest border. 900 percent.   And you know what happens?   These people are not tested. They are checked for lice and scabies,  and then on our taxpayer dime they are released into our country.   For all of our Border Patrol agents, I want to say, I am sorry. I am  sorry that this administration does not have your back. I am sorry that  those on the left don't have your back. But please know that my  colleagues and I, we always will.    Let me be clear: This is not about legal immigration. This is about  fighting against illegal immigration and the criminals who are  profiting off of it.   Now, as we stand here laying down the facts of this crisis--and it  is, in fact, a crisis, despite the fact that this administration cannot  call it that--Americans around the country are probably wondering how  this affects them. They are outraged, sure, but how are they impacted  in their daily lives in their communities?   I have to tell you, every town in America is a border town. The  nearly one million individuals apprehended to date for this year are  coming to our hometowns.   In Florida, they estimate that 70 percent of the migrants that are  coming across are coming to Florida. Seventy percent are bound for my  home State of Florida. Yes, every town in America is a border town.   And you ask, how are they getting to our hometowns? On our dime.   The NGOs have government contracts. They buy plane tickets and bus  tickets, and then they submit reimbursement from FEMA on our dime in  our hometowns unchecked, unvetted, and coming to a town near you. Every  town in America is a border town.   And as they are on these planes, do they have to show ID? No. No,  they do not, because TSA has special guidance that these people are not  subject to the same requirements that every other American is when they  board an airplane.                                time  1245    They do not have to show photo ID. They do not have to prove who they  say they are. Yes, every town in America is a border town now.   And you wonder what happens when these folks get to our hometowns?  They use taxpayer-funded schools, taxpayer-funded medical facilities,  public safety resources. The list goes on and on. It is about enough to  make you sick.   Now when the left decides that taking care of unvetted, untested, and  totally dependent illegals is totally more important than taking care  of our veterans and some of our homeless veterans, I think that is when  we, as  [[Page H3829]]  Americans, and particularly, ``us,'' my colleagues, Republicans and  Democrats, need to stand up and say enough. Enough is enough. The  left's agenda is dangerous.   Clearly, they have turned every town in America into a border town  and defunded our police along the way. The very people who are fighting  to protect our hometowns. Drugs, crime--bring it on, they say. Never  mind the 93,000 Americans that lost their lives to drugs just last  year.   Mr. Speaker, I recently took about six sheriffs from my home State to  the border. I wanted my sheriffs in my area, to see exactly what they  were up against, because when there is a leak, you can mop all day  long, but until you fix the leak, the water will just keep coming. And  they saw firsthand really what is at stake. Our country is at stake.  And they said, right out the gate, every town now I see is a border  town. And let me be exceptionally clear, that you cannot protect your  hometown if you cannot defend the homeland, and that starts with  securing the damn border.   Yes, stopping this influx of crime and drugs and illegal activity  starts with securing our border. But if the crime and the drugs, the  negative impacts to our hometowns, our country, our society, our  culture, our kids, if the lack of support for our agents isn't enough  to convince every single one of my colleagues to take action, then  perhaps the horrific humanitarian crisis unfolding is; the trafficking  of children, maybe that is what it takes to inspire action from those  on the left.   Next here to me today you see this photo. This is a photo of a 3- year-old little girl. I took this photo on April 11 at 1:46 p.m.,  standing just outside McAllen at the border. The man holding her told  us--standing right there as he was being processed in the field--that  that was his little girl. He couldn't tell me her name, and she was so  scared, she couldn't even tell me her name, or anyone else with us. The  man told me and my colleagues that he and his daughter had been  traveling for 2 months.   Mr. Speaker, 12 hours later while standing in the Donna processing  facilities, Border Patrol agents who had processed and conducted an  interview with this man, told us that when they had threatened a rapid  DNA test on him because red flags kept popping up in his story, that he  admitted that that little girl--this little girl--was not his daughter.   She was someone else's daughter; someone who was willing to let their  child be used, trafficked--and in this case, it is called recycling.  Because this administration has policies that encourage children under  the age of six to be recycled, where they get matched up with criminals  so that they can be escorted across the border. That man--this man--was  turned back.   This little girl today is somewhere in the United States in the  custody of HHS away from her family, future unknown. Her story is not  unique. This is a regular occurring event; the recycling of children.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues: Are you okay with the recycling of  children? Is this administration okay with the recycling and  trafficking of children?   It is disgusting.   As I said, there are stories like this that go on for days. I,  myself, met a 9-year-old little girl who couldn't barely get the words  out to tell me her name and where she was from, because her vocal cords  had given out from screaming so loud, because she was being gang-raped  by the cartels. If that doesn't make your stomach turn, I don't know  what will.   President Biden, your administration has proven that while your words  are dangerous, your actions are deadly. Your administration has turned  every single town in America into a border town, and every American  should be outraged at their carelessness, the lack of regard for public  health, public safety, national security, and basic human decency.   Mr. Speaker, securing the border is not a Republican or a Democrat  issue. This is an American issue, and it should be our top priority. We  need to extend title 42. We need to reinstate the MPP policies. Put the  politics and the egos aside and do what is best for our country for the  first time in this administration.   Until then, for myself and my colleagues, who actually give a damn,  we will continue to craft legislation and put the words into action,  and do the thing that the majority and President Biden won't do, secure  the border.
