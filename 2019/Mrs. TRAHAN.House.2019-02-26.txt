 Mr. Speaker, I rise to commend the gentleman from  Arizona and his staff for their tremendous work on this bipartisan  bill.   I particularly appreciate its inclusion of a provision originally  authored by my predecessor, Niki Tsongas, to add the Nashua River to  the Wild and Scenic River System.   Seeking this designation has been a labor of love for the communities  in the watershed and local leaders like Marion Stoddart and Elizabeth  Ainsley Campbell.   I also value the bill's funding cap adjustment for Essex National  Heritage Area.   Finally, it is outstanding to see the bill's renewal of the Land and  Water Conservation Fund, a program that has benefited nearly every  corner of the Nation, including Minute Man and Lowell National Parks in  the district I grew up in and am proud to represent today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the bill's swift passage.
