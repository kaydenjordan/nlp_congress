 Madam Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R.  2622, a bill to amend the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to codify  certain Securities and Exchange Commission no-action letters that  exclude brokers and dealers compensated for certain research services  from the definition of investment adviser.   This bill provides statutory authority for specified Securities and  Exchange Commission (SEC) guidance allowing broker-dealers to receive  payments for research services provided to investment managers.   Under current law, broker-dealers that receive payments for  performing this service must register as investment advisors.   However, the SEC currently waives enforcement against these broker- dealers.   The current no-action relief, which was temporarily granted in 2017  by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has received multiple  complaints from investors and advocacy groups who have expressed  reservations about the current no-action relief.   This bill helps to address these concerns, correct the defects of the  current no-action relief, and resolve issues regarding the potential  expiration of the current relief.   H.R. 2622 helps to strengthen American capital markets by providing  U.S. brokers and dealers relief from undue external security market  regulations and prevent a reduction in investment research that can  potentially harm investment managers and the retail investor customers  that they serve.   This bill also helps to further strengthen the standard conduct of  investment advisory by ensuring that the best interests of customers  are protected without regard to the financial and other private  interests of brokers and dealers.   H.R. 2622 ensure that the SEC provides secure framework of rules and  regulations that help to enhance investors' confidence in the system  and safeguards their investment by ensuring transparency of the  records.   This bill provides more concrete measures for the over 15,000  Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs) to effectively carry out their  primary duties of providing tailored financial advice to their clients,  management of investment portfolios, and other services to the public.    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1548,  Improving Access to Small Business Information Act.   The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 regulates transactions of  securities in the secondary market.   The act typically governs transactions which take place between  parties which are not the original issuer, such as trades that retail  investors execute through brokerage companies.   The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 is a federal law designed to  reduce the total amount of paperwork burden the federal government  imposes on private business and citizens.   Under the Paperwork Reduction Act, agencies must comply with specific  procedures when gathering information from the public.   H.R. 1548 will amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to specify  that actions of the Advocate Small Business Capital Formation are not a  collection of information undue the Paperwork Reduction Act.   In other words, this bill excludes from the Paperwork Reduction Act  actions taken by the Office of the Advocate for Small Business Capital  Formation within the Securities and Exchange Commission.   The Office of the Advocate for Small Business Capital Formation does  hard work to provide an annual report to the United States House and  Senate to ensure that we understand the state of small business capital  formation.   The Office of the Advocate for Small Business Capital Formation will  continue to advocate for solutions to improve the capital raising  opportunities for the dreamers, builders, doers, creators, and  investors who you don't see in the headlines today.   For this reason, it is vital that we pass H.R. 1548.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my colleagues in  the Congressional Black Caucus, and I will continue to work with them  and proceed to analyze the very wrongheaded decision that was made by  the United States Supreme Court on the question of affirmative action.   I thank the gentlewoman from Florida, the gentleman from New York,  and, certainly, the gentleman from Nevada for their leadership.   I rise today as a clear recipient of affirmative action, particularly  in higher education. I may have been admitted on affirmative action,  both in terms of being a woman and a woman of color, but I can declare  that I did not graduate on affirmative action. This is my personal  story, but as I read the Supreme Court opinion led by Justice Roberts  and a number of Justices reading their opinion aloud, they really  skewed and misdirected what affirmative action is.   Affirmative action is affirmatively selecting out of the group  excellent persons who happen to be people of color who would not have  been noted, recognized, or accepted heretofore, and that is evident  because that did not happen in the 20th century, in the 19th century,  when African Americans, in particular, were not admitted to  institutions of higher learning such as Ivy League and other schools.   This very mean-spirited decision will close the door of opportunity  to many, from Latinos to Asians to African Americans to Anglos.   My plea tonight is that this Congress looks squarely at ensuring that  America and her cities are open to equal opportunity and that,  affirmatively, we ensure that everyone has a seat at the table of  empowerment.                            ____________________
