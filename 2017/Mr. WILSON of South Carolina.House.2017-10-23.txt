 Mr. Speaker, last week I traveled the  district and heard from constituents who are grateful for the historic  progress being made by the Trump administration creating jobs.   President Donald Trump has led a strong pro-business team. The  economy has added over 800,000 private sector jobs since January.  Consumer confidence is at a 13-year high. The number of unemployment  claims has plunged to the lowest level in over 40 years.   I appreciate the President can share the significance of the DOW  soaring above 23,000 points, up nearly 5,000 points, or 27 percent,  since election day, as you can see in his tweet on Wednesday.   The President's critics will never give him credit for American  families. Columnist Clarence Page has described the ``anti-Trump  derangement syndrome'' drives critics to irrational extremes.   But these critics can't dispute the facts. The fresh faces, fresh  voices, and fresh ideas that President Donald Trump has brought to  Washington is making a difference for American families.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
