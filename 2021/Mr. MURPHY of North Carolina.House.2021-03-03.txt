 Madam Speaker, thanks to Operation Warp  Speed, we now have a pathway out of the pandemic using anti-COVID  vaccines, but I want to share some more good news.   A new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine shows  that just one dose of the Pfizer vaccine has an efficacy of close to 93  percent. The clinical difference between 92 percent and 95 percent of  the two-dose regimen is minuscule.   If we gave everyone, except possibly the most vulnerable, just the  first dose, we could possibly double our supply immediately and thus  inoculate our citizens much faster. Using this strategy, we could  possibly prevent the spread of new variants and mutants and effect a  quicker end to this tragic pandemic, which has already cost hundreds of  thousands of lives in this country.   Yesterday, I joined some of my fellow physician colleagues, asking  the Health and Human Services Department to consider adopting this  strategy.   Acting now could prevent the spread of new variants and the further  spread of this tragedy, the kind of tragedy already felt and continuing  to be felt by thousands across this country.   Madam Speaker, I strongly urge the Health Secretary to follow the  science.
