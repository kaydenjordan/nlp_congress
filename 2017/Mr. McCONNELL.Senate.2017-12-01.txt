 From its inception, I have opposed the individual  mandate because it is simply wrong for the Federal Government to  require someone to purchase a particular product, particularly one they  do not want and cannot afford. I agree that Alexander-Murray can help  provide certainty and flexibility for State insurance markets in the  absence of the mandate and will support passage of the Bipartisan  Health Care Stabilization Act, ideally prior to the adoption of any  final tax reform conference agreement and certainly before the end of  this year.    I believe that State high-risk pools are a much better  alternative to Federal mandates. I will also support passage of your  bill and this funding to create high-risk pools, ideally prior to the  adoption of any final tax reform conference agreement and certainly  before the end of this year.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there now  be 30 minutes for debate only, with no amendments or motions in order,  with the majority leader being recognized at the conclusion of that  time.    Mr. President, I would say to my friend from Oregon  that there will be plenty of time for him to read it.    Mr. President, I say to my good friend from Oregon,  there were 4 days of hearings on the bill in committee with the  committee report sent out at least 2 weeks ago. I am totally confident  our friends on the other side are fully familiar with almost all  aspects of this. He will certainly have an opportunity to read the  final version, but he is very familiar with the various parts of this.  There was plenty of time to look at it in committee, and, as I said,  there will be plenty of time to read the final version of it before we  vote.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there now  be 30 minutes equally divided for debate only, with no amendments or  motions in order and with the majority leader being recognized at the  conclusion of that time.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to call up  amendment No. 1855; that the amendment be agreed to; that Senate  amendment No. 1618, as amended, be considered original text for the  purpose of further amendment; and that all points of order be  preserved. I further ask that all time be yielded back.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  following amendments be called up en bloc and reported by number:  Sanders No. 1720, Brown. No 1854, and Rubio No. 1850. I further ask  consent that the Senate now vote in relation to the Sanders amendment  and that following disposition of the amendment, the Senate vote in  relation to the above amendments in the order listed; finally, that  there be 2 minutes equally divided between the managers or their  designees prior to all further votes tonight and that they be 10  minutes in length.    Madam President, the next three votes will be in  relation to Sanders amendment No. 1720, Brown amendment No. 1854, and  Rubio amendment No. 1850.                              Amendment No. 1720     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator  Menendez be recognized to offer a motion to commit and that there be 2  minutes of debate, equally divided, prior to a vote on the motion.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following  the disposition of the motion to commit, the Cantwell amendment No.  1717 be called up and reported by number.    Colleagues, we are moving now to final passage.   I know of no further amendments to the bill.                        Amendment No. 1618, as Amended     Mr. President, I yield back our time.    Mr. President, I yield back the time on this side.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 495, Kirstjen Nielsen.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum call for the cloture motion be waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, the Senate vote on this cloture motion at  5:30 p.m. on Monday, December 4.
