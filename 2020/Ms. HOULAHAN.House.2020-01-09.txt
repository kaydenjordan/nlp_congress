 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the resolution before  us today.   Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution states: ``Congress shall  have the power to declare war.'' The Founders were unequivocal. Only  Congress has the power to authorize acts of war.   Today, we bring forth this resolution to honor our Founding Fathers'  vision for our country, for our government, one whose very survival  hinges on the separation of powers and each branch's respect for the  others' authority.   At this moment we, as a Congress, have an opportunity to pursue de- escalatory actions that protect the lives of our Armed Forces,  diplomats, and civilians. I implore the President and this  administration to work with this Congress in this effort.   Today marks this first step. We must aggressively pursue diplomacy so  that no lives are lost. I encourage all of my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle to join in that pursuit.   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. I urge a ``yes''  vote.
