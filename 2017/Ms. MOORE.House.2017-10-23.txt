 Mr. Speaker, I rise, along with the Wisconsin delegation,  to honor the former Congressman, Jerry Kleczka, my predecessor, who  passed away on October 8, 2017, at the age of 73.   He was a very serious, hardworking legislator who served on the Ways  and Means Committee. He had a strong work ethic. He was a particularly  fantastic steward of our seniors, and he was proud to serve the people  of Wisconsin's Fourth Congressional District.   I am pleased to stand here with my colleagues from the Wisconsin  delegation to honor his service to our Nation, to the State of  Wisconsin, and to the Fourth Congressional District, and I ask our  colleagues to join us in a moment of silence.                            ____________________
