 Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Nadler for yielding me the  time.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Clyburn for bringing this  resolution, and I want to thank the Republican leadership, Mr. McCarthy  and company, who have condemned white supremacist and white nationalist  language.   It is important that we come together and condemn this language  because, unfortunately, in Charlottesville, Virginia, we had Ku Klux  Klan people and neo-Nazis marching and saying: ``Jews will not replace  us in blood and soil.'' Our President said there were fine people on  both sides.   We must condemn bigotry, racial superiority, and hate whenever it  raises its ugly head so that it will not come back to bite us once  again.   So today, hopefully, in the House, we have done that. I commend my  Republican colleagues and Mr. Collins, and I hope that when hatred and  bigotry once against surface, raises its head, which it will, that we  will stand together as Americans to condemn it and not see fine people  on both sides.
