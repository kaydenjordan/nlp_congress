 Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Ellzey).            Recognizing Midlothian Innovative Learning Experience     Madam Speaker, I am going to do something this  evening that isn't sort of traditional for me because I mostly do  economics. I tried to do that circle of how everything ties together,  and I accept I get a little geeky. For those who are trying to keep an  eye on the history of our words, wave at me if I start speaking too  fast because I have had a lot of coffee today.   Today, I am going to try to talk about what I saw on the border last  week, but I am going to try to do it in a slightly different way. You  have had lots of us come up here--and I am going to do part of it; I am  going to show the boards and the numbers and all that.   In economics, there is this concept of a second-degree effect, a  third-degree effect. I wish I could come up with a definition for a  misery effect. The fact of the matter is, let's pretend it is really  done out of compassion. Let's pretend our brothers and sisters on the  left, this administration, their approach to the border is because they  are heartfelt, and they believe this is kind and compassionate. My  argument here is going to be really simple: Please think through your  definition of ``compassion.''   Now that we know there are functionally 700 migrants who have lost  their lives trying to cross the river, or when I was with the Border  Patrol last Wednesday in Yuma, Arizona, and the Border Patrol agent,  she was telling me of the heartbreak of finding a couple of children  dead in the desert just a few hundred yards from the border, how can  that be our definition of ``compassion''?   And then we are going to have to walk through the reality of the  misery you have brought to my State, my community.   Last Thursday, we did a roundtable with the true experts in our  community in regard to fentanyl and drug use. I was sitting next to a  mother who lost her teenage son by taking a single pill.   You have us come here and talk about the fentanyl crisis. Do you  understand the scale?   Phoenix has functionally become the distribution hub of North  America. One of the reasons--and I am going try to show it in the  numbers here. When the border is just crowded with populations coming  across it--and I stood there for a good 3 minutes, and there were 30- something people coming across the border. Over here were some other  migrants crossing over the dam. Over here is the Border Patrol agent  saying, I am in the concierge business. I basically take people, I walk  them over to the trucks, and we take them to processing, and when we do  that, whole sections over here on the border are left unmanned.   Then you wonder why a sergeant who is a Phoenix police officer, my  neighbor and friend, tells me a year ago it cost about $112 for some  poor soul to get high for the day. Today it is $12.   If you believe in basic economics, when the price crashes by 112 to  12, do you understand the depravity, the cruelty that Democrats'  definition of ``compassion'' has brought to our own communities?   I will try to do this--and I have done a version of this before--you  have got to think of the effects of the policy that the left is engaged  in. When you open up the borders, you get more drugs. If you get more  drugs, you are getting more homeless. If you are getting more homeless,  you have increased crime. And then you have deaths.   How many people in the last day or so have come behind these  microphones and said, Well, according to the latest statistics, we have  112 Americans who died of fentanyl that we know of. Well, our problem  in the Phoenix area is not only fentanyl, it is meth, and it is other  things.   How do I get the left to be willing to understand, if you love and  care about people, your version of compassion is cruel?   So let's actually walk through some of the obvious, and then try to  add a little bit of color and see if we can make this sort of come  together as an understanding.   First, let's just do the basic math. We are being told, Hey, we are  heading in this fiscal year already to almost a million people.   I had the experience last Wednesday of standing there. I have some  distant relatives who do some farming down in the Yuma area, so I am an  Arizonan, and I am at the border dozens of times.   I went and visited the Border Patrol station, and I know some of the  folks there, and I saw the faces of individuals who feel like they have  just been crushed. They are law enforcement, and they are not able to  protect the  [[Page H4605]]  border because they are functionally in the people management business.  They are taking people here and moving them over here so they can be  processed, so they can be let go, so they can get a return order 6  years from now. This is what is going on.    Then they turn to you and say, I am here to stop drugs and weapons  and potentially horrible people, terrorists, coming across our border,  and I am now functionally in the human transportation business. That is  what we have turned our Border Patrol into.   Then you meet with some of the Customs and Border Protection  officials, and they say, Yes, you know, fentanyl may be coming right  through the borders, but they only have to go several hundred yards  that way and there is no more Border Patrol because all of them are  taking care of people; you can just walk across.   Somewhere here I am going to try to do the other part of the  discussion, where we talk about potentially if that is a million in the  first half of the year, is it a couple million? Will the left have an  honest discussion with us of why their version of compassion has a  level of human exploitation that is really uncomfortable to talk about?   The agent I was standing there with turns to me and says, You  understand most of these people who are walking across right now are  going to spend the next few years of their life paying off the cartels,  those are the costs that they had to commit to to cross the border.   If they can't pay it off with a job that they are not allowed to  have, do they have to pay it off with their body?   Do they have to pay it off with smuggling, moving narcotics?   Is anyone here willing to take a step back from sort of the  radicalized ideology and say this is not compassion, this is cruelty?   We are functionally in the business of human exploitation right now,  that is our border policy. Yet, when we see numbers of border  encounters have increased 278 percent, it is just another guy coming  behind the microphone here and sounding like an accountant on steroids.   These are people. And is it enough that several hundred of them will  die at the border?   Is it enough that many of them are going to have to engage in  activities that are just absolutely exploitive to pay off the coyotes?   Is it enough that the cartels are now said to be making billions of  dollars on human smuggling? And they are using that money now to  actually build their own little factories, so they can make the  precursor chemicals for fentanyl and synthetic opioids because it is  cheaper than getting them imported from China?   We financed their Industrial Revolution.   Think about this: The left says, Well, inflation, these things are  supply chains. Well, dammit, they did a great job. We solved the cartel  supply chain. We financed them enough so now they can make their own  drugs from precursor chemicals all the way up to stamping the pill. You  have got to think about those second-degree, third-degree effects of  misery that really crappy policy brings.   Why have there been so many on the right and now a handful of  Democrats--who are obviously concerned about their elections and  realizing what they have embraced, but they are not willing to sign the  discharge petition on title 42--why are so many of us talking about  this: The Border Patrol--if you have an honest conversation with them-- will turn to you and say, We are maxed out. And if you double the  populations that are approaching the border because you functionally  have removed title 42 so they don't get sent back, they get processed,  it is no longer being overwhelmed, it is just a catastrophe. There  functionally will be no protection on our border, and once again, U.S.  policy is functionally financing the cartels. Congratulations.   The misery, the murders, the exploitation, which is U.S. policy. That  is functionally what we have done here, but you did it in the name of,  Well, this was compassionate. It is an amazing definition of  ``compassion.''   Now, let's actually get to some other bits of misery. This number is  a fraud. The reason this fentanyl number is--saying we have had 133  percent increase of capturing, collecting, stopping fentanyl at the  border--when you meet with law enforcement down on the border they say  most people we can't catch; we are too busy taking care of these  million--now 2 million potentially--people crossing the border.   What a great system.   Let's see. The cartels get to march people to the border. They may  get a few thousand bucks a head, so they get financed there. And  because Border Patrol and Customs and Border Protection are  overwhelmed, it creates these massive openings where you can just move  lots of narcotics across the border.   And here is what should be ripping your hearts apart: I got to sit  next to a mom who told the story of her teenage son taking a single  pill, a single pill that was stamped as something completely different,  and 2 hours later that mom didn't have a son anymore.   In Arizona, 95 percent of our kids that died in the previous year-- out of the 60 who died, 57 of them were from these fentanyl pills. Is  there any love and compassion and caring for these moms that have lost  their children? What is going on here?   Is the ideology of this administration of the Democrats here in the  House, are they so radically calcified that the definition of  ``compassion'' is the death of 57 Arizonan children? Is that really  where they are at? Because that is the outcome.   I don't know how else to humanize this story, but this is what we  have done. Yet, now we see some of our brothers and sisters on the  left, once again, saying, Well, we are actually concerned now, too. But  you notice they won't come sign the actual piece of legislation so we  can vote on it to actually stop that increase.                                time  1700    Forgive me, I can't stop myself with the charts.   Part of it, when you start seeing the explosion of increase--and it  is Arizona, it is my community that is the one that is crushed--when  you start seeing Arizona having a 79.5 percent increase in,  functionally, fentanyl pills crossing our border, and that is what is  captured.   Remember, I mentioned before I did the ride-along with the Phoenix  police sergeant? And in parts of the discussion he was saying, Yeah, it  is about $12 now for that heartbreaking, homeless person there sleeping  in that alley to get high for the day.   That is what we have done.   We have ZIP Codes now, I am being told, that the homelessness has  doubled in the last year.   And what is the consistent policy thing that happened in the last  year? The Democrats opened up the border.   So let's play economist for a moment.   What are the couple of things you do to make the working poor and the  poor, to make their life more miserable?   Okay. Inflation. We have done a great job at that.   Remember, one year ago, March, we functionally dropped another $1.9  trillion on the economy. You look at the charts and, boom, there goes  inflation. My community had functionally a 10.9 percent inflation  increase. I represent the community that had the highest growth of  inflation year to year.   Do you know how many people no longer can afford their apartment-- functionally, can't afford?   You are crushing the working poor.   But you can do more. You can open up the border. And this was  actually left-wing economists that wrote these papers about 10 years  ago. If you want to crush the working poor, import millions of people  with similar skill sets.   So one of the classic definitions of the profile of someone as  working poor is they may not have finished high school, but they are  selling their labor. They are out there hanging drywall, working their  hearts out, they are trying to find a way to get out. And now they are  going to compete against who knows how many people who are going to  work in the underground economy.   You have added millions of people with similar skill sets.   So how are they going to get the money to pay off their smugglers?  Don't you think they are going to be coming in the back door saying, I  will work for cash; I will do this and that?   Now you have other things that make the poor poorer: Crime, drugs,  [[Page H4606]]  someone stealing their stuff because they need money. And you look at  all those numbers. The Democrats are in their, what? Now, 15 months of  control. Every single number. Income inequality, the poor getting  poorer, misery, death, retirees getting poorer, the middle class  getting poorer.   Great job, guys. Great job.   Tell me something you have done that hasn't increased misery in this  country.   I know this is uncomfortable, but I am doing it on purpose. Sometimes  the smartest thing is to just stop what you are doing. Take a breath.  Maybe the ideology is a false ideology. Back up.   I am sorry the former President was into border security. But do you  remember a decade and a half ago when it was the hallmark of Democrats  that were concerned about illegal immigration?   Do you remember it was Republicans and Chambers of Commerce that  wanted to flood the country with cheap labor?   Isn't it amazing what happened here?   It was only about 15 years ago that the left were the protectors of  working men and women.   We will not flood the country with cheap labor.   We need our folks to be able to have a working wage.   Oh, we are going to open the border now because it is compassionate,  and we are going to screw up everyone's life.   What happened?   When did the Democrats abandon the middle class, the working poor? Is  it they weren't voting for them enough?   It is about the math. Now, we are moving beyond pounds, we are  heading towards tonnage in the amounts of fentanyl coming through my  State.   Let's put this in context.   You see this little picture right here, those few crystals there?  That functionally is enough to kill you. So that is a penny. Those?  That kills you.   When does this become terrorism? Because it is already functionally  killing our children.   Does anyone care?   Now, we have got to go just a little bit further down the rabbit  hole.   The border agents report over a thousand percent increase, and these  are the ones in Texas. The argument I was given by our friends at  Customs and Border Patrol is they are not catching much of it.   But it goes further. You have got to understand what has been  happening in my community. This is just one of a dozen headlines when  there is a bust and it is enough to functionally kill every single  person in my State.   There was a bust the night before we did our fentanyl roundtable.  There was enough to kill everyone in my county, and I have the third or  fourth most populous county in the Nation.   Do you understand the scale? When you have the experts here saying,  Well, David, you don't understand. Prices have so crashed, a couple of  years ago it would be several dollars a pill. Now it might be, at  wholesale, 45 cents a pill. When it gets that cheap, you want to try to  understand why it is in your elementary schools, your high schools,  throughout your community, and the homeless campuses.   That is the cascade effect.   So I'm begging the majority to just take a breath for a moment, back  away from the radicalized ideology and just take a breath and say, Do  you actually love and care about people?    Will you accept the misery, the death, just the dystopian devastation  that is happening in our communities right now because of an open- border policy? That is what it is.   And title 42 is not a solution. It is just trying to stop the  catastrophe.   Sign the discharge petition. Prove that your rhetoric actually fits  reality.   Or maybe the constituencies are now so gerrymandered and  intellectually calcified that you can't tell the truth.   Another chart that absolutely proves we have turned, functionally,  our legal apparatus to protect the Nation into, functionally, a  transportation service, ICE. Immigration enforcement is, functionally,  beyond the border in our communities. Those who got through, who were  not stopped, it is up to law enforcement.   How do you catch someone and functionally remove them from the  country?   You see where we were in 2019. And then you see where we were in  2020. And do you see the crash over here? These deportations?   Now, what is fascinating is this line way up here was actually even  further up during the Obama administration.   Did the left basically just crash this because the last President was  so hated by the left for protecting working men and women that if he  said it is Black, you had to say White? You had to walk away from it?   We would be elated to get back to the actual law enforcement  protection of the border numbers that were there during the Obama  administration.   There is this weird irony, and I just show this so folks understand  the bizarreness of Democrat management leadership of this government  right now.   So illegal immigration goes up--well, it is not immigration, it is  illegal captures at the border, presentations, those things--278  percent.   But legal, if the person had just got their Ph.D. in electrical  engineering at ASU and they can't process the paperwork, legal  immigration has crashed. So at the same time we get the complaints from  businesses that they can't hire anyone, that we need talent to grow the  economy.   As you saw the brilliance today, GDP actually fell pretty  substantially in the last quarter. Yay, Democrats are doing a great  job.   One of the factors of economic growth is when you bring in smart  people. Well, that has crashed but we are imparting massive numbers of  poverty into the country. That is the left's version of compassion.   I accept that some of this presentation is a little bit on the  aggressive, maybe slightly jerky side, but I don't have another way to  basically say, Is this really the Democrats' vision of America?   Is this really how you think we are going to make poor people less  poor, the working poor more prosperous, the middle class much more  prosperous?   The thought experiment is very simple. Anyone out there, contact my  office with something, give me a single thing in the last 15 months of  absolute Democrat control of this Congress, this government, that the  left has done that has turned out to actually be good for America, good  for working people, good for poor people. You have made rich people a  lot richer. Isn't that amazing?   Income inequality was shrinking dramatically in 2018, 2019, and the  first quarter of 2020.   Pandemic; Democrats take over--boom. All the things they told us that  they cared about basically have gone to crap. And the math is the math.  But as you all know, we work in a math-free zone.   And maybe at some point we will tie our hearts, our compassion, to  the actual facts. And when we do that, the really bad things that this  Congress and this White House are doing to the American people will  stop.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
