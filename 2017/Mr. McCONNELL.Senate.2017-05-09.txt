 Mr. President, the heroin and prescription opioid  epidemic is taking a heartbreaking toll on families and communities  across our country. Experts estimate that as many as 2 million  Americans are struggling with prescription drug addiction, with heroin  and opioid overdoses claiming an average of 91 lives every day.   We continue to read the devastating headlines, too, like one article  published by CNN entitled ``A Generation of Heroin Orphans.'' It told  the story of five Kentucky children living with their grandparents due  to their mother's addiction. Sadly, this family is not unique. Nearly 3  million grandparents or other relatives across the country are caring  for grandchildren. According to experts, this uptick in children left  without their parents is due, at least in part, to this epidemic. It is  one of the many reasons the heroin and prescription opioid crisis  requires continued action.   Americans across the country--law enforcement, nurses, family  members, and many others--have dedicated themselves to reversing this  crisis. Congress has taken significant steps to combat this growing  problem on a bipartisan basis. Through legislation like the  Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, CARA, and the 21st century  cures bill, we authorized important ways to help fight the opioid  epidemic through things like expanded education and prevention  initiatives, improved treatment programs, and we bolstered law  enforcement efforts. Implementation of these initiatives is already  helping to tackle this crisis.   I was proud to support these pieces of legislation because I knew  they could make a real impact in the fight against opioid abuse, and  they are. We were able to take another positive step just last week.  Congress passed an important piece of funding legislation, now law,  that is helping advance and support many of the programs Congress  authorized in CARA and the 21st century cures bill last year--programs  that can advance medical innovation  [[Page S2822]]  and promote research and treatment development.   That funding legislation dedicated significant new resources to the  fight against the opioid epidemic. It helped fund groundbreaking  research into the field of regenerative medicine. With its passage,  Congress took one more critical step forward in the advancement of  medical research and addiction treatment.   The Senate will soon have another opportunity to move ahead in the  fight against this devastating disease by voting to confirm Dr. Scott  Gottlieb to oversee the Food and Drug Administration.   The FDA plays a central role in the approval of new drug treatments  and therapies. An important part of the 21st Century Cures Act provided  an accelerated pathway for the FDA to approve regenerative medicines. I  look forward to having a Commissioner like Dr. Gottlieb, who is  committed to the development of groundbreaking medicines and treatments  to combat serious illnesses.   Additionally, the FDA will continue to be a crucial partner as States  like Kentucky continue their fight against the opioid epidemic. The FDA  plays an important regulatory and oversight role in combating this  crisis.   I have encouraged the agency to incentivize the approval of safer,  more abuse-deterrent formulations of drugs, and I am glad when they  have concurred. These types of constructive policy decisions show an  FDA that is ready to join the fight against heartbreaking disease and  opioid abuse, and I am proud to support that kind of rigorous oversight  from the agency.   Dr. Gottlieb has the necessary experience to serve in this key role.  Not only has he worked in hospitals, interacting directly with those  affected by disease and treatment, but he has also developed and  analyzed medical policies in both the public and private sectors. He  formed his perspectives on the dynamic public health sector by  overseeing medical research and innovation projects.   In 2005, Dr. Gottlieb was appointed the FDA's Deputy Commissioner for  Medical and Scientific Affairs. He also has served as senior adviser to  the FDA Commissioner and as the agency's Director of Medical Policy  Development.   As a practicing physician with a wealth of policy experience, Dr.  Gottlieb has the necessary qualifications to lead the FDA at this  critical time. The Senate voted to advance his nomination last night on  a bipartisan basis, and I look forward to his confirmation.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have two requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate.
