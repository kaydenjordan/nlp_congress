 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to deliver the 21st installment  of my farm bill impact series to highlight the tireless work of Kansas  wheat farmers. Kansas is known as the wheat State, and our State's  wheat farmers are feeding the world with their lifesaving commodity.  With more than 15,000 wheat farms across the State and 5 million acres  of wheat in the Big First District alone, our State leads the Nation in  wheat production.   Wheat harvest is underway in Kansas, which begins in the southern  part of our State and moves north over the next few weeks. As we speak,  Kansas farmers are working tirelessly in the face of record-breaking  drought to produce wheat, which is a staple for families in our country  and all over the world. This year's drought and market conditions have  caused Kansas producers to abandon the highest number of acres of wheat  since World War I. Over the past 5 years, Kansas wheat farmers have  harvested an average of 44 bushels per acre, but this year, USDA  predicts that farmers will harvest roughly 29 bushels per acre. That is  a 35 percent decrease.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Kansas wheat farmers and all our American  farmers for working tirelessly to keep our country's food secure and  self-determining as a Nation.                            ____________________
