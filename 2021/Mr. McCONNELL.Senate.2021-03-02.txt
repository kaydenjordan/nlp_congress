 Mr. President, there has been a lot of discussion  about the Democrats' decision to load up their partisan spending bill  with liberal items that are completely unrelated to the pandemic.   We are at a key turning point in this crisis. The Nation has just  endured a historically painful year. This virus has stolen half a  million American lives. It has thrown millions of children out of  classrooms and workers out of jobs.   But on every front there seem to be signs we are actually turning the  tide.  [[Page S967]]  New cases, hospitalizations, and deaths have been declining. The CDC  reports that one in five adult Americans has already received at least  one vaccine dose. That is 50-plus million people. One in 10 has gotten  both shots. And the supply of vaccines is continuing to ramp up with  yet another authorized just last weekend.   Meanwhile, science keeps confirming it is quite safe to get kids and  teachers back in the classroom with simple precautions that we can  accomplish right now. All indications suggest our economy is poised for  a roaring comeback for workers and for families.   This crossroads should give Washington a golden opportunity. We could  get together on a bipartisan basis like we did five times last year-- five times--and pass more targeted policies to help finish the fight  and get the American people their jobs, their schools, their lives, and  their country back.   A number of Senate Republicans went to the White House just days  after President Biden was sworn in, proposing we continue the streak of  overwhelming bipartisanship that has designed the COVID-19 response all  this time. Our Democratic colleagues said no; they wanted to go it  alone. And when you look at their partisan bill, you can certainly see  why.   Less than 9 percent of their massive proposal would go to the core  healthcare fight against COVID-19. Listen to this: Less than 1 percent  goes to vaccinations.   You see, they had to leave room for all the completely unrelated,  leftwing pet priorities, like sending $350 billion to bail out long- mismanaged State and local governments, multiple times the expert  estimate of COVID needs; things like massive expansion and ObamaCare  subsidies that would disproportionately benefit wealthier people;  things like handcrafted tweaks to Medicare so it pays more money to  just three States: Rhode Island, New Jersey, and the President's home  State of Delaware. You might call it a special kickback for the Acela  Corridor.   They had to make room to bankroll things like underground rail in  Silicon Valley, upgrading a bridge from New York to Canada, and giving  Planned Parenthood access to taxpayer money meant to rescue mom-and-pop  Main Street businesses.   Sadly, the parts that actually do relate to the pandemic aren't much  better. At the same time that Democrats refuse to follow the science on  in-person schooling, they want to pass a massive new set of deluxe  benefits for Federal Government employees, including 15 weeks of paid  vacation for folks whose children have the option--just the option--of  virtual or even hybrid learning.   They want to keep schools closed and then pay a special bonus only to  parents who are Federal employees because--because their schools are  closed.   Now, this isn't a recipe to safely reopen America. To the degree that  it even addresses the pandemic, it is more like a plan to keep it shut  down.   Mostly, it is just what Democrats promised almost a year ago: taking  advantage of the crisis to check off unrelated liberal policies.                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, on another matter, we recently  learned that Iran has balked at the prospect of direct nuclear  negotiations with the United States and Europe. This sort of resistance  and gamesmanship is nothing new. We have seen this before.   Iran has long flouted international restrictions on its nuclear  program, played hide-and-seek with U.N. inspectors, and failed to  disclose the full scope of its nuclear research. This happened before,  during, and after the Obama administration's Iran deal.   Now, thanks to the firm approach taken by the Republican  administration which restored much of the leverage President Obama had  thrown away, President Biden inherited a much, much stronger  negotiating position.   Let me make it clear. Republicans do not oppose nuclear diplomacy. We  hope the administration will secure a better, stronger, and more  lasting deal than President Obama's, but to do so, President Biden's  team must avoid the mistakes of the JCPOA.   Here is how you do that: coordinate closely with the partners and  allies who are most immediately threatened by Tehran; treat Congress as  a partner to be consulted, not a problem to be managed; and, most  importantly, don't give up any leverage for free.   Of course the mullahs are playing coy. They want concessions before  they even come to the table. In December, after President Biden was  elected, Iran's Parliament reaffirmed their intent to continue acting  out if sanctions were not eased.   Well, I hope it is only the Iranians and not the administration's  negotiators who need this reminder: Look, the United States holds all  the cards. President Biden is the Commander in Chief of a superpower.  There are no circumstances--none--in which Iran should get money for  nothing. And there is no need to rush into the talks.   The administration should take care not to squander our upper hand  just to spite the last administration, nor should President Biden's  team discount the value of the growing regional unity against Iran that  is embodied in the new Abraham Accords.   Every day, headlines remind the world of the threat Iran and its  proxies pose to peace and security. For example, the Iranian  journalist, Ruhollah Zam, was lured back to the region from Europe,  kidnapped, and hanged after a sham trial just in December.   The Lebanese activist, Lokman Slim, was an outspoken critic of  Hezbollah until he was shot dead in his car.   The regime has kept escalating its support of the Houthi rebels in  Yemen, sending in deadlier, longer range weapons, and inciting  terrorist threats.   The Houthis have escalated attacks on Yemen's neighbors, including in  civilian areas, and launched a military offensive that jeopardizes the  peace negotiations being undertaken by U.N. Special Envoy Martin  Griffiths.   Just last week, an Israeli civilian shipping vessel pulled into port  with gaping damage from a missile attack, and Tehran's pet militias in  Iraq have fired rocket barrages against our own American diplomatic and  military facilities. They are communicating to the Biden administration  in the mullahs' preferred language: violence.   Like I said over the weekend, President Biden is right to respond to  this threat by authorizing strikes against targets belonging to Iranian  proxy groups--the right decision--and he is right to recognize the need  for new binding and enforceable constraints on Iran's nuclear  capabilities, but, ultimately, we need a comprehensive approach to  confronting Iran. It must be built on bipartisan foundations to endure  for administrations and Congresses yet to come.   To get there--to get there, the administration must continue to meet  Iranian aggression from a position of strength and consult closely with  Congress for the sake of our own security and that of our friends and  partners in the Ayatollah's backyard.                            ____________________
