 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague, Chairman Goodlatte,  as he is leaving now to continue his quest, going out running to  another hearing, but I want to thank Chairman Goodlatte for all that he  has done and everything that he has expressed not only for our  committee, but also for this bill, and also for Mr. Nadler and his  support coming forward in this. We appreciate the work they have done  and what we are seeing today.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 756, the First Step Act.  This is historic legislation that will make our communities safer, save  taxpayer money, and start addressing the revolving door of  incarceration and crime by helping formerly incarcerated prisoners get  a second chance at life.   I have said this so many times over the last couple of years. This is  simply an M and M issue. This is about money and morals. This is about  doing good with the taxpayer dollar and also giving people a chance,  from a moral perspective, to have a second chance.                                time  1115    The legislation we are considering today is the culmination of  extensive work with our colleagues across the aisle and in the Senate.  I can proudly say that this is a truly bipartisan, bicameral bill.   I thank my friend and colleague Hakeem Jeffries, who has been  instrumental in this effort. We wouldn't be here today without his  commitment to improving not only the justice system but individual  lives. He has been a partner in many things, and this is the  culmination of a large step. I thank him for that.   This bill is the result of compromise reached through extensive  negotiations with the House, the Senate, and the White House, all of  which want to address serious problems within our Federal criminal  justice system.   The Federal prison population has increased from less than 25,000 in  1980 to over 183,000 today. Each year, tens of thousands of Federal  prisoners return to their communities after completing their sentences.  In fact, Mr. Speaker, if you take State, Federal, and local individuals  incarcerated, 95 percent of them, at some point, will come home.   That is a question for each of us. That is a moral imperative on each  of us, on how we are punishing and also how we are preparing them for  reentry. Unfortunately, almost half of these individuals reoffend after  release.   This cycle of recidivism drains taxpayer dollars, strains the limited  resources at the Department of Justice, and undermines community  safety.   First, this legislation will provide low-risk inmates with the  incentives and the resources they need to develop new skills and break  their bad habits so that they emerge from prison as Americans ready to  be productive members of society instead of repeat offenders.   Secondly, the legislation includes carefully tailored sentencing  reforms to address inherent disparities in our sentencing laws while  keeping violent criminals from the incentives and benefits of the bill.  Amending our sentencing laws requires care and balance, and I believe  the negotiations over this bill have resulted in that balance. After  many years of seeing how this has worked on the State level, through  many studies and many evidence-based approaches, we are seeing this  work.   Finally, the legislation includes the Second Chance Reauthorization  Act, authored by my friend and colleague Congressman Sensenbrenner.  This legislation will reauthorize and reform grant programs that have  been crucial to States working to improve reentrance services and to  increase public safety.   This is also sort of special from my perspective as well, for in my  home State of Georgia, Governor Nathan Deal, a former distinguished  Member of this body, went home and began spearheading criminal justice  reform legislation that has made Georgia safer while saving taxpayer  dollars.   States like Georgia, Texas, and South Carolina have shown us that you  can reduce both crime rates and incarceration rates through evidence- based approaches and carefully tailored sentencing laws.   The First Step Act, which is based on these States' successful  reforms, uses evidence-based approaches to drive down the recidivism  rate among Federal prisoners.   Also, Mr. Speaker, President Trump recently said this is an issue  that unifies people, and it has unified a broad range of my colleagues  in the Congress. Speaker Ryan has led on this issue for a long time,  and today's bill would not be possible without his work and the work of  Chairman Goodlatte, Congressman Jeffries, Sheila Jackson Lee, our  majority leader, and so many others.   As we continued on, it also transcended the House and went into the  Senate, where Chairman Grassley and Senators Cornyn, Perdue, Lee,  Durbin, and Whitehouse have negotiated tirelessly, and many legislators  have worked to reach this compromise.   Yes, it is a compromise. It is something that we have worked on and  studied and worked to find something that works for the American  people.   I would also like to thank Jared Kushner and the Office of American  Innovation for all their work and support in this legislation. When he  came to the table, he came to the table with a full-on passion to find  results and to get solutions. For that, Jared has been invaluable in  this process.   Mr. Speaker, when I came to Washington, I came to legislate. I came  to be a part of representing my district and my State and this country.  I am  [[Page H10363]]  proud that my colleagues and I were able to do so here with the First  Step Act, a bill that gives prisoners a second chance and makes  communities safer.   Finally, there is a group out there that is pretty amazing, a group  from both sides of the political spectrum: hundreds upon thousands of  advocates across the country, adding their voices to the reform effort.  Their commitment, focus, and drive helped us get to this point, and  today, we have a chance to move forward with historic, meaningful  legislation to improve lives, make communities safer, save taxpayer  money, and make the judiciary system fairer.   Mr. Speaker, as Members well know, none of us stand here without help  from others. I am blessed in my office to have people who are dedicated  to not only finding solutions but sticking with it.   Jon Ferro in my office, who is my counsel, has worked on this  tirelessly. In fact, Mr. Speaker, I am probably going to have to have  some days built in for him to take off because he has not slept much in  the last month. But he has tirelessly fought for this and worked with  both the Senate and the White House to make sure this is an approach  that will work and do what is intended.   And Erica Barker in my office, who, even with the trials of going  through her own law school experience, has been invaluable, along with  the rest of my office and the rest of the folks that we named already.   This is the time to pass something that makes sense, that has been  studied, that is backed up by evidence. It is a thing that the  Founders, I believe, had envisioned. We fight where we need to, but  when we can find agreement, we find agreement for the American people.    Again, Mr. Speaker, it is about ``M and M's.'' It is about monies and  morals, being smart on money and giving the people the chance that they  need.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner), who has provided such  leadership on this issue and many others for this Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Richmond), a gentleman who has become a  friend on this issue, one that I remember sitting in Houston talking  about this, and also to say, now it has become a reality.    Mr. Speaker, I inform the gentlewoman that we  are ready to close at this time, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, as we close up this debate, this is one of those times  when I really come to this well and understand and discuss from this  podium that those things we do here matter. There are so many times we  pass paper around this floor, we pass it and talk about bills in terms  of line numbers and what it will do here, the code numbers, but at the  end of the day, this is one that actually has faces behind the line.   It has the faces of those who are currently incarcerated that now  have a chance to have some programs so that when they do get out, they  go home and are productive citizens.                                time  1145    It has faces behind the lines of those right now who will be making  mistakes, making bad choices even as we speak here on this floor, Mr.  Speaker, but will have the opportunity to have a redemption in their  life.   We have heard opposition, and there have been some others who have  opposition. It has even been said, ``You are soft on crime; you are not  helping law enforcement''; although, we have folks like the  International Association of Chiefs of Police, Fraternal Order of  Police, National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives,  National District Attorneys Association, some that don't want to come  on, and I understand that.   But I stand before you as a son of a Georgia State Trooper, someone  who has been there when I watched my father go out and do his job when  others didn't want to, when I know that this bill will help in the long  run not only helping with not only the redemptive part, but also making  sure that when people come out, they are not committing more crimes.  When we are saving money and helping people, we are helping law  enforcement do their job when we understand this.   I have also heard from others who have sort of dismissed the data  from States that said that this is not something that is evidence  based. It is working in conservative States. It is working in some  liberal States, but it is working in places like Georgia and Texas and  Oklahoma and Kentucky. This is where this works.   Some said, ``Well, we don't need to do anything because we need to  punish them.'' Some are so looking backwards that all I will say to  this is, Mr. Speaker, how is it working for us right now?   Over 50 percent of these folks are recidivizing a short time after  getting out of prison. These are folks going back in and committing  more crimes. If we can do something to stop that, then this is  something worth standing for; this is worth the time and the effort.   When we come here today, we come here today to go back to the old  principle that I said is about M and M,  [[Page H10366]]  money and morals, and that is the best place to be, Mr. Speaker.   I urge adoption of this act, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  concur in the Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 5075) to encourage,  enhance, and integrate Ashanti Alert plans throughout the United  States, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the Senate amendment is as follows:   Senate amendment:         Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the       following:       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 5075, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5075, the  Ashanti Alert Act of 2018.   This bill directs the Department of Justice to establish a national  communications network, the Ashanti Alert Communications Network, to  support the regional and local search efforts for missing adults. It  fills the gap between the AMBER Alert and the Silver Alert.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congressman Scott Taylor for championing  this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous materials to H.R. 7093, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is in part a response to the work of the  current committee's Over-Criminalization Task Force. The Judiciary  Committee created this task force to look at the growing problems of  over-criminalization and over-Federalization of criminal law.   The bill before us adheres to these principles by eliminating several  sections of the Federal Criminal Code that have either never been  charged, criminalized conduct that should not land someone in Federal  prison, such as unauthorized use of the Woodsy Owl image or slogan, or  both.   This is a sensible, good-government measure, and I urge my colleagues  to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I would also like to thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Chabot) for his work on this bill, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of H.R. 7093,  and I yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous materials on S. 2896, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I support S. 2896, the JACK Act. This bill applies to  the penalties for failure to disclose under the Lobbying Disclosure  Act, failure to disclose State or Federal court convictions for the  offences of bribery, extortion, embezzlement, fraud, and tax evasion.   Mr. Speaker, I would urge all my colleagues to support this bill, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of S. 2896, and  I yield back the balance of my time.

(b) Federal Immunity.--        (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of       law, any individual making a good faith report to appropriate       authorities of a suspected or known instance of child abuse       or neglect, or who otherwise, in good faith, provides       information or assistance, including medical evaluations or       consultations, in connection with a report, investigation, or       legal intervention pursuant to a good faith report of child       abuse or neglect shall not be subject to civil liability or       criminal prosecution, under any Federal law, rising from       making such report or providing such information or       assistance.        (2) Presumption of good faith.--In a Federal civil action       or criminal prosecution brought against a person based on the       person's reporting a suspected or known instance of child       abuse or neglect, or providing information or assistance with       respect to such a report, as described in paragraph (1),       there shall be a presumption that the person acted in good       faith.        (3) Costs.--If the defendant prevails in a Federal civil       action described in paragraph (2), the court may award costs       and reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the defendant.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous materials on S. 2961, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation takes a number of positive steps to  protect children; for example, it reauthorizes the appropriation of  Federal grant funds until 2023 for the Department of Justice programs  to prevent child abuse and assist victims of such crimes.   In doing so, the bill also provides important liability protection  for mandatory reporters such as, and including, pediatricians,  educators, and law enforcement. This will protect these individuals  from criminal and civil liability from not just reporting suspected  child abuse, which they are mandated to do, but also for assisting with  investigations of suspected child abuse.   Mr. Speaker, as a father, I can think of no greater responsibility  than protecting the most vulnerable among us, our children.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, again I just want to emphasize it couldn't be a better  day for us, especially with the First Step Act and the things we are  moving forward on criminal justice. I join the gentlewoman from Texas  in saying this is a good bill, and I urge adoption.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
