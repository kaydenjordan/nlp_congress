 Mr. Speaker, the United States of America is known  for many things. It is known for its integrity, its honesty, and its  high moral compass.   We are well aware that the United States intelligence community is  united in its assessment that Russia attacked our Nation in 2016, and  interfered in our elections. In response, President Obama imposed  sanctions on the Russian Government and personnel entities, including  intelligence services. He also expelled dozens of Russian officials  from the United States. Now, we know that General Flynn, in violation  of many laws, intruded and discussed these issues with the Russian  Ambassador.   His departure does not end this investigation. Who knew what, when?  When did the President know it? The integrity of this country is higher  and more superior than one individual.   Why, when other Presidents have used Camp David and the White House  for international diplomacy most often, did we have, over the past  weekend, the embarrassment of international and national security  issues, and personnel being filmed in an ordinary restaurant owned by  the President?   Finally, let me say, with the many hundreds of thousands of DACA  children who need relief, the question is: Can the President attend to  serious business fighting for these young people and saving lives?                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues and my fellow  Americans can see what is even greater about this country in its far- reaching wildlife and open areas.   I rise in strong opposition to H.J. Res. 69 because I do think it is  important that we be good custodians of what has been given to us. Yes,  to protect those humans who have come to be in places where wildlife  was, but to be good custodians.   The rule that was adopted years ago after public engagement from many  different people is reasonable and rational:   Denning of wolves and their pups, shooting or trapping them while at  their dens in the spring; using airplanes to scout land and shoot  grizzly bears; trapping of grizzly bears and black bears with steel- jawed leghold traps and wire snares--this is what that rule prevents-- luring grizzly bears with rotting meat, sugar, and pet food to get a  point-blank kill; denning of black bear mothers and cubs during  hibernation.   It reminds me of the time that I came to the floor last year to stand  against a horrible killing of Cecil the lion by someone who wanted a  trophy.   So let me tell you about the lesson from Dr. Ed Schmitt, a retired  surgeon, a hunter, who moved to Alaska from Colorado to fish in the  river that flowed by his house, to be able to hunt. He enjoyed fishing  for salmon, casting for salmon, and seeing the brown bears, also known  as grizzly bears. Here is what he said:   ``'Most of us that live in Alaska are here because we recognize that  it has something that the rest of the world doesn't,' says Mr. Schmitt,  president of the Alaska Wildlife Alliance, which is working with the  HSUS to protect animals from trophy hunting abuses. `The wildness can  be destroyed by people. We've stopped seeing the wildlife because we've  made it go away.'''   He further said: ``It's not true that all Alaskans are OK with the  state running rampant on public lands.''    `` `It's not true that all Alaskans are OK with the  state running rampant on public lands,' he says. `Only a minority of  Alaskans are hunters, and even fewer kill animals just for a trophy.'  ''   This is Dr. Schmitt, a hunter. This is not a tree hugger. He is a  hunter who moved to this beautiful land that we can call America. So  many Americans on the mainland, in essence, go to this beautiful,  connected Alaska, and so Dr. Schmitt goes on to say, like most hunters  in Alaska, he is appalled at practices that have been raised up to not  save the beauty of these wild animals. ``'The notion that people don't  want any rules is a myth. We want good rules, just like everybody  else.'''   Well, I want to stand alongside of Dr. Ed Schmitt, a healer, a former  doctor, a hunter who moved to Alaska, who understands that what we are  seeking to disapprove is wrong because it was a reasoned response to  all who were engaged in this area.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.J. Res. 69, a  congressional resolution rescinding a final rule promulgated by the  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) to prevent widely criminalized,  cruel, and unsporting hunting methods of killing wolves, grizzly bears,  and other native mammals on 76 million acres of federal lands in  Alaska.   I oppose the disapproval resolution because it subverts the judgment  of professional wildlife managers, and allows appalling methods of  killing animals on public lands designated for wildlife.   The FWS rule does not apply to subsistence hunting or sport hunting  in general; it simply restricts methods of killing that are not suited  anywhere, least of all on national wildlife refuges.   The rule, adopted after years of public engagement and with the  support of many Alaskans, bans the following practices:   1. Denning of wolves and their pups--shooting or trapping them while  at their dens in the spring;   2. Using airplanes to scout, land and shoot grizzly bears;   3. Trapping of grizzly bears and black bears with steel-jawed leg  hold traps and wire snares;   4. Luring grizzly bears with rotting meat, sugar, and pet food to get  a point blank kill; and   5. Denning of black bear mothers and cubs during hibernation.   H.J. Res. 69, if adopted, would prevent the Administration from ever  issuing a rule on this topic, foreclosing our Federal wildlife managers  from regulating these activities in any way under current law.   The decision to ban these cruel hunting practices came directly from  professional wildlife managers from the FWS based in Alaska and is  consistent with science-based wildlife management practices.   In addition, the FWS statutory mandate requires that the agency  conserve wildlife species.   The FWS appealed to the Alaska Board of Game dozens of times to amend  its rules to ensure that the FWS statutory mandate was being followed.   The Board of Game's continued refusal to do so forced FWS to initiate  this rulemaking to ensure that its statutory mandate of conserving  wildlife species on National Wildlife Refuges in Alaska is followed.   Mr. Speaker, a statewide poll conducted in February 2016 showed  Alaskans opposed denning of wolves by more than a 2-to-1 margin.   The poll showed that Alaska voters strongly support eliminating these  cruel and unsporting methods of killing native carnivores on National  Wildlife Refuges in their state.   Additionally, at a series of public meetings on the rule, many  Alaskans turned out to publicly support the rule because they want  these inhumane, unsustainable, unsporting practices to end.   Mr. Speaker, another reason to oppose H.J. Res. 69 is that it would  damage wildlife tourism and hurt the economy of Alaska.   These are federal lands, maintained with federal taxpayer dollars,  and millions of Americans travel to Alaska each year for the unique  opportunity to see bears, wolves, caribou, lynx, and other species on  these lands.   Wildlife watchers contribute over $2 billion to the economy of  Alaska--five times more than the amount generated in Alaska from  hunting activity.   The wildlife within our National Wildlife Refuges is a national  resource and Americans across the country care about protecting it for  future generations of Americans.   For these reasons, I strongly opposed H.J. Res. 69, and urge my  colleagues to join me.   I ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this disapproval and to support  and stand with these beautiful animals.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the article, ``The Fight to  Protect Alaska's Predators,'' and an article regarding Safari Club.          [The Humane Society of the United States, Oct. 19, 2016]                  The Fight To Protect Alaska's Predators                            (By Karen E. Lange)         Ed Schmitt, a retired surgeon, moved to Alaska to       experience the wild. He left Colorado for the Kenai       Peninsula, south of Anchorage, where he could fish in a river       that flowed right outside his house and hunt, he says, in a       way that respects wildlife and the environment. Schmitt       enjoyed casting for salmon and seeing brown bears, also known       as grizzly bears, fishing nearby.        He never wanted to kill them. But over 25 years,       development and new roads ate away bear habitat. And a       different mentality from Schmitt's, one that treats large       predators as  [[Page H1265]]       creatures to be eliminated so populations of moose and       caribou can flourish, took its toll on the Kenai's brown       bears. Schmitt hasn't seen one in three years.        ``Most of us that live in Alaska are here because we       recognized that it has something that the rest of the world       doesn't,'' says Schmitt, president of the Alaska Wildlife       Alliance, which is working with The HSUS to protect animals       from trophy hunting abuses. ``The wildness can be destroyed       by people. We've stopped seeing the wildlife because we've       made it go away.'' A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service rule       released in August aims to preserve the state's biodiversity       by banning cruel and unsporting hunting methods on the 76       million acres of Alaska's federal national wildlife refuges.       (Last year, the National Park Service issued a similar rule       for the more than 20 million acres of federal preserves       within the state). Under the rule, supported by The HSUS and       a network of scientists and local advocacy groups, hunters       will no longer be able to bait brown bears, trap brown or       black bears or use a plane to find bears from the air and       then immediately land and shoot them. In addition, trophy       hunters will not be allowed to kill black bear mothers and       cubs or wolf and coyote mothers and pups in their dens       (subsistence hunters are exempt). And ``predator control''       programs, which let hunters kill greater numbers of       carnivores in the hope the populations of prey animals such       as caribou will increase, won't be permitted in national       wildlife refuges.        ``This is the first time the federal government has stood       up to the state of Alaska's brutal practices in 37 years,''       says Wendy Keefover, HSUS native carnivore protection       manager, who led meetings on the rule in Anchorage, Juneau       and Fairbanks to encourage constituents to speak out.        An HSUS poll in March showed a majority of Alaskans support       these restrictions, and the Fish and Wildlife Service says       most people who submitted comments favored the rule. The       change came despite well-financed campaigns by the NRA and       Safari Club International against it, and the opposition of       the hunters, trappers and hunting guides on the state's Board       of Game, as well as Alaska's representatives in Congress.        HSUS Alaska state director Michael Haukedalen says the       number of residents who rallied to support the rule shows       there's a constituency for reform. ``It's not true that all       Alaskans are OK with the state running rampant on public       lands,'' he says. ``Only a minority of Alaskans are hunters,       and even fewer kill animals just for a trophy.''        In the 1980s and 1990s, citizen ballot initiatives passed       bans on cruel and unsporting hunting practices. However,       these were later overridden by the state legislature and       governor. In 1994, the legislature enacted a law requiring       the state's Department of Fish and Game to practice       ``intensive management'' of predators if caribou, moose and       deer populations dropped below certain levels.        For 10 years federal officials tried to negotiate with the       Alaska Board of Game to protect wolves and bears from       egregious hunting practices, says biologist Francis Mauer,       retired from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.        ``It's this ever-increasing fervor to kill predators in       Alaska,'' he says. ``The federal agencies realized these       hunting practices are inconsistent with the purpose for which       the parks and reserves were established, and they had a       responsibility to act.''        The fight against hunting abuses has now shifted to       Washington, D.C., where Rep. Don Young (R-AK) got riders into       House appropriations and energy bills that would undo both       the Fish and Wildlife and National Park Service rules.       Similar language was slipped into a Senate appropriations       bill. The HSUS and other groups are encouraging Congress to       reject these riders before sending the bills to the       president.        Schmitt says he, like most hunters in Alaska, is appalled       by the practices the Fish and Wildlife Service has banned.       ``The notion that people don't want any rules is a myth. We       want good rules, just like everybody else.''                                   ____                       [From the Clarion, Feb. 9, 2017]      Safari Club Sues Over National Park, Wildlife Refuge Regulations                            (By Elizabeth Earl)         The Safari Club International has filed a lawsuit against       the U.S. Department of the Interior, the Fish and Wildlife       Service and the National Park Service over its hunting rules       on federal lands in Alaska.        The nonprofit, one of the largest hunting advocacy       organizations in the country, is challenging a set of rules       the three organizations enacted in 2016 to restrict hunting       and trapping practices on national preserves and on national       wildlife refuges in the state, specifically on the Kenai       National Wildlife Refuge. The rules conflict with the state's       ability to manage wildlife and interfere with Alaskans'       ability to hunt and trap, among other impacts, according to       the lawsuit filed Jan. 19 in U.S. District Court for Alaska.        The federal government owns more than half of Alaska,       managed by a smattering of different federal agencies. The       U.S. Department of the Interior manages national wildlife       refuges through the Fish and Wildlife Service and national       parks and preserves through the National Park Service. Taken       together, NPS manages about 54 million acres of the state,       and Fish and Wildlife manages about 76.7 million acres.        Specifically, the lawsuit takes issue with a rule that bans       predator control activities on national wildlife refuges       ``unless based on sound science and in response to a       conservation concern or is necessary to meet refuge purposes,       federal laws or (Fish and Wildlife Service) policy,''       according to an Aug. 3, 2016 press release about the rule.        The National Park Service's rule, which was finalized Oct.       23, 2015, prohibits the taking of brown bears over bait and       the take of wolves and coyotes between May 1 and Aug. 9,       which is designated as denning season, and eliminating the       ``temporary'' closure category for national preserves in       Alaska, which previously expired after 12 months. The lawsuit       claims these closures allow Alaska personnel ``unlimited       discretion'' to close areas to sport hunting without       providing rulemaking notice or public comment opportunities.        The lawsuit also claims the consequences of the National       Park Service's actions extend beyond its boundaries because       the predators and prey do not remain within the boundaries of       the national preserves.        ``The NPS exceeded its statutory authority in promulgating       the NPS Regulations, as the regulations illegally override       the State's authority to regulate the methods and means of       taking Alaska's wildlife,'' the lawsuit states.        The complaint against Fish and Wildlife's general rule       prohibiting predator control activities on Alaska national       wildlife refuges is for similar reasons. On the Kenai       National Wildlife Refuge specifically, which covers a broad       swath of the Kenai Peninsula between the Russian River and       the community of Sterling and stretches down toward the Fox       River Flats on the southern peninsula, the lawsuit objects to       the public use restrictions that prohibit some plane and       motorboat use and lynx, coyote and wolf hunting within the       Skilak Wildlife Recreation Area and prohibit bear baiting for       brown bears, require a permit for baiting black bears and       prohibit using a dog to hunt big game except for black bears,       with a special use permit, among other rules.        The lawsuit claims that neither the National Park Service       nor Fish and Wildlife completed the proper National       Environmental Protection Act processes for their regulations.        The lawsuit asks for the court to declare all the       regulations as invalid and enjoin the agencies from enacting       the regulations.        The suit was filed less than a week after the State of       Alaska filed its own lawsuit against the same rules. The       state's suit claims very similar grievances against the       rules, saying it breaches the state's ability to manage its       wildlife effectively, according to a news release from Gov.       Bill Walker's website.        The Safari Club International supports the state's lawsuit       but chose to file its own anyway, said Safari Club       International President Larry Higgins in a statement. The       Safari Club's lawsuit focuses more specifically on the rights       of nonsubsistence users than the state's lawsuit and contains       complaints specific to the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge       rules, which the state's lawsuit does not, he said.        ``Safari Club concluded it was necessary to file its own       lawsuit to represent and protect fully the interests of its       members and others who hunt in Alaska for subsistence and/or       for nonsubsistence purposes,'' he said. ``Both lawsuits       challenge regulations adopted by the Obama Administration       that prohibit certain hunting methods on National Preserves       and National Wildlife Refuges.''        The main issue the group has with the rules is state       wildlife management, said Eddie Grasser, the vice president       of the Safari Club's Alaska chapter. All successful wildlife       management in the U.S. is based on state management, he said.        ``The main emphasis for our part, anyway, is the issue of       state management,'' he said. ``We don't feel the federal       government has the authority to manage wildlife because of       the way the system has evolved over time.''        Higgins said in his statement that the club will support       the state's legal efforts as well.        ``To the extent possible, Safari Club will work       cooperatively with the State, and others who may decide to       challenge the regulations, to present the best arguments to       the court,'' he said.        The National Park Service had no comment on the Safari       Club's lawsuit and the Fish and Wildlife Service did not       respond to a request for comment Thursday.     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her  leadership.   This is not about States, and it is not about the Federal Government.  It's about women and the rights of women. H.J. Res. 43 could impact  nearly 4 million primarily low-income patients that receive family  planning services at title X sites, annually, across the United States.   Of those 4 million patients, approximately 69 percent had incomes at  or below the Federal poverty line, while 61 percent of those patients  claimed the title X clinic as their only regular source of health care.  About 60 percent of women who access care from family planning health  centers consider it their main source; 4 in 10, it is their only source  of care.   Approximately 1.5 million Planned Parenthood patients benefit from  the Nation's family planning program. Approximately 20 percent of these  patients identify as Hispanic and approximately 50 percent as African  Americans.   Every public dollar invested in Planned Parenthood, $7.09 is saved in  Medicaid-related costs. Planned Parenthood centers are roughly one- third of the program's clients, although Planned Parenthood health  centers comprise 10 percent of the publicly supported safety and family  net.   This resolution for which we should vote ``no'' is going to take away  money from people who are in need, who need  [[Page H1272]]  health care. Where are the Republicans on women's rights?   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.J. Res. 43, a  congressional resolution rescinding a rule promulgated by the U.S.  Department of Health and Human Services providing important protections  to ensure that women, men, and young people can see trusted  reproductive health care providers, like Planned Parenthood, through  the Title X family planning program.   I oppose the disapproval resolution because it is nothing more than a  blatant attempt to persecute Planned Parenthood and make it easier for  the state politicians to take away people's health care, specifically,  the four million people who rely on Title X for birth control and other  care.   From birth control, to well-woman exams, to cancer screenings,  millions of Americans nationwide turn to Planned Parenthood and other  safety net reproductive health providers as their trusted source of  health care.   Many of these Americans, including low-income women, women of color,  and those living in rural areas, are uninsured and rely on important  public health programs for affordable health care, including Medicaid  and the Title X family planning program.   But their access to health care is under attack across the country  because in recent years because politicians in at least 14 states have  taken action to block access to care through Title X, willfully  ignoring the law, the recommendations of public health experts, and the  clear and present need in their communities.   In September 2016, HHS issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM)  titled ``Compliance With Title X Requirements by Project Recipients in  Selecting Subrecipients'' aiming to explicitly bar these types of  actions.   HHS opened the proposed regulation to public comment, which closed in  October 2016 and garnered widespread support, with 91% of the roughly  145,000 responses in favor of the rule.   Madam Speaker, Title X provides lifesaving, preventive care to  millions of people and is cost-effective.   Title X helps ensure more than four million persons of low-income  have health care in this country.   In fact, Title X is the only way that millions of low-income women or  uninsured women have access to birth control, cancer screenings, STI  tests, and other basic care.   Eighty-five percent of the people served by Planned Parenthood's  family planning program have incomes below 200 percent of the federal  poverty level, and 48 percent are uninsured.   In 2015 alone, Title X provided nearly 800,000 Pap tests, breast  exams to 1 million women, nearly 5 million tests for STIs, and 1  million HIV tests.   About 60 percent of women who access care from a family planning  health center consider it their main source of health care; for 4 in  10, it is their only source of care.   Approximately 1.5 million Planned Parenthood patients benefit from  the nation's family planning program, 78 percent of whom live with  incomes of 150 percent of the federal poverty level or less, the  equivalent of $35,775 a year for a family of four in 2014.   Approximately 20 percent of these patients identify as Hispanic; and  approximately 15 percent identify as African American.   For every public dollar invested in family planning, $7.09 is saved  in Medicaid-related costs; that is savings to both federal and state  governments and taxpayers.   Planned Parenthood health centers serve roughly one-third of the  program's clients, although Planned Parenthood health centers comprise  10 percent of publicly supported safety net family planning centers.   Planned Parenthood health centers are located in the communities  where access to care is most needed.   More than half of Planned Parenthood's health centers across the U.S.  are in rural and underserved communities with limited access to health  care.   Seventy-five percent of Planned Parenthood patients have incomes at  or below 150 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL).   The idea that other providers could absorb Planned Parenthood's  patients has been resoundingly dismissed by experts.   In fact, the American Public Health Association called the idea  ``ludicrous.''   Planned Parenthood health centers are also considerably more likely  to offer Title X patients a broader range of contraceptive methods than  other providers.   In a study of Community Health Centers (CHCs), among CHCs that  reported an independent family planning clinic in their largest site's  community, 69 percent reported referring their patients to providers  specializing in reproductive health services, like Planned Parenthood  health centers, for family planning care.   H.J. Res. 43 is a blatant effort to embolden states to try to block  women from getting birth control and other preventive care at highly  qualified family providers.   By issuing this important protection, the Obama Administration made  sure that politicians cannot ignore the law and stand in the way of the  care that women need.   I urge all Members to vote No on H.J. Res. 43.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter and article in  opposition to this resolution.     =========================== NOTE ===========================        February 16, 2017, on page H1272, the following appeared: Madam  Speaker, I include a letter . . .      The online version has been corrected to read: Madam Speaker, I  include in the Record a letter . . .    ========================= END NOTE =========================                                                   February 14, 2017.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Senate Majority Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles Schumer,      Senate Minority Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Leader McConnell, Speaker Ryan, Leader Schumer and       Leader Pelosi: As organizations committed to improving access       to health care for all people, the undersigned groups write       to strongly oppose H.J. Res. 43 and S.J. Res. 13, legislation       to overturn the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services       (HHS) final rules updating the regulations governing the       Title X family planning program. This critical rule clarifies       and reinforces the longstanding requirement that health care       providers may not be excluded from the program for reasons       unrelated to their qualifications to perform Title X-funded       services.        The Title X family planning program is a vital source of       family planning and related preventive care for low-income,       uninsured, and young people across the country. Every year,       more than 4 million individuals, including LGBTQ people and       people living in rural and medically underserved areas,       access life-saving care such as birth control, cancer       screenings, and testing for sexually transmitted infections       (STIs) including HIV at Title X-funded health centers. Title       X cannot succeed unless states and other Title X grantees       include providers that are optimally qualified to furnish the       range of Title X-funded services according to national       standards of care. This task becomes all but impossible if       experienced, reputable reproductive health care providers are       arbitrarily barred from fair consideration.        An increasing number of states have nevertheless tried to       block trusted reproductive health care providers from       participating in Title X. To date, at least 14 states have       taken official action to target and exclude otherwise       eligible providers from the program. Other states have       threatened to follow suit. Mounting evidence shows that the       exclusion of reproductive health care providers from publicly       funded health programs harms health outcomes, widens       disparities, and erects new barriers to care. When the very       providers that are best suited to deliver Title X-funded       services are targeted for exclusion based on factors wholly       unrelated to the program's objectives, federal health care       resources are poorly and inefficiently distributed and care       is less likely to reach individuals in need.        Ideological exclusions of trusted, highly qualified       providers from federally supported health programs undermine       health care access and jeopardize the health of the patients       these programs serve. Title X patients deserve the       opportunity to obtain high-quality family planning care from       the providers that are best equipped to provide it. As such,       we strongly support HHS's rule reinforcing that grantees must       design their provider networks based on the ability to       provide care to Title X patients in an effective manner--not       based on the political preferences of state lawmakers.        We strongly urge you to oppose H.J. Res. 43 and S.J. Res.       13, legislation that will overturn this important rule and       embolden states to attempt to block women from getting birth       control and other preventive care at highly qualified family       providers.

But the clinic closed in October, along with more than a       dozen others in the state, after financing for women's health       was slashed by two-thirds by the Republican-controlled       Legislature.        The cuts, which left many low-income women with       inconvenient or costly options, grew out of the effort to       eliminate state support for Planned Parenthood. Although the       cuts also forced clinics that were not affiliated with the       agency to close--and none of them, even the ones run by       Planned Parenthood, performed abortions--supporters of the       cutbacks said they were motivated by the fight against       abortion.        In December, the Department of Health and Human Services       finalized a rule that would prohibit states from withholding       federal funds--including Title X family planning money--from       Planned Parenthood. On Monday afternoon, a Republican senator       introduced a bill that would reverse it, along with a second       bill that would prohibit Planned Parenthood from receiving       any federal funding--including Medicaid.        The bills, from Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), would redirect       federal funds away from Planned Parenthood to other health       care providers. The Hyde Amendment already prohibits federal       funds from being used for most abortions, but this       legislation would bar low-income women who rely on Medicaid       and Title X funding for subsidized care from obtaining other       women's health care services at Planned Parenthood.        ``With a pro-life president in the White House and pro-life       majorities in the House and Senate, we will continue to work       together this year to undo the damage done by the Obama       administration,'' wrote Ernst and Rep. Diane Black (R-Tenn.)       in an op-ed published in the Washington Examiner on Friday,       the day of the annual anti-abortion March for Life.        The text of one of the bills, S. 241, explains that other       entities, including ``state and county health departments,       community health centers, [and] hospitals,'' will be able to       fill women's health care needs, including contraception, STI       testing, and cervical and breast cancer screening. Many       health experts say other health providers would not be able       to absorb Planned Parenthood's patients. An analysis       conducted by the Guttmacher Institute, which publishes       research on reproductive health, found that in two-thirds of       the counties that have a Planned Parenthood center, these       centers serve at least half the women seeking publicly funded       contraceptive care. In one-fifth of those counties, Planned       Parenthood is the only provider offering subsidized       contraceptive care.        ``If passed, these bills will cause a national health care       crisis, leaving millions with nowhere to go for basic care,''       said Dana Singiser, vice president of public policy and       government affairs for the Planned Parenthood Federation of       America, in a statement.        Texas offers an example of what women's health care looks       like when Planned Parenthood is excluded from public funding.       In 2011, the state stopped state funds from going to Planned       Parenthood, leading to numerous clinic closures. Other health       centers attempted to step in, but Medicaid contraception       claims declined by 35 percent, suggesting that fewer low-      income women were obtaining contraceptive care. There was       also an increase in childbirths among women receiving       Medicaid who'd previously received contraception from Planned       Parenthood clinics.        A bill to deny federal funds to Planned Parenthood passed       both chambers of Congress last year, but was vetoed by then-      President Barack Obama. Trump is likely to sign Ernst's       version of this bill should it cross his desk: Throughout his       campaign, Trump promised that defunding the women's health       care provider would be a priority for his administration.
