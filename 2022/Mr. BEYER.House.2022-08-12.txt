 Madam Speaker, today we protect the world for future  generations.   Madam Speaker, the Inflation Reduction Act will do untold good for  the Nation and for the American people. This is our generation's  signature contribution to American history, our Social Security Act, or  Civil Rights Act, or even the Bill of Rights.   The act will lower healthcare costs, reduce prescription drug prices,  and create jobs. We have emphatically put people over politics.   Much like a proposal I introduced with Senators Elizabeth Warren and  Angus King, it will actually reduce the deficit by preventing tax  avoidance for the biggest corporations in this country, requiring them  to shoulder their fair burden of the tax responsibility.   Most importantly, Congress is finally taking the sweeping, ambitious  action we desperately need to prevent the worst effects of the climate  crisis. We are passing the most important environmental bill in  history.   I am privileged to serve on Chairman Neal's brilliant and enlightened  Ways and Means Committee. I am proud of the diverse tax credit  provisions I partnered with my distinguished Members and friends.   These are the parts of the act which will have enormous climate  consequences:   They will accelerate the adoption of zero emission mid-size trucks,  vans, and other commercial vehicles.   They will scale up direct air capture technology to remove carbon  pollution directly from the atmosphere.   They will incentivize the reduction of emissions from commercial  buildings.   These provisions and the bill as a whole will create huge numbers of  good-paying jobs.   Then there is the big picture. This bill will put us on a path to  reduce our target emissions and actually help save the planet.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their support.
