 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 188,  I call up the bill (H.R. 842) to amend the National Labor Relations  Act, the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, and the Labor-Management  Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, and for other purposes, and ask  for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 842, the Protecting the  Right to Organize Act of 2021.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 842, the Protecting the Right  to Organize Act of 2021, or the PRO Act.   The American economy needs a strong middle class. Labor unions play  an essential role in rebuilding our middle class and improving the  lives of workers and their families. There is clear evidence that  workers who organize a union have higher wages, better benefits, and  safer workplaces.   Regrettably, union membership has dropped over the last 50 years from  nearly one-third of all workers in the mid-20th century to just over 10  percent of workers today. The decline of unions and workers' bargaining  power are major reasons why income inequality has soared and wages have  stagnated for hardworking people.   But this decline in union membership is not a product of workers'  choices. A recent survey by MIT found that nearly half of nonunion  workers say that they would vote to join a union if given the  opportunity.   The gap between worker preferences and union membership is the result  of an 85-year-old labor law that lacks the teeth to enforce workers'  rights when employers unlawfully retaliate against them for organizing.  The National Labor Relations Act, the NLRA, is far too weak to defend  workers against intensifying antiunion attacks from special interests.   That is why we must pass the PRO Act. The legislation strengthens  workers' rights by making significant upgrades in the NLRA since it was  enacted 85 years ago.   First, the PRO Act provides new tools to protect workers from  antiunion intimidation and retaliation. It then introduces meaningful  penalties for companies that violate workers' rights and closes  loopholes they use to exploit workers.   Finally, the PRO Act strengthens safeguards to ensure that workers  can hold free, fair, and safe union elections.   Mr. Speaker, it is time for Congress to stand up for workers and  ensure that they can exercise their right to join together and  negotiate for higher wages, better benefits, and a safe workplace. I  urge my colleagues to support the legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici), the chair of the Subcommittee  on Civil Rights and Human Services.    Mr. Speaker, during the last Congress we held  three hearings and considered 35 amendments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan), who is a member of the Committee on Education  and Labor and the co-chair of the new Labor Caucus.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal) who is a distinguished member  of the Committee on Education and Labor and is the chair of the  Congressional Progressive Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  distinguished gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Levin), a distinguished member of the Committee on  Education and Labor.    Mr. Speaker, could you advise how much time is  available on each side?

Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Bowman), the vice chair of the Committee on  Education and Labor.    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman's amendment was  made in order, so we will be considering it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from North Carolina  (Ms. Adams), the chair of the Workforce Protections Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Jones), a distinguished member of the Committee on  Education and Labor.    Mr. Speaker, reference was made to union  officials at the UAW. They were caught and prosecuted under present  law. The Trump administration that prosecuted them did not make any  recommendations for changes in the law.  [[Page H1149]]    Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Nevada (Ms. Titus).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Mrs. Trahan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell), the co-chair of the Labor  Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Garcia).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Ryan).    Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining on  each side?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. DeSaulnier), the chair of the  Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions of the  Education and Labor Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Norcross), a distinguished member of the  Committee on Education and Labor.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green).    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Madam Speaker, each of us can agree that hard work in this country  should pay off. Yet, for far too long, we have allowed wealthy special  interests to pad the profit margins by stripping workers of their  rights.   Madam Speaker, we often voice our support for workers. Today, we have  the opportunity to match our words with action by taking a historic  step to ensure that they can stand together and negotiate for higher  pay, better benefits, and safer workplaces.   I want to recognize all the workers and advocates, especially my  colleagues on the Committee on Education and Labor, for their  leadership on this legislation.   There is an extensive legislative history underpinning this bill,  including three hearings and a markup in the 116th Congress. The views  of the committee are outlined in the committee report from the last  Congress.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a Statement of Administration  Policy in support of the PRO Act and a statement by President Biden on  the House taking up the PRO Act.                     Statement of Administration Policy    H.R. 842--Protecting the Right to Organize Act of 2021--Rep. Scott, D-                          VA, and 212 cosponsors         The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R.       842, the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act of 2021,       which would strengthen the Federal laws that protect workers'       right to organize a union and collectively bargain for better       wages, benefits, and working conditions.        America was not built by Wall Street. It was built by the       middle class, and unions built the middle class. Unions put       power in the hands of workers. They give workers a stronger       voice to increase wages, improve the quality of jobs and       protect job security, protect against racial and all other       forms of discrimination and sexual harassment, and protect       workers' health, safety, and benefits in the workplace.       Unions lift up workers, both union and non-union.        The policy of the United States Government, stated clearly       in the National Labor Relations Act, is to encourage union       organizing and collective bargaining. However, due to anti-      union efforts by many employers for decades, lax enforcement       of existing labor laws, and the failure to restore and       strengthen labor laws to address the real-world of labor-      management relations, only 6.3% percent of private-sector       U.S. wage and salary workers were union members in 2020.        H.R. 842 would strengthen and protect workers' right to       form a union by allowing the National Labor Relations Board       (NLRB) to assess penalties on employers who violate workers'       right to organize and ensuring that workers who suffer       retaliation for exercising these rights receive immediate       relief.        The PRO Act also defends workers' right to strike--a       fundamental economic right--and to engage in boycotts and       other acts of solidarity with workers at other companies       without penalty. It clarifies that employers may not force       employees to waive their rights to join together in       collective or class action litigation. The bill also closes       loopholes in Federal labor law by barring employers from       misclassifying workers as independent contractors and       preventing workers from being denied remedies due to their       immigration status. It establishes an expansive joint       employer standard, allowing workers to collectively bargain       with all the companies that control the terms and conditions       of their employment. The bill allows unions to collect fair-      share fees to cover the cost of collective bargaining and       administering a union contract for all workers who are       protected by the contract's terms. H.R. 842 restores workers'       access to fair union elections and ensures the results are       respected.        The Administration strongly encourages the House to pass       H.R. 842, and looks forward to working with the Congress to       enact this critical legislation that safeguards workers'       rights to organize and bargain collectively. The PRO Act will       strengthen our democracy and advance dignity in the       workplace.                                   ____     Statement by President Joe Biden on the House Taking Up the PRO Act                  (Statements and Releases, March 9, 2021)         I strongly encourage the House to pass the Protecting the       Right to Organize (PRO) Act of 2021, which would dramatically       enhance the power of workers to organize and collectively       bargain for better wages, benefits, and working conditions.        As America works to recover from the devastating challenges       of deadly pandemic, an economic crisis, and reckoning on race       that reveals deep disparities, we need to summon a new wave       of worker power to create an economy that works for everyone.       We owe it not only to those who have put in a lifetime of       work, but to the next generation of workers who have only       known an America of rising inequality and shrinking       opportunity. All of us deserve to enjoy America's promise in       full--and our nation's leaders have a responsibility to       deliver it.        That starts with rebuilding unions. The middle class built       this country, and unions built the middle class. Unions give       workers a stronger voice to increase wages, improve the       quality of jobs and protect job security, protect against       racial and all other forms of discrimination and sexual       harassment, and protect workers' health, safety, and benefits       in the workplace. Unions lift up workers, both union and non-      union. They are critical to strengthening our economic       competitiveness.        But, after generations of sweat and sacrifice, fighting       hard to earn the wages and benefits that built and sustained       the American middle class, unions are under siege. Nearly 60       million Americans would join a union if they get a chance,       but too many employers and states prevent them from doing so       through anti-union attacks. They know that without unions,       they can run the table on workers--union and non-union alike.        We should all remember that the National Labor Relations       Act didn't just say that we shouldn't hamstring unions or       merely tolerate them. It said that we should encourage       unions. The PRO Act would take critical steps to help restore       this intent.        I urge Congress to send the PRO Act to my desk so we can       seize the opportunity to build a future that reflects working       people's courage and ambition, and offers not only good jobs       with a real choice to join a union--but the dignity, equity,       shared prosperity and common purpose the hardworking people       who built this country and make it run deserve.     Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support  the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to section 3 of House  Resolution 188, I rise to offer amendments en bloc No 1.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Murphy).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Newman).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms. Bourdeaux).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin), a member of the committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Tlaib).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Torres).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Madam Speaker, these amendments will provide whistle-blower  protection for workers, expose violations of the Labor-Management  Reporting and Disclosure Act, require the Department of Labor to make  employment arrangements and payments to union avoidance firms available  and more accessible, clarify that nothing in the bill would expand the  National Labor Relations Board's jurisdictional standards, direct the  NLRB to establish a system of electronic voting in representation  elections, clarify that nothing in the bill will be construed to amend  the definition of employer or employee in any provisions of State law,  direct the GAO to produce a study of the use of sectoral bargaining in  peer nations, require that workers are informed of their rights under  the bill in a language that they actually speak, direct the GAO to  produce a study of the impact of the PRO Act's changes to the  definitions of employee and employer, adds a 120-day timeline for the  arbitration process when workers and employers are unable to reach a  first bargaining agreement, and confirms that the bill will not affect  existing provisions for worker privacy.   These amendments make meaningful improvements to the bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on en bloc 1, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to section 3 of House  Resolution 188, I rise to offer amendments en bloc No. 2.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   Madam Speaker, we have heard a lot about complaints about the dues  but what we don't hear are complaints about the higher salaries, safer  workplaces, and better benefits that are accrued by virtue of  investments from the unions. They enjoy those benefits, so it is not  unreasonable to expect people to pay a fair share of those costs.   Now, fair share does not include the political activities, does not  include the annual holiday parties, but those services that the union  is obligated by law to provide, negotiating salaries, negotiating a  safe workplace, individualized representation when necessary, whatever  they do for union members they have to do for nonunion members, a fair  share of those expenses is not unreasonable.   Madam Speaker, I hope that we would defeat these amendments that  would undermine that idea, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan.)    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   Madam Speaker, over 500 attorneys, including 244 Members of the  American Bar Association, submitted a letter in support of the  persuader rule. It does not require the disclosure of legal  representation but only of persuader activities.   Employers hire union avoidance persuaders to consult with them,  according to the Department of Labor in 2016, and between 71 and 87  percent of union elections persuaders produce antiunion literature and  materials, write speeches and statements, and identify prounion  employees for discipline or reward. The employees often do not know  that their employer has retained such consultants in its campaign  against the union. It is one of the things that they ought to have to  disclose.   So, Madam Speaker, I hope that we will defeat this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Madam Speaker, as a group, these amendments would erode workers'  rights, slow down elections, allow workers to freeload, or even  prohibit employers from agreeing not to interfere with the election. I  would hope that we would defeat these amendments, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
