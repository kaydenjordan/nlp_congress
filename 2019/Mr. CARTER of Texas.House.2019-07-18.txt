 Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend, Mr.  Gohmert, for yielding.   I rise today to honor my dear friend, Congressman Richard Hudson of  North Carolina.   Congressman Hudson served as my chief of staff from 2006 to 2008 and  is now forging his own path right here on Capitol Hill.   Some time ago, Congressman Hudson gave me a hard time about other  Members being recognized as ``Honorary Texans'' by Governor Abbott.  Well, after speaking with the Governor, we have gone one step further  with our recognition here today, and I am pleased to swear in Admiral  Richard L. Hudson to the Texas Navy.   I will now read the certificate granting his commission:   ``In the name and by the authority of The State of Texas to all to  whom these presents shall come, Greetings. Know ye, that Richard Hudson  is hereby commissioned an honorary Admiral in the Texas Navy with all  rights and privileges appertaining thereto and with the duty of  assisting in the preservation of the history, boundaries, water  resources, and defense of the State.   ``In testimony whereof, I have signed my name and caused the Seal of  the State of Texas to be affixed at the City of Austin, this the 10th  day of May, 2019.''   Signed: Greg Abbott, Governor of Texas.   I am now going to read the oath that Mr. Hudson will take as he takes  this commission:   ``I, Richard Hudson, do solemnly swear that I will support and defend  the Constitution of the United States and the State of Texas against  all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and  allegiance to the same; and that I will obey the orders of the  President of the United States, the Governor of Texas, and the orders  of the officers appointed over me, according to regulations and the  Uniform Code of Military Justice. And I will remember the Alamo. So  help me God.''    Madam Speaker, I congratulate Mr. Hudson.
