 Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Tennessee.    I send to the desk a question on behalf of myself and  Senators Lee and Johnson.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senator Blackburn and Senators Lee and Johnson is  for counsel for the President:         What was the date of first contact between any member of       the House Intelligence committee staff and the whistleblower       regarding the information that resulted in the complaint? How       many times have House Intelligence committee members or staff       communicated in any form with the whistleblower since that       first date of contact?    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, thank you for that  question.   The answer is, we don't know. Nobody knows. We don't know when the  first contact was. We don't know how many contacts there were. We don't  know what the substance of the contact was. That all remains shrouded  in some secrecy.   And as I said a moment ago, we think that the way this case has been  presented, this body should simply acquit. There is no need to get more  evidence to probe into that.    But if we were to go down the road of any evidence or witnesses, then  those are certainly relevant questions and relevant things to know  about, to understand what those contacts were, what the whistleblower's  motivation was, what is the connection between the whistleblower and  any staffers, and how that played any role in the formulation of the  complaint. That would all be relevant to understand how this whole  process began.   Now, I do want to mention something else, while I have the moment, in  response to some things that Manager Schiff said.   Again, the House managers come up--it seems like they keep saying the  same thing, and we keep pointing to actual evidence and letters that  disprove what they are saying. They come up and say that the President  said: It is my way or the highway--blanket defiance--there is nothing  you can do. And they say that, well, they would have accommodated if we  were willing to participate in the accommodation process.   The October 8 letter that Counsel for the President, who Mr. Schiff  says acts in bad faith and called duplicitous here on the floor of the  Senate, sent a letter on October 8 to Mr. Schiff and others explaining:  ``If the Committees wish to return to the regular order of oversight  requests, we stand ready to engage in that process as we have in the  past, in a manner consistent with well-established bipartisan  constitutional protections and a respect for the separation of powers  enshrined in our Constitution.''   That was followed up in an October 18 letter that I mentioned before,  a letter that specified the defects in the subpoenas that had been  issued--not blanket defiance, not simply ``we don't cooperate''-- specifying the legal errors in the subpoenas.   And it concluded: ``As I stated in my letter of October 8th, if the  Committees wish to return to the regular order of oversight requests,  we stand ready to engage in that process as we have in the past, in a  manner consistent with well-established constitutional protections and  a respect for the separation of powers enshrined in our Constitution.''   The President stood ready to engage in the accommodations process. If  anyone said: ``My way or the highway'' here, it was the House because  the House was determined that they wanted just to get their impeachment  process done on the fastest track they could. They didn't want to do  any accommodation. They didn't want to do any litigation. They didn't  want anything to slow them down. They wanted to get it done as fast as  they could so it was finished by Christmas.   It was a partisan charade from the beginning. It resulted in a  partisan impeachment, with bipartisan opposition, and it is not  something this Chamber should condone.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.
