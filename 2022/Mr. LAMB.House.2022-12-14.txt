 Mr. Speaker, this is my last speech.   The first time that I walked in here, I looked all around the Chamber  the way that new Members do, and it really struck me that there are  only two paintings in here. They are right behind me now. One is of  George Washington and the other is of General Lafayette.   I think what struck me is that neither man ever served in this House,  but on that first day, I felt that they were looking right at me and  saying, we have a message for you: Don't take this place for granted.  Other people had to fight for us to be able to do what we do in here.   On that first day, I had no idea that within less than 3 years, the  D.C. police and the Capitol Police would have to fight for us again  right here, that hundreds of them would be injured, that some of them  would give their lives just so that we can walk back in that night and  do our job.   I saw a recent poll that showed that just 21 percent of Americans  approve of the job that we do in here; 75 percent of Americans  disapprove. And most of us know why that is. We have been in our  Congressional districts during a government shutdown and after we fail  to pass yet another bill that most Americans support, and also because  the bad news about this place travels much farther and much faster than  the good news ever does.   But I just keep thinking about how those officers fought for this  place. They fought for us. And I think they would do it all over again  if you asked them to.   We can take confidence in that fact. We can take confidence in the  fact that this institution did its job on January 7, hours after being  attacked on January 6. We can take confidence in the fact that since  then our fellow Americans have continued to reject so many candidates  around the country who are not committed to this democracy.   If I could only make one observation on my way out the door here, is  that I think we all have to be confident about this institution and we  should be more confident in ourselves.   Our failures are noticed more. We all know that. But our successes  are real. And we have to value those successes because they are a  credit to people like Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick or to  Representative John Lewis or to a young Air Force staff sergeant from  my district named Dylan Elchin, people who sacrificed and shed blood  for this democracy and for what it means.   The things that we have done in here and that you will continue to do  next term reflect the greatness of these people. I keep thinking about  these brown cardboard boxes of food that the Department of Agriculture  put together during the pandemic. They rushed them to food banks, and I  loaded a lot of these boxes into people's cars when I was back in my  district.   These were honest and good people. In their trunks, these were people  that had work boots and tools; they never thought they were going to  need something from a food bank. But it was our votes that fed those  people and gave them help in their hour of need.   I could go on and on about the things that we have done in this room  that are so special. My staff knows I talk endlessly about the fact  that our district was home to the first-ever civilian nuclear power  plant, and its successor power plant was at risk when we came into  office. It is now secure because of the bipartisan infrastructure bill  and the Inflation Control Act; thousands and thousands of jobs, clean  power that our region needs in investment and science.   I would talk about the teamsters and the miners and how we saved  their pension if I had time.   How we rebuilt a bridge in Pittsburgh in less than 1 year because of  Federal funds.   How the microchips and hydrogen that we have set aside money for are  themselves an expression of so much confidence in our future in this  country.   My time is up, so I will just say that I don't want to deny that we  have our problems in this country, we definitely do, but I have only  been here for 4 years, and it is obvious to me that we have everything  we need to be successful. For an Irish guy, that is a very emotional  thought, but I have seen it.   When I was a kid, I had this plaque that my grandmother gave me that  said the words of St. Paul, which were that we have a responsibility to  stir into flame all the gifts that God has given us.   God has given this country so many incredible gifts. I just think we  have to be worthy of that. We have to honor our inheritance; and on our  best days, for the last 4\1/2\ years, we have done that. It has been  the honor of my life to do that.   Mr. Speaker, to all my colleagues, I just say that I am confident in  you. I know what you all are capable of and what this institution is  capable of.   To my constituents, I say thank you. It has been a tremendous  privilege to be here in your name.                            ____________________
