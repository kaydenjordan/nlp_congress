 Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to introduce the Transparency  in Student Lending Act.   College education can be a life-changing investment, but it can come  at a tremendous cost. Right now, 44 million Americans collectively hold  $1.5 trillion in student loan debt. The Federal Government lends 90  percent of these dollars. However, unlike other lenders, the Federal  Government does not provide students with complete information about  the total cost of their loan, leaving borrowers unaware of hidden costs  and fees until they enter the repayment phase. I have introduced this  bill to require complete information be provided to students before  they take out a loan.   Mr. Speaker, I represent the youngest congressional district in the  United States, and many of my constituents are struggling with student  debt. With this legislation, we can help young people make fully  informed financial decisions for their families and their futures.                            ____________________
