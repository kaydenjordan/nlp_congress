 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 1.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs  Act.   As an engineer, I have learned that no issue is too difficult for  American innovation and ingenuity to solve when we honestly identify  the problem, develop a sound plan to solve it, and do the hard work to  get the results we desire.   The truth we all know is America has an energy crisis. Energy is  foundational to everything we do, and for the sake of our future, we  must solve this problem.   Energy prices, in general, have gone up nearly 40 percent in a little  over 2 years. High energy costs translate throughout the economy,  causing inflated prices for every necessity of life, from the food we  eat to the clothes we wear to the roof over our heads.   President Biden has said he is working to lower these costs. But his  actions are drowning out his words. He has waged war on American  producers, shutting down oil and gas leasing, banning mining  development in certain areas, and insisting on keeping our Federal  regulations permanently stuck in the past.                                time  1415    What are we getting in return?   We are getting more dependence on the worst polluters in the world  while we wreck our own economy sending our wealth and jobs overseas.   Our current energy policies favor Putin, the Chinese Communist Party,  and despots around the globe over the American people and freedom. Why  would our friends across the aisle continue to put the worst polluters,  human rights violators, and those who wish us harm above the American  people?   No more. H.R. 1 is designed to solve our energy crisis. House  Republicans are ready to show the world that American energy--not Saudi  Arabian, not Venezuelan, not Chinese, or Russian energy--American  energy is our future. American mining, American innovation, American  processing and refining,  [[Page H1486]]  American manufacturing, and American infrastructure will lead us out of  this energy crisis.   H.R. 1 outlines this through a variety of measures. First, it rolls  back the Biden administration's oil and gas leasing moratoriums, giving  producers certainty to produce resources safely and responsibly right  here at home.   Next, given the importance of minerals to our national security,  clean energy technology, and a host of everyday uses, H.R. 1 shores up  domestic supply chains for commodities like copper, lithium, and  cobalt, and allows us to make our energy infrastructure where it should  be made--right here at home in the United States.   Every ounce we produce here is an ounce less we and our allies are  forced to purchase from Chinese-controlled mines with deplorable labor  and environmental standards. And, of course, none of this is possible  without modernizing the Federal regulations that delay the projects we  desperately need.   If you don't believe permitting reform is needed, maybe you will  believe President Biden's senior adviser, John Podesta, who recently  said: ``We can move faster by setting tighter deadlines for agencies to  complete environmental reviews. We can move smarter by making it easier  to approve projects with low environmental impact . . . But Congress  needs to do its job . . . So it is time to get back to work and pass  permitting reform legislation.''   We are called to be good stewards of our resources and leave them  better than we found them. That is the definition of conservation. We  cannot say our global resources are better off today under Democratic  policies. China is building coal plants at a rapid pace, using slave  labor to construct solar panels and develop critical minerals, while  Russia is not only one of the worst environmental catastrophes on the  planet, but they are also using their energy revenues to fund their war  in Ukraine.   We cannot continue to turn a blind eye to these injustices and say,  ``not in my backyard.'' America drills, mines, builds, and innovates  cleaner, safer, and more responsibly than anywhere else in the world.   Before American innovators and workers can solve our energy problems,  we need a plan. H.R. 1 is the plan to solve our energy crisis.   For these and many more reasons, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the  Lower Energy Costs Act. H.R. 1 is the blueprint to ease the burden of  this self-inflicted energy crisis on American families.   H.R. 1, when executed, will make the United States more secure and  competitive on the global stage. Ultimately, H.R. 1 will improve the  health and longevity of our natural resources, create a better climate,  and spur economic growth and jobs--these are results we should all get  behind.   Mr. Chair, you don't have to be an engineer to solve this energy  problem. I urge all of my colleagues to join with me and vote a  resounding ``yes'' in support of H.R. 1.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                         Committee on the Budget,                                     Washington, DC, March 20, 2023.      Hon. Bruce Westerman,      Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Westerman: I am writing regarding H.R. 1335,       the Transparency, Accountability, Permitting, and Production       of American Resources Act, which was ordered reported by the       Committee on Natural Resources on March 9, 2023.        The bill contains provisions that fall within the       jurisdiction of the Committee on the Budget. In order to       expedite House consideration of H.R. 1335, the Committee on       the Budget will forgo action on this bill. This is being done       with the understanding that it does not waive any       jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in H.R. 1335       or similar legislation and that the Committee will be       appropriately consulted and involved as this bill or similar       legislation moves forward so that the Committee may address       any remaining issues that fall within its jurisdiction. The       Committee on the Budget also reserves the right to seek       appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any       House-Senate conference involving this or similar legislation       and requests your support of any such request.        I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming       this understanding with respect to H.R. 1335 and would ask       that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be       included in your committee report and in the Congressional       Record during floor consideration of H.R. 1335.            Sincerely,                                                Jodey C. Arrington,      Chairman, Committee on the Budget.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Natural Resources,                                     Washington, DC, March 21, 2023.      Hon. Jodey C. Arrington,      Chairman, Committee on the Budget,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Arrington: I write regarding H.R. 1335, the       Transparency, Accountability, Permitting, and Production of       American Resources Act, which was ordered reported by the       Committee on Natural Resources on March 9, 2023.        I recognize that the bill contains provisions that fall       within the jurisdiction of the Committee on the Budget and       appreciate your willingness to forgo action on the bill. I       acknowledge that the Budget Committee will not formally       consider H.R. 1335 and agree that the inaction of your       Committee with respect to the bill does not waive any       jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in therein.        I am pleased to support your request to name members of the       Committee on the Budget to any conference committee to       consider such provisions. I will ensure that our exchange of       letters is included in the Committee Report for H.R. 1335 and       the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the       bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this       legislation            Sincerely,                                                   Bruce Westerman,      Chairman,Committee on Natural Resources.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                        Committee on Agriculture,                                     Washington, DC, March 24, 2023.      Hon. Bruce Westerman,      Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: This letter confirms our mutual       understanding regarding H.R. 1335, the ``TAPP American       Resources Act''. Thank you for collaborating with the       Committee on Agriculture on the matters within our       jurisdiction.        The Committee on Agriculture will forego any further       consideration of this bill. However, by foregoing       consideration at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction       over any subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation. The Committee on Agriculture also reserves the       right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees should it become necessary and ask that you support       such a request.        We would appreciate a response to this letter confirming       this understanding with respect to H.R. 1355, and request a       copy of our letters on this matter be published in the       Congressional Record during Floor consideration.            Sincerely,                                             Glenn ``GT'' Thompson,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Natural Resources,                                     Washington, DC, March 25, 2023.      Hon. Glenn ``GT'' Thompson,      Chairman, Committee on Agriculture,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I write regarding H.R. 1335, the       Transparency, Accountability, Permitting, and Production of       American Resources Act, which was ordered reported by the       Committee on Natural Resources on March 9, 2023.        I recognize that the bill contains provisions that fall       within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Agriculture and       appreciate your willingness to forgo action on the bill. I       acknowledge that the Committee on Agriculture will not       formally consider H.R. 1335 and agree that the inaction of       your Committee with respect to the bill does not waive any       jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in therein.        I am pleased to support your request to name members of the       Committee on Agriculture to any conference committee to       consider such provisions. I will ensure that our exchange of       letters is included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the bill. I appreciate your cooperation       regarding this legislation            Sincerely,                                                   Bruce Westerman,                          Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources.     Mr. Chair, this utopian idea of having our cake and  eating it too, the ``not in my backyard'' mentality, it just won't work  for the economy or the environment. That is why we need change.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Thompson), the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, someone who  knows the importance of energy to production agriculture.    Mr. Chairman, the rhetoric is just not matching the  reality. The reality is that current energy policies are forcing us to  buy energy and minerals from the worst polluters on the Earth. Not only  are they the worst polluters; they are the worst human rights  violators.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Idaho (Mr.  Fulcher), who serves on the Committee on Natural Resources.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Wittman), who is another member of the Natural Resources  Committee.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Chair, I heard the word ``rich'' mentioned a few times. I will  tell you what is rich is when our colleagues across the aisle project  their energy policies onto our plan. Again, the only polluters who are  being put over the people are China, Russia, and Saudi Arabia.   Talk about big oil company profits, I read where Aramco, a Saudi  company, had record profits last year, $161 billion in profits. I  believe that is the country that President Biden went to and asked them  to increase production because we weren't making enough at home.   Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.  Stauber), the chair of the Energy and Mineral Resources Subcommittee.    Madam Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Minnesota.    Madam Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Lamborn), the senior Republican on the Committee on  Natural Resources.    Madam Chair, the Inflation Reduction Act that has been  referenced here, it did invest in energy companies: energy companies in  Saudi Arabia, energy companies in China, and energy companies in places  like Russia and Venezuela and Iran at the cost of the American people.   The bill also referred to--outside of the House Chambers--is the  climate bill, referred to by my colleagues across the aisle. It did one  thing to inflation, it drove inflation up at the cost to the American  taxpayer.   Madam Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  McClintock).    Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Puerto Rico (Mrs. Gonzalez-Colon), another Member of the House Natural  Resources Committee.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for her input on  the bill and for her great ideas.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I find it ironic that a Member from  Pennsylvania, where one of the largest deposits of natural gas in the  world resides, would call the producers in Pennsylvania the polluters  versus the ones in Russia and Saudi Arabia.   Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California, (Mr.  McCarthy), the Speaker of the House.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gosar), another member of the House Natural Resources  Committee.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   The ideas of the Republican Party will do more to reduce global  carbon emissions than anything that the Democrats have proposed,  especially the legislation they passed in the last Congress that is  actually incentivizing foreign production of energy.   I remember distinctly President Biden going over and fist-bumping the  Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. Then, this year, guess what? Saudi  Arabia's state-owned oil company reported the highest profits ever-- $161 billion, for an oil company.                                time  1545    They are the plans that we are putting in place, H.R. 1, that will  help the planet. It is not the continued misguided principles that are  putting the real polluters, the global polluters, ahead of the people.   It is ironic that a Member from Texas would think that producers in  Saudi Arabia and Russia and Venezuela are polluting less than the oil  producers and the energy producers in the State of Texas.   Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Montana (Mr.  Rosendale).    Madam Chair, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Carl), another member of the House Natural Resources  Committee.    Madam Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Graves), who has offered so much positive input on the  Lower Energy Costs Act. He is the author of the BUILDER Act and added  so many other great provisions to this bill.    Madam Chair, I checked. We are in the 118th Congress,  even though our colleagues keep putting signs up to describe their so- called Inflation Reduction Act, the polluters over people act.   We also know they call this the climate bill. Even President Biden,  in his State of the Union Address, talked about the $370 billion  investment in climate in the Inflation Reduction Act. We know that  giveaway is not $370 billion but now is being projected to be $1.2  trillion in outlays--again, increasing inflation, not reducing  inflation.   Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Tiffany), who is the chairman of the Federal Lands Subcommittee of the  Natural Resources Committee.    Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Valadao), who understands what bad energy policy does  to rural America.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. James).    Mr. Chair, when I see the sign about selling out clean  air, I think about the coal-powered plant per week that is being built  in China so they can manufacture the minerals that we need here in  America.   I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Williams), the  chairman of the Small Business Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Guam (Mr. Moylan).    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 20 seconds to the  gentleman from Guam.    Mr. Chairman, thanks to Democrat energy policies,  Putin, Xi Jinping, and the crown prince of Saudi are the ones that are  drilling and mining their way to prosperity at the expense of the  American public.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr.  Smith).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Colorado (Mrs. Boebert), another member of the House Natural  Resources Committee    Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentlewoman an 30 additional  seconds.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to the time remaining.  [[Page H1505]]     Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Oklahoma (Mrs. Bice), who knows a lot about diversified energy because  Oklahoma has the most diversified energy portfolio of any State.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Kansas (Mr. LaTurner).    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. LaMalfa), another member of the Natural Resources  Committee.                                time  1715     Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Wyoming (Ms. Hageman), another  [[Page H1506]]  member of the House Natural Resources Committee and the chairwoman of  the Indian and Insular Affairs Subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Wyoming.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Collins), another member of the House Natural Resources  Committee.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire again as to the time left.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Duarte), another member of the House Natural Resources  Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Newhouse), the chair of the Congressional Western  Caucus.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Mississippi (Mr. Ezell).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  South Dakota (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Iowa  (Mr. Feenstra).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Bean).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Jackson).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Bergman).    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time for  closing.   It is a time for choosing. It is a time to choose whether you want to  be with America or if you want to be continually supporting our  adversaries across the seas.   H.R. 1 provides a solution to a problem that Democrat energy policy  has created. Democrat energy policy means energy dependence.   H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act, means energy independence for  America.   Democrat energy policy is a threat to national security.   H.R. 1 secures our country, secures our country's energy, secures our  country's minerals, secures our country's food supply, and secures our  country's future as we move forward.   Democrat energy policy is bogged down with their very permitting  processes.   H.R. 1 will relieve those permitting processes. It doesn't undermine  any bedrock environmental laws. It actually makes the environmental  laws work. It allows projects to be permitted. Green energy projects,  American energy projects, roads, bridges, transportation corridors,  ports, navigable waterways, all of those things are being held up by  the permitting process. H.R. 1 will be a great step toward making  things happen in America.   Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 1, to lower  energy costs for Americans, and I yield back the balance of my time.
