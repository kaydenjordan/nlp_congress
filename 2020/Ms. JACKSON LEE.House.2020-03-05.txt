 Mr. Chair, I rise to speak in strong support of H.R.  1140, the Rights for Transportation Security Officers Act of 2020,  which will create civil service protections for TSA employees that are  long overdue.   H.R. 1140, mandates the conversion of all covered employees and  positions within the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to  the provisions of title 5, United State Code.   The bill represents a longstanding priority for Chairman Thompson,  the bill's author, and my own as a former chair of the Homeland  Security Committee's Subcommittee on Transportation Security to extend  the rights and protections afford to all federal government employees  to TSA personnel.   Several versions of the bill have been introduced over the past  decade, but this Congress is the first time the bill has received  overwhelming, bipartisan support, with 236 cosponsors including 10  Republicans.   The legislation curtails TSA's broad authorities to create and  control its personnel systems, instead requiring TSA to abide by the  provisions of title 5 which regulate personnel systems for most Federal  agencies.   The bill would provide TSA employees with the workforce protections  and benefits available to most other Federal workers.   The bill sets forth transition rules to protect the rate of pay and  other rights of TSA employees during a transition to title 5.   The bill also requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to consult  with the appropriate labor organizations to carry out the transition.   This bill does not affect prohibitions against disloyalty and  asserting the right to strike against the federal government.   The bill also extends the timeline for the transition from 60 days to  a more realistic 180 days, and it contains language to protect  employees with grievances or disciplinary actions pending during the  transition.   On the morning of September 11, 2001, nearly 3,000 people were killed  in a series of coordinated terrorist attacks in New York, Pennsylvania  and Virginia.   The attacks resulted in the creation of the Transportation Security  Administration, which was designed to prevent similar attacks in the  future by removing the responsibility for transportation security from  private entities.   The Aviation and Transportation Security Act, passed by the 107th  Congress and signed on November 19, 2001, established TSA just 2 months  following the September 11, 2001 attacks.   The urgent need to provide a response to the available security  threat was facing meant that much of the work to provide administrative  structure and integration measures that would have woven in the civil  service protections now be added did not occur at that time.   The TSA's mission is to protect the nation's transportation systems  to ensure freedom of movement for people and commerce.   The work of the TSA is a frontline Department of Homeland Security  and it is not easy--it can in fact be very dangerous.   Like many of my colleagues, I recall the shooting incident at LAX  that killed Gerardo Hernandez, who became the first TSA officer killed  in the line of duty; and the machete attack at the Louis Armstrong New  Orleans International Airport that resulted in injuries to Senior  Transportation Security Officer Carol Richel.   These incidents only highlight the difficult work that the men and  women of the TSA must perform each day to keep our nation's airports  and flights safe.   The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) supports several key parts  of the U.S. coronavirus response.   The TSA is responsible for: enforcing the travel restrictions for all  flights that are carrying individuals who have recently traveled from  China, notifying passengers and travelers of risks of contracting the  virus, and coordinating with air carriers and airports to discuss  government actions and seek input (TSA).   Allegations about mismanagement, wasteful procedures, retaliation  against whistleblowers, low morale, and security gaps within the Agency  are causes for concern.   TSA has consistently struggled with low morale across the workforce,  ranking 303 out of 305 government agencies in 2016.   Low morale has a nexus to the high turnover rate within the ranks of  Transportation Security Officers (TSOs).   TSOs represent 70 percent of the TSA workforce, yet have been denied  full collective bargaining rights, whistleblower protections, and  opportunities to effectively raise issues in dispute to an independent  third party, such as the Merit Systems Protection Board.   Additionally, TSOs are subject to a pay and performance system that  does not track with the General Services (GS) wage system, the primary  wage system for Federal workers.   It is past time to make the changes provided by H.R. 1140, so the TSA  workforce is treated equally to other federal employees with the power  to advance and expand their opportunities as government employees.   Finally I am excited to support the Mucarsel-Powell amendment  regarding infectious disease preparation and protection for TSOs, and  the Cisneros Amendment that is very important which requires the DHS to  prioritize hiring veterans including disabled veterans and others  associated with veterans.   I ask my colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 1140.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise to indicate I was unavoidably  detained in a committee hearing and unable to register my vote for the  Cisneros amendment protecting veterans and having a focus of hiring  veterans under the legislation H.R. 1140, Rights for Transportation  Security Officers Act of 2020, I ask that my vote of ``aye'' be placed  in the Record at the appropriate place.                            ____________________
