 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong support of  this rule and to provide consideration of H.R. 4712, the Born-Alive  Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which would ensure that children who  survive an abortion, or an attempted abortion, are given proper medical  treatment.   I am a proud cosponsor of this bill to ensure that babies born alive  are transported and admitted to a hospital immediately following  emergency care. As a Christian and as a father of two, I hold  maintaining the sanctity of life as my highest priority.   The House of Representatives voted to pass this legislation in the  114th Congress, but it was met with an unresponsive Senate. I will vote  again to support this bill to hold healthcare providers accountable,  protect and empower mothers, and help ensure that these innocent  children are provided the same medical care that any other newborn  would receive. I remain hopeful that this time around we can send this  important legislation to the President to be signed into law.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
