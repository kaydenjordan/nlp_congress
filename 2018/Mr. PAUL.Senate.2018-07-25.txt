 Mr. President, our national debt now exceeds $22 trillion.  We are borrowing about $1 million a minute--actually, more than $1  million. Many authorities, including Admiral Mullen, have said the  greatest threat to our national security is actually our debt.  [[Page S5352]]    The best way to do something about debt is to quit spending yourself  further into a hole. We had spending caps. We adhered to them for a  couple of years, and we actually were reducing the size of the deficit.   This year, though, the deficit will actually approach $1 trillion,  and next year it may exceed $1 trillion. This amendment would put the  spending caps back just on the spending we have before us in this bill.   I would advocate that if you are concerned about the debt, concerned  about the deficit, and concerned about the strength of our country,  that you vote to reinstitute the spending caps.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
