 Mr. Speaker, I thank our newly-elected vice chair.  Congratulations. I look forward to working with him.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today because accountability is finally here.   For years, Joe Biden has used his name and influence for personal  gain, all while serving in office and receiving a salary funded by  taxpayer dollars. He has deceived the Nation by posing as a trustworthy  family man, only to be bought and paid for by foreign nationals.   The Biden family has embedded themselves in a web of lies, spreading  deceit to the Nation to cover up their shady dealings. We are not fools  and we cannot be fooled.   For months, House Republicans have followed the facts, and more  importantly, followed the money. It has all led right back to President  Biden. Despite stonewalling attempts at every turn, we have persisted.  From the DOJ to the FBI and the White House, cohorts of the Biden  family have done everything they can to stop the truth from coming to  light. These lies cannot stay hidden forever.   House Republicans in the Oversight Committee have unearthed over  $240,000 in direct payments to the President and his family. What about  that money?   That money has direct ties to foreign nationals and our adversaries.  These same adversaries President Biden swore to defend America against  are actually lining his pockets and influencing his decisions.   It is past time that the American public know the truth. It is time  for the Biden family to be held accountable for their corruption.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the House Republicans that accountability is  finally here.
