 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Chair, I am proud to offer this pro-worker amendment. Current  employees are locked into old, obsolete, and outdated union contracts  that were approved long before they ever came to work there.   Employees deserve a voice that is reflective of today's rapidly  modernizing workforce and workplace. Baby boomers are retiring, and  countless existing employees are locked into collective bargaining  agreements made decades ago.   In 2016 alone, NLRB data showed that only 6 percent of union members  voted to be represented by their union in those agreements that they  were bound to. This simple amendment would allow employees to petition  for a union certification election whenever fewer than 50 percent of  the current union members were members during the last election. It  also empowers employees who might deem unions unnecessary. It will  allow them the right to decertify and to represent themselves.   This proposal gives new and current employees a seat at the table.  They get their own voice and it provides for more accountability. With  the recent news of embezzlement and corruption by United Auto Worker  Union bosses, we must go further to empower all employees who are  forced to pay dues to their unions that they haven't voted on or  wanted.   All employees deserve honest representation and the ability to  decertify a collective bargaining agreement if they no longer need  union representation. I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in  supporting the current and future workforce by supporting this  amendment.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1845     Madam Chairwoman, I would like to reemphasize  a couple of facts here that are at  [[Page H914]]  variance from what the gentleman from over there said.   Six percent of union members have voted to be represented by their  union under current collective bargaining agreements. This amendment  would say, if 50 percent or more of the people in a collective  bargaining agreement never voted on it, they get the right to vote on  it.   We all know people in business who have dealt with unions--and I have  decertified unions all over Oklahoma and Texas and other States. These  contracts are not as easy to decertify, given the existing impediments  as might be seen. This law would enable those workers to have the  freedom to do it themselves and not be subjugated to agreements that  they never voted on in the first place.   When I decertified the unions in Oklahoma and Texas back in the  eighties, thousands of our building trades employees flocked to vote  yes to get rid of the unions because they weren't adding value and they  wanted to keep those fees for themselves. Since that time, we know how  the construction industry has developed in Oklahoma and Texas.   So I speak from real, personal experience, having been a member of  the carpenters union, that it is good to give employees the right to  decertify their union and to make it easier for them to do that.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chairwoman, how much time do I have?    Madam Chairwoman, maybe I ought to do this in  Spanish or Italian, because we are not communicating effectively.   There is nothing in this amendment that has anything to do with  employers determining who is or is not decertified. It is when a  certain number of employees have not voted on that collective  bargaining agreement because of turnover in the rapidly evolving,  modernizing workforce--which I appreciate the gentleman recognizing--it  makes it easier for them to do it.    Employers don't have a role in this. This is about employees deciding  if they want to keep their collective bargaining agreement or not.   We have all seen the difficult institutional impediments to the  ability to decertify the way it is right now. This will help that and  recognize that we are in an era of high volatility, workers going to  many more jobs than they used to throughout their career, and making  the NLRB get with the program on adapting to the current workforce that  we live in.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chairwoman, one more time, I would like  to say that the NLRB was a very important piece of legislation 70 years  ago. These little tweaks like this to update the NLRB for the modern  workforce, the volatility, the digital era, are perfectly legitimate  and logical responses to the conditions that we find ourselves in now.   We don't have carpenters who would spend their entire career at one  company anymore. They come and go at different places. It happens in  manufacturing as well. This bill would recognize that volatility and  institutionalize it in a constructive manner.   I yield back the balance of my time.
