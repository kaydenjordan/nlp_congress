 MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I thank the  gentleman for yielding and for his great leadership.   Madam Speaker, today, we vote to defend the interests of the American  people, our system of checks and balances, and our very Constitution  with this resolution to hold Secretary Ross and Attorney General Barr  in criminal contempt.   For well over a year, Trump administration officials have lied  through their teeth about the reason for adding a citizenship question  to the 2020 Census.                                time  1430    They have repeatedly lied to Congress, the Supreme Court, and the  American people.   In an effort to cover up their lies, they blocked every demand from  our committee, every demand to comply with reasonable oversight,  withholding documents, asserting illegitimate executive privilege, and  blatantly ignoring bipartisan subpoenas, all to a degree that would  literally break the Constitution if allowed to stand.   New evidence in court, which I shared on this floor, revealed that  the real reason for the question was to disenfranchise non-White  voters. The Supreme Court ruled that the administration's explanation  was contrived.   A functional democracy depends on accountability. Accountability  requires real oversight.   The passage of this criminal contempt resolution is necessary to  preserve the integrity of all congressional oversight on this and so  many other issues now and into the future. This contempt resolution, in  fact, allows both Democrats and Republicans to do their job.   Never, ever during my time in Congress have I encountered such  complete contempt for the law, and that contempt deserves to be  punished.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for this. Our democracy  depends on it.
