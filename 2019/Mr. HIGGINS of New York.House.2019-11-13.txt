 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize our  everyday heroes--police and fire personnel--who sign up to rush into  dangerous situations most people would run from.   Today I want to take this opportunity to commend the outstanding  members of the Niagara Falls Fire Department and the New York State  Park Police.   Last week, a man was discovered in the fierce and frigid rapids of  the Niagara River. Without hesitation, the Niagara Falls firefighters  and New York State Park Police took quick action, entering the water  just yards away from the brink of Niagara Falls and, under the most  dangerous of circumstances, completed a successful rescue.   We are grateful for the brave and selfless service of these first  responders and others across my community and this Nation who risk  their own safety and save the lives of others.                            ____________________
