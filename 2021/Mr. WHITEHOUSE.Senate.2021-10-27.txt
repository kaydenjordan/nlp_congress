 Mr. President, I rise today to discuss again the  scheme by rightwing donor interests to capture  [[Page S7399]]  and control our Supreme Court, just like big industries have captured  and controlled regulatory agencies through history.   In these speeches, I have covered the origins, motivations, and  central players in the scheme; and, today, I am here to respond to a  little bit of counterprogramming from the scheme.   So, obviously, Job 1, if you have captured an agency, is to pretend  it is not captured; it is still legit.   Well, on Thursday, the minority leader, Senator McConnell, one of the  principal operatives of the court capture scheme, traveled to The  Heritage Foundation, one of the central dark-money groups in the court  capture scheme, to toast Justice Clarence Thomas, one of the most  ardent justices in pursuing the scheme's donors' goals and purposes.   Senator McConnell opened by lauding Justice Thomas for his campaign  to overturn decades of precedent protecting women's constitutional  right to abortion. That is an important point to note because the court  is set to take up not one but two cases offering the new 6-3 Republican  majority a chance to tear down Roe v. Wade.   But his other mission was to defend the court capture scheme, and  that is an important mission right now because the court just hit an  all-time low on Gallup's national approval survey. According to a poll  out this month by one of the most respected pollsters in the country,  about two-thirds of Americans think politics guides the Supreme Court's  decisions. And that is not a partisan opinion. Republicans and  Democrats share that view in equal proportion.    And Americans aren't wrong. When big Republican donor interests come  before the Court, they win--it looks like every time. I have shown the  pattern. I have published an article on it. It is currently at 80 to 0.  Lawyers would love to take evidence like that--an 80-to-0 record--into  court as pattern evidence of bias.   So when the evidence is bad, what do you do? You blow smoke. There is  an old, old propaganda technique of accusing your adversary of the  exact wrong you are committing. It is such an old propaganda technique  that it even has a Latin name: the ``tu quoque fallacy,'' from the  Latin for ``you too.'' The Oxford English Dictionary defines it as  ``retorting a charge upon one's accuser.'' It is a rhetorical trick.   At Heritage, Senator McConnell used this rhetorical trick, retorting  a charge that critics like me of what has happened to the Court were  trying to politicize the Court. Now, that is a particularly tricky  version of this rhetorical trick because it is an accusation of  something that we did not do, coming from people who actually did that.   We have all seen in plain view the mischief done by Senate  Republicans to capture the Court for big special interests. They  weren't even subtle. So the ``tu quoque'' rhetorical trick says to  accuse us of what they did.   The Republican leader's rhetorical charge stood on a Supreme Court  brief that I wrote, along with a number of my colleagues. And in that  brief, we quoted a Quinnipiac poll. That Quinnipiac poll showed that a  majority of American voters believe the Court is--and I quote the poll  here--``motivated mainly by politics''--``motivated mainly by  politics'' and the poll continued that those voters believed the  Supreme Court should be--and, here, I am quoting the poll-- ``restructured in order to reduce the influence of politics.'' That is  the language from the poll question. And in our brief, we quoted it  precisely.   In his telling, Senator McConnell leaves out the quotation marks and  turns what was essentially an uncontested observation of fact of what  that poll said, using the language of that poll, into what the  rightwing has constantly replayed and cooked up as a threat to the  Court. He also suggested that I had called for expansion of the Court,  which I have actually not done. But never let the facts get in the way  of a good story, huh?   In his telling, the majority leader's telling, it is Democrats who  are up to no good at the Court. Let's look at what that telling leaves  out because it masks a lot.   First, it masks the Court's partisan record, the record I have  described: Justice Thomas and his fellow Republican appointees in the  5-to-4 and now 6-to-3 majority on the Robert's Court has handed down  over 80 partisan 5-to-4 decisions benefiting easily identified  Republican donor interests. Like I said, by my reckoning, it is an 80- to-0 record for the big donors. His telling masks all of that.   It also masks the entire Republican Court-packing operation that  yielded three donor-selected Justices and hundreds of lower court  judges during the Trump Presidency.   It masks the big donors' nominations turnstile at the Federalist  Society, where they decided who would and would not become a Justice.  It was insourced to the White House for it to vet and select Trump  nominees.   It masks the dark money political attack groups, which used massive  anonymous donations to apply political pressure on behalf of the  donors' nominees.   And it masks Leonard Leo and the shady $250 million web of dark money  groups outed by the Washington Post for packing and influencing the  Court.   What else does it mask? It masks the influence operation built to  steer those Justices' attention to rightwing donor priorities.   It masks the armada of amici curiae--so-called friends of the court-- appearing before the Court by the orchestrated dozen, funded by dark  money.   It masks the dark money front groups that comb the country for cases  that can catapult selected controversies before the Court to help the  Justices change precedent; it masks the special interest fast lane  those front groups have established to get cases quickly before the  Court, a fast lane the Court indulges; and it masks the hot house dark  money so-called think tanks, like the Heritage Foundation where Senator  McConnell spoke, where legal theories benefiting Big Donor interests  are planted and watered and fertilized and propagated for the Court to  adopt.   And, last, it masks what Republicans did, shredding norms and rules  that the Senate had long relied on to manage judicial nominations, the  scrapping of the Supreme Court filibuster; the scrapping of the circuit  court blue slip; the acceptance of preposterous assertions of executive  privilege to hide nominees' records; the refusal to grant Merrick  Garland so much as courtesy visits, let alone a hearing; the invention  of the so-called Garland rule about not confirming Justices near an  election; the mad rush to confirm Brett Kavanaugh under the cloud of  barely examined sexual assault allegations; and then the hypocritical  full 180 reversing that so-called Garland rule to jam a rightwing  Justice onto the Court 8 days before an election.   This was all done in plain view. This was not subtle. You have got to  be gaslighting really hard to not pay attention to all that evidence.   I will tell you what, we weren't the only ones watching. The American  people are watching, and they are fed up with all of this. They trust  their noses, and they know this reeks.   Senator McConnell and I do agree on one thing. There are, as he said,  ``storm clouds'' swirling around the Court.   I also agree with him when he said this; he said:         One of our country's two major political movements has       decided they're fed up with trying to win the contest of       ideas within the institutions the framers left us and would       rather take aim at the institutions themselves.    That statement is exactly true. It is just that Senator McConnell got  exactly wrong which party is the guilty one. Against that litany of  interference and influence and dark money all around the Court that I  just described, one misquote from a brief--it is not even a contest.   Here is a final quotation to set next to Senator McConnell's. It  comes from Lewis Powell a few months before he took his seat on the  U.S. Supreme Court. In a memo he wrote to one of the most significant  forces in Republican politics, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce--a memo, by  the way, that was never disclosed to the Senate during his confirmation  proceedings. Here is what he wrote:         Under our constitutional system, especially with an       activist-minded Supreme Court, the judiciary may be the most       important instrument for social, economic and political       change.    Powell branded the courts a major element of what he called ``The  Neglected Political Arena'' that Big Business and rightwing ideologues  should  [[Page S7400]]  move in and exploit. Exploiting that is exactly what the rightwing  donor scheme is. It enmired the Court in dark money influence. It  packed the judiciary with judges selected to rule in the big donors'  favor. It won an 80-to-0 rout of partisan decisions benefiting Big  Donor interests. And it is steering the Court to protect the dark money  that was the prime vehicle for capturing the Court in the first place.   Oh, yes, indeed, the Court has been politicized, but look at the  evidence. We weren't the ones who did it, and no amount of smoke can  obscure the evidence of how this Court became the Court that dark money  built.   I yield the floor.
