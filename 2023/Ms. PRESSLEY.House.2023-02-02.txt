 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rhetoric and  resolution from across the aisle; our colleagues, who, once again, seek  to make history for all the wrong reasons.   I rise on behalf of every little girl who sees herself in the  leadership of Congresswoman Omar. She is a mother, daughter, refugee,  advocate, skilled policymaker, a duly and decisively elected third-term  Member to the U.S. House of Representatives.   I have spent time in the Minnesota Fifth. I have seen her pull her  community through grief and loss. I have seen her stand arm-in-arm on  picket lines with our educators and our nurses. I have seen her pass  historic legislation to feed our babies in our schools.   She has built coalitions, given constituents in crisis a sense of  agency and centered the most marginalized in word and deed.   No matter how embattled, no matter how racially profiled, no matter  how targeted, she has pressed on for peace over militarization, human  rights at home and abroad, a world where an education is a fundamental  right and where gender equity is recognized. I want to live in that  world. Let me make it plain: Congresswoman Ilhan Omar is right where  she belongs. Her work in Congress is needed.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to these cruel  efforts to terminate emergency declarations for COVID-19.   We are still very much in the midst of a public health crisis.  Moreover, one in five adults who have had COVID-19 are suffering from  prolonged health impacts known as long COVID.   Those living with long COVID experience debilitating symptoms which  impede their daily lives, from fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, muscle  contractions, and heart palpitations. These symptoms are often hard to  diagnose, leaving millions feeling as though their pain is invisible.   In Massachusetts' Seventh District, I hear these stories daily.  Abruptly ending these public health declarations would jeopardize the  health insurance of vulnerable community members, leaving many without  barriers to care that quite literally threaten their lives.   As we strive for a healthcare system and an economy that works for  all, it is imperative that we center the voices of COVID long-haulers  still reeling from this pandemic.                            ____________________
