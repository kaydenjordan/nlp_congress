 Mr. Speaker, Native American communities are facing  extraordinary challenges during this pandemic. Like other minority  communities, they are disproportionately affected by COVID-19 with  devastating loss of life and economic hardship. This pandemic has  magnified the health disparities and historic lack of resources that  exist within Indian Country. The HEROES Act contains many nonpartisan  priorities for Native Americans, reflecting bipartisan work to meet  their critical needs.   I acknowledge my coworker, Mr. Cole, on the floor with me on this  endeavor.   Mr. Speaker, we are providing $900 million through the Bureau of  Indian Affairs to assist Tribal governments to operate essential  community services and provide clean water and safe housing. $2.1  billion is for Indian Health Service to purchase additional PPE and  provide Tribes more telehealth. The bill includes dollars for  transportation, supports education for children, and $20 billion in  direct relief to Tribal governments.   The Federal Government must uphold its trust and treaty obligations  to Tribal nations. This bill is critical to ensure the health and  safety of our Native American brothers and sisters.
