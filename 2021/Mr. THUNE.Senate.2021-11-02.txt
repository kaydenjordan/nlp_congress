 Mr. President, in all of the time I have been in  Washington, in both the House and the Senate, I have seen Republicans  in control, in the majority, and I have seen Democrats in the majority.  I have been on both sides of that, and I have seen Republican  Presidents and Democrat Presidents. But one thing that doesn't change  is that, when Democrats get power in Washington, they want to expand  government, they want to grow government, they want to spend money.   If you just look throughout history, at least since the time I have  been here, that is just a fact. We have already seen them this year-- since the President came to power and the Democrats have had narrow  majorities in the House and Senate, which they have interpreted somehow  as being a mandate, but is a dead-even U.S. Senate--push through on a  partisan basis a $1.9 trillion spending bill which expanded government.  There is a $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill that has passed the Senate  in a bipartisan way, on which there was some agreement, and it is still  awaiting action in the House of Representatives.   Already--already--in this new administration, that represents over $3  trillion in spending, which is on infrastructure and some core hard  infrastructure with respect to the bipartisan bill.   The other bill was of a lot of things that the Republicans felt  weren't necessary, particularly after the five bills we passed last  year in 2020 in response to the pandemic.   By the way, every one of those was on a bipartisan basis. So a lot of  spending went on in responding to the pandemic--trillions and trillions  of dollars.   The first thing that happened when the Democrats came to power was  that they passed another $2 trillion, and then an infrastructure bill.  So we have already got over $3 trillion spent at a time when we have  $30 trillion in debt--and growing by the day. Yet the Democrats' now  proposal is to spend $3.5 trillion. Some on their side want to spend up  to $6 trillion to grow and expand the government.   So I guess it doesn't come as any surprise that that is what  Democrats do. When they gain power, when they get majorities, they want  to grow; they want to expand government; they want to spend more money  and raise taxes to do it. It is almost like kind of a rite of passage  in that, if you are going to be a good Democrat, this is what you do.   As I said before, you know, after last year, in coming through the  pandemic at a time when the country had to and both sides agreed to  address the concerns and the needs that were out there--to keep people  employed, to keep businesses operating and workers employed, to support  our healthcare industry, to support our schools--there were enormous  amounts of money that went into the economy last year.   You would think that when the Democrats took power this time that  they might want to dial it back and just think about seeing how the  economy reacts before going on a full-blown effort to grow and expand  government once again, but what we saw right out of the gate,  immediately--and, again, in a very partisan way--was a $2 trillion  spending bill.   I say that again because we all know that the amount of debt that we  have today dwarfs, eclipses, anything--anything--in history even close  to what we are talking about. Even if you go back to the thirties and  the big expansion of government then--and, by the way, I think part of  this is that President Biden was convinced that he could be the next  FDR. And to do that, you have got to spend lots of money. And so trying  to find stuff to spend it on has been a challenge. They have come up  with a big list, and a list, again, that would be financed with a lot  of tax increases that, I think, would be incredibly harmful to the  economy.   But what I want to talk about briefly this morning is just what has  happened as a result of the spending that has already occurred and  what, I think, is going to happen if the massive amount of spending  they want to do from here forward actually happens.   Like I said, we will do everything we can to stop it. I think it is  just an absolutely disastrous prescription for the economy right now  and as to what people are already experiencing in their daily lives.   Last week, we learned that economic growth for the third quarter had  fallen short of expectations, largely driven by a deceleration in  consumer spending and supply problems of goods and labor.   Meanwhile, American families continue to deal with what is rapidly  becoming a serious, long-term inflation problem that is attributable,  in many respects--again, as I will get to later--to the amount of  spending and the number of dollars that have been flooding the economy.   Last month, consumer prices rose at the fastest pace in 30 years. A  recent estimate from the chief economist at Moody's Analytics suggested  that an average household is having to spend an additional $175 a month  on basics, thanks to inflation--175 bucks a month.   That may not sound like much to a wealthy Democrat politician, but  that is a lot of money for an ordinary American family. Having $175 a  month can be the difference between putting something away in savings  and living paycheck to paycheck. It can be the difference between  whether or not you can afford braces for your child or whether you have  the money to replace a broken appliance or to make a needed car repair.   Our inflation problem has gotten to the point that it has overtaken  wage growth. Inflation is growing faster than wages, which means that  many American families have received a de facto pay cut. The growth in  wages isn't keeping up with the increase in costs in their lives.   So how did we end up here?   As I said, a lot of the problem traces back to this past March, when  the Democrats decided to pour a lot of unnecessary government money  into the economy under the guise of COVID relief. By the time the  President and the Democrats took office in January, Congress had passed  no fewer than five bipartisan COVID relief bills--the most recent of  them in December. The December COVID relief bill that we passed  contained almost $1 trillion in funding and met, essentially, all of  the pressing COVID needs the country was facing.   But that didn't matter. That didn't matter to the Democrats. Now that  they were in charge, they were eager to take advantage of the  opportunity the  [[Page S7581]]  COVID crisis presented to push their Big Government agenda. So they  decided to pass another ostensible COVID bill less than 3 months after  the December bill and before a lot of money from the December bill had  even been disbursed.   They gave $129 billion to schools, even though schools had spent just  a small fraction of the $68 billion they had already been given.   They created a staggering $350 billion slush fund for States, despite  the fact that the majority of States already had the money that they  needed to deal with the pandemic, and many, many States were operating  in a surplus situation.   They extended enhanced unemployment benefits until September of 2021,  despite the millions--literally millions--of available job openings;  and they made part of the unemployment compensation tax-free, creating  incentives for Americans to stay on unemployment instead of returning  to work.   Among other things, they provided an additional $21 billion in rental  assistance, none of which has yet been needed.   In short, their so-called American Rescue Plan flooded the economy  with a lot of unnecessary government money, and the results were  predictable: inflation.   The definition of ``inflation'' is too many dollars chasing too few  goods and services, and that is exactly the situation the Democrats  created. They sent too many dollars into the economy, and the economy  overheated as a result.   You don't have to take my word for it. Here is what former Obama  economic adviser Jason Furman had to say recently when discussing our  current inflation problem:         The original sin was an oversized American Rescue Plan. It       contributed to both higher output but also higher prices.    That was from Jason Furman, Obama's economic adviser.   That quote from Mr. Furman appeared in a recent New York Times  article that also noted:         But some economists, including veterans of previous       Democratic administrations, say much of Mr. Biden's inflation       struggle is self-inflicted. Lawrence H. Summers is one of       those who say the stimulus bill the president signed in March       gave too much of a boost to consumer spending . . . Mr.       Summers, who served in the Obama and Clinton administrations,       says inflation now risks spiraling out of control and other       Democratic economists agree there are risks.    So what are congressional Democrats doing in response? Well, they are  planning to flood the economy with even more government dollars. That  is right. Instead of keeping a sharp eye on government spending to make  sure our inflation situation doesn't get worse, Democrats are planning  to double down on the strategy that got us into this position in the  first place.   Democrats are trying to finalize a new--now it is $1.75 trillion-- tax-and-spending spree, the so-called Build Back Better plan, on top,  as I said, of the $1.9 trillion spending spree from earlier this year.  And I say $1.75 trillion, but Democrats have only arrived at that  number through a combination of shell games and budget gimmicks. The  real cost of this proposal over 10 years is going to be way, way  higher--way, way higher; some estimates in the $4 trillion range.   So, once again, Democrats want to flood the economy with government  dollars, including billions for such priorities as tree equity--tree  equity--and environmental justice programs at well-funded colleges and  universities. That is right--Ivy League schools that don't have  problems financially, where students pay tens of thousands of dollars  in tuition every year, will get tax credits if they teach courses on  environmental justice.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to complete my  remarks before the vote begins.    Mr. President, I am forcibly reminded that the definition  of ``insanity'' is the doing the same thing over and over again and  expecting different results. What exactly do Democrats think is going  to happen to inflation if they pass this $1.75 trillion legislation? Do  they think that if one round of excessive government spending triggered  inflation, another round of excessive government spending is going to  cure it? Do they think that dumping more fuel into an already  overheated economy is somehow going to put out the inflationary fire?  If they do, they have got another think coming.   The only thing Democrats' latest spending spree is going to do is  make our inflation problem worse. We are already looking at serious  inflation lasting well into next year. Add Democrats' Build Back Better  spending spree to the mix, and we could be looking at a very, very long  period of inflated prices and reduced spending power for American  families.   Democrats were warned that their March spending spree could spur  inflation; they passed it anyway. So I don't have a lot of hope that  Democrats are going to heed concerns about inflation, even coming from  their own economists, when it comes to their current tax-and-spending  plan, but I and every other Republican will stand firm against this  reckless tax-and-spending spree and will continue to urge our  Democratic colleagues to rethink their spending agenda before inflation  soars out of control and American families have to suffer the  consequences.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from South Dakota (Mr. Rounds).
