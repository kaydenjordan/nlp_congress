 Mr. Speaker, Americans have been hit hard by the high fuel  prices caused by the Biden administration's anti-energy policies.   Today, Virginia families are paying $3.30 a gallon at the pump for  regular gasoline, over a dollar more than when President Biden took  office. That is why we are bringing to the floor H.R. 1, the Lower  Energy Costs Act. This legislation will reduce costs by increasing  domestic energy production, cutting burdensome red tape, and reforming  the permitting process.   Folks, it is evident that Joe Biden has waged war on America's energy  independence. That war ends today.   House Republicans are working to put America back in the driver's  seat of energy production by voting for the Lower Energy Costs Act so  families can keep more of their hard-earned paychecks.   I urge every one of my colleagues to support this important  legislation.                            ____________________
