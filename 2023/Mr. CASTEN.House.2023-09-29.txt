 Mr. Speaker, with the failure of that last vote, we are  now less than 2 days away from shutting down the United States  Government, not because we don't have a path forward, but because the  party of Lincoln has been captured by the spirit of Yeats: The best of  you lack all conviction, and the worst are filled with passionate  intensity.   Extreme Republicans with passionate intensity are choosing to destroy  all that makes America great while their moderate enablers sit meekly,  lacking the conviction to oppose.   My question is, do any of you have a plan to land this plane? It  seems weird that you skipped that part of flight school.   Less than 2 days from now, every single American is going to feel the  pain of this crash, every soldier who wants to get paid, every woman  who wants food assistance for her child, everybody who needs housing  support, everybody who is wondering if the train they are riding on has  been inspected.   We don't have to be here, Mr. Speaker, but we need some of you, any  of you, to stand up.                            ____________________
