 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this  censure resolution.   I watched this video, and I was sickened when I saw Mr. Gosar  depicting the killing of another Member of this body and brandishing  swords at the President of the United States.   This kind of rhetoric is not just unfitting of a U.S. Representative,  it is dangerous, and it can be deadly, as we saw on January 6 and in  2011 when an individual shot then-Congresswoman Gabby Giffords after  Sarah Palin sent out a video with shooting targets on various  congressional districts, including Gabby's.   This is not a joke. This is not about politics. It is about safety.   While healthy debate on the issues, on policy, is important, it is  what keeps our democracy alive. This is not that. We cannot allow  Members to encourage and incite violence, period.   Mr. Gosar, you are no Alexander Hamilton. You must be held  accountable.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding,  and I appreciate the opportunity to speak about the President's vision  for really investing in working families in this country and doing it  in a way, particularly after COVID, that the economy is rebuilt so that  everyone has opportunities and that not only people at the top realize  their full potential and reap all the benefits, but that everyone in  this country can benefit from the economic recovery that the President  has articulated in the Build Back Better plan.   I have been in Congress now 11 years. I don't know that we have ever  had a better example of what leadership from the President means in  terms of understanding that the best way to grow the economy is to  invest in working families, to invest in middle-class families by  making sure they can access all of the opportunities that exist in this  country.   And what are those struggles? Affordable childcare, universal pre-K,  job training, lowering prescription drug costs, lowering the cost of  healthcare.   When the President made his address to the joint session of Congress,  what struck me in that speech was that President Biden identified  virtually every single struggle I hear about from my constituents in  Rhode Island--the high cost of prescription drugs, the high cost of  healthcare, the high cost of childcare, the inability to access pre-K,  difficulty retraining because of the absence of job training programs.  It is as if the President put together everything I have heard that  folks struggle with every day in this country, and he drafted and  included all those in the Build Back Better provisions.   When you take the bipartisan infrastructure bill along with the Build  Back Better legislation which we are about to pass, we are going to  create 1\1/2\ million jobs a year for a decade, and that is  extraordinary. These are good-paying, union jobs.   We are going to, for the first time, take on in a serious way the  climate crisis. We are going to drive down costs of everything from  prescription drugs to childcare to healthcare, and the best part about  it is it is paid for by making sure the wealthiest people in this  country and the most profitable corporations pay their fair share. My  constituents pay their fair share. They expect everyone to do the same.   And so we have this extraordinary investment in working families that  is going to give people an opportunity, move so many of the obstacles  that allow folks to return to the workforce, particularly women. Women  were devastated by the pandemic, particularly devastated.                                time  1830    If we did the bipartisan infrastructure bill alone, a lot of that  economic recovery would escape women in this country. The Build Back  Better provisions are going to ensure many of those obstacles that  prevent women from reentering the workforce are addressed so that our  economy can realize the full benefit of the extraordinary talent of  women in the workforce.   This economic recovery that we are all craving after 2 years of a  very difficult time with this pandemic, that economic recovery is going  to reach everyone in this country. It is going to begin with working  families and middle-class families, who for the first time, I think,  are going to be the focus of a very comprehensive strategy.   I am excited. I feel particularly honored to be in Congress at this  moment, and I thank the President for his leadership in developing a  plan to rebuild the middle class and address so many of the challenges  that working families face.   I thank you for giving me an opportunity to speak during this Special  Order hour, and I look forward to the passage of Build Back Better and  all it is going to mean for families in my State and all across this  country.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding,  for leading us in this Special Order hour, and for saying out loud the  names of the individuals who we have lost.   I am proud today to rise in recognition of Transgender Day of  Remembrance, which we will mark this Saturday, November 20, and in  remembrance of the transgender and gender nonconforming people whose  lives were taken this year.   Madam Speaker, 52 years ago, in the early morning hours of June 28,  1969, New York City Police raided the Stonewall Inn, a popular gay bar  in Greenwich Village. It had become a refuge and a well-known gathering  place for LGBTQI-plus individuals.   This was the third such raid on Greenwich Village bars in a short  period of time. Tired of harassment and blatant discrimination, patrons  began clashing with law enforcement outside the Stonewall Inn on  Christopher Street.   This was not the first time LGBTQI-plus people fought back, but these  clashes sparked an uprising that would unfold over the next 6 days and  fundamentally change LGBTQI-plus activism in the United States and  around the world.   At the forefront of this uprising were transgender and gender  nonconforming people like Marsha P. Johnson, the P standing for ``pay  it no mind,'' a common response Marsha would say to questions about her  gender.  [[Page H6365]]    Too often, transgender individuals are left out of the story of the  LGBTQ-plus rights movement, especially transgender women of color like  Marsha, as well as Sylvia Rivera and Miss Major Griffin-Gracy.   These three icons and so many other activists like them were and  continue to be the backbone of the LGBTQ-plus civil rights movement.  Miss Major, currently in her eighties, continues to fight against the  disproportionate incarceration rates of transgender people.   Tragically, so far this year, at least 46 transgender or gender  nonconforming people have been fatally shot or killed by other violent  means in our own country. 2021 marks an alarming milestone for the  transgender community: the deadliest year on record for transgender and  gender nonconforming people. Let me say it again: the deadliest year on  record for trans and gender nonconforming people.   This epidemic of violence particularly affects transgender women of  color, specifically Black and Latinx transgender women, who make up  more than three-quarters of the recorded 46 violent deaths this year.  These deaths are horrific, and we must act to end this violence.   The right to live freely without fear of persecution or  discrimination is one that every person needs and deserves. The  Equality Act adds sexual orientation and gender identity as protected  classes through existing civil rights law, ensuring that the  transgender community would have the same protections as everyone else.  I am so proud that we have passed that out of the House, and it is  awaiting action from the Senate.   The 2021 Transgender Day of Remembrance House resolution, of which I  am a proud cosponsor, commemorates November 20, 2021, as a day of  remembrance and memorializes the lives lost at the hands of anti- transgender violence in the United States and around the world. I urge  all of my colleagues to support this resolution.   Now is the time to show solidarity with the trans community. They  have done the work to bring injustice wrought against the LGBTQI-plus  community to light. They bear the brunt of violence, abuse, and even  death. It cannot continue. We must not let it continue.   Madam Speaker, as we remember the names of the transgender  individuals who gave their lives for this cause, we honor their legacy  by continuing the fight to ensure that all people, regardless of gender  and gender identity, are treated equally and justly in this country.   Madam Speaker, the forces working against progress are strong, but we  are stronger. I thank Congresswoman Newman for being one of the co- chairs of the Transgender Equality Task Force of the Equality Caucus,  for the good work in developing this resolution, and for leading this  Special Order hour tonight.
