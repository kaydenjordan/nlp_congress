 Mr. Speaker, today's theatrics are shocking.   Thirty-five million jobs are lost. Businesses and livelihoods are  ruined. While American grocers, nurses, and workers kept America going,  Democrats kept Congress in hiding for the past 3 weeks. Hiding is fear;  it is not leadership.   When we finally reconvened, we get this--Politico summed it up best:  ``Neither this bill nor anything resembling it will ever become law--it  is a Democratic wish list filled up with all the party's favored  policies.''   Is this a joke? Because it certainly isn't based on reality. Reality  would be working here for the last 3 weeks, examining each problem our  Nation faces, and working together to find the best solutions. That  shouldn't be all that difficult since, I would presume, we still have  the same goal: mitigate the virus and save our economy and society.   Right? That is still our goal, isn't it? If it is, then stop playing  games.   Mr. Speaker, $3 trillion of virtue signaling to your base is no way  to govern in the midst of a crisis, and you know it.
