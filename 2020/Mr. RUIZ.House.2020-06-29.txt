 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1425, the Patient  Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act.   We are in the middle of a global pandemic that has infected millions  of Americans, left millions more unemployed and struggling to pay their  bills, and underscored the American people's need for quality,  affordable healthcare.   It is precisely during this time; it is precisely in our moment of  history, during American families' hardships and agony; it is precisely  now that we must act for the people and fight to make healthcare more  affordable and accessible.   As an emergency physician, I have seen the faces of failed healthcare  policies, the anguish from severe illness and death that could have  been prevented if only the patient had routine care and health  insurance.   That is why today, for the patients who need to see a doctor and get  treatment, for the recently laid-off workers who just lost their health  insurance, for the families struggling economically, I ask you to join  me in voting for H.R. 1425, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care  Enhancement Act.   This bill would lower healthcare premiums for middle-class families;  encourage States to expand Medicaid; lower the cost of prescription  drugs; and strengthen protections for preexisting conditions, the same  ones that render a person more likely to die from COVID-19.   The American people need our help in this moment, and they need this  bill.
