 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the opportunity we  have today to lead on the crisis of climate change.   The climate change crisis is unlike any other that we have faced. It  cannot be defeated on the battlefield; it cannot be cured; it cannot be  wished away; and it, certainly, can no longer be denied.   What we can do is what we have always done and lead the community of  nations to address a problem that would leave our children and their  grandchildren with an unbelievable crisis and possibly a planet that  they can no longer inhabit.   The Paris climate agreement was a set of targets that we developed  that are not mandatory. The Paris climate agreement is about making a  statement that this is a problem and a crisis, and that America will  lead.   Today, this Chamber has an opportunity to say, yes, we will lead. We  will not hide from the problem. We will not let this crisis distract  us. We will lead.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 9 today and to send  a statement to the world that, as we have always done, we will lead on  this global crisis.                            ____________________
