 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I rise in  support of the creation of this bipartisan Select Committee on  Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese  Communist Party.   Like my friend from California said, the title is fundamental here.  This is a policy dispute between our government and the Chinese  Communist Party, not China, not the Chinese people.   Most Americans have a great affinity for the Chinese people, their  industriousness and technical talent both in China and as citizens  abroad.    The United States has a long history of partnership with China: in  the 19th century as a partner in trade; during World War II as an ally;  and our support of their growth over the past five decades.   Today, as a great power and as an ancient civilization, China has  been perverted by the modern leadership of leader for life Xi and the  CCP.   Sadly, this has been manifested by rampant intellectual property  theft, overburdening developing nations through corrupt credit  practices, manipulation of the facts in Wuhan, punishment of religious  thought, and the collapse of the rule of law in one of the freest  places on the globe in Hong Kong, and perhaps most offensively,  genocide of the Uyghurs and others.  [[Page H128]]    During the pandemic, we have witnessed the severe vulnerability of  the world's global supply chain as being far too reliant on China for  minerals, for pharmaceuticals, for medical supplies, for almost  everything.   This select committee will work to address the possible strategies to  meet and counter Xi's posture.   I urge all my colleagues to support its creation. I wish Chairman  Gallagher well in his mission.
