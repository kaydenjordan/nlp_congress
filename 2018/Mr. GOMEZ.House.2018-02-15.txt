 Madam Speaker, a budget reflects one's values. President  Trump's budget shows he values polluters and profits over people.   With the ink barely dry on the Republican tax scam, Trump's budget  proposes we pay for their corporate giveaway by gutting public health  and environmental programs.   One of the budget's largest targets is the EPA, which will suffer a  25 percent cut. This means cuts to grants that help States like  California implement the Clean Air and Clean Water Act. That means cuts  to Superfund programs that clean up sites where toxic chemicals from  factories and landfills were dumped for decades, polluting the  surrounding soil, water, and air.   We simply cannot afford a dirty budget that prioritizes polluters and  profits over people.                            ____________________
