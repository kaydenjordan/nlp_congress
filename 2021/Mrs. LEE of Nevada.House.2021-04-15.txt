 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the  hundreds of thousands of Nevadans who are still struggling to put food  on the table.   I rise for those who can't bear to look their children in the eye  when they are asked, ``What's for dinner.''   Right now, in my home State of Nevada, where our economy has been  devastated by this pandemic, 304,000 adults say that they don't have  enough food to eat. Of that, 132,000 say that their children don't have  enough to eat. This is entirely unacceptable. There is no excuse for a  child to go hungry in our country.   But I am glad to say that help is here.   The American Rescue Plan will cut child poverty in half through  payments, bolster child tax credits, and the expansion of food  assistance programs. For the first time in a long time, millions of  children across this country will be lifted out of poverty and allowed  a stable and secure childhood.   We all know that our children are our future, and the smartest  investment we can make is in them, which is just one of the many  reasons I am proud to support the American Rescue Plan.                            ____________________
