 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the voice of agriculture in Pennsylvania and beyond, Mr. Dave Williams.   Dave has been a key voice in agriculture for more than 20 years. A  farmer himself, Mr. Williams never expected to air on nearly 30 radio  stations, three networks, and weekly PCN-TV.   His first show aired on WDNH-AM 1590 in 1998. He believed it was  important to involve the consumers who buy and eat the foods so that  they could have a better understanding. He was right. From there he  went on to interview State and Federal legislators,  [[Page H6056]]  Governors, State agriculture officials, and of course, a lot of farm  family stories.   In January of this year, David was the recipient of the Gerald W.  Reichard Impact Award, given annually to someone who has had a  significant overall impact on the Pennsylvania Farm Show.   Dave continues to use his platform for agriculture advocacy,  highlighting the important work of farmers and ranchers in Pennsylvania  and across the country.    Thank you, Dave, for your important work, and thank you for being a  voice of agriculture.                            ____________________
