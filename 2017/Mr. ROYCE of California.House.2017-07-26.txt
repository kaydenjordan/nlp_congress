 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  agree to the resolution (H. Res. 317) calling for the unconditional  release of United States citizens and legal permanent resident aliens  being held for political purposes by the Government of Iran, as  amended.  [[Page H6332]]    The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 317         Whereas Iran has taken as hostages several United States       citizens, including Siamak and Baquer Namazi and Xiyue Wang,       as well as United States legal permanent resident, Nizar       Zakka;        Whereas Siamak Namazi was detained on October 15, 2015,       falsely accused, and convicted on October 18, 2016, for       ``collaborating with a hostile government'' and has been held       for extended periods in solitary confinement and under       constant interrogation;        Whereas former UNICEF official Baquer Namazi, the 80-year       old father of Siamak Namazi, was detained on February 22,       2016, falsely accused, and sentenced to 10 years in prison       for the same crime as his son;        Whereas former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon       urged Iranian authorities to release Baquer Namazi, whose       health status is deteriorating, to allow his family to care       for him;        Whereas UNICEF has issued four public statements on Baquer       Namazi's behalf;        Whereas Xiyue Wang, a graduate student at Princeton       University, was arrested in Iran on or about August 7, 2016,       while studying Farsi and researching the late Qajar dynasty       as background for his doctoral dissertation, detained by Iran       in Evin prison for almost a year, falsely charged with       espionage, and sentenced to 10 years in prison;        Whereas Robert Levinson, a United States citizen and       retired agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation,       traveled to Kish Island, Iran, and disappeared on March 9,       2007;        Whereas the United States Government had ``secured a       commitment from the Iranians . . . to try and gather       information about Mr. Levinson's possible whereabouts'' but       has not received any information thus far;        Whereas Nizar Zakka, a United States legal permanent       resident alien and Lebanese national, who is also in a       weakened physical state, was unlawfully detained around       September 18, 2015, after presenting at a conference in Iran       at Iran's invitation, and was later falsely charged with       being a spy and sentenced to 10 years at the Evin prison;        Whereas, on April 13, 2017, the Department of the Treasury       sanctioned the Tehran Prisons Organization and its former       head, Sohrab Soleimani, and White House Press Secretary Sean       Spicer noted ``The sanctions against human rights abusers in       Iran's prisons come at a time when Iran continues to unjustly       detain in its prisons various foreigners, including US       citizens Siamak Namazi and Baquer Namazi'';        Whereas, on April 25, 2017, at the meeting of the Joint       Commission overseeing implementation of the Joint       Comprehensive Plan of Action, the Department of State       reported that the United States delegation had ``raised with       the Iranian delegation its serious concerns regarding the       cases of U.S. citizens detained and missing in Iran, and       called on Iran to immediately release these U.S. citizens so       they can be reunited with their families'';        Whereas elements of the Iranian regime are reportedly using       nationals, dual-nationals, and permanent residents from the       United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, and other       countries to exact political or financial concessions; and        Whereas reports indicate that the Government of Iran is       seeking additional payments or other concessions, including       relief from economic sanctions, from the families of hostages       and their governments as a condition of release, a practice       banned by the 1979 International Convention Against the       Taking of Hostages and other international legal norms: Now,       therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) calls on the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran       to release unconditionally Siamak Namazi, Baquer Namazi,       Xiyue Wang, Nizar Zakka, and any other United States citizen,       legal permanent resident alien, or foreign national being       unjustly detained in Iran;        (2) urges the President to make the release of United       States citizens and legal permanent resident aliens held       hostage by the Government of Iran the highest of priorities;        (3) requests that the United States and its allies whose       nationals have been detained consider establishing a       multinational task force to secure the release of the       detainees;        (4) urges the Government of Iran to take meaningful steps       towards fulfilling its repeated promises to assist in       locating and returning Robert Levinson, including immediately       providing all available information from all entities of the       Government of Iran regarding the disappearance of Robert       Levinson to the United States Government;        (5) encourages the President to take meaningful action to       secure the release of Siamak Namazi, Baquer Namazi, Xiyue       Wang, Nizar Zakka, and any other United States citizen, legal       permanent resident alien, or foreign national being unjustly       detained in Iran if the Government of Iran does not release       such United States citizens, legal permanent resident aliens,       and foreign nationals; and        (6) encourages the President to take meaningful action to       secure the return of Robert Levinson if the Government of       Iran does not locate and return him.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material in the Record.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this particular resolution calls for the unconditional  release of American citizens and legal permanent residents that are  being held as prisoners right now, being held in jail by the Iranian  regime.   I would like to begin by thanking the ranking member and the chair of  our Middle East Subcommittee--and that is both Ms. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen,  the chair, who is with us, and Mr. Ted Deutch--for their tireless work  on behalf of these victims and on behalf of the families. They have  introduced this resolution along with Congresswoman Nita Lowey and  Congressman Judge Ted Poe.   The reason for it, as you all know, is that Iran just continues to  engage in this despicable practice of detaining people who are visiting  Iran, and then they come up with fabricated criminal charges, and then  these innocent people are held captive; but not just held captive, it  is the brutal conditions which they find themselves in.   When we have talked to those and they have shown us what they have  been through, these former prisoners in Iran, these Americans, they  describe being subjected to electric shock, to forced drug withdrawal,  through whippings, solitary confinement, they are denied medical care  oftentimes, and routinely forced to sleep on the floor, if they are  permitted to sleep at all.   Right now we have a number of U.S. citizens, Siamak and Baquer  Namazi, Xiyue Wang, and U.S. permanent resident Nizar Zakka.   These U.S. citizens and permanent residents were imprisoned after  being falsely accused of collaborating with a hostile government or  accused of espionage. Their families are paralyzed with fear about how  they are being treated.   Why is Iran so intent on holding Americans on bogus politicized  charges?   It is because the Iranian regime believes it can use detained  Americans as leverage to demand concessions, like ransom or sanctions  relief, in violation of the International Convention Against the Taking  of Hostages.                                time  1445    U.S. citizen Robert Levinson, he is still missing, and this is after  10 years. He disappeared 10 years ago in Iran, and Iran has not  remotely fulfilled its commitment to try to help locate him.   Our committee has held multiple hearings with these prisoners'  families, most recently yesterday, when family Members testified before  our Middle East and North Africa Subcommittee, and we thank them for  their bravery in sharing their stories.   We stand in solidarity with these citizens and with their families as  we call for their release. We can't imagine the horror that one would  be experiencing, but our hearts are with you, and we are committed to  advocate on behalf of you and your loved ones.   H. Res. 317 calls on Iran to let these Americans, and all individuals  being unjustly detained by Iran, come home. And it also calls on Iran  to fulfill its many promises to help find Bob Levinson. It also urges  the President to prioritize release of these captives and encourages  him to take meaningful action to secure their release.   Last week, the administration called on Iran to release these  unjustly detained U.S. citizens, or to face new and serious  consequences. We appreciate the administration's actions so far and,  with this resolution, urge continual attention to this matter until all  of these prisoners have been safely returned to their families.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), who chairs the Foreign  Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa, the author of  this measure.    I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1  minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe). He is the chairman of the Foreign  Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would just say that the individuals that we are  talking about, the Americans that are being held in captivity and their  families, have been suffering for far too long. I think our country  needs to take decisive action to secure their release, and I believe  that we have got to make sure that Iran and all other hostile actors  who would follow Iran down this road know that taking U.S. prisoners  does not pay.   I again thank Mr. Engel and the gentlewoman and gentleman from  Florida, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Ted Deutch, for their leadership,  along with Nita Lowey and Ted Poe.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution as the  next step toward bringing these innocent people back home to the United  States, and I yield back the balance of my time.
