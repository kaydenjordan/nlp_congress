 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that Members  have 5 days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize the dedicated public  servant and congressional aide, Exodie C. Roe, III, who has been  instrumental in helping me serve the constituents of California's Ninth  and Eleventh Congressional Districts.   Exodie C. Roe, III was born in Stockton, California, to Exodie C.  Roe, Jr. and LaJuana Johnson Bivens. He credits his mother and his  nonbiological father, Robert ``Bobby'' Bivens, Sr., as his inspiration  for pursuing a career in public service.   Exodie is a 2002 graduate of Stagg High School in Stockton and a 2006  graduate of Dillard University in New Orleans, Louisiana. This year he  was honored by Dillard University with the ``40 Under 40'' award for  his public service achievements.   Exodie began his service in my Stockton office as a field  representative when I was first elected in 2007. In this role he  developed the first major congressional foreclosure assistance workshop  in the country that helped more than 500 residents and hundreds more  through subsequent housing workshops. He also organized dozens of  Congress at Your Corner events and several other events throughout my  district. For his contributions to the residents of San Joaquin County,  Exodie was featured in San Joaquin Magazine's ``5 People Under 30 to  Watch For'' edition as the Change Maker.   After working in my Stockton office for 4 years, Exodie was promoted  to legislative assistant and relocated to my Washington, D.C. office in  2011. Exodie was promoted again in 2015 to senior legislative  assistant. During his time in my office, he worked on several  legislative initiatives and two bills that were signed into law.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Exodie  C. Roe, III for his contributions to our community and for his  invaluable public service over the past 12 years.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
