 Mr. Chairman, I am proposing the ``last servicemember  standing service medal.''   Mr. Chairman, I have the privilege and responsibility to share the  story of the late, great American soldier Sergeant John Eade of Toledo,  Ohio.   In 1965, at aged 21, he deployed to la Drang Valley, Vietnam, as fire  team leader in 2nd Platoon, Alpha Company, 2nd Battalion, 7th Air  Cavalry Regiment.   On November 14, the single deadliest day for American forces of the  war, Sergeant Eade and his team became pinned down by the Vietcong due  to terrible intelligence.   By the end of that bloody day and night, he was the only surviving  member of his platoon, sustaining shrapnel wounds to his legs, struck  by napalm, and shot in the shoulder and abdomen. He was wounded by  grenades that affected his walking for the rest of his life. His face  was terribly wounded, resulting in the loss of his eye, injuries that  he dealt with his entire life.   He refused to withdraw, repeatedly exposing himself to the onslaught  to hold the southwestern flank.   Regrettably, the Department of Defense has yet to appropriately honor  his valor and those of other soldiers who gave everything to this  country with a Distinguished Service Cross because there were no  witnesses to attest to his sheer heroism.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support a last servicemember  standing medal that would recognize not just Sergeant Eade but all of  America's greatest soldiers who continue to fight for their country  against enemy forces even as every one of their squad mates gave their  lives.   Please support the last servicemember standing award. I am grateful  for the time allowed today.
