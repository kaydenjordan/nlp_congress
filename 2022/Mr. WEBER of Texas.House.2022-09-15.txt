 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of  one Jefferson County Sheriff's Office Deputy James Lee, who tragically  passed away on July 9, leaving behind a legacy of service to Jefferson  County.   Deputy Lee was a former marine. Maybe I should say is a marine  because once a marine, always a marine. Deputy Lee was one who started  with the  [[Page H7848]]  Jefferson County Sheriff's Office in 1973 and was 71 years old when he  passed.   He was known as someone who enjoyed going to work to protect his  community and who was tough but always showed compassion. He leaves  behind a wife and a son, who will follow in his father's footsteps at  the sheriff's office.   Though he may be gone, I know that Deputy Lee is still watching over  his beloved community and family.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing the extraordinary life and  service of one Deputy James Lee.   He will be missed.                            ____________________
