 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jayla Atkinson,  a junior from Stow-Munroe Falls City High School as the champion of the  week for Ohio's 13th Congressional District.   Jayla recently won the Division I State title in the 800-meter race  with a winning time of 2 minutes 10.74 seconds.   Jayla's win highlights the importance of perseverance and the will to  win because last year, Jayla finished second in the 800-meter State  meet, but she did not quit.   After a year of training, hard work, and dedication, Jayla came back  stronger than ever, bringing the Division I State title back to Ohio's  13th District.   Jayla is truly an exceptional athlete, and her achievements made her  family, teammates, coaches, and community proud.   Madam Speaker, once again, I congratulate Jayla Atkinson on her  Division I State title and wish her the best of luck in her future  competitions. I thank her for making the birthplace of champions proud.                            ____________________
