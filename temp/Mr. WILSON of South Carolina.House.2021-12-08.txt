 Mr. Speaker, the fake news concealing  of Bidenflation only reinforces manipulation of facts. Real people see  with their eyes Biden policies are disastrous, destroying jobs.   Anti-energy stopping of pipelines and pausing leases for oil and gas  have intentionally raised pump prices 61 percent. This leads to higher  costs in food  [[Page H7552]]  prices and transportation costs for all products, and home heating is  up 54 percent.   With inflation at a 40-year high after the most expensive  Thanksgiving, now we face the most expensive Hanukkah and Christmas.   The Democrat elite think they are smarter than everyone and think  Democrat voters and Democrat media are ignorant to believe that this  $4.5 trillion costs zero dollars.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years, as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to welcome Hunter Taylor Wilson, Jr., born  today at 2 a.m., son of Dr. Julianne Jett Wilson and my No. 4 son,  Hunter Taylor Wilson, Sr., of West Columbia, South Carolina.                            ____________________
