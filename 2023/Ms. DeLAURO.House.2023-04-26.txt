 Mr. Speaker, preventing default is an obligation that  Congress has. My Republican colleagues are holding our economy hostage,  linking it to the annual process of funding the critical programs that  serve American families and veterans.   The price of averting a catastrophic default is drastic cuts to these  programs now and severe caps for the next 10 years.   Republicans claim that veterans' healthcare would be protected. That  is not the case. For 6 hours during the Rules Committee meeting last  night, I told House Republicans that veterans had no protections  whatsoever in their debt default bill.   Given the look on their faces, I believe I was the one to inform them  of the immediate $2 billion rescission that robs veterans of timely  access to healthcare services. I do not think they know what it is in  their own bill.   You know what they did after 6 hours of debate? Nothing for veterans.  You know what they did after hearing from dozens of veteran and  military service organizations about the lack of protections in the  bill? Nothing for veterans.   In the middle of the night, they made last-minute changes to win over  Republican holdouts. You know what they did after going back to the  drawing board?   Nothing for veterans. Nothing to fix the $2 billion rescission.  Nothing to protect veterans from a 22 percent cut.  [[Page H2015]]    Nothing to maintain our commitment to veterans who have been exposed  to burn pits, Agent Orange, and other toxic substances.   This is shameful. This default and cuts bill should not even come to  this floor for a vote. Our veterans sacrificed for us. We owe them the  benefits that they have already earned.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill and vote ``yes'' for  veterans. By voting ``no,'' you say ``yes'' to veterans.
