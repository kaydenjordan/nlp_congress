 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, as  well as Mr. DeFazio for his leadership on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, the Recovering America's Wildlife Act, I believe, is the  single most exciting policy development in the conservation space in  decades.   As an amendment to today's bill, we are doing three things here: We  are protecting ecosystems; we are enhancing community; and we are  supporting recreation.   I also add my thanks to Representative Debbie Dingell, who has been a  tremendous leader in this particular effort, as well as Jamie Raskin,  the Congressman from Maryland, for joining us.   Mr. Speaker, most Americans don't know that the Federal Government  requires that States do wildlife management planning. This amendment  funds that Federal mandate in a more creative fashion, by connecting  resource extraction with prudent resource recovery, to help States  improve their plans and create a continuity of habitat for multiuse  opportunities within communities. That is why we have such a diverse  group of persons supporting this bill: Hunters and anglers and birders  and hikers and other wildlife enthusiasts, as well as those who are  involved in the burgeoning field of ecotourism.   Mr. Speaker, here is another benefit. When something goes wrong, of  course, we tend to act. And in this regard, we act through a very  important law  [[Page H3008]]  called the Endangered Species Act. But this amendment puts preventative  measures in place, moving upstream from the emergency room enactment of  the Endangered Species Act and moving us from regulation and litigation  to collaboration and conservation, which saves huge amounts of  government resources, societal resources, while it also enhances our  environmental security.   And while there are some structural difficulties with the overall  bill from my perspective, nonetheless, this provision is a winner.
