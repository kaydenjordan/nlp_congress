 Mr. President, the question before us is quite simple:  Do we want stimulus checks to go to households with family incomes of  $300,000 or do we want to target the assistance to struggling families  who need the help and provide a boost for the economy?   I urge my colleagues to support the Manchin-Collins amendment.    Mr. President, on behalf of myself, Senator Manchin,  Senator Capito, Senator Moran, Senator Shaheen, Senator Portman, and  Senator King, I call up amendment No. 546 and ask that it be reported  by number.    Mr. President, I ask that I be notified when I have 30  seconds remaining.    Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to replenish  and strengthen the Provider Relief Fund, which has been a lifeline for  hospitals, nursing homes, and community health centers, as well as  physician practices across the country, but especially so in rural  America.    Mr. President, our rural hospitals have been  particularly hard hit during this pandemic.   With that, I would yield to my friend from West Virginia.
