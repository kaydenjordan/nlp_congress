 Mr. President, last night Senators reached a bipartisan  agreement on a package of Russia sanctions for the Senate to vote on as  an amendment to the pending Iran sanctions.  [[Page S3415]]    It was the result of several days of negotiations and hard work. The  Republican leader and I spent a lot of time on this, and I thank him  for that, as did Senators Crapo, Brown, Cardin, Corker, Shaheen,  Durbin, and Menendez. I thank each of them for their efforts and their  expertise in getting this done.   In particular, I thank Senator Cardin, ranking member of the Foreign  Relations Committee, who is one of the most trusted voices in our  caucus on this issue. He did an excellent job of forging a bipartisan  consensus on this committee with little regard for the credit he would  receive. I also want to thank Senator Brown, our ranking member on  Banking, who has been steadfast in making sure we would get a good,  effective sanctions bill done. We wouldn't have done this also without  Senators Shaheen, Durbin, Menendez, and their staffs. I thank all of  them.   The final result of these negotiations is a good result for our  country. By codifying the existing sanctions and requiring  congressional review of any decision to weaken or lift them, we are  ensuring that the United States continues to punish President Putin for  his reckless and destabilizing actions. I believe it is particularly  significant that a bipartisan coalition is seeking to reestablish  Congress as a final arbiter of sanctions relief, no matter what the  administration does, particularly, considering that this administration  has been too eager to put sanctions relief on the table. These  additional sanctions will also send a powerful and bipartisan statement  to Russia and any other country that might try to interfere in our  elections that they will be punished, and Congress will stand firm in  making sure they are punished, Democrats and Republicans.   Again, I thank my Republican and Democratic colleagues for putting  party aside, for doing what is best for the country. I hope this  agreement quickly passes both the House and Senate, and we hope the  President will sign this legislation as well, even though it cedes the  power to Congress.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am frankly disturbed by the new  strategy on the hard right to discredit Special Counsel Mueller and  sully his reputation. Their strategy is clear. They know or suspect  that facts might not be good for the President so they are trying to  vilify the man who is in charge of finding them, but they have chosen  the wrong man. Anyone who engages in these baseless attacks about Mr.  Mueller's character is only heaping dishonor upon themselves.   Mr. Mueller is known for his service to America and for his  integrity. He is a straight arrow. He is a Republican. Only a few weeks  ago, these same hard-right commentators and pundits were praising Mr.  Mueller. They were lauding his qualities. Even Attorney General Jeff  Sessions has unequivocally praised Mr. Mueller in the past for his  service and credibility. Sessions said, Mueller's ``integrity is  undoubted . . . his experience and love of country is undoubted.''   To these hard-right commentators who are attacking this honorable man  who is trying to do a job for our country and see that the rule of law  is obeyed, read what Attorney General Sessions has said.   Now, because Director Comey's testimony has made President Trump's  actions less and less defendable, these hard-right commentators have  turned tail. They have started an ad hominem, nasty assault on a career  public servant and a very fine man.   A close associate of the President, Mr. Christopher Ruddy, has even  insinuated that the President might fire Special Counsel Mueller. I  can't think of a worse move for the President at this time. I would  have him look back in history and see what happened to a President who  tried to do the same thing.   I have one question. What are these people who are attacking Mueller  afraid of? Are they afraid of what Mr. Mueller is going to find? Is the  White House afraid of what Mr. Mueller is going to uncover?   It seems pretty obvious that if they were not worried, they would let  Mueller proceed because they would be confident he would find nothing.  I find no other legitimate reason why the critics would flip so quickly  to attack a man of integrity unless they were worried about what he  might find. Again, if the White House truly has nothing to hide, they  ought to encourage Special Counsel Mueller to investigate. They should  let him do his job.   When people say ``where there is smoke, there is fire,'' they are  pointing to actions like this, and it makes the American people  distrustful of the White House and their allies.   I know these attacks probably don't bother Mr. Mueller. He has a very  strong spine, and he will go after the facts regardless of the noise  around him, but they are bothersome, they are wrong, and they are  nasty.   One of the most important things in our democracy is a bedrock faith  in the rule of law; that no person is above the rule of law. The  President's allies are going to attack every single law enforcement  agent involved in the Russia investigation. If the White House ever  joins in those attacks, it will greatly erode the American people's  faith in the rule of law and do significant damage to our democracy at  a time when it seems somewhat more fragile than it has in the past.  This is not a game. This is not fun.   This is a very serious investigation that is headed by one of the  most trusted men in Washington. It is about foreign interference in our  elections, something that eats at--that corrodes the very roots of our  democracy, the very wellspring of our being, and pride as a nation. I  would urge that these attacks on Mr. Mueller be ceased and that my  friends on the other side join me in defending his reputation. They  have gone a little too far.                            ____________________     Mr. President, finally on healthcare, there are only 11  calendar days of Senate business left before the July 4th recess, and  yet Republicans are looking to vote on a final healthcare bill before  the deadline, and not a soul outside the Republican caucus has seen the  bill. I am not sure that every Member of the Republican caucus inside  has seen it.   To everyone in America, this should be a red alert. This should be a  red alert for doctors, hospital administrators, and patient groups,  groups that represent older Americans, groups that fight for children's  healthcare, groups that fight for better treatment for substance abuse  and mental health. This should be a red alert for working families  across this country whose lives depend on affordable healthcare and yet  have no earthly idea what their representatives in Congress might pass  in just 2 short weeks.   They might never know. The Republicans have not scheduled a single  committee hearing--not one--not a single committee hearing on a bill  that would reorganize one-sixth of the American economy, touch the  lives of millions of Americans--a life-and-death issue for some--not a  single committee hearing or public debate on a bill that would  potentially change drastically the way Medicaid is funded, the way  women are treated in our healthcare system, the way we treat older  Americans and those with preexisting conditions.   Why on Earth haven't we had a single committee hearing on a bill of  this magnitude? Why on Earth is this bill being hidden from public  view?   There is only one reason. The Republican majority is afraid of the  American people learning what is in their healthcare bill. They don't  want the American people to know how much they cut and destroy Medicaid  or how fat of a tax break they give to the wealthiest few because they  know the backlash would be severe. In short, by their actions, it seems  our Republican colleagues are ashamed of this bill, and they know their  chances of passing the Republican healthcare bill would plummet if they  release a bill that looks anything like the House healthcare bill,  which only a tiny sliver of Americans support--17 percent in the last  poll. The majority of Republicans and the majority of Trump voters are  opposed to TrumpCare.   So our Republican colleagues have made a calculation, which is  ultimately self-defeating, to keep their healthcare bill hidden from  view under lock and key until the last possible moment. Maybe this is  the only strategy to pass a bill as unpopular as this  [[Page S3416]]  bill is going to be. Maybe it will shield their bill from criticism in  the short term, but make no mistake, there will be a reckoning if this  bill is passed.   Passing a bill of this scale, with so many consequences for the  American people, without telling them what is in it, without telling  them how they would fare, the political retribution will be swift. It  will be a catastrophe for the Republican Party. I am afraid, worse,  this bill will be a catastrophe for the American people.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, before we recess for the caucus lunches,  I wish to comment on the upcoming vote on a resolution of disapproval  regarding a portion of President Trump's recent arms sales to Saudi  Arabia. I have announced that I am in favor of the resolution of  disapproval for several reasons.   First, the human rights and humanitarian concerns have been well  documented with respect to Yemen. Yemen's story in the Middle East is a  tragic one. Yemen's previous President ruled the country for decades  with an iron fist and fleeced the country of its resources for his  personal gain. He also allowed terrorist groups to enjoy safe haven in  Yemen in the days after 9/11.   Today, Yemen remains a country in dire straits. It is on the verge of  a famine, and there have been over 100,000 cases of cholera.   To make matters worse, the current conflict in Yemen, which includes  the Saudi military, has worsened the humanitarian situation. Selling  the kingdom precision weapons in this deal could further exacerbate the  crisis.   Second, and of equal concern to me, is an area that hasn't been  talked about much in this debate; that is, that the Saudi Government  continues to aid and abet terrorism via its support and funding of  schools that spread extremist Wahhabi propaganda. Saudi Arabia's  support for these Wahhabi madrassas goes back decades. It is  responsible for much of the radicalization of Muslim youth in the  Middle East and North Africa.   In the past several months, we have witnessed lone-wolf attacks in  London and in Tehran and elsewhere around the globe. Though the nature  of terrorism has changed, many of the sources are the same. The  propagation of Wahhabism, an extreme ideology, continues to fuel  radicalism and terrorism around the globe. So if we want to get serious  about cracking down on terrorism, the United States should focus--one  of the focuses should be--on countering the spread of Wahhabism.   The White House has not clearly articulated how the United States  will put pressure on Saudi Arabia to end their support of Wahhabi  schools, even as it claims that President Trump's recent visit to  Riyadh was focused on curtailing terrorism. Furthermore, the  administration has not sufficiently assured Congress that these weapons  will not fall into the wrong hands.   Look at Pakistan. It has become a radical place--it wasn't 15 years  ago--in good part because of Saudi funding--Saudi individuals who are a  good part of the government, some who are friends with the government-- of these madrassas, which taught radicalism to the Pakistani people.   Look at Indonesia, one of the largest countries in the world. It had  usually practiced a form of Islam that was mild and tolerant. The  Wahhabi schools are now flourishing in Indonesia, and it is becoming a  radical place of danger to us.   We have to send a message to Saudi Arabia.   They do some good things. I support their putting pressure, for  instance, on the Palestinian Authority to finally make peace with  Israel. But they do a lot of bad things. It seems there has almost been  a rotten deal between the Saudi monarchy and the Wahhabi clerics to  work together. It has to end.   My vote for this resolution of disapproval hopefully can send a  message to the Saudis that their behavior in regard to Wahhabism must  change. It is hurting the world and eventually will hurt them.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I will not object, but I reserve the  right to object.   First, I want to thank the majority leader, as well as Senators  Corker, Cardin, Crapo, and Brown. This is another example of how we can  work together on issues we agree on. I am very proud of this bill. I  think it will do a lot of good in both directions--in the Iran  direction and particularly in the Russia direction. The lack of trust  of Mr. Putin on both sides of the aisle here is paramount. Now this  says that these sanctions will stay in place unless Congress  disapproves them and adds some new sanctions--both good things. I hope  the House will pass the bill without change and send it to the  President's desk.  [[Page S3429]]    With that, I withdraw any objection and again thank the majority  leader for the cooperation we have had.
