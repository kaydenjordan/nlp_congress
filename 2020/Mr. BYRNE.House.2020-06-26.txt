 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to overriding  President Trump's veto of H.J. Res. 76.   Everyone in this Chamber can agree that schools that commit fraud and  take advantage of students must be held accountable. However, returning  to the 2016 borrower defense rule put in place by the Obama  administration is not the answer.   Put simply, the Obama-era rule sends millions of taxpayer dollars to  those who were not harmed by their university. Under the Obama-era  rule, the standard to define fraud was placed so low that the  Department of Education saw about 300,000 relief applications in just 5  years. Compare that to the just 59 applications in the previous 20  years the borrower defense process has been in place.   Understanding this problem, the Trump administration released an  updated borrower defense rule in 2019 to prevent fraud, ensure taxpayer  dollars are spent responsibly, and cut the regulatory red tape that has  made it difficult for students and educational institutions to  understand the old rule.   The new rule also ensures that due process, a founding principle of  our Nation, is in place for both students and institutions.   The cost of allowing the Obama rule to stand is great, over 40  billion taxpayer dollars. Thankfully, the changes made by the Trump  administration will save taxpayers billions while still ensuring that  students are protected from fraud.   The Trump administration rule applies relief where it is needed,  unlike the overly broad Obama-era rule. This should be something both  parties can support.   Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that students who are defrauded by  educational institutions deserve debt relief, but the Obama-era rule is  not the answer.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and sustain the President's veto.
