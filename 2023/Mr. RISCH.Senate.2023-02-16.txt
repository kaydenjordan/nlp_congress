 Mr. President, as a member and former chairman of  the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each month  I recognize and celebrate the American entrepreneurial spirit by  highlighting the success of a small business in my home State of Idaho.  Today, I am pleased to honor The Shoe and Tack Shop, as the Idaho Small  Business of the Month for February 2023.   The Shoe and Tack shop, owned by Steve, Patty, and Clay Gorrell, has  been in business since January 17, 1979. Steve, a cowboy and rodeo  clown, met Patty while working for her father at Simplot. The two  married in 1970 and moved to Colorado a few years later. During their  time in Colorado, Steve managed 40,000 head of cattle for Lebsack and  Patty worked as a supervisor for Miller Western Wear. By 1978, they  found their way back to Twin Falls, ID, where Steve worked for his  father's business, Dan's Boot Repair. Five months later, Steve and  Patty moved to Jerome and began their venture at shoe repair.   What started as a boot and shoe repair shop has since evolved into a  retail store, where the Gorrell family makes and sells their own cowboy  gear. The Gorrell family has mastered their craftsmanship--Clay is an  artisan, who does much of the tooling, Patty does the intricate sewing,  and Steve does a little bit of everything.   The Gorrells commitment to the community shows through knowledgeable,  fair, and honest treatment of their customers. From building and  repairing tack, to offering advice on the best pair of boots, the  Gorrells offer exceptional service. Their journey from humble  beginnings to becoming a community stronghold exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. They are truly a local gem.   Congratulations to the Gorrell family on their selection as the Idaho  Small Business of the Month for February 2023. Thank you for serving  Idaho as small business owners and entrepreneurs. You make Idaho proud,  and I look forward to your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
