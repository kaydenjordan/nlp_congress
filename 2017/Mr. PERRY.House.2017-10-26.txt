 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the 75th anniversary of  Indian Rock Dam in York County, Pennsylvania.   Indian Rock Dam was completed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in  1942 as part of an unprecedented boom of water resource infrastructure  construction across America that stemmed from the Flood Control Act of  1936.   It is an earth and rock structure measuring 1,000 feet long, rising  83 feet above the streambed that dams up to 9.1 billion gallons of  water that otherwise would inundate downstream communities.   While impossible to prevent all floods, we can limit the damage and  risk. Since Indian Rock Dam was completed in 1942, it has prevented  more than $55 million in potential flood damage to our community of  York, Pennsylvania.   Managed by the Corps' Baltimore District, Indian Rock Dam is one of  the 13 Corps dam projects in the Susquehanna River watershed.   For 75 years, Indian Rock Dam has been a silent protector for our  citizens. For that and its continued benefit of reducing risks to  Americans downstream, I am proud to recognize the 75th anniversary of  Indian Rock Dam.                            ____________________
