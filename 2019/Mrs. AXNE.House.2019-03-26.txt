 Mr. Speaker, this past winter, Iowa and the Midwest  experienced record snowfall with freezing temperatures. The ground has  remained frozen, which kept the snow from melting into our soil. And  then the rapid warming over March 12 to March 14, along with heavy  rains, resulted in mass flooding and devastation across Iowa,  particularly in my district of southwest Iowa.   The flooding has resulted in hundreds of millions, if not billions,  of dollars in agricultural losses; destroyed homes, schools, small  businesses, medical centers; and has caused significant damage to  public infrastructure that is vital to these communities.   Entire small towns, such as Hamburg in Fremont County and Pacific  Junction, shown here, in Mills County, are under water and are facing  irreparable damage.   Communities are without sanitary water. The lasting effects on the  health and well-being of Iowa families is beyond calculation, and the  flooding is still ongoing. We have yet to have seen, probably, the  worst of it.   I am grateful that the President declared a disaster emergency  declaration to support efforts to guarantee public safety and rapid  recovery, but, given the impact of this flooding--and it was mainly in  smaller rural communities--the assistance needed to ensure these  communities can recover is dramatic, and I have requested the House  Appropriations Committee to fund additional disaster supplemental  support.                            ____________________
