 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  my good friends and community leaders who have been serving my hometown  of Shreveport for a remarkable 75 years.   The CPA firm of Heard, McElroy & Vestal has been an integral part of  our community since 1946. In fact, founding partner Charles McElroy  served as one of the first chairmen of the Louisiana Certified Public  Accountants.   From the very beginning, the firm has established itself as a pillar  of trust, integrity, and competence. Their firm is now one of the  largest public accounting groups in northwest Louisiana.   This firm and its over 100 employees have worked faithfully for the  people of Louisiana every day, and they have continued to be a  cornerstone for our region. We are blessed to have their mission of  accounting excellence and commitment to integrity as a part of our  community.   Thank you to my friends for serving so well for all of these years,  and happy 75th anniversary.  [[Page H1061]]                                ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  [[Page H1062]]  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, this evening we will have  Republican Members from across this country to address the multiple  crises that are facing our country, whether it is the economic crisis,  the crime crisis, the energy crisis, the border crisis, the foreign  policy crisis, or now the related issue of the staggering and ongoing  crisis of fentanyl, a scourge upon this country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield first to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Griffith) to address this issue.    Mr. Speaker, I could not have said it  better myself. I thank my friend for those comments.   Mr. Speaker, what Mr. Griffith is explaining there is the magnitude  of this crisis, and I have a number of colleagues here tonight who will  speak to it. Illegal drug overdoses recently became the leading cause  of death for Americans age 18-45; the leading cause of death. Today in  America illegal drug overdoses are killing more people at this age  demographic than car accidents, obviously, than cancer, more than  COVID. In my home State of Louisiana alone, opioid deaths increased in  2021 by 40 percent; 40 percent in one year; mostly driven by an  increase in illicit fentanyl.   What is fentanyl? Fentanyl is this synthetic opioid that is 80 to 100  times stronger than morphine. It is created with chemicals shipped from  China to Mexico. It is trafficked across our southern border. Its  potency means the smallest amount, even to fit on the tip of a pencil,  is considered a lethal dose, and now it is fueling one of the worst  drug epidemics in American history.   Mr. Speaker, the Biden administration's response has been nothing,  passivity. They have been passive about securing our border, the entry  point for all these drugs coming into our communities. They have been  passive about prosecuting drug offenders. Many Democrat-led  jurisdictions are lowering felony offenses to misdemeanors. They have  been passive about preventing drug abuse. The Democrats' American  Rescue Plan, so-called, even includes a provision, as you have already  heard tonight, and you will hear it more, to distribute drug  paraphernalia at taxpayers' expense. It is unbelievable.   Mr. Speaker, fentanyl deaths are certain to increase unless we act  with the same resolve that we have used to attack other less-deadly  threats. If the Biden administration were serious about addressing this  crisis, they would start by securing our turnstile at the southern  border. It is time for the Democrats in charge here to wake up.   To help address this problem, we have to take immediate steps. We  have to secure our border. We have to prosecute criminals again. We  have to work with localities to prevent drug abuse rather than  accommodate it.   Mr. Speaker, I have a number of colleagues, as I mentioned, who will  address this issue in further detail. I am delighted that they have  taken the time to be here. I am happy to yield to the gentleman from  Florida ( Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for that  compelling message. He is right, every State is a border State now,  whether you are on the coast or whether you  [[Page H1063]]  are up north or anywhere in the country, and Tennessee is no exception  to that.   I yield now to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Burchett), my good  friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend. It is a  serious issue. Every moment of levity helps us. I tell you what, if we  can't work in a bipartisan fashion to prosecute criminals and stop the  cartels, there may not be a lot of hope for this institution. I hope we  can get back to that soon.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko).  Arizona is a State that certainly deals with this every moment of every  day, and she has seen it up close.    Mr. Speaker, that passion is authentic. And  as we said, from Arizona you see it every day.   Mr. Speaker, I just received a text message from our colleague, Mr.  Katko, and he is the lead Republican on the Homeland Security  Committee, and he said make sure when we are talking about the cartels  to point out they are getting magnificently enriched through this alien  smuggling surge, and they are, therefore, flush with cash, and they are  now developing their own ability to make fentanyl. That is a dangerous  game changer for the country. This crisis gets worse and worse by the  hour.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Van Drew).    Mr. Speaker, strong words on a very  important set of issues.   I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  remarks.   The Border Patrol agents are as frustrated as we are. Demoralized is  exactly right. We have met with them and heard their stories. And the  reason they are so frustrated, Mr. Speaker, is because all of this  crisis is completely avoidable. These are the results of bad policy  choices, and that is what is so outrageous.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that  forceful message.   Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield next to a  gentleman who has been on the front lines of all this as a retired  police lieutenant. He is also a former professional hockey player, and  that is pretty cool, too. He is a tough guy, but he knows the issue.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Stauber).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend. I  appreciate his words and his expertise on the issue.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin), who I  think will address some of the other crises we are facing as well.    Mr. Speaker, that debt is so staggering.  And Dr. Babin is right, so many people don't stop to think about the  magnitude of it and what we are doing to our children, our  grandchildren, every future generation of Americans. We better get  control of it. Thank you for that insight tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter),  another gentleman with a lot of expertise, who will address some of the  crime crises that we are facing.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for his  insights there.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Rose).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend. I think  about the same thing, our children and what we are doing to them and  their future. They will have less security, less financial stability,  less opportunity. They won't have the great fortune that we have  because we are making bad policy decisions right now. We are adding to  the debt. We are compounding the problem day by day, and we just can't  get anyone here to pay any attention to it.   The Democrats in charge refuse to address the issue. In fact, they  just continue to double down on bad policy, and it is just so  frustrating.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Clyde) to  talk about this energy crisis more.    Mr. Speaker, as we have illustrated tonight  with so many Members coming in from all over the country to express our  concerns about all of these crises--and we genuinely could go for hours  upon hours. But the hour is getting late tonight, and our Special Order  hour is running out.   I just want to reiterate again some of the things we highlighted in  this last hour on the floor here in the people's House tonight.   We addressed this economic crisis. It is just staggering. A $30  trillion Federal debt is a number that previous generations of  Americans couldn't even have imagined.   We talked about the crime crisis and the utter lack of responsibility  that Democrats in charge have shown and that the White House has shown  to address this issue.   The border crisis and now the fentanyl crisis that is directly  related to that. It has become the number one killer of Americans aged  18 to 45 in this country.   The energy crisis--because I come from an energy state, the State of  Louisiana, I just want to conclude with a couple of remarks to put a  fine point on that latter issue before we close this evening.   Mr. Speaker, the problem here is that, as with all of these crises,  all this is totally avoidable. All of this is the result of policy  choices. It is bad decisions, bad policy by the White House and by the  Democrats in charge.   Mr. Speaker, on the energy crisis, President Biden's anti-energy  agenda has caused the price of a gallon of gas to skyrocket to $3.42  nationally. Last week, oil prices hit $90 a barrel. Mr. Speaker, $90 is  a 7-year high. In just the last month, oil prices have surged 37  percent. That is in 1 month, and it has been on a steady and rapid  increase.   Given this agenda and the rapid rise in prices, it is not surprising  that, according to a recent Gallup poll, American satisfaction with our  energy policies is the lowest in two decades. That is because Americans  have paid at the pump more now than they paid since the Obama-Biden  administration.   U.S. households will also pay between $700 and $1,700 more for heat  this winter, depending on where they live and what type of fuel they  use. More than one in four Americans report now that they skipped basic  expenses to pay their energy bill in the past year. One in five  Americans report they could not pay their full energy bill. This is a  crisis.   Let me just tell you, and break it down in layman's terms, why this  is happening.   From the very beginning of the Biden administration, the first couple  of weeks, as soon as he took office, he issued that slew of executive  orders, a record number of executive orders. Among those early  executive orders were his directions on energy policy.   He reflexively did exactly the opposite of what President Trump had  done and accomplished. We were energy dominant, not just energy  independent. We were energy dominant because of the Trump-era policies.   What does President Biden do? He does exactly the opposite,  reflexively almost. President Trump moved us to domestic oil and gas  production to increase that to make us energy dominant, to make us a  net exporter. What does President Biden do? The opposite.   He shuts down and puts a moratorium on drilling and exploration on  Federal lands, including offshore, off the coast of States like mine,  Louisiana. That was a killer for the national economy. It is a direct  contributor to driving the costs up.   He also killed the Keystone pipeline, of course. That was a big  source, an artery, as it were, for domestic production and supply in  our country. Here is the great irony. Ostensibly, the reason  [[Page H1067]]  for doing all those things is he wanted to help the environment, I  guess. I guess he owed it to some interest groups or something. They  claim that that would be better for the environment if we moved away  from fossil fuels, as we always hear.   But here is the great irony--and I will close with this. When  President Biden shut down domestic production, not only did he drive up  the cost of all the fuel that we need to heat our homes and to fill up  our gas tanks and all the rest, not only did he increase the pain on  American consumers, but here is the irony. When they shut down domestic  production, the demand for fossil fuels, oil and gas, in this country  didn't go down. The demand didn't change nationally just because the  President decided he didn't want to supply it anymore. In fact, the  demand is at least stabilized and, in some cases, has gone up.   So, what does that mean? Well, Americans have to get their supply  from somewhere else. If we are not going to produce it here, the  bountiful resources that God has given us beneath our own feet, if we  are not going to do it here, we have to get it from somewhere else.   The Biden administration turns to OPEC. They turn to Russia, Saudi  Arabia, begging for more production and begging for our supply to be  met from these overseas parties.   Do you know what the greatest irony about all of this is? Ostensibly,  they wanted to help the environment, but do you know what they do when  we get more of our oil and gas from Russia and Saudi Arabia? We do  exponentially more harm to the environment.   If you believe their metrics, this is a terrible policy solution  because--guess what?--we produce oil and gas in a much cleaner fashion  in the United States than they do in those other countries.   So, the great irony is not only do they drive up costs for American  consumers, not only do they increase the pain for everybody; they are  actually doing more harm to the world that they claim they want to  help.   It is truly unbelievable, not to mention it has destabilized us and  put Russia in a better position. Now, we see the results of that on a  whole different crisis that we didn't even have time to address  tonight.    Mr. Speaker, I am out of time. I would just close by saying that the  American people cannot tolerate this for much longer, and they won't  tolerate it for much longer. We cannot wait for this election cycle  that comes up later this year when we get an opportunity to be returned  to the majority to govern this place again and bring some sanity back  to Washington.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
