 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate  Pride Month in San Diego and honor our progress.   In 1974, a group of LGBTQ San Diegans were denied a permit to host a  pride parade. Despite facing great danger, dozens bravely marched in  the streets. So this weekend, over 200,000 San Diegans are expected to  join together to celebrate how far we have come and spread the message  of equality.   Though we have made great progress, this month also marks the 1-year  anniversary of a lawsuit that was actually  [[Page H6052]]  filed against me for displaying a pride flag in front of my office.  This frivolous lawsuit is a great reminder of why Pride Month is still  necessary and why our work is never done.   The pride flag symbolizes the ideals of liberty, equality, and love  that this month celebrates. No lawsuit will deter me from defending  these values.   I am proud to be an ally in this fight and will continue to stand  shoulder to shoulder with our LGBTQ community.   Happy pride, San Diego.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Correa for  this Special Order.   Mr. Speaker, the Trump administration has just missed their court  deadline for reuniting the youngest children separated from their  parents, and there seems to be no solution in sight for these innocent  children.   Over 20 days ago, even before the court order, I led my colleagues in  writing a letter to Homeland Security and Health and Human Services  asking what their plans were for reuniting separated children with  their families.                                time  1815    I have yet to get an answer. The American people deserve to know  where the children are and how they will be safely returned to their  families.   In a world where we can track nearly everything in real time, how is  a Federal agency unable to provide answers to Congress on the  whereabouts of kids in their care?   We are told that agencies did not coordinate their efforts. Did they  not plan for this? Do they not understand the concept of  interoperability that we have come to use within our administrations?   This administration's cruel policies are overwhelming our already  burdened judicial and foster care systems, and the American people are  stuck paying the price. It is time for this administration to realize  that policy decisions have consequences.   Even the few children who have been reunited with their families will  carry the scars of this appalling experience throughout their lives. We  have already heard reports that some of the youngest do not recognize  their parents as they are reunited. That is understandable. In fact, it  is even anticipated. Families, as we are seeing, are traumatized. They  are scared. They are heartbroken, as anybody would be in their shoes.   Mr. Speaker, I once again call on this administration to answer  critical questions about the whereabouts of the children and reunite  them with their families immediately.
