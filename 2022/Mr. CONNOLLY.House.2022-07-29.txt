 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time.   We face two choices today in this body. One is to protect our  children, to protect our houses of worship, to protect where we shop,  to protect where we watch a movie from guns that exist for one purpose  only--mass death inflicted efficiently.   Or we can listen to the other argument, which you have heard, in  thrall to the gun manufacturers, to protect them at any cost, and you  as a citizen are collateral damage at the altar of the gun  manufacturers, and we will be bathed in blood forever.   It is time to act. It is time to end the madness and disenthrall  ourselves from automatic weapons that are mass killers.
