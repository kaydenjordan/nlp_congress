 Madam President, I am here for the 14th time to keep  unmasking the scheme to control our Supreme Court--a scheme that is now  poised to destroy a woman's right to make her own reproductive health  choices and to smash foundational Supreme Court precedent to get there.   Last week, Politico confirmed a fear that many of us have had for  years. We now see that the Supreme Court has at least five votes to  eradicate Roe v. Wade, one of the most important decisions in the  Court's history. For nearly half a century, women in this country have  relied on Roe's recognition that our constitutional right to privacy  includes the right to decide when to have a child. This is one of the  most profoundly personal and life-changing decisions anyone can make.  Now, the draft opinion from Justice Alito shows in black and white how  the Court plans to steamroll over that right--and afterward probably  many others that are anchored in that same American right to privacy.   If Justice Alito's draft opinion becomes law, women in this country  will have a well-established constitutional right stripped away. That  has not happened before.   Already 13 States have trigger bans that will snap into place the  moment Roe is overturned, and 13 more are expected to ban or severely  restrict abortions in the future. And it won't stop there. For example,  Louisiana's Republican lawmakers just advanced a bill that would  criminalize abortion as homicide and allow prosecutors to charge women  seeking abortions as criminals.   In the week since the news broke, a lot of Americans have expressed  just how strongly they disagree with the path this Court is headed  down. They are disappointed, stunned, outraged, and they are right.  When you take a second to remember what these same Justices told us in  the past about Roe, you can be doubly outraged. I know Democrats on the  Senate Judiciary Committee are. We saw the last three Republican  Justices come through that committee and look us in the eye as we asked  what they thought about Roe. Let's be clear: Each of these Republican  Justices came before the committee; each was specifically asked about  Roe v. Wade.   Here is what they told us:   Neil Gorsuch:         Roe v. Wade, decided in 1973, is a precedent of the United       States Supreme Court. It has been reaffirmed.    Brett Kavanaugh:         It is settled as a precedent of the Supreme Court, entitled       to respect under principles of stare decisis.    Amy Coney Barrett:         Roe is not a super-precedent because calls for its       overruling have never ceased. But that doesn't mean that Roe       should be overruled. It just means that it doesn't fall       within a small handful of cases like Marbury v. Madison and       Brown v. Board that no one questions anymore.    Add in Alito himself:         Roe v. Wade is an important precedent of the Supreme Court.    Yet here is what Alito's draft opinion says:         Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was       exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging       consequences.    Well, there was no mention of ``egregiously'' at the confirmation  hearings. There was no mention of ``wrong from the start'' when we  asked about Roe. Does anyone seriously think that this was a sudden,  new epiphany that came over the Federalist Society Justices in the last  few weeks? None--none--managed to mention their belief that Roe v. Wade  was ``egregiously wrong from the start.'' Whether that was outright  lying or confirmation hearing hide-the-ball tricks, it is dishonorable,  and it was dishonest.   If that is what you believe as a judge, own it. Don't keep your views  secret until you have the votes to make your move. That may be clever  politics, but it is politics, not judging. It is a big tell about this  captured Court.   Since the news broke, Republicans have tried desperately to change  the subject. The minority leader says:         The real outrage is not the obliteration of women's rights       but that we found out about it a month early.    He says:         This lawless action should be investigated and punished as       quickly as possible.    Other Republicans called for the FBI to prosecute the leaker  criminally or civilly. Some even purport to identify the leaker.   Chief Justice Roberts called the leak ``a singular and egregious  breach of . . . trust'' and an ``affront to the community of public  servants who work here.''   Look, as to the leak, Mr. Chief Justice, go for it. Investigate away.  Send the Marshals. But to my Republican colleagues, sharpening their  pitchforks and calling for criminal prosecution: Spare me the high  dudgeon. Spare me the faux outrage. As former White House Ethics  Counsel Walter Shaub explains, ``[T]he Supreme Court has no code of  ethics--which is the place you would normally put a ban on misusing  nonpublic information. [So] what crime would [the] FBI . . .  investigate?''   As for the ``affront'' to the institution, I suggest everyone  consider the real rot at the core of the Supreme Court.   If you care about the independence and integrity of the Court, it is  not this leak you should be outraged about; it is that for the first  time in the history of the U.S. Supreme Court, the selection of Supreme  Court Justices was farmed out, handed off to a private organization,  and Justices were selected in some backroom with zero transparency into  how the selections were made, how the lists were assembled, and zero  transparency into the dark money that flowed into that private  organization while the selections were being made. Who paid what to  have a seat at the Federalist Society's judicial selection turnstile?   We know from new reporting that it was the Federalist Society's  Leonard Leo who ``laid out [the] road map for Trump on the Federal  court system'' with the goal of ``transforming the foundational  understanding of rights in America.''   So much for balls and strikes, huh?   Leo came up with the list of ``judges that would please the  Republican base'' from among what he called the ``decades of  conservative lawyers in the pipeline.'' He became a ``team'' with Don  McGahn, Trump's White House Counsel, and Mitch McConnell to ``keep the  judicial nominations effort moving.'' It was Leo who took to the White  House where he had ``extensive access,'' to the revised nominees list  that included Kavanaugh and Barrett. The picks were made by advisers,  said Senator McConnell, with Trump's role  [[Page S2413]]  merely ``signing off on them,'' and he ``never veered from the lists of  candidates suggested by Leo and others.''   Again, this was not about calling ``balls and strikes.''   If you want ``to have the longest possible impact on the kind of  America you want,'' said Leader McConnell, ``you look at the courts.''  That is their goal, to change the kind of America we have--more  accurately, the kind of America the far-right megadonors want, I would  say.    Trump noticed. ``Mitch McConnell. Judges. Judges. Judges. The only  thing he wants is judges,'' said Trump.   We know this happened because the Trump White House, right up to  Trump himself, said so. Trump's own White House Counsel joked that he  ``in-sourced'' the Federalist Society into the selection process. As  one prominent conservative explained, this was an ``enterprise''--an  ``enterprise of building a Supreme Court that will overturn Roe v.  Wade.''   Once the anonymous donors behind the Federalist Society Justice- picking operation got the nominees they wanted, then came the dark  money front groups rolling out ad campaigns to help ram those Justices  through the Senate. Anonymous donations of $15 million, $17 million,  $19 million went to phony front groups like the so-called ``Judicial  Crisis Network'' to promote those backroom-chosen Federalist Society  nominees.   Then, once the Federalist Society Justices were stacked onto the  Court, flotillas of dark money front groups appeared before them, both  as litigants and as amici curiae, orchestrated by the dozens in little  groups to signal the Republican Justices how to rule. And it is pretty  likely that the same donor network was behind the nomination turnstile,  the propaganda machine, and the flotillas. And by the way, they are  winning--winning--with these handpicked Justices at an astonishing  rate--80 to 0 by one count.   We see the results of the scheme in this very case. The sponsors of  the Mississippi abortion law admitted that they passed the law because  they thought the new Supreme Court Justices would uphold it, just like  a new legislative body had come in. After Amy Coney Barrett's  nomination was rushed through the Senate, the State of Mississippi even  changed its position to ask the Supreme Court to overrule Roe in its  entirety. It all smells of ``fixery.'' No wonder Justice Sotomayor  asked during oral argument whether the Court will ``survive the stench  that this creates in the public perception that the Constitution and  its reading are just political acts?''   So, if colleagues want to talk about demolition of the integrity and  independence of the Court, then they better have something to say about  turning the Supreme Court over to dark money special interests, about  special interests capturing the Court to serve their rightwing  ``enterprise.'' A captured Court, that is delivering for the special  interests that stacked it and helping to keep their secrets has had its  integrity and independence pretty well demolished already.   The last gasp of the scoundrels is to pretend that it is Democrats  calling out this dark money mess who are the ones undermining the  integrity of the Court. They even point to a brief of mine where  several colleagues and I quoted to the Court a poll showing that a  majority of Americans feel the Court is ``mainly motivated by  politics'' and that it ought to be ``restructured in order to reduce  the influence of politics.''   That is a poll, not a threat.   And the Court better start paying attention to why the American  people feel that way, rather than quarreling that anyone that is  ``threatening'' or ``bullying'' the Court by pointing that out.   By the way, if threatening is what you want to fuss about, have the  decency to be consistent. Here is a quote from FOX News' host Laura  Ingraham discussing this actual abortion case after the oral arguments  were done.   Forgive my bad language to the pages who are here. I am actually  quoting her verbatim.         We have six Republican appointees on this Court after all       the money that has been raised, the Federalist Society, all       these big ``fat cat'' dinners. I'm sorry. I'm pissed about       this. If this Court with six Justices cannot do the right       thing here, the constitutional thing, then I think it's time       to do what Robert Bork said we should do, which is to       circumscribe the jurisdiction of this Court, and if they want       to blow it up, then that's the way to change things finally.    Far from pushing back on that threat to ``blow it up'' and ``change  things finally,'' the Senate colleague she was talking to said:         . . . in a heartbeat.    When you are treating an accurate quotation of a poll as a threat and  ignoring a public threat to blow up the Court and change things  finally--after all the ``fat cat'' money spent on the Federalist  Society, no less--forgive me for doubting your sincerity.   As Senator Padilla said in the Judiciary Committee last week, have  the decency to be consistent at least.   Justice Alito spent over 98 pages trying and failing to justify  overturning the decision protecting these rights--overturning a  decision he told the U.S. Senate was an ``important precedent of the  Supreme Court.''   His opinion isn't persuasive to me at all as it reads as snide and  cruel, but that is not going to stop these Justices from trying to  throw us back into an age where women aren't free to make their own  choices about their own bodies and their own futures. It looks like the  fix went in on that a while ago, and we just weren't told about it in  the hearings.   So, tomorrow, the majority leader will bring before this Chamber  legislation to protect those rights nationwide, to protect that freedom  across this country, and I am eager to vote for it. We have got to  stand against this assault on women's constitutional rights, and I hope  some Republican colleagues will join us.   Particularly, I hope, in the weeks and months ahead, that we can find  ways to unravel the dark money scheme that has brought this Court and  our country closer to the brink because the Court that dark money  built--it is not done. It is not done trying to reshape America against  our will to suit the extreme ideology of the rightwing billionaires  behind the scheme.   There is one good thing in all this darkness, and that is that the  American people see this nonsense and have had enough.   I yield the floor.
