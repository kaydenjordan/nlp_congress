 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman, the ranking  member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Mrs. McMorris Rodgers, for  leading on this issue.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this radical movement  by our colleagues on the left to go way further than Roe, under the  guise of codifying Roe, to push some of the most extreme packages of  pro-abortion legislation that we have seen.   Where would this push us if they got their way? Under this package of  bills that the House is taking up today, the United States would end up  among just a handful of countries, including China and North Korea, in  radical abortion on demand up until birth policy.   Now, there has been a lot of misinformation presented since the  Supreme Court made their decision, a decision that I applaud because,  Madam Speaker, it is a decision that finally said Roe was a flawed  decision and that, in fact, elected leaders should be the ones debating  this.   How much can we debate how to protect life? States have been having  this debate. Roe didn't end the debate. It started a movement, a  movement for almost 50 years. The March for Life. You see young people,  tens and hundreds of thousands, coming up to Washington, just praying  and marching for the opportunity to protect life. Now, those States and  Congress can have that debate about how much more we can do to protect  life.   In fact, we brought an amendment because whether it was before the  Dobbs decision or even today, a State like New York has such a radical  law that a baby can be born alive outside the womb, and they can murder  that baby and call it abortion. That is still legal today in States  like New York. It should not be. It is murder. If a baby is born alive  outside the womb, how in America can that baby be murdered under the  guise of abortion? Yet, that is what is allowed.   We had the motion to recommit we brought forward--we will have a vote  on that shortly--to say that barbaric act can no longer happen again in  America, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. Everybody  should vote for that. People pro-choice have said they think it is  radical that a baby can be born alive outside the womb and still be  murdered under the name of abortion.   We will have the opportunity to right that wrong today on the House  floor. I hope everybody votes for it. Unfortunately, so far, we haven't  gotten any support from my Democratic colleagues.   I will end with this, Madam Speaker: Our Founding Fathers empowered  us with three unalienable rights, life, liberty, and the pursuit of  happiness. The first among those is life. Let's do all we can to  protect life, not have this radical, extreme agenda pushed forward  today.    Madam Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring to  the House majority whip the schedule for next week.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.  Clyburn), the majority whip of the House.    Madam Speaker, I know this is a conversation I have had  for months with the majority leader as we have talked about the concern  over high gas prices, and I notice that, on the agenda that was listed,  there are no bills that would deal with the high price of gasoline that  families are struggling under due to President Biden's many different  actions he has taken to shut down American energy.   Of course, as we know, the President today is in Saudi Arabia,  begging the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to produce more oil, when we have  been asking the President to work with us to open up American energy,  which is abundant, available, but, unfortunately, closed for business.   Of course, we know during the campaign, President Biden bragged that  he was going to shut down drilling, that he was going to make it hard  for the energy companies to produce in America, and he has done that.  The problem is it has had devastating impacts on families.   So, we brought forward a number of bills, again, months ago. I have  presented some of these to the majority leader. He said he would look  at them and consider bringing some of them up. I want to present a few  of these to the gentleman from South Carolina to see if we can get  consideration of some of these bills next week at a time when we just  saw a report with 9.1 percent inflation, the worst numbers in 40 years,  in large part driven by the high price of gasoline.                                time  1400    We have bills to alleviate that problem that families are facing.   I will start with H.R. 7285, by Mr. Carl. This is the Unleashing  American Energy Act that requires the Secretary of the Interior to  conduct a minimum number of oil and gas lease sales so that we can get  back to producing more energy here.   H.R. 7292, by Garret Graves, the Securing American Energy and  Investing in Resiliency Act: This requires the Secretary of the  Interior to conduct all oil and gas lease sales that, under current  law, he is supposed to be doing. The President is not in compliance  with existing law on that.   H.R. 7293, the Energy Permitting Certainty Act, by Ms. Herrell: This  requires the Secretary of the Interior to process applications for a  permit to drill. It doesn't tell the Secretary what determination they  have to give, but it gives them a shot clock, just like they give to  businesses. When they tell a business that they have to give an answer  on something, it is by a certain date. Yet, when the applications are  submitted, the agency just ignores it, just doesn't do their job. Let's  get an  [[Page H6665]]  answer, yes or no. Let's get an answer and back it up with facts. That  is what this bill requires.   H.R. 7298, the Promoting Energy Independence and Transparency Act, by  Mr. Moore from Utah: This requires the Secretary of the Interior to  submit a report on expressions of interest in applications of permits  to drill and requires the publication of data on expressions of  interest in applications of permits to drill.   H.R. 7304, the Restore Onshore Energy Production Act, by Mr.  Rosendale: This requires the Secretary of the Interior to immediately  resume onshore oil and gas lease sales. Let us have an opportunity to  utilize our natural resources to lower the price of gas.   H.R. 751, the Protecting American Energy Production Act, by Mr.  Duncan: This prohibits any declaration of a moratorium on the use of  hydraulic fracturing, which, again, has been a threat by this  administration on a very efficient, clean source of energy that America  could produce but, right now, is being dramatically limited.   Finally, H.R. 1616, the Promoting Interagency Coordination for Review  of Natural Gas Pipelines Act, by Mr. Burgess: This provides for Federal  and State agency coordination in the approval of certain authorizations  under the Natural Gas Act for the critical infrastructure of pipelines  to move energy throughout America so we don't have to get it from  tankers, from foreign countries, many of them hostile to America.   I would be happy to yield to see if we could get some consideration  next week of some of those bills, if not all.    Madam Speaker, if the gentleman is interested in  inflicting pain on Putin, then pass these bills. These bills will take  away all of Putin's leverage. The only reason Vladimir Putin has any  leverage over America and Europe is because President Biden shut down  American energy.   Again, each of these bills addresses different components of  President Biden's attack on American energy. It has been a very direct  assault on American energy on many different fronts. These lay out all  of those things.   You can have all the leases in the world, but if the administration  won't give permits to actually execute the lease to do seismic, to  build pipelines so you can actually move the resource, to drill in new  areas while the resource is being depleted in other areas, then you  don't have an ability to secure America's future. It results in the  President going hat in hand to foreign countries like Saudi Arabia.   I would just point out that I know the President likes talking about  carbon emissions a lot. It is a 5,700-mile trek to Saudi Arabia, and I  would imagine he is going to come back home. That is more than 11,000  miles on Air Force One. If you notice the picture, there are no solar  panels on the wings of Air Force One. It is jet fuel that actually gets  it from here to there and back with the President and his staff. You  could save all 11,000 miles and the entire carbon footprint of that  trip by staying here in America. I recommend going to a place like Port  Fourchon in south Louisiana where they produce energy cleaner, cheaper,  and with American jobs.    By the way, as States drill, they get revenue sharing. They would  actually be able to use that investment to lower prices at the pump and  to help American families.   If you think about where the price is today, whether it is $5.20 or  $4.80--of course, it continues to go back and forth in a very high  range--it is all double, more than double, what it was 2 years ago.   What that means is that people who are filling up are looking at the  bottom line. They are looking at the fact that it is costing them over  $150 to fill their car today when it cost them maybe $70 2 years ago if  they can afford to fill it up all the way.   We are seeing a trend right now where many families can't even get it  to full. They might have to go only halfway because they can't afford  the full price. Their credit cards get maxed out before then because if  they are filling up to go to the grocery store, they are also paying  double-digit increases for everything they are buying there because of  the spending-induced inflation.   I suggest if we want to send a message to Putin, no better way to do  it than to cut him off at the knees in his ability to hold leverage  over America and Europe by producing more here in America.   If we produce it in America, cartels can't control the price. Putin  can't control the price. We can meet all of our needs and help our  allies around the world so that Putin has no leverage over anybody.   The only person giving Putin leverage today is President Biden by  allowing all these limitations on American energy production that these  bills will remove. These bills will help America get back to energy  independence by unleashing all of those different leverages, those  different inhibitions, the prohibitions that President Biden has put on  our energy.   Again, if he was against all fossil fuels, maybe there would be a  consistency in policy, but he is only against American fossil fuels. He  will travel 5,700 miles to beg Saudi to produce oil that he won't allow  our own producers here in America to produce. I think that is what has  Americans irate the most.   I yield to the gentleman.    I appreciate that. Hopefully, as I continue to have  these conversations with the leader, maybe you and I could be whipping  these bills together. You would see an overwhelming result and a quick  reduction  [[Page H6666]]  in the price at the pump that is hurting families.   One final question I want to raise to the gentleman, and this came up  yesterday or 2 days ago as we were having a series of votes on the  National Defense Authorization Act, as the gentleman pointed out. Next  week, we will be bringing up some of the appropriations bills, with  still more to come over the next few weeks. As we have large numbers of  amendments on NDAA and appropriations, which is typical for the  process, to be able to go back to 2-minute voting where we can do our  business not in 4 hours until 11 at night, but where we can actually be  more efficient at processing all the requests that Members have to get  a vote on different issues.   We have continued to push to end proxy voting. Again, you have seen  most of the country already get there. Most of the country is getting  back to work.   Airplanes, finally, you don't have to wear masks anymore. People are  traveling internationally again. People are opening up their offices  again to get workers in the office.   Congress, frankly, should be leading, not lagging, on this. But if we  got rid of proxy voting, we could get back next week to 2-minute votes  and be much more effective and efficient in doing our jobs here in  Congress.   Is that something that the majority would consider, especially  looking at six different appropriations bills, which I am sure will  yield hundreds of amendments that would be debated and voted on, on  this floor?    I yield to the gentleman.    I appreciate that. I will share--and if the gentleman  wanted to share as well with the majority leader--our side stands ready  and strongly encourages the complete elimination of proxy voting. We  could absolutely get back to 2-minute voting with that. It is not a  partisan issue.   You can look across the Capitol, in the United States Senate they  have never utilized proxy voting. They continue to do their work. It  is, of course, controlled by Democrats over there. They represent the  same States that we represent. They managed to do their business  without proxy voting so that everybody has to show up to do their job.   This time is no different than any other time in our Nation's  history. There are some people who get ill; there are some people who  have surgeries; there are some people who just have other things maybe  with their family that takes them away. That is something that we all  accommodate, we all recognize as a condition of doing a job that  actually requires interaction with other people. The Senate has managed  to do it without proxy voting; we would just urge that the House  embrace that same approach. We will continue to push for that, which  would allow us to do things like 2-minute voting.   Unless the gentleman has anything else, I am prepared to yield back.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
