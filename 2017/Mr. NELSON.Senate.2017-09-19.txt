 Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for  today's vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the nomination of  William Emanuel to be a Member of the National Labor Relations Board. I  would have voted nay.    (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________
