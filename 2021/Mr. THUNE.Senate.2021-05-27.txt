 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, from the beginning, the story of the U.S.  auto industry has been one of ingenuity, of taking risks, and of  pushing forward.   At the dawn of the 20th century, most Americans could hardly  comprehend the idea of the automobile. Yet, 20 years later, they had  become nearly ubiquitous in American life, thanks to the insistence of  entrepreneurs like Henry Ford on making the automobile affordable for  the majority of Americans.   The democratization of the automobile, rather than the invention of  the automobile itself, is, in my opinion, one of most remarkable and  uniquely American success stories.   Automobiles allowed Americans to capitalize on the economic dynamism  of the roaring twenties and helped Americans move and adapt during the  Great Depression.   They contributed greatly to the American industrial base and the  know-how needed to fight and win the Second World War and help propel  the United States to its current status as a preeminent global economic  and military power.   Visionary investments like the Interstate Highway System made cars a  staple in American economic and cultural life. And cars certainly made  it a lot easier to get to and from rural America. In a place like rural  South Dakota, with limited public transportation, the automobile, often  a pickup or an SUV, is typically the only way to get around.   Today, the automobile industry stands on the brink of a new  technological revolution, which promises to dramatically transform  mobility once again.   Over the past three decades, the internet has transformed our economy  and our way of life, and the next generation of the internet, 5G, which  is currently being deployed across the Nation, will enable a host of  new innovations, including a revolution in vehicle technology:  automated vehicles or what we call AVs.   AVs will change the way that we move in numerous ways, making the  transportation system safer, more efficient, and more accessible.   Individuals whose mobility is currently limited, for example,  Americans with disabilities, could gain new independence with the  deployment of automated vehicles, allowing them to work or visit  friends and family safely and easily.   I am proud that my proposed AV amendment to the Endless Frontier Act  was recently endorsed by the National Federation of the Blind, and I  ask for unanimous consent that the letter of endorsement be inserted in  the Record   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                               National Federation of the Blind,                                                       May 11, 2021.      Hon. Maria Cantwell,      Chair, U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, &           Transportation, Washington, DC.      Hon. Roger Wicker,      Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, &           Transportation, Washington, DC.        Dear Chair Cantwell and Ranking Member Wicker: The National       Federation of the Blind, the nation's transformative civil       rights organization of the blind, supports and endorses the       amendment to the Endless Frontier Act filed with the       committee by Senator Thune on May 10, 2021. Specifically, we       support the portions of the amendment that will create an       exemption classification for manufacturers who provide       transportation access for people with disabilities and       prohibit discriminatory licensing practices for highly       automated vehicles.        Subsection (d)(2)(C) of the amendment would create an       exemption category under the federal motor vehicle safety       standards located in Section 30113 of title 49 United States       Code that would ``provide transportation access for       individuals with disabilities, including non-visual access       for individuals who are blind or visually impaired.'' This       addition to the law will provide the incentive needed for       automobile manufacturers to ensure that the unique       requirements for Americans with disabilities to be able to       operate automated vehicles are considered in the early stages       of development.        Subsection (e)(3) of the amendment would mandate that a       state ``may not issue a motor vehicle operator's license for       the operation or use of a highly automated vehicle in a       manner that discriminates on the basis of disability.'' This       will ensure that current requirements necessary to obtain a       driver's license, like a vision test, will not be required in       order to operate or use a highly automated vehicle. We are       pleased to see this subsection included in the amendment       because highly automated vehicles will pilot themselves (SAE       Level 4 and Level 5), making a vision requirement arbitrary       and discriminatory.        Highly automated vehicles have the potential to       revolutionize the transportation landscape, especially for       individuals with disabilities. However, those same       individuals with disabilities who stand to gain the most from       the creation and proliferation of highly automated vehicles       could be left out of this new frontier if specific actions       are not taken. Senator Thune's amendment to the Endless       Frontier Act is an important step to ensure that America's       journey toward automotive automation is fully inclusive of       those who will benefit most.            Sincerely,                                              Mark A. Riccobono,                                                          President.     Madam President, imagine a farmer in rural South Dakota  who can no longer drive to get to town for appointments, prescriptions,  or groceries--enter the automated vehicle.   This technology has potential to keep people in their homes and  communities longer.   Moreover, AVs have potential to greatly increase roadway safety.  Currently, there are an average of more than 35,000 traffic fatalities  on our Nation's roadways each year, including pedestrian, motorcycle,  and bicycle fatalities. Automated vehicles could dramatically-- dramatically--reduce that number. Distracted driving, driving while  impaired--automated vehicles could eliminate those dangers.    For automated vehicle technology to advance, it is imperative that  the regulatory framework catch up with private-sector innovation. That  is why I have pushed for the enactment of AV legislation over the years  and why I had hoped--I had hoped--that we would be voting to add my  automated vehicles amendment to the legislation before the Senate  today.   I have spent nearly 5 years--5 years--working in a bipartisan manner  on a legislative framework to govern the testing and deployment of  automated vehicles. The amendment I offered to the bill before us today  is an amendment that I had hoped to be able to offer with bipartisan  support. It would have paved the way for expanded testing and  deployment of automated vehicles in the United States under the  oversight of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.   And let me emphasize that oversight point. My amendment would ensure  that automated vehicles would not--not--touch pavement without the  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's certification that  they are at least as safe as a conventional vehicle. The data gathered  from the vehicles deployed as a result of this amendment would be  crucial to the development of future motor vehicle safety standards for  AVs.   Unfortunately, bipartisan agreement on my amendment collapsed when  special interests expressed their opposition, despite major efforts to  accommodate their concerns. And I am deeply disappointed that, once  again, Democrats yielded to pressure from special interests against the  best interests of our economy and the American people.   Advancing AV technology is not just a vehicle safety issue. It is  also an issue of U.S. leadership and global competitiveness. Investing  in the production of AV technology here in the United States would not  only strengthen the resilience of the auto industry but also the  Nation's industrial base and our national security.   The auto industry touches nearly every American State. For example,  Horton in Britton, SD, manufactures engine cooling systems, providing  steady, good paying jobs for that community and strengthening the local  economy. The same story repeats itself countless times in communities  all across the Nation.   Providing millions of jobs and investing billions annually, the  American auto industry is a critical component of the nation's economy.  Right now,  [[Page S3551]]  U.S. companies lead the world in AV technology, but other nations, like  China, are seizing upon regulatory inaction and striving to take the  lead. If we don't move forward with automated vehicle technology, we  will soon see some other nation leading the AV revolution.   The legislative package before us today is designed to bolster the  global competitiveness of the United States.   It is pretty difficult to understand why this reasonable and, I might  add, no cost AV amendment that would lead to untold benefits for our  Nation's transportation system, does not fit in. How can a bill making  strong investments in artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and  advanced manufacturing exclude a legislative framework for AVs?   Are we really going to back down from leading the world in automated  innovation and technology and cede the future of this industry to  nations like China? Will we really ignore the enormous--enormous-- safety benefits of these vehicles just to suit Democrats' political  convenience?   More than a century ago, when the automobile was invented, there were  plenty of skeptics, but America's automobile pioneers did not let that  stop them. They seized the moment and pressed forward and ushered in a  transportation revolution. We can do that again today or we can cede  this moment to nations like China and let the American automobile  industry fall permanently behind. That is the choice in front of us. I  hope we will choose to seize this moment and pass the legislation we  need to usher in another American transportation revolution.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
