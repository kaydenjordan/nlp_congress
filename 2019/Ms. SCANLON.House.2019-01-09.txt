 Mr. Speaker, it is time for this administration to  choose people over politics.   As we are talking about the shutdown, the stories of real people are  getting lost in the mess created by this administration. I want to  share the serious impact of the shutdown on my constituents and  Americans around the country.   These stories come from hardworking families, like newlyweds in my  district who just had a premature baby. They spent 3 weeks in the NICU  and are just now getting back home. They told me: ``We have so many  bills and a mortgage, and the shutdown happened just as we are sending  in our first mortgage payment. Our baby requires special formula  because he was not able to breastfeed. My husband has been asked to  work overtime and is not getting paid. We are scared about how we are  going to get by.''   This is a national crisis, one our President has created, and we have  a responsibility to fix it.   I call on the White House, my colleagues across the aisle, and their  colleagues in the Senate to stop holding our government hostage and  allow the government to reopen as we debate effective and humane border  security.    Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  rules package before us. This package includes, among other things, a  critical provision defending the affordable healthcare of Americans.   I came to Congress with a resounding message from my constituents to  protect and expand affordable, quality healthcare. Parents should not  have to choose between paying rent or healthcare for their children.  Students should not have to choose between paying for school or health  insurance. Children should not have to spend sleepless nights worried  about paying for aging parents' healthcare.                                time  1545    It is unacceptable that American families are one healthcare  emergency away from financial ruin.   This administration is once again undermining the Affordable Care Act  and ignoring a clear message from the American people. Quality  healthcare is a right and should not be the privilege of the few who  can afford it.   I will continue using my voice in Congress to advocate for those who  need us most, pushing this body to protect the healthcare of my  constituents.
