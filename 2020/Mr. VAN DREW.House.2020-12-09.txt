 Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize Bucket Brigade  Brewing in Cape May Courthouse in south Jersey.   They actually were founded by two identical twin brothers, Kurt and  Karl Hughes. The brothers are also firefighters from Cape May County.   The Hughes family has a long, storied history in this great Nation,  even having a relative who signed the Declaration of Independence. His  name was Thomas McKean.   The Bucket Brigade taproom was inspired by the rich history of Cape  May County's small businesses. I was lucky enough to swing by and visit  with them recently.   I want to thank them for their commitment to south Jersey and to  first responders and partnering with the National Fallen Firefighters  Association to assist those who are in real need.   Mr. Speaker, if you happen to be in the area, make sure to grab a  nice cold beer.   I thank Kurt and Karl for all they do for their community.   God bless you, and God bless America.                            ____________________
