 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the  Arkansas Business Hall of Fame Class of 2019 and their contributions to  industry, our State and beyond.   Clairborne P. Deming, Joe M. Steele, Warren A. Stephens and John W.  Tyson are icons and trailblazers. They shaped my home State of Arkansas  and their business fields and industries where their influence  continues to be felt today.   The Sam M. Walton College of Business at the University of Arkansas  established the Arkansas Business Hall of Fame to recognize Arkansans-- by birth or by choice--who have been influential business leaders and  ensure their reputations and achievements are enshrined for future  generations. Currently, there are more than 80 Arkansans who have been  inducted.   This year's inductees are certainly worthy of joining the ranks of  those who have the distinction of being named to the Arkansas Business  Hall of Fame.   Claiborne P. Deming, the former president and CEO and current  chairman of Murphy Oil, started his career with the El Dorado-based oil  company as a staff attorney after graduating from Tulane Law School in  1979. He served as executive vice president and chief operating officer  at Murphy Oil before becoming the president and chief executive officer  in 1994.   During Deming's tenure as CEO the company expanded internationally,  tripled its production and oil and gas reserves and started an  important business relationship with Walmart, whereby Murphy built and  operated gasoline stations and convenience stores in Walmart  Supercenter parking lots. However, Deming's legacy extends beyond  business.   In 2007, he worked with the company's board of directors on a $50  million proposal to create an educational scholarship for students  graduating from El Dorado High School. The program, called the El  Dorado Promise, awards all graduates a scholarship equal to instate  tuition and mandatory fees for bachelor or associate college degrees.  The Promise scholarship has provided funding to over 2,000 students  over the 10 years since it was established. Deming retired as CEO in  2008 and became chairman of the Murphy Oil Corporation's board of  directors, a position he still holds today.   Joe M. Steele established Steele Canning Company in 1924 while still  a teenager, packing tomatoes inside a shed on his family farm in  Lowell. By 1932, Steele's young business had outgrown the small plant  and he moved his operation to Springdale where it continued to grow  rapidly. During World War II, 70 percent of Steele's canning products  were diverted to the Armed Forces and became a regular export to  soldiers on every battlefront.   Steele Canning was instrumental in several innovative marketing  initiatives including sponsoring the Beatles' 1964 tour and increasing  instore spinach sales with the addition of Popeye to its label. By the  1970s, Steele Canning became the industry standard and  [[Page S1128]]  was one of the largest canning companies in the Nation before its sale  to Pioneer Food Industries.   Steele's legacy also lives on at the Beaver Water District. In 1960,  Steele and fellow community leaders joined forces to explore ways to  supply Northwest Arkansas with a long-term supply of clean, safe water.  Steele and his colleagues advocated for the U.S. Water Supply Act which  passed in 1958 and paved the way for the establishment of the Beaver  Water District. Because of his efforts, long-term, abundant and  economical drinking water became a reality for Northwest Arkansas.   Warren A. Stephens joined his father and uncle at Stephens Inc., a  Little Rock-based investment bank and private equity firm, as a member  of the corporate-finance department after graduating from Wake Forest  University with his MBA in 1981. By 1983 he was named the head of  corporate finance, and just three short years later he was named CEO of  Stephens Inc. on his 29th birthday.   In 2006, Warren acquired 100 percent of Stephens Inc. When the global  economic crisis hit just a little more than a year later, Warren's  leadership helped the company remain on sound footing and continue to  grow. When Warren's tenure as CEO began, the company employed only 100  workers and had just one location in Little Rock. Now, over 30 years  later, Stephens Inc. has more than 1,000 employees and 28 locations  across the country. In addition to his responsibilities at Stephens  Inc., Warren currently serves on the board of directors of Dillard's  Inc., is a member of the Arkansas Arts Center Foundation Board and is  the chairman of the Episcopal Collegiate School Foundation Board.   John W. Tyson began his career in the poultry market during the Great  Depression, hauling chickens from his family's farm to nearby cities to  sell. When he learned that poultry prices were higher in the northern  regions of the country, Tyson invested his savings and borrowed enough  money to load up a truck full of chickens and drive them from Arkansas  to Chicago. The long-haul trip proved to be successful.   His young business expanded greatly during World War II. As food  rationing drove up the demand for poultry, Tyson moved into the  business of raising chicks and milling feed. In 1947, Tyson Feed and  Hatchery was incorporated and provided chicks, feed and trucking  services to local poultry farmers. The company reached new heights of  success in the 1950s, and in 1952 Tyson's son, Don, joined the family  business as general manager.   In 1963, the company went public as Tyson's Foods Inc. and began a  crusade of acquisitions that would grow Tyson Foods into a world-class  protein producer. In 1966, Tyson named his son Don as president of  Tyson Foods Inc but stayed on as chairman and chief executive officer.  Today, thanks to Tyson's flexible business strategy, Tyson Foods is the  largest processor and marketer of chicken, beef and pork in the nation.   The 2019 inductees are innovative leaders, successful entrepreneurs  and determined job creators who have realized the rewards of taking  risks. I congratulate Claiborne P. Deming, Joe M. Steele, Warren A.  Stephens and John W. Tyson for their outstanding achievements in  business and thank them for the positive impact they have had on the  state of Arkansas. They are certainly deserving of induction in the  Arkansas Business Hall of Fame.                            ____________________
