 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the chair and the ranking member for  their willingness to hear this amendment. I also want to thank the  Rules Committee, Mr. Sessions and Mr. McGovern, for ruling that this  amendment is in order.   Mr. Chairman, my amendment would provide an additional $10 million to  the defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, formerly known as JPAC, for its  newly expanded mission to bring home our missing servicemembers in  North Korea.   In light of the recent agreement that includes a commitment to  recover and repatriate U.S. POW/MIA remains from North Korea, we must  ensure that the DPAA will be able to move quickly to take advantage of  this unexpected opportunity.   As most Members are aware, nearly 8,000 U.S. servicemembers are still  categorized as missing in action and presumed dead from World War II,  the Korean war, and the Vietnam war. According to the Veterans of  Foreign Wars, the remains of about 5,300 of our sons and daughters in  uniform are believed to be in North Korea. Many of them fell in battle  near the Battle of Chosin Reservoir in November and December of 1950,  the scene of one of the most heroic battles in U.S. military history,  and certainly U.S. Marine Corps history.   Mr. Chairman, it has been 65 years since the Korean war ceasefire was  put into effect. For those brave Americans and so many American  families, to be still missing after so long is a tragedy. These brave  servicemembers and their families deserve better.                                time  1645    Mr. Chairman, I have been involved with this issue for the past 8  years. I actually went out with JPAC to the South Pacific and the  Philippines, to Vietnam and to Korea to observe their recovery efforts.   I had a chance to visit the headquarters at Hickam Air Force Base at  Pearl Harbor where a dedicated group of our forensic pathologists are  working tirelessly to use modern techniques to identify each of our  brave heroes and return them to their families and their hometowns to  receive the dignified and respectful remembrance that they deserve.   Mr. Chairman, this is a very unique opportunity. We have to act  quickly. The mitochondrial DNA that allows us to identify our sons and  daughters in uniform breaks down over time because of conditions in the  soil. If we don't act quickly, we will lose this opportunity.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr.  Visclosky).    Mr. Chair, I thank the chairwoman for her indulgence and  also thank the ranking member. I ask Members to support this amendment  to support the DPAA in its efforts to find and repatriate our missing  heroes.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
