 Madam Speaker, as my colleague from Colorado recognized  the 100th anniversary of Estes Park, I take to the floor to thank my  wife for putting up with me for 30 years--30 years ago today.   Madam Speaker, as we all know, behind every good man is a great  woman. I wanted to come to the floor to thank her for helping raise our  three boys, helping make sure that we attend church faithfully, and  putting up with the hectic life that a lot of our constituents don't  understand living in two places at one time, trying to manage a family  in another State, while we are gone almost half of the year.   So I come to the floor just to pause and thank my beautiful wife,  Karen, for sticking with me for 30 years.                            ____________________
