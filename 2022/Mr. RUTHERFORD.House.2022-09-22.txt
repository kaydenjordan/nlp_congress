 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I have to tell you, I have spent 40 years in law  enforcement, 12 as a sheriff, as you know, and I have to tell you,  never in my life have I seen law enforcement more under attack in  America than I have for the last 2\1/2\ years--never.   I know the dangers that they face out there every day. I have been  there. I have done that. I have to tell you, the attempts by those  across the aisle to delegitimize, to demoralize, and to defund our  State and local law enforcement is atrocious and unforgivable.   I hope that, come November, the American public will hold accountable  some of these folks that you just heard read out. I can tell you, I  don't think they are popular at all with the American public. Yet, now,  leading into the midterms, we are going to come together, and we are  going to throw four bills onto the floor to address law enforcement and  show that we are supportive of law enforcement. I can tell you three of  these bills are off that point.   First of all, the Mental Health Justice Act, the VICTIM Act, and the  Break the Cycle of Violence Act, these three bills, let's take them one  at a time.   The Mental Health Justice Act will actually make it more dangerous  for  [[Page H8076]]  law enforcement, make it more dangerous for our citizens. We are going  to literally send mental health workers to respond to volatile  situations where police officers, who are armed, go in and are killed  oftentimes.   Mental health calls are some of the most dangerous calls that we  handle, and we want to send civilians in lieu of law enforcement? I  don't think so.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   The idea that we are going to send civilians to do a law enforcement  officer's job in quelling a dangerous, volatile situation is bad  business.    The VICTIM Act does nothing. There is nothing new in the VICTIM Act.  All it does is add to the programs that already exist in DOJ--not one  single new idea in the VICTIM Act.   The Break the Cycle of Violence Act, first of all, comes with a very  hefty price tag, $6.5 billion, but all that money goes to public health  government bureaucrats, not law enforcement.   Listen, our job in Congress is to provide effective assistance to our  law enforcement men and women. These three acts do not do that. They  simply do not achieve that goal.   I am glad, however, that my colleagues have finally decided that  defunding the police is not a good idea, but I wish they would look at  the appropriation bills where they are basically federally defunding  law enforcement because they are putting all of these strings attached to all of our DOJ grants that go to small-, medium-, and large-sized agencies.   They are never going to be able to meet those standards, never going  to be able to meet all of those standards. So, basically, we just  federally defunded State and local law enforcement if that passes. I  hope to God it doesn't.   Instead of these misguided policies, let's work together on some  solutions. Help us hire and retain some of the best and brightest  officers that we have.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on all three of these bills: the  Mental Health Justice Act, the VICTIM Act, and the Break the Cycle of  Violence Act. These will do nothing but endanger our law enforcement  men and women.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill.   I was very fortunate during my 40-year law enforcement career to work  for a large and growing law enforcement agency. We had the resources to  go after Federal grants to help keep our community safe, to bring those  Federal dollars back home to protect my community.   I know that many agencies that I worked with did not have that  benefit, and that is why, on many of the projects that came from  Federal participation, we often partnered with much smaller agencies to  help them out.   This bill is all about helping those agencies with 125 officers or  less to be able to access those Federal grants that they cannot access  right now for training, retention, and hiring. That is what we should  be doing, Mr. Speaker.   That is why I worked with my good friend across the aisle, Josh  Gottheimer. I appreciate him working on this, getting to the language  that we could all agree with. It has been back and forth quite a bit,  but we got it here to the floor, and I congratulate him on that.    This is a bipartisan issue. This is for our law enforcement men and  women. These are for those small agencies. We need to be able to help  them out.   I can tell you the last 2\1/2\ years have left law enforcement  demoralized like never before. I have seen it. They need this  assistance as they have officers that are leaving in droves.   I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come together  and vote for this bill, which is going to help small law enforcement  agencies join with the National Fraternal Order of Police, which  supports this bill, and other law enforcement organizations. NAPO is  another.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage everyone to vote ``yes'' on this bill. I  believe these small law enforcement agencies absolutely need our  assistance.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Texas for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Trinity Love Hoblit and the  Hoblit family. I rise today to recognize and bring to the attention of  our country a horrible condition.   Trinity Love Hoblit was born with a rare form of primordial dwarfism  and at age 9 was diagnosed with multiple brain aneurysms. Despite  undergoing numerous surgeries to treat and prevent future symptoms,  Trinity suffered a fatal aneurysm on June 30, 2015, at only 14 years of  age.   Throughout her young life, Trinity underwent a variety of medical  treatments, leading to several hospital visits. Her mother remembers  that during those long hospital stays, Trinity would always think of  the other children first. It was her love for others and her desire to  make a difference within her community that now lives on through the  foundation in her name.   In 2016, Olivia and Phil Hoblit established the Trinity Love Hoblit  Foundation, located in Amelia Island, Florida. It is for the purpose of  raising awareness, support, and funding for neurological research,  training, and treatment for those like Trinity who suffer from brain  aneurysms and other cerebrovascular conditions.   Most recently, the foundation began research on determining if  medical history and genetic markers increase a person's risk of  developing these brain aneurysms.                                time  1715    Brain aneurysms affect an estimated 30,000 Americans each year and  can occur at any age and without any preexisting conditions.   Brain Aneurysm Awareness Month, this month, is a time to raise  awareness for the signs and symptoms that can help with early  detection, like:   Severe headaches,   Pain above one or both eyes,   Blurred or double vision,   Difficulty speaking or swallowing,   A numbness or weakness on one side of the body, and   Painful seizures.   These are all signs that can be symptoms and help with early  detection.   Thanks to higher levels of awareness and research developments, we  are one step closer to finding a cure.   On behalf of Florida's Fourth Congressional District, I thank Olivia  and Phil Hoblit and the Trinity Love Hoblit Foundation for their  lifesaving work in northeast Florida and across the country.                Making Homeownership More Accessible to Heroes     Mr. Speaker, as inflation takes a toll on families  throughout our Nation and housing costs soar, many of our first  responders and educators struggle to find affordable homes in the  communities that they serve.   For this reason, I introduced H.R. 3172, the HELPER Act, which would  establish a new one-time-use home loan program for law enforcement  officers, firefighters, EMTs, paramedics, and pre-K-12 teachers.   Modeled after the successful VA home loan program, the HELPER Act  would make homeownership more accessible to our local heroes by  removing the downpayment and mortgage insurance premium requirements  that can put homeownership just out of reach.   The HELPER Act has strong bipartisan, bicameral support from over 90  Members in both Houses of Congress and more than 225 different  organizations across the country, including 108 mayors from different  cities around the country.   As we all know, everything is more expensive these days, and the  HELPER Act would prevent our first responders and educators from being  priced out of home buying in the very communities they are sworn to  protect.
