 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, this amendment prohibits the use of any funds  in this act for so-called transit-oriented development.   Contrary to the claims of proponents of such communities, they do not  increase ridership on transit lines. Rather, they just ensure taxpayers  subsidize development that would likely happen anyway.   Moreover, like transit investment generally, they do not create  economic growth. Instead, these communities just subsidize the growth  that would likely have occurred naturally.   This is a giveaway to developers in large urban areas, as most areas  do not have the population density to support these communities. It  does not address the more fundamental issue plaguing our Nation's  transit systems than driving down ridership, which is the problem.  Doing so will only result in wasted Federal resources that would be  better directed toward core highway and bridge projects.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, the gentleman says that Federalism is good  sometimes but not other times, and States' rights are important  sometimes but not other times.   Let me be clear: We are not talking about the transit lines  themselves. This is transit-oriented development.   Let me break it down for everybody here. There is a transit line  running somewhere. There is not a lot of ridership on it, so we have to  boost the ridership. What that means is that we are going to subsidize  some developer to build housing or whatever other development adjacent  to the line to hope that those people will then get on that transit  line. That is what is happening here.   You know what happens next. We subsidize the development. Then, the  people who get into that development take their cars to wherever they  are going and don't ride on the transit line.   If you have to have transit lines, God bless you. That is awesome. If  you want to ride them, God bless you. That is awesome. There is no  reason whatsoever that this is a Federal requirement or a Federal nexus  at all to build developments next to transit lines.   If States and localities want to do that, if they want to subsidize  them, God bless them, too. They should do that, but people in  Pennsylvania shouldn't be supporting transit-related development in  California any more than people in California should be supporting it  in Illinois. That is no Federal nexus.   If Illinois wants to do it, they should. If Pennsylvania wants to do  it, they should. We shouldn't require every taxpayer in the country to  pay for transit-oriented development to boost ridership on the lines  that don't have any so that we can justify the lines and then build  more lines without any ridership.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, this is an awesome idea. I am glad that the  gentleman can walk 15 seconds outside his door and get on the train  and, as he says, more quickly and safely get to his destination. That  is great. That is good for him.   If my colleague wants to pay for that, he should. If Illinois wants  to pay for that, they should. I shouldn't have to pay for it.   By the way, while my colleague is talking about quicker and safer, of  course, there are no metrics to support any of that.   I have no interest in riding mass transit. My daughters get on the  bus every morning, and I remind them, as they are standing up there at  the bus stop in the freezing cold waiting for the bus, that I hope they  enjoy their mass transit. I hope they enjoy their public transportation  because it is inefficient. It is not getting them there more quickly.   Riding in America's cities on mass transit, my colleague said it is  safer. It seems like crime is on the rise in every single city. It is  not ``seeming so,'' it is so. It is not safe. It is not safe here in  the Nation's Capital to ride on transit. It is not quicker. It is not  safer. I am providing the same metrics to prove my point that you  provided to prove yours, which are none.                                time  1930    Mr. Chair, this is about federalism. This is about subsidies and  boondoggles and things that we can't afford while we are $33 trillion  in debt.   If somebody wants to build, if some developer wants to build next to  the transit line because they think it will  [[Page H5527]]  help them sell their properties in their development more quickly, they  should do that. Taxpayers shouldn't be involved.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of my amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, this amendment prohibits the use of funds to  finalize, implement, or enforce the National Highway Traffic Safety  Administration's rule mandating automatic emergency braking systems on  new commercial vehicles.   Isn't that wonderful, another mandate? Making the world better,  making America better, making us more free, making everything more  affordable, except it is not.   The IIJA, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, required the  Department of Transportation to issue a mandate for heavy-duty trucks  to be equipped with automatic emergency braking systems. It also  required the DOT to consult with the commercial vehicle user community  and address any existing deficiencies with automatic emergency braking  systems before issuing its mandate.   The issue is that DOT has failed to meet both requirements, or any  requirement.   There are real and legitimate concerns about false activations of the  systems that remain unaddressed and must be dealt with before  proceeding with any requirement.   Moreover, an integrated safety system with an automatic emergency  braking system can add up to $5,000 to the cost of a single truck. Oh,  but it is always worth it. It is always worth it. We are going to be  more safe if we have this stuff.   Meanwhile, we can't get anybody to drive a truck anymore. That is why  we are looking at automated trucks without drivers in them because we  have depleted the truck driving industry. We have driven everybody out  because they can't afford to get in or stay in.   With fleets operating on exceedingly tight margins, this mandated  cost increase presents a barrier to entry for new market participants.  It will also likely result in extending the life of current vehicles,  causing these operators to miss out on the safety improvements of newer  trucks that they won't buy.   I know it is counterintuitive, but when these rules are made, they  never think about the additional cost that the truck owner or the  person that wishes to buy a truck or replace a truck is going to have  to incur. They just assume, well, they will just spend the extra  $5,000.   This is not where it ends. This is just one system. There are  multiple systems on these new trucks and all new equipment. They just  keep adding and adding.   Well, I don't understand why the cost of everything goes up. I can't  figure it out. If you are on the left you can never figure those things  out. It is because of you and the things that you do. That is why.   Moreover, this will likely result in an older truck fleet in the  U.S., which is actually probably more dangerous because people are not  going to replace trucks because they don't have the extra $5,000. I  know you think all truck drivers are made of money, but they are not.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, my good friend from Illinois says that we  ought to just go through the rulemaking process.   However, as I told you, there are real and legitimate concerns that  have not been addressed, and that is why you go through the rulemaking  process. It is not just a perfunctory, well, we asked for your input,  and we got it. Now we are just going to disregard it and do what we  want to anyhow, which is exactly what the National Highway Traffic  Safety Administration is doing, which is why we cannot fund this.   It is our government. The government serves us. It is not the other  way around. It is just another example where we act like we are Oliver  Twist begging for more gruel. The gruel is ours, Mr. Chairman, and we  should not have to beg for it as the citizens of this country. This  government belongs to us, not the other way around.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, my colleague says that we should respect the  rulemaking process. Maybe some of my colleagues here in Washington  don't understand, don't recognize, won't acknowledge that this  government has gotten too big, and the rulemaking process is really  meant to shut out voices across America.   It is we here in Congress who should be making these rules, not  unelected bureaucrats who have no accountability to the people that  they impose these rules upon. It is we who should be doing this.   By the way, there were some folks who came in, they said, We oppose  your amendment. We want this emergency braking system on trucks.   I said, Well, how about on your trucks?   Oh, no, no, we don't want it on our trucks. We want it on their  trucks. We want it on someone else's trucks.   Everybody wants someone else to pay the freight until it comes to  their doorstep, then they are not interested.   Mr. Chairman, this government is too big. This is an example of it. I  urge adoption of this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
