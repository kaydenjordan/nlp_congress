 Mr. President, before he leaves, let me commend my  colleague from Louisiana. His role as a substitute teacher is one I  greatly admire.   I thank you for sharing that with us today. I am sure it gives you  great insight into education--greater than some--and I am going to  accept your challenge and try to find a way to be a substitute teacher  myself along the way, if they will have me. But thank you for that  statement.   It has been almost 100 years since the Great Depression. It was a  terrible time in American history. Businesses failed right and left.  Families lost all of their savings. There were runs on banks,  businesses failing. It was a horrible moment.   Luckily for us, the leadership of Franklin Roosevelt appeared in  1933, when he was sworn in as President of the United States, and we  made some significant basic changes. One of them we still benefit from  today: Federal deposit insurance.   If you go to a recognized legal bank in America, a regulated bank,  under our Federal guidelines, there is an insurance policy that says  that even if this bank goes bust, we are going to be there to protect  much of your savings, maybe all of them, depending on how much you have  invested in that bank.   We were tested during the savings and loan crisis a few decades ago,  and we kept our promise. We paid people back when the savings  institutions they were invested in failed.   But there are areas where you can invest your own personal savings  where there is no insurance policy. You are on your own. The stock  market is one of them.   By and large, when you buy stock, if you don't make money on it, that  is your personal loss. But even when it comes to the stock market, the  companies that are in that stock market doing business in America are  largely subject to regulation. So we know, at least, that the books  they are presenting have to be legal and be accurate in their  disclosures. It is just the basics of government regulation.   However, there are some areas where you can bet your money or invest  your money where there is no protection and no regulation. I want to  speak to one of those areas at this moment. This area has been called  the ``new money,'' ``digital cash,'' and some have called it ``the way  of the future.'' I have another name for it: reckless, predatory,  foolish, and dangerous. I am referring, of course, to cryptocurrency,  the latest scam to rip off millions of hard-working Americans to the  tune of billions of dollars.   In under a decade, this industry has skyrocketed in popularity, raked  in big bucks for its leading speculators, before exploding into dust  for all the world to see.   Let me tell you about crypto's terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad  year--2022. Let's start with the most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin.  In 2022, the currency cratered, losing more than 60 percent of its  value in 1 year.   To put it in perspective, if you bought one Bitcoin at the start of  2022 and held on to it today, you would be down $25,000. Think of all  the Americans who could have held on to that cash for family needs or  to cover a downpayment on their first home. Their money is gone. There  is no insurance. It is just an investment that disappeared.   They are not alone. The disaster began last May with a financial  meltdown known as ``crypto winter.'' If you are one of the millions of  consumers--millions--who were convinced by those well-respected  financial advisers--Matt Damon, Larry David, and LeBron James--to buy  into crypto, you don't need me to tell you what happened next.   In a matter of months, more than $2 trillion vanished from this  industry. One crypto firm after another folded. Even a so-called  ``stablecoin,'' which claims to offer great stability, went bust.   Then, in the fall, came the mighty collapse of the exchange FTX. Its  founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, spent years cultivating the reputation of a  selfless wunderkind and entrepreneur. He claimed crypto and the FTX  platform would democratize finance, that he was giving a leg up to the  little guy, finally, and sticking it to the barons of traditional  finance.   It was all a lie. While Sam Bankman-Fried was burning millions of  dollars branding himself as some noble disruptor, the reality is he was  stealing his own users' money to fund his own risky bets.   Here is the worst part. For Americans who were scammed into investing  in FTX, there is little hope of retrieving any of their money.   Earlier this week, Annie Lowrey wrote a piece in The Atlantic,  sharing the story of one FTX user whose money was stolen. His name was  Greg Sanders. Greg has actually been a crypto investor for quite a  while, a pretty vigilant investor too. He even protected his assets  with a technique he calls ``cold storage.''   So Greg knew about the risk with trading crypto. He knew those assets  were loosely regulated, if regulated at all, and he knew about the  volatility of the market. But Greg never expected that the company he  trusted to safeguard his money would end up stealing it. He lost nearly  $10,000 when FTX collapsed, and, like millions of others, he hasn't  gotten any money back.   Here is what he said about his experience: ``FTX was legitimized in  the public eye . . . I saw the Tom Brady commercials,'' Greg said. ``I  saw the Major League Baseball umpires'' with FTX's name on their  uniforms. ``Its name was on the Miami Heat arena. There was so much  legitimatization from the public, and it lent credence to the idea that  this was a safe place,'' to put your money.   Thankfully, Greg says he will be OK. He has a good-paying job and  enough money saved to pay his bills.   But stop for a second and think about Americans who are not that  lucky.  [[Page S184]]  More than half of our Nation's families cannot afford a $1,000  emergency, and those same families, who struggle to make ends meet,  have been targeted by the crypto ad campaigns Greg mentioned.    In fact, leaders of the crypto industry have explicitly marketed  their products to unbanked and underbanked Americans, those who do not  have access to traditional financial services.   Now, this is a problem that disproportionately affects Black and  Brown Americans, who have historically been outside the financial  system. So along comes crypto and its leading fabulists, like Sam  Bankman-Fried. These grifters cloak themselves in the language of  inclusion and accessibility, promising that crypto is open to everybody  and operates ``without discrimination.''   Well, in a way, they are right. When the crypto industry melted down,  everybody got hurt, especially all of the Black and Brown Americans,  who were more likely than White Americans to invest in crypto. It seems  the cynical ad campaigns worked.   So as a new year begins, where do we stand with crypto? The industry  is hoping the dust will settle, that things will quiet down. Maybe it  will even blow over, and everybody will forget the damage of 2022.   Guess again. Our Federal regulators are coming to life, and they are  bringing down the hammer on crypto.   I want to commend Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary  Gensler. He is doing his part to protect the integrity of our capital  markets and to hold bad actors accountable. In the past month alone,  the SEC has filed charges against two major crypto companies for  burning their investors.   And there are other cops on the beat too. On Friday, the Federal  Reserve rejected an application from a crypto company called Custodia  for a deposit account at the central bank and denied its request to  become a member of the Federal Reserve System. In denying the  application, the Federal Board wrote that Custodia ``proposed to engage  in novel and untested crypto activities . . . on open, public and/or  decentralized networks.''   As we have learned, that would be a recipe for disaster. So I am glad  both the Fed and the SEC, among others, are working to insulate our  broader financial system and protect investors from the instability of  crypto.   But, now, it is time for wiser minds in finance to come to their  senses, and it starts with Fidelity. To think the crypto industry has  entranced one of the largest 401(k) providers in the world is shocking.  Yet that is exactly what happened.   This past summer, Fidelity announced it would allow retirement plan  sponsors to offer plan participants exposure to Bitcoin.   Remember, Bitcoin alone lost more than 60 percent of its value last  year. Now imagine if your 401(k) lived or died by the value of Bitcoin.  That is unacceptable for 40 million Americans who invest with Fidelity,  and I am one of them. Many of them are relying on those investments to  retire in dignity.   So that is why last year I sent a letter, along with Senators Warren  and Smith, to Fidelity CEO Abigail Johnson. We respectfully asked her  to reconsider this ill-advised decision on crypto.   We received a response in which Fidelity said: ``respectfully  disagree[d] with the assertion that bitcoin cannot meet the higher  standards applicable to retirement accounts.''   So after the collapse of FTX, I thought: Let's send another letter to  Fidelity and see if they have a change of heart.   We figured that at least diversifying from crypto would be a no- brainer at that point. Apparently not, because we still haven't  received a response.   Hard-working Americans who entrust Fidelity with their retirement  savings expect more. They deserve better than Ponzi schemes and endless  volatility. The financial future and stability of millions of their  customers--and many others--is on the line. It is time to do the right  thing and be honest about cryptocurrency. There should be more  transparency, accountability, and enough regulation so that we know  they are telling the truth.   And let me close with one point. I was at a hearing with the  Agriculture Committee where we were discussing the issue from a  different perspective, whether Bitcoin and similar objects were  commodities, subject to regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading  Commission, an Agency I know well from the financial industry in  Chicago.   I left that hearing after some critical remarks about cryptocurrency,  and a reporter stopped me in the hall, and she said to me: How much  money have you received in political contributions from FTX?   I said: None.   She said: You are wrong. Look again.   I looked. It was over $7,000--money that I did not solicit but banked  not knowing what was behind that money. We have given that money to  charity, as you might expect.   But they have more friends in high places than they have really good  arguments for their product.   I think that we have got to be thoughtful and mindful as politicians  that this industry has a lot of money riding on this bet, and we have  got to be careful that we don't become so beholden to them that we lose  our clear-eyed look at an entity that has hurt so many people already  and is likely to do more in the future.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from Oregon (Mr. Wyden) is  necessarily absent.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
