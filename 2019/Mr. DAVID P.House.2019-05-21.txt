 ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much  time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I would like to associate my comments with the  chairman's comments about women's suffrage 100th anniversary today.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2359, as amended, the  [[Page H4033]]  Whole Veteran Act. This bill would require the Department of Veterans  Affairs to submit a report to Congress on the implementation of the  whole health initiative and include information in the report about the  availability of a number of complementary and alternative treatments  like meditation, acupuncture, yoga, and equine therapy.    VA's whole health initiative is a component of Secretary Wilkie's  plan to transform the Veterans Health Administration into a more  innovative, holistic, and veteran-centric healthcare system that puts  veteran patients in the driver's seat.   I support the Secretary in that effort wholeheartedly, and I look  forward to seeing how it will yield improved outcomes and satisfaction  among veterans across the country.   The dissemination of best practices and complementary and alternative  approaches to pain management is particularly important, given the  ongoing opioid crisis that continues to plague our Nation.   I thank Congressman Conor Lamb from Pennsylvania for sponsoring this  bill and Congressman Barr from Kentucky for improving it with his  tireless advocacy for equine therapy. I encourage all Members to join  me in supporting it.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I have no further  speakers at this time. I am prepared to close. I reserve the balance of  my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I, too, want to encourage all Members to support this.   We, in 2003, spent about $2 billion on mental health and PTSD  treatment at the VA; in this year's budget, it is $8.5 billion. And we  have not moved the needle at all on the number of veterans committing  suicide.    So I think this is a great idea to see if we can use an alternative  treatment to help lower this way-too-high rate and help.  [[Page H4034]]    When you think about 20 people a day dying of suicide, by their own  hands, it is heartbreaking. So I encourage all Members to vote for  this.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 1812, as  amended, the Vet Center Eligibility Expansion Act.   Every day, 20 of those who have worn our Nation's uniform die by  suicide. Of those 20 deaths, each one is a tragedy.   There are approximately four deaths among Active-Duty servicemembers  and nonactivated members of the National Guard and Reserve.   The number of suicides among never federally activated members of the  National Guard and Reserve, in particular, has increased from 2005 to  2016, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs' most recent  suicide data.   Many of these men and women have stepped up to serve their  communities and our country honorably in dangerous and unpredictable  situations. That service can have an understandable impact on mental  health, but because they may not meet the legal definition of a veteran  due to the nature of their service, these individuals may not be  eligible for care from the VA.   This bill would address that issue by expanding eligibility for  counseling and care at VA Vet Centers to those in the Reserve, National  Guard, or Coast Guard who served in response to emergency situations in  the wake of a disaster or civil disorder or support of drug  interdiction operations who never deployed.   VA's 300 Vet Centers are community-based facilities that provide  readjustment counseling services to Active-Duty servicemembers,  veterans, and their families.   Vet Center employees, many of whom are veterans themselves, are on  the forefront of the fight to prevent suicide among servicemembers and  veterans, to assure their successful transition following the military,  and to assist them in recovering from whatever trauma or challenges  they may be facing.   I am proud to sponsor this bill and grateful to Congressman   Mike  Levin from California for joining me as an original cosponsor.   I am also grateful to the Enlisted Association of the National Guard  of the United States and the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America  for their support of this legislation.   It is my sincere hope that this bill will allow all of those who  served in the National Guard, the Coast Guard, or the Reserve component  to get the  [[Page H4035]]  help they need and lower the number of suicides among this population  of heroes.   Madam Speaker, before reserving, I do want to note my surprise that  the bill received a discretionary score of $55 million over 5 years  from the Congressional Budget Office.   It appears that CBO estimated that VA would need to create costly new  capacity within the Vet Centers to care for those individuals newly  eligible in this bill.   Madam Speaker, I have been to many Vet Centers, and the brick and  mortar is already there. You don't have to do anything. The personnel  are there. So there would be, if any, minimal costs.   However, I understand from VA that excess capacity exists within the  Vet Centers that this bill would help fill, at little additional cost  to the Department. I hope that could be taken into account for this  bill, moving forward.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all Members to support this bill today,  and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1545     ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all Members to support this. I think it is  a great step forward for our Guard and Reservists.   I will just pass along a quick story of one of the reasons why I have  pushed this so hard. In my Tennessee Guard at home, my previous  commander said that in the first 45 days he commanded the Tennessee  Guard, he had four suicides. He knew he had to do something, so he  instituted a program there to help lower veteran suicides.   We have lowered our suicide rate among our Tennessee guardsmen by 70  percent. We would like to make sure that all Guard and Reservists have  access to the benefits they need, the therapy they need, and the help  they need for their families by allowing them to get this help at the  vet center.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all Members to support this, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2326, as amended, the  Navy SEAL Chief Petty Officer William ``Bill'' Mulder (Ret.) Transition  Improvement Act of 2019.   One of the most important things our government can do to help our  Nation's servicemembers is to ensure that their transition from  military to civilian life is as seamless as possible. We all know that  an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and I believe that so  many of the problems that veterans encounter later in life could have  been mitigated if they had a more supportive and successful transition.  I know that the goal of this bill is to help servicemembers have as  smooth a transition as possible to civilian life.   I will allow Congressman Jodey Arrington from Texas, who is an  original cosponsor of the bill, to go into the specifics in a moment.  Before I do that, I want to thank him, as the former chairman of the  Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity, for taking the time last Congress  to sit down with stakeholders and really examine the transition process  from the very beginning and look at the need for improvements.   While this bill was a culmination of a bipartisan review and work, it  is only one step in the process to ensure a successful transition for  all servicemembers. I know that we all remain dedicated to making  improvements to this process to reach this goal. We were unable to  persuade the Senate to act on this bill last Congress, and I want to  thank Mr. Arrington, Chairman Takano, and subcommittee Chairman Levin  for picking up where we left off in pushing this bill through yet  again. I am confident, with their continued support, we can ensure it  is on President Trump's desk very soon.    Madam Speaker, I want to just say from a point of privilege, when I  separated from the military, the U.S. Army in 1974, a long time ago, my  transition: Was how quick can I get to the front gate? We have made  huge improvements since the end of the Vietnam war. There really was no  program for veterans then. It was a mistake then. I appreciate the  efforts of my colleague to rectify this mistake.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all Members to support H.R. 2326, as  amended, and I reserve the balance of my time.

We not only memorialize those whom  we lost in combat, but I think we also memorialize those who are lost  because of the invisible wounds of combat.   I can't think of a more fitting time to pass this bill for Navy SEAL  Chief  [[Page H4039]]  Petty Officer Bill Mulder. It is a small consolation for his family,  but I think they know his memory can live on by helping other veterans.  I encourage all Members to support this legislation.

Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2333, the Support for  Suicide Prevention Coordinators Act. This bill would require a  Government Accountability Office report on the responsibilities,  management, workload, training, and vacancy rates of Department of  Veterans Affairs suicide prevention coordinators. The VA employs at  least one suicide prevention coordinator in every VA medical center to  coordinate, care for, and conduct outreach to servicemembers and  veterans at risk of suicide.   These men and women are on the front lines of the fight against the  tragic loss of 20 of our Nation's servicemembers and veterans every day  to self-harm. We must ensure that they are appropriately staffed,  supported, and overseen as they go about their difficult and incredibly  important work. Passage of the Support for Suicide Prevention  Coordinators Act today will help us do just that.   This is a bipartisan bill sponsored by several members of the  Veterans' Affairs Committee, including Congressman   Jim Banks from  Indiana, ranking member of the Subcommittee on Technology  Modernization; Congressman   Mike Bost of Illinois, the ranking  [[Page H4040]]  member of the Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial  Affairs; Congressman Steube from Florida, a member of both the  Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee, and Health  Subcommittee.   I am grateful to each of them, as well as the bill's lead sponsor,  Congressman Andy Brindisi from New York, for their efforts.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all Members to join me in supporting H.R.  2333, and I reserve the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee.

Madam Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2340, as amended, the  FIGHT Veteran Suicides Act.   This bill would require the Department of Veterans Affairs to report  to the local congressional delegation, as well as to the committee,  whenever a veteran attempts or dies by suicide in or on the grounds of  a VA facility.   We have all heard the heartbreaking stories of veterans who have died  by suicide on VA campuses, including five veteran suicide deaths in the  last several weeks alone. There is no indication that these events  represent an increase in the rate of suicide among servicemembers and  veterans, but they are particularly poignant because they occur so  close to help and appear to be an indictment on the healthcare system  that was created to support them.   To be clear, suicide is a national public health crisis that is not  unique to VA, the military, or veterans. However, we must pay careful  attention to the incidents of suicide among those who have served and  sacrificed on our behalf and do everything we can to point those in  crisis to the resources they need to recover from the traumas and live  long, full, healthy lives.   I am grateful to Congressman Max Rose from New York for sponsoring  this bill, which will allow us to learn all we can about the suicides  that occur on VA campuses so that we can take action that may save  other lives in the future.   I encourage all Members to support this much-needed piece of  legislation.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1200, the Veterans'  Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2019.  [[Page H4043]]    In keeping with the traditions of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs,  this bill was introduced by Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs  Subcommittee Chair Elaine Luria and Ranking Member   Mike Bost. I  appreciate their commitment to ensuring that veterans and their  families can afford living expenses when prices go up.   H.R. 1200 authorizes a cost-of-living increase for veterans and their  families next year if Social Security recipients receive an increase.   To put this in perspective, in 1975, a veteran who was rated totally  disabled would receive at least $655 in monthly disability  compensation. Because of the COLAs that Congress has passed for  decades, totally disabled veterans now receive $2,907 in tax-free  monthly disability compensation, an increase of 443 percent over the  years. As you can see, H.R. 1200 is necessary to prevent inflation from  eroding the value of veteran and survivor benefits.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all Members to support H.R. 1200, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to  the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Bost), ranking member of the  Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs and a marine  veteran.

I think my last duty assignment was probably in Mrs. Luria's  district, Fort Eustis, Virginia. That is where my last 9 months in the  Army was.   I was raised in a military town: Fort Campbell, Kentucky, and  Clarksville, Tennessee. I grew up around the military, and I just  cannot thank them enough.   This is the very least we can do for our disabled veterans, to give  them a COLA which will, hopefully, make their lives a little bit better  and thank them for their service.

Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2372, as amended, the  Veterans' Care Quality Transparency Act.   This bill is sponsored by Congresswoman Lauren Underwood of Illinois,  and I thank her for her efforts to bring it to the House floor today.   This bill would require the Government Accountability Office to  conduct an assessment of the effectiveness of all memoranda of  understanding and memoranda of agreement entered into by the Department  of Veterans Affairs and other governmental or private-sector entities  regarding suicide prevention activities and outreach, as well as the  coordination of mental health services, during the 5-year period  preceding the date of enactment.   For the last two decades, approximately 20 of our Nation's  servicemembers and veterans have died by suicide on a daily basis.   Suicide is, unquestionably, a tragedy that impacts all Americans and  is a crisis that VA cannot combat alone. In light of that, VA has  become increasingly mindful of the need to collaborate with partners in  both the public and private sectors to connect with servicemembers,  veterans, and their families wherever they reside and with whatever  they may be struggling.   This bill would ensure that Congress has insight into those  collaborations and whether or not they are working as intended to  reduce incidents of suicide among those who have served our country.

Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much  time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2045, as amended, the  Veterans' Education Transition and Opportunity Prioritization Plan Act,  or the VET OPP Act.   Madam Speaker, investing in education and employment opportunities  for our Nation's veterans is one of the Department of Veterans Affairs'  most important but least recognized missions.   Today, programs concerning education and employment are embedded  within the Veterans Benefit Administration which, understandably,  devotes  [[Page H4047]]  most of its time, attention, and resources to disability compensation- related issues and backlogs that rise and fall with time.   The focus on compensation programs creates programs when other VBA  programs need attention. An example of this was the implementation last  fall of the Forever GI Bill which was, to say the least, rocky, the  start was.   While I know that the VA has many dedicated employees who tried their  best to prevent the delays that occurred, I do believe that if the  implementation of this law had received more attention from senior  leaders at VA, things could have been better.   The VET OPP Act is a means to mitigate these problems in the future.  The bill would create a new, fourth administration at VA which would be  called the Veterans Economic Opportunity and Transition Administration  and led by a new Under Secretary for Veterans Economic Opportunity and  Transition.   The new Under Secretary would oversee education benefits like the GI  Bill, the Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Program, VA's home  loan program, the Transition Assistance Program, or TAP program, and  the small business programs. Creating a new administration within VA to  house education and employment programs will ensure that those programs  receive the focused leadership time and attention that they deserve.   I appreciate my friend and colleague, Congressman Wenstrup from Ohio,  for championing this legislation. It has my full support.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to  the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), my good friend, and a  Member I have served with on the Veterans' Affairs Committee the entire  time I have been in Congress.

ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much  time as I may consume. I have no further speakers, and I am prepared to  close.   Madam Speaker, I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this  bill. When I first got here to Congress in 2009, the Veterans Benefit  Administration had 1 million backlogged disability claims. It is hard  to focus on something else when you have that much on your plate.   I think we have recognized that over the last several years, and I  commend Dr. Wenstrup and others for bringing this up.   Madam Speaker, I strongly encourage all Members to support this, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much  time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 1947, as  amended.   This bill would address a limitation in current law that prevents  funding from being transferred to the Department of Veterans Affairs  nonprofit research and education corporations, or NPCs, for longer than  1 fiscal year.                                time  1730    NPCs were established by Congress in the late 1980s to provide a  flexible funding mechanism to support research. Collectively, they have  contributed more than $2 billion to VA research projects over the last  decade.   However, last year, VA's Office of the General Counsel uncovered a  legal limitation that prevents funding from being transferred to the  NPCs for longer than 1 fiscal year. This upturned years of practice by  the NPCs and threatened a number of ongoing research projects across  the country that could benefit veterans and all Americans.   Madam Speaker, I have been involved in a number of research projects  over the years, and they just don't go for 365 days. Many of them go  for years and years. This bill would correct that limitation and  preserve the ability of the NPCs to support important multiyear  research projects.   Additionally, H.R. 1947, as amended, includes a provision from  Representative LaMalfa's bill, H.R. 1126, the Honoring Veterans'  Families Act.   Currently, VA is authorized to add a memorial inscription for a  veteran's deceased spouse or eligible dependent child to a VA-furnished  marker, but only if they are buried in a national cemetery or a State  or Tribal veterans cemetery. Unfortunately, VA cannot provide this  benefit to veterans and their families if they are buried elsewhere,  such as a private or local cemetery. H.R. 1947, as amended, would  address this problem by allowing VA to memorialize a veteran's deceased  spouse or certain children on the veteran's marker, regardless of where  they choose to be laid to rest.   The cost of this bill will be paid for by closing a loophole in GI  Bill rules related to flight schools by capping the total tuition and  fees that can be used at a public school for flight training at the  current private school cap of $23,671 per year. The bill would  authorize a 2-year grandfather clause so that no current students are  impacted by this change.   It also includes provisions that would make it easier for students to  attend flight training by removing the prohibition against GI Bill  funds paying for a private pilot's license and giving students the  option to accelerate their GI Bill benefits to pay for the increased  cost associated with flight training.   These changes to flight training for the GI Bill have had wide  bipartisan and veteran service organization support in the past, and I  am pleased that they are included in this bill.   I encourage all Members to support H.R. 1947, as amended.   I thank the chairman for his kind comments and support of this bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Before I yield back, I do want to express my disappointment that H.R.  2196 is not on the floor for consideration this afternoon. This bill,  introduced by my friend and outstanding new member of our committee,  Congressman Barr from Kentucky, would clarify the eligibility of the  Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship program. This scholarship, which  was enacted as part of the Forever GI Bill, authorizes extra GI Bill  funding to help student veterans complete their undergraduate degrees  in the science, technology, engineering, and math, STEM, fields.   Madam Speaker, we all know that there is a need to fill vacancies for  high-paying jobs in the STEM fields. The Smithsonian Science Education  Center found STEM-related jobs grew at three times the rate of non-STEM  jobs between 2000 and 2010. By 2018, they projected that 2.4 million  STEM jobs would go unfilled.   The Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship program is critical to  ensure that veterans are the ones who fill these vacancies. However,  the way the original law was drafted, it would unintentionally prevent  most students from using this scholarship in all but a few STEM  programs.   With the scholarship going live on August 1, 2019, I am grateful to  Mr. Barr for quickly stepping up to the plate to offer this bill to  ensure students are eligible for it.   We all know that the Senate generally takes longer to review  legislation than the House. Let me repeat that. We all know that the  Senate generally takes a lot longer to review legislation than the  House does. That is why, with the August 1 deadline approaching  quickly, I was hopeful we could consider this legislation today. The  bill has gone through full regular order, is supported by VA and  veterans service organizations, and has no cost.   I would ask the chairman if he would please work with the majority  leader to schedule this bill for consideration immediately after the  Memorial Day district work period.   Before I yield back, next Monday is Memorial Day. For me, personally,  I want to thank all of the members of the Veterans' Affairs Committee,  the chairman and others, as you have seen today, for the work they have  done in a bipartisan way to help our Nation's heroes.   As I said, for me, personally, as a veteran, this is a very difficult  day because it is a day that we mourn the loss of veterans who served  on Active Duty and paid the ultimate price. I want to just mention a  few names of people.   First, Sergeant Thomas E. Thayer, a tremendous man whom I knew as a  young boy growing up. He was my Scout master. He was in the 101st  Airborne and was killed in Vietnam, receiving the Silver Star in 1965.   Johnny Parham, who was also an Eagle Scout, as I am. Johnny and I ran  on the 2-mile relay team together in high school. I have to say, we  were pretty good. Johnny died in 1969 in Vietnam and was unable to have  the wonderful life that I have had, to be able to raise a family, have  children and grandchildren, because of service to our Nation.   Bob Perry, a young man whom I went to elementary school with all the  way through high school. I found out at my high school reunion many  years later that Bob also died in Vietnam.   We just heard today, Chief Petty Officer Bill Mulder, a highly  decorated Navy SEAL who protected this Nation, giving up his life  because of, really, the invisible wounds of war.   I just want to thank all of those who paid the ultimate price for our  freedom. Thank you, thank you, thank you.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
