 Madam Chair, I rise today in opposition to this extreme and  misguided amendment.   In Iraq and Afghanistan, I fought alongside servicemembers from every  race, gender, and political affiliation, and we had each other's backs.  We still do. So, I will not sit quietly while people attack the rights  of women who have stood up to serve this country. We owe them better  than this.   It is extreme, misguided, and inconsistent with the values of our  Nation and our military.   Madam Chair, as a standard-bearer of those values, I urge my  colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I fully support Ukraine in its existential fight  for freedom and democracy. I have also spent years in this Chamber  addressing the issue of civilian casualties. In fact, I am one of the  founding co-chairs of the Protection of Civilians in Conflict Caucus.  Why? Because I spent the formative years of my life in Afghanistan  seeing the horrific results of war, including cluster munitions.   However, there are times in this Chamber when a measure doesn't do  what we think it does, when it, in fact, does the opposite.   This measure will not stop the use of clusters in Ukraine. I have  written to the administration. I have asked for clarity. I have asked  for assurances and mitigation measures, and I will continue to do that.   What this measure will do is play right into pro-Russian and pro- Putin propaganda. It will be twisted and contorted by nefarious actors  who say that America doesn't support Ukraine and that Democrats don't  support Ukraine. That is not where we need to be because that is the  history of this bill. That is the history of many of those who are  supporting this bill and who have originated this bill. That is the  context from which this bill originates.   That is not where progressive, pro-Ukrainian Members should be.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this measure vociferously.    Mr. Chairman, I do a lot of good work with my friend from  California, and we have agreed before, but I have to vehemently  disagree with him on this particular amendment.   It is framed as an Afghanistan oversight amendment, an issue that is  very important to me and which I have worked very hard on over the last  couple of years, both before the withdrawal from Afghanistan and after  the withdrawal from Afghanistan.   It lists a number of efforts and a number of data points and  information and documents that it wants the government to turn over.   If only somebody had thought of this before. If only we thought about  doing oversight of Afghanistan before; like maybe the Special Inspector  General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, SIGAR, or maybe the Abbey Gate  investigation, or maybe the thousands of documents that CENTCOM already  has on its website, or maybe the Oversight and Accountability  Subcommittee that Foreign Affairs actually just created that I am the  ranking member of, or maybe the DOD, State Department, and CIA after- action reviews that exist, or maybe the General Accountability Office  investigations, or maybe the IG investigations, or maybe the bipartisan  Afghanistan War Commission  [[Page H3559]]  that we have supported that has eight Democrats and eight Republicans  that many of my friends on the opposite side of the aisle won't even  agree to fund now, or maybe the 20 pieces of legislation that I and  others have supported to make sure that we learn lessons and do this  right, or maybe the Afghan Allies Protection Act that I am moving  forward to do right by our SIVs, or maybe the Afghan Adjustment Act to  make sure that we are helping those Afghans that we evacuated.   I could go on and on about all the efforts that I have worked on, and  others have worked on that I would fully support and hope that you  would do the same, but this is just a political effort, right?   There is all this other stuff going on that I support that are good,  bipartisan efforts. This is duplicative which makes it gratuitously  political, and I urge my colleagues not to support this measure.                                time  2140     My friend from California, I will always accept an offer to  meet with our families of the fallen. I served in Afghanistan, as you  know, and some of my friends and people that I served with made the  ultimate sacrifice, but this is not the way to advance this mission and  get this done.   As the ranking member of the Oversight and Accountability  Subcommittee, I will work with you to do it the right way.
