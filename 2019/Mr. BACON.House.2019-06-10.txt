 Madam Speaker, I appreciate Mr. Larsen's team spirit, good  sportsmanship here, and good cheer.   Again, I just want to thank Mr. Larsen, Ms. Castor, and also Mr.  LaHood. We are the co-chairs of the Soccer Caucus here in the Congress.  I really loved working with the other three here.   I also appreciate the good sportsmanship here. We stuck out a good  victory despite the heroics on your side, Madam Speaker. But we gave it  all. Some of these great new players on our side really did the heavy  lifting.   I want to thank the U.S. Soccer Foundation for putting this together  and for their great fundraising. The important thing is the U.S. Soccer  Foundation raised tremendous amounts of money for youth soccer.   That is what we want to do. We want to make youth soccer more  prevalent  [[Page H4377]]  and more readily accessible for all our youth. It teaches teamwork, and  it is good for physical conditioning. You learn about following the  rules and taking orders from the coach. It is great for growing up and  learning how to be a more responsible adult.   So it is a great team that put this together.   I appreciate all the Members who played. We also appreciate the staff  members as well as some of the professionals who came out to help bring  in more people.   We worked together as a team to bring the World Cup to North America  here in the future. We are proud of that.   Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Larsen for being a great teammate.
