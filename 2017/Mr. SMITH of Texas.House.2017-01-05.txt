 Mr. Speaker, you may have heard about this new  phenomenon called fake news. Fake news usually consists of false and  made-up stories. Actually, it is not new and it has been around as long  as there have been media.   What is new is that a few liberal media organizations are going to  label news stories suspect if they feel the stories are not true. This  should be of great concern to anyone who believes in free speech.   It works this way: nearly half of all Americans get information from  Facebook. Facebook has now decided to let liberal media like ABC News  and the Associated Press determine whether news is fake or not. This  represents the liberal mindset that the media know better than the  American people what is good for them.   A better idea is to trust the American people and let them determine  what is real news and what is not. The American people will learn to  discern the good from the bad if the media stops telling them what to  think.                            ____________________
