 Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge my colleagues to join  me in overriding the Presidential veto of H.J. Res. 76.   Last night, we took a historic vote for racial justice, the Justice  in Policing Act. Time and again, Congress takes votes, votes like this  one that will soon be forgotten in the media, but these are the votes  that quietly perpetuate the systemic inequality and racism in our  country. That is what this vote today is about.   Communities of color, minority and low-income students, and veterans  are preyed upon by predatory for-profit schools. They are manipulated.  They are lied to and they are defrauded.   Because we, the Federal Government, did not do enough to prevent that  fraud, we established the borrower defense rule as part of the Higher  Education Act as a way to give these students a path to justice and  relief. But the Department of Education not only rewrote that rule  to make justice for our students virtually impossible, it is also  failing to hold these predatory schools accountable for their actions.    Time and time again, we tell young students in this country education  is  [[Page H2550]]  the answer, and they believe us. But that system failed them. The  system failed my constituent, Kendrick Harrison, a brave Iraq war  veteran, a father, and a Black American.   Kendrick and his family were left homeless after his for-profit  school blew through his GI benefits and convinced him to take out  $16,000 in debt right before shutting their doors. He is fighting to  this day and working as hard as anyone to get his life back on track.   I promise this story is not an exception. There are over 350,000  students just in recent years who were lied to, manipulated, and  defrauded by predatory schools.   So I ask my colleagues: Are you going to stand with these students?  Are you going to stand with the system that perpetuates inequality and  holds down brave Americans like Kendrick? Are you going to let these  for-profit schools wreak havoc on the lives of these students and take  advantage of American taxpayers?   Because it is us, American taxpayers, who foot the bill for these bad  actor schools because the Department of Education refuses to hold them  accountable.   I am ready to take a stand against this broken policy, and I need you  to stand with me. Take a stand for the very communities who have been  rising up in this country.   These protests over the last several weeks are about police  brutality, but they are about so much more. They are about decisions  that we make in this body that perpetuate inequality and continue to  stack the deck against Black Americans, student veterans, students in  poverty, and working people who are just trying to better themselves.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote to override the President's  veto. It is time to take a stand.                                time  1200
