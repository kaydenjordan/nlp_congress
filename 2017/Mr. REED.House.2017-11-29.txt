 Mr. Speaker, I rise today and join my colleagues. The  Republican and Democratic men and women stand together here on the  floor of the House to join in the recognition that when it comes to  sexual harassment and sexual assault across America, we say ``no  more.'' We say ``enough is enough?''   Yes, this is a step--a small step in the right direction, but it is a  legitimate step for us to reflect those that we represent across  America and saying to the issue that have impacted all of us, my family  included, when it comes to sexual harassment and sexual assault, we  stand together as Americans and in this body to declare that no more  shall sexual harassment and sexual assault be allowed to exist in our  society.   I applaud my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for doing this and  the leadership they have demonstrated on this issue once and for all.
