 Mr. Speaker, I, likewise, am deeply grateful for  your leadership in putting this together.   Mr. Speaker, this is a call for our entire country to come together.  This should not be something that is wrapped up in partisan politics.  We are talking about securing our border. Securing our border. Right  now, we have a discharge petition to save title 42, unfortunately  Democrats are refusing to support that discharge.   I am calling on them tonight to come on, to sign on to the discharge  and let's save title 42. This is in defense of our country and in  defense of our national security.    Mr. Speaker, there are zero, to my knowledge.    Mr. Speaker, I am calling on them tonight--we  are calling on them tonight to sign it. This is a national security  issue. What is the problem here? It makes no sense to me. We have no  Democrats that have signed on to this discharge petition.   As you mentioned, we are now watching--and Mr. Good from Virginia as  well--we are watching now the numbers soar to the point of more than  doubling the maximum that we have had in the years past. In year 2000  we had 220,000 apprehensions, and now it is going to soar over 500,000.  We are sitting back here in the people's House doing nothing about it.  We are responsible as the governing body of this country to defend our  borders.   Right now, because of the surge that is taking place, Mr. Speaker, we  are having Customs and Border Protection agents who are now being moved  to process these illegal individuals. There are ICE agents who are  being moved to process these individuals coming across our border.   The U.S. Marshals are leaving the various places around this country  where they are serving to go to our southern border to try to help with  this crisis that has no business even being a crisis. Now, we have all  these agents who are not even doing their job because they are  processing illegal individuals coming across into this country.   Now, we hear that DHS is calling on other Federal Government agencies  to  [[Page H4572]]  provide doctors. I don't know about you, but I don't know of many  agencies in the Federal Government who have doctors. Where are they  going to come from? Perhaps the Department of Defense. Certainly, there  are some doctors in the VA.   Let's say those doctors go to the southern border, then what happens  to our veterans who now are lacking doctors to serve them? None of this  makes any sense, and it leaves our entire country in a very vulnerable  position.   Mr. Speaker, I would just say that border security is an enormous  component to national security, and if we do not have secure borders,  we do not have a secure Nation. I am calling on our Democrats today to  sign on to the discharge petition. Let's save title 42. For crying out  loud, let's defend our borders and get over the partisan politics and  do the right thing and defend our borders.                                time  1945
