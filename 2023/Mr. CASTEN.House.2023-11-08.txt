 Mr. Speaker, we operate on a September 30 fiscal year.  Here we are 39 days later, and the majority has yet to even propose a  way to keep the government open.   Last September, they kicked the can down the road and kept the  government open for 45 days. In the words of Mr. Santos, that made you  all ``big mad.'' You fired your Speaker. You have a new Speaker. A lot  of you are still big mad. Instead of working, we are sitting here this  week debating nonsense.   Here is an example. Lots of American companies operate overseas.  Outside of the U.S. Republican Party, climate change is real, which  means that U.S.  [[Page H5550]]  companies have to comply with scientifically informed policy.   The Biden administration is appropriately trying to help develop U.S.  climate reporting rules that are also scientifically informed to  minimize the hassle of multijurisdictional reporting.   The Republican response to that is big mad. Today, we are voting on a  bill that would defund the ability of regulators to develop consistent  climate accounting rules instead of doing the work of the people.   Mr. Speaker, science is real. We have real challenges. Please stop  being big mad.                            ____________________
