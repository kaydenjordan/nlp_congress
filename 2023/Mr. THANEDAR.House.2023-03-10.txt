 Madam Speaker, I stand today to speak about the  importance of uplifting small businesses in our country.   About 50 percent of U.S. GDP is generated by small businesses.  Despite this, big corporations seem to always rake in big profits  during economic hardship, while small businesses struggle to get by.   As a result, small business owners barely have enough leftover funds  after payroll to reinvest into their businesses.   As a former small business owner, I know firsthand the difficulties  these hardworking men and women face. Today, entrepreneurs, especially  women and minorities, find it hard to get access to capital. I am  calling for targeted programs to provide access to capital for Black  and Brown communities for businesses led by veterans, the disabled, and  women across this country.                            ____________________
