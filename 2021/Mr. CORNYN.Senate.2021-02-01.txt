 I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum  call be rescinded.    Madam President, President Biden built his campaign for  the Presidency around a theme of unity, the promise that he would work  to heal the deep divisions that exist in our country and restore  respect and bipartisan communication. He has consistently pointed to  his decades in the U.S. Senate as proof of his understanding and his  ability to achieve results--and for good reason. Senator Biden had a  record of working across the aisle and brokering bipartisan deals, but  so far, at least, the actions of President Biden have run counter to  his image as a pragmatic dealmaker.   Let's look at the first big test, which is coronavirus relief. This,  of course, has been the main focus of the Senate for nearly a year now.  We passed several bipartisan bills, ranging from far-reaching,  multitrillion-dollar packages to smaller, more targeted bills, and  every single one received overwhelming bipartisan support. Make no  mistake, the path to getting those bills signed into law was not easy.  The Republican-controlled Senate and the Democratic-controlled House  had very different ideas about the size and shape of those bills, but  we managed to overcome those differences and provide trillions of  dollars in relief to support our response on both the healthcare and  economic fronts.   President Biden has made COVID relief a top priority and laid out a  framework for a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, which  includes everything from bipartisan priorities, like funding for  vaccines, to partisan ones, like slush funds for blue States.   I don't support the President's proposal in its current form, but I  do believe that it is a good place to start to kick off bipartisan  negotiations. I also believe that before we rush out and throw  trillions of dollars--I should say more dollars--at this problem, we  need to see how what we have done is already working. In fact, it was  only a month ago when we passed our last COVID-19 relief bill with big  bipartisan votes, and that money is not even out the door yet.   As we look to the future, I had high hopes that we could continue  this trend of working together. After all, that is the idea the  President ran on--bipartisanship, deal making, and reaching across the  aisle to build consensus.   President Biden knows the rough and tumble of the legislative process  very well. He helped broker many compromises during his career and  promised to use that experience to restore bipartisanship in  Washington. But that is not what the early days of this administration  have looked like, not even close.   Our Democratic colleagues kicked off the year with threats to  eliminate the filibuster. We know the filibuster is the single biggest  safeguard of the minority in the Senate, whether it be Republican or  Democrat, because it requires--indeed, it forces--bipartisan compromise  in order to advance legislation   For the past 6 years, as the minority party, our Democratic  colleagues have proudly filibustered bill after bill. They have blocked  the Senate from considering legislation on everything from coronavirus  to justice reform, to border security.   Make no mistake, Republicans were frustrated. It is frustrating to  have the majority and not be able to get what you want. But the  integrity of the filibuster and its ultimate purpose was never called  into question, even though Leader McConnell faced calls from many-- including President Trump--to toss it out the window.   But in this new reality of a 50-50 Senate, the Democratic leader has  so far not been interested in playing by the existing rules. He wants  an easy, compromised-free path for the Democratic radical agenda, and  he is prepared to go full-scorched earth to make it happen.   Senator Schumer has threatened to eliminate the legislative  filibuster and subject the country to the chaos that a majority-ruled  Senate would create. The difference here, of course, is that Leader  McConnell stood up to those in his own party who called for this.  Senator Schumer so far has led us to believe that he will not do the  same.   Fortunately, the Senators from West Virginia and Arizona, Senators  Manchin and Sinema, have vowed not to participate in this dangerous  exercise. And it is clear--or it should be clear, but I will  emphasize--that this is not for the benefit of the minority party. This  is for the benefit of the Senate as an institution and the country as a  whole.   With the elimination of the filibuster off the table, because at  least two Democratic Senators will not vote to eliminate it, Senate  Democrats have found a new opportunity to break the rules, ignore  precedent, and pave a path for partisan legislation. If the reports can  be believed, our Democratic colleagues are preparing to abuse the  budget reconciliation process to ram President Biden's coronavirus  relief proposal through the Senate. This is a process designed as a way  to enact certain fiscal policies in a budget resolution--things like  spending reductions, tax relief, or tax increases.   Unlike the traditional legislative process, which is used for the  majority of the bills that move through the Senate, there is no 60-vote  threshold when you use budget reconciliation. But that doesn't mean you  can or you should fast-track partisan legislation. In fact, our  predecessors have warned us against that.   One of the most influential Senators in protecting this budget  reconciliation process was Robert C. Byrd, the longtime Senator from  West Virginia. He was the architect of the now so-called Byrd rule,  which is used to keep the reconciliation process from being used to  circumvent the normal legislative process. In short, he wanted to  prevent the process from being abused in the way Democrats appear to be  preparing for now.   The referee in all of this is the Senate Parliamentarian, a  nonpartisan expert adviser on Senate rules and procedure. Folks on both  sides of the aisle know and respect our Parliamentarian and the people  who work with her. We respect their guidance to understand the rules of  the Senate and ensure that both sides are treated fairly.   The most senior Member of this Chamber, the President pro tempore,  once said:         I've been here with many, many parliamentarians. All were       good. But she's the best.    Throughout modern history, Senate Parliamentarians have advised the  Senate on which provisions can and cannot be included in a budget  reconciliation bill based on the application of the Byrd rule. In fact,  the Parliamentarian gives it a process known as ``a Byrd bath.''   While the majority party technically has the power to determine  whether or not to accept the Parliamentarian's advice, there has never  been much of a question about whether to do so or not.   Think about this. It would be like allowing a batter in the World  Series to ignore the umpire's balls-and-strikes call and treat every  pitch as if it were a ball. I am sure it is no surprise, then, that the  last time either party ignored the Parliamentarian's ruling was 1975-- nearly 50 years ago. Since then, both Republicans and Democrats have  understood the dangers of such reckless action and have respected the  advice of the Parliamentarian, even when it punches a hole in their own  legislation.   But if reports are to be believed, it looks like our Democratic  colleagues may be preparing to break precedent once again. With the  filibuster--legislative filibuster--still intact, our Democratic  colleagues are no doubt considering a plan to shove President Biden's  massive coronavirus relief bill through the Senate using  reconciliation, and that plan involves ignoring  [[Page S210]]  any adverse rulings from the Parliamentarian. Over the last several  decades, Senators on both sides have refrained from such a dangerous  move because of the precedent it would set.   Here is another instance where, despite pressure from some in my  party, Leader McConnell refrained from eliminating the legislative  filibuster. He knew how detrimental it would be to the U.S. Senate as  an institution.   Basically, what we are hearing now about budget reconciliation and  considering eliminating the Byrd rule is essentially a backdoor method  to eliminate the filibuster and push the most partisan, controversial  measures through with only a simple majority.   In 2001, Senator Byrd said: ``Reconciliation was never, never, never  intended to be used as a shield for controversial legislation by  depriving Senators of their rights and their duty to debate and  amend.'' But that is precisely what our Democratic colleagues are  reported to be considering now--to overrule the advice of a nonpartisan  adviser to the Senate so they can deprive Senators of their duty and  ability to debate and amend legislation.   I urge our colleagues not to go down this road. After all, you would  have thought they learned a lesson now that the shoe is on the other  foot when it comes to nominations and the filibuster.   In 2013, then-Majority Leader Harry Reid went nuclear and eliminated  the 60-vote cloture requirement on judicial nominees--something  distinct and different from a legislative filibuster but applied to  nominees. Leader McConnell told our colleague from Nevada at the time:  ``You'll regret this, and you may regret this a lot sooner than you  think.'' And as it turned out, he was right.   As our colleagues now know very well, the Republican-led Senate  confirmed more than 230 judges who were nominated by President Trump,  all thanks Harry Reid's rule change. This action cleared the way to  eliminate the 60-vote cloture threshold on Supreme Court nominees,  which lead to the confirmation of three Supreme Court Justices during  the Trump Presidency.   There are inherent and perhaps unintended consequences of changing  the rules in a place where your power is never permanently guaranteed.  Chipping away at the rights of the minority may help you now, but you  are sure to regret that someday, just as Democrats now regret the day  Harry Reid cleared an easy path for hundreds of conservative Federal  judges.   There are a few ways to stop this madness before Democrats head down  this dangerous path. The first is for President Biden to intervene and  warn Senate Democrats not to break the rules by ignoring decades of  precedent.   We are less than 2 weeks in a Biden Presidency, which was won on the  promise of working together. President Biden consistently pointed to  his experience as a U.S. Senator as evidence of his ability to reach  across the aisle to get things done. This will be his first test. Will  he urge Senate Democrats to pursue a bipartisan approach to  legislating, or will he give up on his single largest campaign promise  less than 2 weeks into his administration?   The second option is for our Democratic colleagues to speak up.  Senators Manchin and Sinema stood up to the Democratic leader when he  threatened to eliminate the filibuster. As I see it, this is no less  dangerous.   Whatever precedent you set or break when you are on one side will  affect you when you are on the other side, which you, inevitably, will  ultimately be.   If Democrats destroy the budget reconciliation process now, it will  clear the way for them to pass a progressive agenda with absolutely  zero need for Republican votes. That could include everything from  Federal funding for abortions to heavyhanded climate policies. And when  Republicans ultimately find themselves in the majority, all of these  policies could be eliminated with a party-line vote and replaced with  new laws.   This is a dangerous and unnecessary road to go down, and our  Democratic colleagues have a duty, I believe, as Members of this body,  to respect its rules and respect the Senate as an institution. The  Senate should not replace the Byrd rule with Harry's rule.    I would like to once again share some wise words from our late  colleague Senator Byrd, who was known as a master of the Senate rules  and process and procedure. Not long before his death, he spoke in a  Senate Rules Committee hearing about the importance of protecting  minority rights--something the Senate has been known for. Oddly enough,  the current Democratic leader was presiding at the time. Senator Byrd  said:         As I have said before, the Senate has been the last       fortress of minority rights and freedom of speech in this       Republic for more than two centuries. I pray that Senators       will pause and reflect before ignoring that history and       tradition in favor of the political priority of the moment.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
