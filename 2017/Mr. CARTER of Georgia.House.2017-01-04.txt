 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr.  Jimmy Burnsed, who has served as chairman of the Bryan County Board of  Commissioners for the past 12 years.   On December 31, 2016, he officially retired from serving on the  board. Beyond serving as chairman, Mr. Burnsed has dedicated an  admirable amount of his life to public service. Nearly 40 years ago, he  began serving on the City Council for Garden City, Georgia, before  serving 4 years as mayor. In 1989, he moved from Garden City to Bryan  County. In 2005, he ran and was elected chairman of the Board of  Commissioners.   Mr. Burnsed's accomplishments on the board since that time are  numerous. He worked to build a new administrative building for the  county to hold meetings and other events; he managed and planned the  infrastructure for Bryan County, which has grown more than 50 percent  in size during his tenure; and he helped to upgrade Bryan County's  trails, parks, and recreation centers. Mr. Burnsed always put the  community first and performed his duties in a way that would make any  constituent very proud.  [[Page H59]]    Jimmy Burnsed, you will be greatly missed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  72, the GAO Access and Oversight Act of 2017.   The GAO is one of the most important tools taxpayers and Congress  have to keep the Federal Government accountable. Without complete  information, GAO is limited in their ability to prevent waste, fraud,  abuse, and mismanagement.   This bill clarifies that GAO has access to data, such as the National  Directory of New Hires, which will better equip GAO to audit key  Federal programs on behalf of taxpayers. Every day, GAO handles the  government's most sensitive information in a responsible manner, and  GAO provides trusted recommendations for improving the Federal  Government's operations.   The Federal Government reported $137 billion in improper payments in  fiscal year 2015, the largest ever reported. Total improper payments  for the Federal Government over the past 10 years exceeds $1 trillion.  This bill will increase the effectiveness of GAO to help reduce  improper payments, dollars that could be used to better fund the  programs that ultimately serve the people. This bill takes an important  step forward by providing GAO with an additional tool to ensure GAO's  effectiveness in preventing fraud, waste, and abuse.   I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.
