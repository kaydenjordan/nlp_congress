 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak in strong support of  reauthorizing the Family Violence Protection and Services Improvement  Act. As a survivor of intimate partner violence, I can tell you that  this piece of legislation is so very important.   For 37 years the bipartisan Family Violence Prevention and Services  Act has supported survivors of domestic violence and their children.  FVPSA helps local governments and service providers prevent violence.  It protects families and victims in their most vulnerable moments. This  time around, FVPSA has strong components of culturally specific  programs, underscoring the sad truth: that victims from all communities  need support.   This reauthorization comes at a critical time for State and local  organizations in this space. The COVID-19 pandemic has not only led to  an increase in domestic violence, it has also led to budget cuts for  many organizations which work to combat violence.   Whether it is in the House of Representatives or the house next door  or my house, we must always speak out against the harmful effects of  violence, especially against women.   Madam Speaker, let's pass this bill. We will keep working for a  future free from domestic violence and intimate partner violence.
