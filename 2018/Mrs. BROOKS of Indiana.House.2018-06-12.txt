 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my  colleagues to pass H.R. 5329, the Poison Center Network Enhancement Act  of 2018, a bill that reauthorizes the national network of poison  control centers, as we have heard, that offers free, confidential,  expert medical advice 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.   We heard during an Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee hearing  that this past summer the Georgia poison control center was the first  public health entity to detect and respond to a deadly opioid outbreak  where yellow pills were being sold, stamped with the brand Percocet  that, in fact, contained substances chemically similar to fentanyl.  Without calls to poison control centers to report this drug, these  pills could have gone undetected indefinitely.   Poison control centers are fielding almost 192 cases a day of opioid  abuse and misuse. In 1 month alone, there were 9,039 opioid exposures  related to poison control centers nationwide. They are essential in  combating the opioid crisis because these are the centers that compile  the data that can be used to discover hotspots for opioid abuse and  misuse and save lives.   I want to thank all my colleagues, especially Representative Engel,  Representative DeGette, and Representative Barton, who have been strong  voices, as well as Chairman Walden and Ranking Member Pallone, for  supporting this and so many other impactful bills.   On behalf, most importantly, of the 1,526 Hoosiers who have died of  an opioid overdose in 2016, I want to urge my colleagues to pass H.R.  5329.
