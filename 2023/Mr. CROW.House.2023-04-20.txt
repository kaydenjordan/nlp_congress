 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the victims of the  horrific mass shooting that occurred at Columbine High School in  Littleton, Colorado.   Twenty-four years ago, 12 teenagers and 1 teacher went to school and  never came home. I stand before you all today and ask: What has changed  since Columbine?   Two weeks before his death, one of the victims expressed concern to  his dad about America's gun laws. He asked his dad about the loopholes  in the Brady Bill that allowed individuals to obtain guns online or at  gun shows. His life was taken from him by a gun purchased through one  of those loopholes.   The gun show loophole remains open to this day. Gun violence in this  country is the worst it has ever been. Our children fear going to  school every single day, and Republicans in Congress refuse to take any  steps to protect them.   Americans have had enough, and I have had enough. We can and must do  more to protect our children and our communities from gun violence. We  must ban assault weapons and ensure these weapons of war are  inaccessible to the general public.   As Members of Congress, we have a responsibility to act to stop these  tragedies from occurring all over our country.                            ____________________
