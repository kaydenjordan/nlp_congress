 Mr. President, I grew up in a wonderful small town in  Louisiana called Zachary.   Now, today, Zachary is a city. It is five times larger than in the  days I spent there growing up because Zachary, a number of years ago,  got very serious about improving elementary and secondary education.  The Presiding Officer knows something about that. So Zachary is much  larger today, and if anyone ever doubts that growth and economic  development is centered around quality public education, all you have  to do is look at Zachary.   But when I grew up in Zachary, it was very small--one stoplight. We  were so small, we didn't have a town drunk; several people had to take  turns. But I loved it. I loved Zachary High School. You know, some  people did not like high school. I am not one of them. I cared about  two things: basketball and cheerleaders. And I wasn't very good at  either one, but I had fun trying.   I also loved baseball, in part because my dad, my late father, was a  baseball fan. And I was an OK fielder in baseball, but I had to quit  the sport because I couldn't hit a curve. I was OK with the fastball,  but I couldn't hit a curve. And I remember my coach telling me:  Kennedy, keep your eye on the ball, OK? Keep your eye on the ball.   And I tried, but I just couldn't do it.   My purpose in rising today is to suggest that we should keep our eye  on the ball. We are faced with many difficult issues in the Senate  today. We always are, but I think that is especially true today. My  colleague Senator Cornyn just talked about one: immigration. Of course,  the war in Ukraine is on everyone's mind. And I could go on and on and  on.   But I don't want my colleagues to forget about one of the most  important issues of all facing the American people today, and that is  the cost of living in our extraordinary country--inflation. In my  State, the median household income for a family of four is about  $55,000. That means half of our families make more and half of our  families make less. But the mean is $55,000 for a family of four.   As a result of President Biden's inflation--and, as an aside, I would  note, I say this with no joy whatsoever--inflation in America today is  manmade, and that man's name is President Joe Biden. In my State, where  the mean household income is $55,000, the average American family is  paying $800 a month more--a month; not a year, a month more--to live in  this wonderful country as a result of Bidenomics. That is $9,600 a year  that a family of four making $55,000 a year has to find.   And my people, they have maxed out their credit cards, and they have  spent their savings. And they borrowed money, and they have had to take  money out of their children's 529 college savings program. It is  strangling my people. It is not any better in other States.   I looked at the numbers this morning. What we call overall inflation  right now is about 3.7 percent. Core inflation, if you take out food  and energy prices, as many of the economists like to do, is 4.3  percent. So 3.7 percent overall, 4.3 percent if you take out food and  energy. Now, we are doing better. A year ago, those numbers were  double. And I am so pleased that inflation has fallen just a bit, but I  want you to understand what that means.   Falling inflation just means that prices--they are still rising, but  they are not rising as fast as they were. Let me say that again.  Falling inflation just means prices are still going up every month,  every day, but they are not going up as fast as they were. We call that  disinflation. Falling inflation also means that prices overall are not  going down. That is deflation. My point is, even though inflation is  falling--and I am so glad it is--all that means is that prices are not  going up as fast as they were.   And we are going to be stuck with these high prices. They are going  to be permanent, even if inflation goes to zero. What does that mean?  Well, let's look at basic goods. Even if inflation goes to zero  tomorrow, since February of 2021, electricity is up 24 percent. We are  stuck with that. When inflation falls, electricity is not going to go  back down to where it was. We are going to continue to pay 24 percent  more. And gas--in Louisiana, gas is up 71 percent. We are stuck with  that, even if inflation falls to zero. Eggs are up 28 percent; potato  chips are up 28 percent; bread, 28 percent--permanent--coffee, 30  percent; rice, 28 percent; flour, 29 percent; milk, 17 percent; ice  cream, 20 percent; chicken, per pound, 24 percent. And that is why the  American people, in large part, are struggling so economically.   You should not have to sell blood plasma in America, the wealthiest  country in all of human history, in order to go to the grocery store.  It is not any worse, our inflation--which I am afraid these high  prices, as I said, are going to be permanent. It is not any better if  you look at necessities by category. All goods--as a result of  President Biden's inflation, starting in February of 2021 and running  through today, all goods are up an average of 17 percent.   How many American families have seen their income go up 17 percent?  Not many. Food--all food, average--an average--is 19 percent. Housing  is up 16 percent. Clothing is up 10 percent. Used cars and trucks are  up 32 percent. And even if we can get inflation down to zero, we are  going to be stuck with those prices. New cars are up 20 percent.  Mortgage rates are up 161 percent.   Let me end as I began. We have a lot of issues that we are struggling  with right now, but among the five things that moms and dads in America  worry about when they lie down to sleep at night and can't is the cost  of living in our wonderful country.   And these are the people who made this extraordinary country. America  is not great because of the Federal Government. America is great  because of ordinary people doing extraordinary things--people who just  get up every day, go to work, obey the law, pay their taxes, and try to  do the right thing by their kids.   President Biden's inflation is strangling a free people. The American  people deserve better. And I don't want us to lose sight of that fact  as we grapple with other important issues.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
