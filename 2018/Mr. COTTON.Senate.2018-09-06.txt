 Madam President.   The ACTING PRESDIENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arkansas.                            ____________________     Madam President, I speak in support of the nomination of  Dominic Lanza to be a district judge for the District of Arizona.   Dominic is my old friend and law school classmate and, maybe most  importantly, intramural basketball teammate, when he was known as  ``Dom'' or perhaps ``The Dominator.''   Now, I can't claim the credit for Dominic's nomination. He has the  highest qualifications, and his whole life has prepared him for this  moment to be a U.S. district judge. Dom graduated with highest honors  from Dartmouth in 1998, where he was also an All-Ivy League and  Academic All-American offensive lineman on the Dartmouth football team.  He received the Barrett Award for being the outstanding graduate of his  class in achievement, character, and leadership.   In law school together, he excelled, graduating with honors, serving  as a member of the law review.   He went on to clerk for Judge Pam Rymer on the Ninth Circuit Court of  Appeals. For 5 years, he worked in private practice with Gibson Dunn &  Crutcher in their constitutional and appellate law practice, and won  awards for his pro bono work.   For the last 10 years, Dom has served the people of Arizona and the  people of this country in the U.S. attorney's office from the District  of Arizona. As an assistant U.S. attorney, from 2008 to 2012, he  prosecuted over 300 defendants for a wide variety of crimes, including  immigration offenses, drug trafficking, and public corruption.   He authored more than 20 appellate briefs and argued more than 11  cases in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. From 2012 to 2015, he  served as chief of the district's Financial Crimes and Public Integrity  section, and he is now the chief and executive assistant U.S.  attorney--the No. 2 position in the district--where he oversees the  Phoenix office.   Dom said that the most important lesson he has learned in his time at  the U.S. Attorney's Office is the need to represent the facts and the  law fairly and accurately to the court and opposing counsel. He has  also learned the necessity of treating everybody involved in the legal  process--from judges to jurors, support staff, opposing counsel, and  parties--with courtesy, dignity, patience, and respect.   Dom has volunteered in the Court Works Program, in which students  from at-risk schools perform simulated trials. He participated in the  Veterans Court Program, which provides increased support and guidance  to Federal criminal defendants who are veterans.   Dom participated in, completed, and received the highest marks from  Senator McCain and Senator Flake's judicial nomination panel. He now  has the support, as well, of Senator Jon Kyl. I commend all three men  for an outstanding selection.   As I said, I can't take credit for Dom's nomination, but I can  perhaps add a little bit of perspective to the kind of judge he will be  from the man I knew on the basketball courts.   Dom was tough. If you were driving to the basket or fighting for a  rebound, you did not want him in your way.   Dom was fairminded. If he fouled an opposing player or knocked a ball  out of bounds, you would get no argument from him. He would admit that  he knocked the ball out of bounds or that he had committed the foul,  and play would go on.   I would say Dominic was even-tempered, something of a gentle giant.  When tempers flared on the basketball courts at Hemingway, as they, in  retrospect, did too often--and over silly matters--Dom was a  peacemaker, separating those who might otherwise be in an altercation.   Dom was a team player. When it was time for him to take the shot  because that is what the team needed, that is what he would do, but he  was just as happy to pass the ball off, to set a screen, to box-out for  a rebound.   Dom was good-natured--competitive to be sure, but he understood that  in the grand scheme of things, we were all just a bunch of washed-up  high school and college athletes enjoying a few hours off from our  studies.   These are all traits that are going to put him in the best position  possible to deliver justice not only for the people of Arizona but for  the people of the United States. Everyone who comes before him is  fortunate that Dominic Lanza will soon be a district judge.   For 42 years, Dominic has been known as Dom or the Dominator, but in  just a few hours, he will be known as Your Honor. Few men, by their  character and by their lives, better deserve that title than the  Dominator, Dominic Lanza.   Madam President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
