 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 335 because  there is a consistency 4 years ago when I rose in support of a previous  general. But when I look at General Lloyd Austin, I see a qualified  individual, in my opinion, and I see somebody worthy of the Senate  considering. But I also see that, in fact, we are setting a precedent.  Sixty-seven years, we didn't. Two administrations in a row, we have.   I strongly recommend today that the Armed Services Committees in both  bodies begin the process of looking at what the true length of time  should be and what exceptions and exemptions need to be there.   Although General Austin is a very qualified individual, he still will  have subordinates whom he helped promote. He still will have people  whom he is extremely close to. And that creates a question of civilian  leadership.    So although I am not here today to speak in any way against the  general or any way against his predecessor, General Mattis, I am saying  that it is time for this body, after this vote, to move to a  deliberative process and regular order and begin asking: Is 10 years  right? Is 7 years right?   If 1 year is right, what will be the requirements for that individual  before we again face that with some future highly qualified former  military person?
