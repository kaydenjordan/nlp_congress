 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize International  Holocaust Remembrance Day. Together, we must all honor the millions of  lives that were lost to the unspeakable atrocities committed by the  Nazi regime.   The Holocaust claimed the lives of over 6 million Jews and millions  of other residents of Europe. It was one of the most horrific genocides  to ever occur on our planet, perpetrated by an evil and twisted group  of fanatics.   The horrific violence and campaign of death that the Nazis waged on  all fronts is a stark reminder of the fragility of human life and the  importance of defending it.   My district, New York's 17th District, is home to one of the largest  per capita Jewish populations in the United States. On this day, in  particular, my heart and thoughts are with them as we remember those in  our own community who have lost loved ones during the Holocaust.   We must all recommit ourselves to confronting anti-Semitism wherever  it rears its ugly head and continue to work toward a safer and brighter  future for all.                            ____________________
