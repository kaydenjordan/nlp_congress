 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember and  honor the life of Mr. Roger Boatright of Alma, Georgia, who passed away  on May 8.   Roger was a remarkable man of great courage, leadership, and depth,  and I had the honor and privilege of knowing him well.   Roger retired from the Georgia State Patrol as a trooper first class  and was a faithful member to his church and numerous community  organizations, such as the Bacon County Exchange Club; the Bacon County  Hospital Authority; and the Georgia Municipal Association, to which he  served as president.   When Roger was elected as a council member for the city of Alma in  1986, this paved the course of his life of service to his community.   A few years later, Roger was elected mayor of Alma, where he  faithfully served 14 years. In 2009, he was elected chairman of the  Bacon County Board of Commissioners and later returned to serve as a  council member for the city of Alma.   While tremendously improving his city as mayor, he was appointed to  the board of the Georgia Department of Community Affairs before he  became chair of this statewide board.   Roger was truly a pillar in his community, which is why he was  rightfully rewarded various accolades.   Although Roger had a passion for service and loved his community  deeply, he loved his family more than anything.   I am thankful for the lasting impact Roger had on so many, including  myself, and I know his legacy and influence will remain for years to  come.   My thoughts and prayers are with all who worked with him, knew him,  and loved him. Southeast Georgia has lost a great man.                            ____________________
