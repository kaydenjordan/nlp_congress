 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate Officer Glenn  Anthony Doss, a Detroit police officer who died while serving in the  line of duty.   Officer Doss, who joined the police force nearly 2 years ago, was  answering a call when a gunman opened fire and shot Officer Doss in the  head before he could get out of his patrol car. He was immediately  rushed to the hospital, but, unfortunately, he died on Sunday, January  28, 2018.   Officer Doss is what we call an American hero. He did what any police  officer does the moment they put on their uniform and go out and serve  their community with courage and honor, knowing that even the smallest  interaction may put their life in harm's way.   Officer Doss followed in his father's footsteps who has been a member  of the Detroit Police Department for nearly 20 years.   I want to say God bless his memory, his family, his friends, and the  Detroit Police Department for the work they do. He had a 9-month-old  child.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Evans for his strong  representation of his constituents of the Second District of  Pennsylvania and his leadership and support of civil rights.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address racial inequality with America's  wealth gap. As we continue to celebrate Black History Month, we  remember victories such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting  Rights Act of 1965, and the Fair Housing Act of 1968. We can look back  and celebrate these victories that brought us closer to the American  principle of liberty and justice for all.   But the fight for equality, fairness, and justice continues. I am  proud to stand with my colleagues of the Congressional Black Caucus to  call for true economic justice for the Black community. Still, today,  Mr. Speaker, in 2018, Black people in America have to earn a high  school education, a high school diploma, and complete some time in  college to catch up to the wage of White high school dropouts.   The Black-White wage gap is larger today than it was in 1979. This  tragic truth does not affect Black men and women the same. Since the  year 2000, young Black women have been hit the hardest. However, the  racial wealth gap is even greater. The average wealth for White  families is seven times higher than the average wealth for Black  families.   Mr. Speaker, with facts like this, no wonder many find it difficult  to stand and applaud President Trump's belief that there is a trend of  lower Black unemployment rates. Lower unemployment rates does not  address this imbalance of wealth and opportunity, and backward policies  do not deserve our cheers.   When we have an administration that puts forth policies that would  eliminate programs to support minority businesses, drain the Black  labor pool by doubling down on the war on drugs and mass incarceration,  put forth a tax plan that gives billions to corporations and the  wealthiest while leaving crumbs for the hardworking middle class, Mr.  Speaker, this does not deserve our applause. Certainly, under this  administration, African Americans and minorities have a lot to lose.                                time  2000    We heard that often during the campaign: ``What do you have to  lose?''   Today, this administration is surprised we are not standing and  applauding.   A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. The strength of  America is at its best when we are all strong.   Mr. Speaker, that is why this fight from the Black Caucus--we are  raising our voices--this isn't just about Black America; this is about  America. We are a country that the stronger each and every one of us  is--regardless of our race, our religion, or where we came from--if we  are in America and we are Americans, if we are all strong, the United  States of America is strong.   Equality is smart economics, and justice for all is our American way.  [[Page H770]]  Today, we stand and call on this administration and this Congress to  fight to make America strong, to make America the best it can be. We  call for equality and we call for economic justice for all.    Mr. Speaker, let me use the example of mass  incarceration.   In my State and in this budget in Congress, we are constantly cutting  programs for education. In America, if you do not educate a child,  their choices are very limited. Statistics have shown that the lower  the education, the higher the rate of incarceration.   I will share with the gentleman that if we truly want to reduce the  cost of mass incarceration, if we truly want a workforce that is  trained and available to address economic opportunities and invest in  technology, and ensure that we are paying taxes and growing our tax  base, it will be more efficient to invest in education.   But, instead, we systematically, with budgets and cutting funds,  empower the prison system, while at the same time create a disadvantage  for people who then become what we so often hear: a burden to society,  social welfare, and all these other things.   When you create the opportunity to provide leadership to say, ``We,  in America, understand an educated American is an economic advantage,''  and we have systematically ignored that--we sit here as if every child  in America is getting equal education--it is not a reality. It should  be an outcry from every CEO in America. All of these corporations are  getting billions of dollars in tax cuts.   Instead of saying, ``Oh, do you know what, we are going to open up a  new factory,'' or ``We are going to do this,'' they should say that in  conjunction with, ``We are going to make sure that every child who is  our customer, every community will be able to improve the educational  system.'' Because the larger our work base, the more powerful our  corporation and our economy becomes.   Why do you think these corporations go overseas and say they have to  go to other countries to get workers?   And, excuse me, you don't see the reality slapping you in the face  when you have these children who are not educated, and you have school  systems that don't have adequate books and technology to allow this  child to reach their highest potential?   That is a weak link.   And this America that says that we are one of the best economies in  the world, we are being attacked every day because our workforce is  diminishing because we are not providing education that is competitive  with other countries.    Mr. Speaker, when you have what we call the working  poor--they are going to work every day--think about a mother who is  raising a family. She is not asking for a handout. She is actually  going to work every day. Some of them are working two jobs and still  cannot provide the basics of food, shelter, and clothing for their  children. And then when she says, ``I need help,'' they say, ``Oh,  these handouts, this social welfare these people are asking for,'' when  these are people who are working every day to achieve the American  Dream, not to have luxuries, but to have the basics, the minimum wage  is a beginning. But you tie that to education. We must address that.   Many of these individuals, who have never committed a crime--they are  not criminals, they are not bad people--they did not get the education  that prepared them, and now they are working, they are trying, they are  pursuing the dream of: ``If I work hard every day, if I do the work and  show up and be a good employee, I will be able to provide for my  family.'' That is not a reality. In America, we should be ashamed of  ourselves to have people working and still considered poor in America.
