 Madam President, I recognize Zachary Daniel Zampella, who,  after 12 years of serving the people of Florida in the U.S. Senate, has  moved on to new opportunities. I thank him for his years of hard work  with my office.   Zach began his time with my office as a caseworker specializing in  military and veterans administration issues before becoming my regional  director for Southwest Florida in 2012. He returned to my Orlando  office in 2015, serving as deputy director of constituent services.   During his time with my office, Zach mentored several of my staffers,  played a key role in my Constituent Services Department and disaster  relief efforts, and drafted office correspondence. He also assisted  veterans with their issues pertaining to the Department of Veteran  Affairs and worked with other various Federal, State, and local  government agencies.   In 2017, he assisted residents affected by Hurricane Irma, working  our Recovery Assistance Center events held in the hardest hit cities  across Florida. In 2018 and 2019, he made several trips to the  panhandle region after Hurricane Michael's devastation. He walked door- to-door to assist constituents and provided valuable assistance in the  region.   Zach grew up in Orlando, FL, graduating with his bachelor's degree in  history and master's degree in business administration from  Southeastern University in Lakeland, FL. After graduation, he interned  for Senator Mel Martinez, later joining his staff in 2008. He also  worked for Senator George LeMieux before joining my staff in 2011.   Zach's work for my constituents for my office made a real difference  over the years. I am grateful for his dedicated service to the people  of Florida and extend my best wishes to Zach on his future endeavors.                            ____________________
