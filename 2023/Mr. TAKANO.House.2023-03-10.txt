 Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank a member of my staff  on the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs for his invaluable service  to our Nation's veterans, this Congress, and our country.   Daniel Santa Cruz joined our committee in 2020 as our digital  director. From the outset, he demonstrated an outstanding technical  ability and tremendous creative vision. He proved instrumental in  helping the committee meet the new digital demands of the COVID-19  pandemic; developed, produced, and directed thousands of hours of  compelling video content; created graphical representations of our work  for social media platforms; and captured powerful images of committee  members hard at work for America's veterans across the world and in our  Nation's Capital.   His charm, humor, and generosity have been infectious, and his  commitment to the work of this committee has been incredibly impactful.   The work of my committee, this Congress, and our government to honor  and support our veterans was made better by Daniel's service, and he  will be deeply missed.                            ____________________
