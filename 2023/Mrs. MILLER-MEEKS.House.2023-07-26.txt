 Mr. Speaker, as a physician, I believe that we  must support and utilize available medical breakthroughs. That is why I  am proud to co-lead the Treat and Reduce Obesity Act, legislation that  would provide a direct line to chronic weight management medications  for Medicare recipients struggling with obesity.   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, obesity  is prevalent in over 40 percent of adults aged 60 and older. The  National Institutes of Health attributes obesity to an increased risk  for health problems such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart  disease, stroke, liver disease, and certain cancers.   This bill would assist those struggling to lose weight and would help  decrease comorbidities associated with obesity. I urge my colleagues to  support this important bill.                   Accelerating Access to Care for Children     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  Accelerating Kids' Access to Care Act.    Iowa's First District is blessed to have the University of Iowa Stead  Family Children's Hospital, and this bill would allow out-of-State  children to access our top-tier clinical trials, specialists, and care  teams.   Currently, children enrolled in Medicaid or the Children's Health  Insurance Program must have an out-of-State care team be screened by  their home State's Medicaid program, even though the providers have  already been screened and enrolled in their own State program. This  causes delays and can cause a child's condition to worsen, putting  their lives at risk.   This legislation would streamline the process by allowing providers  who treat children and are in good standing to enroll in multiple State  Medicaid programs for a period of 5 years.   As a mother, physician, former director of the Iowa Department of  Public Health, and a Congresswoman, I understand the duty to care for  our children's health, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.           Remembering Burlington Police Department K9 Officer Paco     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember Burlington  Police Department's K9 Paco.   K9 Paco served with the Burlington Police Department for nearly 2  months and was in the process of being trained for assignment as our  second K9 unit with K9 Handler Officer Gallegos.   K9s are specifically trained to help members of our law enforcement,  and their keen sense of tracking and detection are invaluable for  officers.   This is a sad day for the Burlington Police Department, and I will  continue to keep the Burlington Police Department and Paco in my  prayers.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding to  me.   This week or very soon we will be voting in support of H.R. 4368, the  fiscal year 2023 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug  Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act.   Supporting Iowa's farmers and rural communities is especially  important as one in five Iowans work in the agricultural industry. This  bill has many highlights that do just that. It continues very critical  investment in agricultural research, rural broadband, and animal and  plant health programs. It prevents the purchase of agricultural land by  foreign adversaries and directs the USDA to focus hiring efforts on  State and county offices to assist producers and rural communities.   Additionally, it reins in harmful regulations that dictate how  poultry and  [[Page H4020]]  livestock producers raise and market their animals. That is especially  important to Iowa due to the fact that we are the number one hog  producer in the country and in the top ten producers for both cattle  and turkey.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill.   Another bill that we have taken up is H.R. 4366, Military  Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies bill.   The Department of Veterans Affairs' mission, as listed on their  website, is to fulfill President Lincoln's promise to care for those  who have served in our Nation's military and for their families,  caregivers, and survivors.   As a 24-year military veteran and a family of military veterans, that  mission is one that I wholeheartedly agree with, and I understand the  importance the VA has for so many former servicemembers in our Nation.                                time  1930    Very importantly, this bill provides $299.496 billion for the  Department of Veterans Affairs. It fully funds the healthcare programs,  fully funds veterans benefits and VA programs, and also includes  funding for electronic health record modernization initiatives.   Most importantly, what I would like to point out is, in contrast to  what the Secretary of the VA said earlier this year when he politicized  the VA by sending emails to veterans service organizations, saying that  the Republicans were going to cut funding, this cuts no funding to  veterans or veterans benefits. That still remains on the VA's website  and should be removed, and an apology should be issued.   The appropriations bill that the House Republicans passed this week  fully funds the VA and prohibits the use of funds for anything that is  not beneficial to running a smooth and efficient Department.   Veterans in my district are experiencing enough struggles accessing  care from the VA. The President's politicization of the Department is  not alleviating those concerns.   We did the right thing by passing this bill, and I am proud of the  Republicans for both cutting spending and fully funding our veterans  benefits.
