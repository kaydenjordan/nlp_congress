 Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of my amendment to  add the first six titles of the Protecting America's Wilderness and  Public Lands Act and, also, Congresswoman Leger Fernandez's bill to  protect the Cerro de la Olla in her State to this year's NDAA bill.   Taken together, this amendment will preserve more than 1.6 million  acres of public land across Colorado, California, Washington, and New  Mexico and will add more than 1,000 miles of river to the national wild  and scenic rivers system.   Preserving these pristine, untouched wilderness lands is about more  than just protecting our environment. It is about protecting our  economy, our way of life, and ensuring our Nation's top military pilots  have the space they need to train.   Among the areas that would be protected under this measure are some  of our Nation's most important military training grounds, including the  high altitude aviation training sites in Colorado where some of our  Nation's most elite helicopter pilots train to take on some of the  harshest environments anywhere on this planet.   The areas to be protected under this amendment also play a key role  in combating the climate crisis which the Pentagon itself has deemed a  preeminent threat to our national security.   The designations in this bill were not drawn from a hat. They are the  product of decades of work, and that is why this amendment has  widespread support from every single area where that is included in  this bill. That is why this Chamber has taken steps to pass it not  once, not twice, but four times now in just the past 2 years alone  including as a part of last the 2 years' NDAA bills.   Taking on the fight against the climate crisis and ensuring our  Nation's military pilots have the space they need to train for some of  the world's most difficult environments is something all of us should  be behind.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this important  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, let me just clear up a few of the pieces of  misinformation that have come out about this bill tonight. The first  one is that the HAT, the high-altitude training I talked about which is  used by the military, is not supported by pilots.   Actually, the Colorado National Guard has issued a statement of  support of this legislation because we do protect those training areas,  and it is very important--it has been important ever since  Afghanistan--to do that.   The second thing I want to talk about is that all of the economic  studies have shown that more wilderness actually creates more jobs. So  for people who are in rural communities in remote areas, when there is  wilderness around them, the growing and new economy in the West is for  more jobs in recreation and other industries.   Last but not least, the portion of this bill that is in my State of  Colorado, the Colorado Wilderness Act, which is my bill, is about  660,000 acres. Those acres are almost all currently wilderness study  areas. All the wilderness study areas are currently managed by the BLM  as if they are wilderness.                                time  0210    These claims that are being made that there are going to be new  fires, that there are going to be new problems, that is simply not  true. We are taking something that has been a reality in those areas  for 40 years and simply making it permanent so that our children and  our grandchildren can enjoy those wonderful areas, so that we can  stimulate the recreation economy, and so that we can protect those  lands for preservation and for helping to address the climate issue.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
