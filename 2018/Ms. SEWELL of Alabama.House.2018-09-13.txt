 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember the  55th observance of the bombing of 16th Street Baptist Church in  Birmingham, Alabama, and to commemorate the lives and legacy of four  precious little girls--Addie Mae Collins, Denise McNair, Carole  Robertson, and Cynthia Morris Wesley--who were murdered during that  devastating attack 55 years ago.   On September 15, 1963, at 10:22 a.m., the four little girls were  getting dressed in the bathroom downstairs in the church, preparing to  sing in the church choir. The morning of the bombing, some 200 church  members were in the building getting ready for the 11 o'clock service.   When the bomb detonated on the church's east side, it caused the  interior walls of the church to cave in and sent mortar and bricks  flying from across the front of the church. Most of the parishioners  were able to evacuate the building as it filled with smoke, but the  bodies of four little girls were found beneath the rubble in the  basement restroom.   The bombing was a racially motivated act of terrorism, Madam Speaker,  orchestrated by four suspected members of the Ku Klux Klan. As part of  the attack, the men planted 19 sticks of dynamite outside the basement  of the church.   Along with the murder of the four little girls, a dozen other people  were injured, including Sarah Collins Rudolph, the younger sister of  Addie Mae Collins. Sarah had been in the basement with her sister and  the other girls getting ready for church--yes, getting ready for church  service.   The attack would later be described by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,  as one of the most vicious and tragic crimes ever perpetrated against  humanity.   As the day continued, thousands of African Americans protested,  gathering in scenes across the State. Governor Wallace, at the time,  soon called in the police to break up the protests. Dozens of people  were arrested, and two young Black boys were also killed that day:  Johnnie Robinson, 16, and Virgil Ware, 13. Robinson was shot by a  police officer, and Ware was killed by two White youths within hours of  the bomb detonating.   Following the attack, several people were suspected, but no one was  immediately brought to justice. It wasn't until 14 years later, in  1977, when then-Alabama Attorney General Bob Baxley reopened the case  and the investigation began to make headway. Eventually, Klan leader  Robert Chambliss was finally brought to trial and convicted of the  murders.   It would take another 20 years before the other Klansmen accomplices  were brought to justice. It was then-U.S. Attorney Doug Jones who  brought justice, leading to the convictions of Thomas Blanton and Bobby  Cherry.   The events that took place in Birmingham, Alabama, on September 15,  1963, became a major catalyst for the civil rights movement. The loss  of four young girls was not in vain for, you see, we got the passage of  very important historic civil rights legislation because of their  sacrifice: the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of  1965.   Today, as we continue to seek justice and equality for all people,  Madam Speaker, we must appreciate just how far we have come. Every gain  in the battle for civil rights has come at a high cost, paid for by  those who believed in a vision and a dream bigger  [[Page H8175]]  than themselves. In order to see results, we must continue to fight,  further their legacy and their work each and every day.   On a personal note, it is never lost on me that I get to walk the  Halls of Congress today because four little Black girls lost their  lives, so they can't.                                time  1015    It is humbling and inspiring to know that my very presence in this  institution was because of the personal sacrifice of others. I was  honored that my first bill to pass Congress was to pay tribute to Addie  Mae Collins, to Carole, to Cynthia, and to Denise posthumously, when  the Congress of the United States gave a Congressional Gold Medal in  2013 on the 50th anniversary of their deaths.   I want to thank Pastor Price and the amazing congregation of 16th  Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, who tirelessly keep the flame and  memory of this tragic incident alive and preserves this historic church  for future generations.   Madam Speaker, on behalf of the Seventh Congressional District and  the State of Alabama, I ask my colleagues to join me in remembering the  55th observance of the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing and in  honoring the life and legacy of four little girls, Addie Mae Collins,  Denise McNair, Carole Robertson, and Cynthia Morris Wesley.   The events 55 years ago shaped the future of our Nation and continues  to have a lasting impact on our quest for equal justice and our pursuit  for a more perfect union.                            ____________________
