 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, as spring begins, daily new cases of  COVID-19 have dramatically decreased since the height of Omicron.  Hospitalizations, thank God, have steadily declined. Across the  country, Americans are able to remove their masks as the spread of  disease seems to be lessening. Crucially, schools are open, and we need  to do everything we can in our power to make sure they stay open.   All of these signs point in a positive direction. The country is  turning the corner on the COVID pandemic. We are in a new moment of the  fight.   But we also are at a crossroads. Either we act now to secure the  progress we have made, or we risk backsliding if another contagious  variant emerges in the fall and winter. Just as we cannot allow COVID  to rule our lives, neither can we fall into a false sense of  complacency.   That is why the White House has requested that Congress include $22.5  billion in additional COVID relief funding in the upcoming spending  bill, and Congress should follow through with this request over the  coming days. If not, we risk sliding back if another variant occurs.   This morning on CNBC, former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb reminded  viewers of the key aspect of this disease. To paraphrase him loosely,  cases can drop in the spring and summer, but the risk still exists for  another wave to surge in the fall or winter. He is right. We all know  this from sad experience.   We also know what we must do to be ready. We know a lot more now what  to do to be ready than we knew a year ago. If we want to keep our  schools open, if we want to keep life as close to normal as possible,  if we want to be ready for the possibilities of future variants,  Congress must provide the resources needed before a new variant  arrives. That is the surest way to minimize cases, hospitalizations,  and deaths in the future.   Let me repeat. To keep schools open, to keep life as normal as it can  be, we need additional COVID investments now, not after a possible new  variant arrives.   Remember, by now, all public health funding provided by the American  Rescue Plan has run out. If Congress waits until a new variant arises  to pass new funding, it will be too late.   And we are happy to make clear with our Republican colleagues about  how this money is dedicated. The White House has already provided an  explanation about how COVID money has been spent over time. Some  Republicans may think it should have been spent differently, but the  point is that  [[Page S962]]  it has been spent. We can't pull those dollars back, and we need to  provide new funding for possible variants.    Where has the COVID money been spent thus far? It has gone to  vaccinate 215 million Americans. It has been used to keep schools open,  to expand treatment, and to provide 1.2 billion vaccines to other  countries.   Last night, Acting OMB Director Shalanda Young sent Congress a 12- page letter detailing what the new funding would do: more vaccines for  children, bolstering our testing supply chain, therapeutics, and more.   If there is one thing both parties should be able to agree on it is  that we should not shortchange the American people on vaccines, on  testing, or on therapeutic medicines that greatly reduce the severity  of the illness if you are able to take them and if we have the supply.   Again, Congress must include new funding for COVID relief to ensure  our schools and our communities face minimal disruption in case another  variant comes, and we should do it ASAP. The most logical place  immediately to do it is in the upcoming omnibus bill.                                  Inflation    Mr. President, on another matter, on costs to the American people, in  the coming months and beyond, Senate Democrats will maintain a focus on  one of the most vexing issues facing American families: lowering costs  while building on the wage and job growth we have seen over the past  year.   The American economy is booming compared to a year ago. The number of  new jobs added to the economy is staggering. We have added more than 6  million new jobs in a single year, including the most--the most--new  manufacturing jobs in decades, but at the same time, we must fiercely  confront the wave of rising costs resulting from COVID's worldwide  disruptions. This is the biggest economic challenge that our country  must focus on right now.   Later today, at our DPCC lunch, at the request of Chair Stabenow, FTC  Commissioner Lina Khan will join us to shine a light on the troubling  pattern of corporate price hikes in the areas of oil and gas,  prescription drugs, and other goods.   This dimension of inflation cannot be ignored. Americans are being  asked to pay more at the grocery store, at the pump, and for basic  goods even as they watch incredulously as some of the Nation's biggest  corporations post their most massive profits.   In many instances, these profits resoundingly exceed prepandemic  figures. Last fall, Bloomberg noted that U.S. corporations outside of  the financial industry reported the biggest margins since 1950--since  1950--71\1/2\ years ago. It appears corporate profits are far outpacing  inflation, and they are spending much of the profits on things like  corporate buybacks, which are hitting record levels. So Americans are  being asked to pay more, but many mega corporations are making a  killing. That is a twisted thing to see as we recover from COVID.   Democrats are working right now on a number of proposals and ideas  that would ease the pressure Americans are feeling from rising costs.  We must lower the cost of insulin to $35 a month. We must make all  prescription drugs cheaper. We need to help make groceries more  affordable. We need to look at fixing ocean shipping bottlenecks.   I will also add that one of the best things we can do to fight  inflation is to confirm President Biden's nominees to the Federal  Reserve. I urge in the strongest terms possible for Republicans to drop  their holds on these members. The Federal Reserve is so crucial for our  economy right now, and to intentionally delay their confirmations is  irresponsible.   Most importantly, we must boost manufacturing, American  manufacturing, and decrease our reliance on overseas producers. The war  provoked by Putin is an illustration as to why this example is  important.   President Biden's State of the Union made clear that the United  States remains strong and ready to face the immense challenges of our  time, but to maintain that edge, we must focus like a laser on  addressing costs. That is what Democrats will keep doing.   Another thing we are doing today, that is happening today, is a  hearing in the Commerce Committee on shipping costs and a bipartisan  bill by Senators Klobuchar and Thune that will help reduce those costs.  Shipping costs affect every American. Any good that comes from overseas  has to be shipped here.                                  H.R. 3076    Mr. President, on the post office, Democrats have been working all  week with Republicans to push the biggest postal reform bill in years  over the finish line, and, today, we are close. Today, we continue  negotiations with the other side on their proposed list of amendments  to the bill.   As we continue to work on a deal, I filed cloture last night on the  postal bill in order to keep the momentum going. At the end of the day,  the vast majority of Democrats and Republicans wants to see this bill  sent to the President's desk quickly, so I hope we can arrive at an  agreement to finish before the weekend.   I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their  continued work, especially Chairman Peters and Ranking Member Portman.   This postal reform bill has been a long time coming, and when passed,  it will ensure that tens of millions of Americans who rely on the post  office every single day for medicines, Social Security checks, and  other goods can make sure that the post office remains in good hands  and is strengthened.    Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act                                  of 2021    Mr. President, finally, I want to close by noting, this afternoon,  President Biden will sign into law bipartisan legislation ending forced  arbitration for sexual assault and sexual harassment.   All of us have heard the searing testimonies--searing--of those who  have faced harassment or abuse at work, only to discover their jobs  offered precious little in accountability. Countless careers have been  derailed or undone. Worse still, countless lives have been forever  damaged. For decades, workplace practices like mandatory arbitration  have perpetuated cultures of abuse and unaccountability.   We can't ignore a basic reality of these clauses: They deprive  victims of sexual harassment and assault of their basic rights by  mandating that they seek remedy only behind the closed doors of private  arbitration, with no other alternative. With the President's signature  today, that will come to an end.   I want to thank Senator Gillibrand for leading the fight for years,  and I am glad I was able to work with Senators Graham and Ernst to push  this bill over the finish line.   By the end of today, we will be able to say: The Senate acted; the  House acted; the President acted; and now forced arbitration reform is  law.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I will be brief as I conclude.   Mr. President, as our country turns the corner on the COVID-19  pandemic, we stand at a crossroads. We can either take steps to keep  America ready in case new variants arise--and the odds are high they  will arise--or we can backslide and undo everything we have done, at  great cost, to get our country closer to normal.   Today, the Senator from Kansas is advancing a proposal that would  precisely handicap the Biden administration's ability to fight the  pandemic and heighten the danger that all our progress is suddenly  unraveled in the future. We have learned how to fight the pandemic; we  are better at it; this undoes it for some kind of ideological reason.   This proposal to hinder our COVID preparedness is as damaging and  risky as it is unnecessary, and it should be voted down. It is going  nowhere if it passes.   The national emergency declaration, which this proposal would  immediately terminate, has been one of the most powerful and best tools  for mobilizing the Federal Government to combat the pandemic. It has  made it easier to acquire medical supplies, to provide resources for  healthcare works, and has helped cut redtape under the Defense  Production Act. It has also offered student loan borrowers critical  relief by clearing the path for suspending student loan payments--a  lifeline for tens of millions. Do we want that undone?   Just as it looks like we are turning the corner, why on Earth would  Republicans risk bungling it all by crippling America's ability to  remain prepared for the future? The best way to ensure that we keep  schools open and cases low is by staying at the ready, and that is what  these emergency powers enable us to do. We don't know if new variants  will come or not, but if they do, they can appear with frightening  speed, and we need to be prepared.   By prematurely terminating the national emergency declaration on  COVID, it will be harder to ensure we have enough supplies, enough  support for healthcare workers, and risks throwing tens of millions of  student loan borrowers into needless uncertainty and anxiety. It is a  wrong move. I will vote against it today.   And I ask for the yeas and nays.                             Vote on S.J. Res 38
