 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Kentucky for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I particularly want to recognize Mr. Yarmuth's  extraordinary leadership as the ranking member on the Budget Committee.  As we all know, budget should be a statement of our national values.  What is important to us as a nation should be reflected in how we  allocate our resources.   Again, it is a statement of values, and who better to manage all of  that in this Congress of the United States than Mr. Yarmuth, who brings  his values and his heartland priorities to the budget process, and I  thank him for the leadership he has provided.   Sadly though, I rise in opposition to what the Republicans have  proposed which is a devastating Republican budget. The first step in  the GOP's dangerous plan to fast track their immoral tax framework is  to hand trillions of dollars to the wealthy while raising taxes on  working American families.   The Republican budget and tax plan cruelly rig an unfair system even  further against hardworking Americans. It cuts a raw deal for families  in every corner of our country. Democrats have a better deal, better  jobs, better pay, better future.  [[Page H8252]]    But right here, before our eyes in this House, Republicans are  replacing the great American ladders of opportunity with the silver  spoons of plutocracy and aristocracy. Their agenda raises taxes on the  middle class. That is a fact. Tens of millions of middle class families  will pay higher taxes, including a heavier burden for State and local  taxes.   It might be interesting to our distinguished colleague, Mr. Scalise-- and isn't it a joy to see him in debate on the floor--in his State of  Louisiana, 458,000 people will pay an average of nearly $7,000 more by  losing their deduction.   And Congresswoman Black, from the great State of Tennessee, in her  State, 573,960 people will lose their deduction, around $5,600 a filer.   Not only that, if that isn't bad enough for assaulting the dream of  homeownership in our country by attacking the deduction, this plan that  the Republicans propose has been estimated to reduce the value of  people's homes by 10 percent. You not only are paying more money in  order to give a tax break to the wealthy and to big corporations, you  are reducing the value of your home, and, by the way, your neighbors'  homes as well.   So with all of the unfairness in it, the one that is most  understandable to people directly is how it affects them. And in that  case, 44 million Americans will pay more because of what the  Republicans have in their plan.    So it raises taxes on middle class, particularly with the State and  local tax deduction removed. And by the way--another by the way--if you  are a corporation, your deduction is not removed, just if you are an  individual filer, so again, an advantage to corporate America at the  expense of America's working families.   Next, it borrows trillions from the future to give tax cuts to the  wealthiest. Eighty percent of the tax cuts in this Republican proposal  goes to the wealthiest 1 percent; 80 percent goes to the wealthiest 1  percent at the expense of America's working families and children. The  budget on the floor today reveals the true cruelty behind the  Republican's tax plan. What words would be best to use it? It is  looting the middle class, massive looting of the middle class; rip-off  of the middle class, because there are many middle class people.   So you take some money from all of those middle class people and  those who aspire to it so that you can give a lot of money to the few.  That is a big sucking up of assets from the middle class to the  wealthy. That is what they are here for. It is in their DNA: trickle- down economics. It is in their DNA. That is what the Republicans come  here to do, and that causes a deep addition to the national debt.   They are supposed to be deficit hawks, but I think they have become  an endangered species because they don't seem to care that, with the  cuts that they are taking, the tax breaks they are giving to corporate  and wealthy America will cost over $2 trillion--not counting service on  the national debt which would take it closer to $3 trillion additional.   That is a very hard road to come back from. And as our distinguished  ranking member has pointed out, the opportunity cost in the budget,  whether it is a trillion dollars from Medicaid, half a trillion dollars  from Medicare, funds taken from education, the seed corn of America's  preeminence in the world. Why? To give a tax cut to the high end.   And they will say: Oh, well, the growth will come from this. We will  pay for that.   It never has; never has. Don't take it from me. Bruce Bartlett, who  was one of the orchestrators of the supply-side economics said: We  never said it paid for itself. Anyone who says it does, it is not true.  It is nonsense.   He went even further to call it BS.   As I said, it ransacks Medicare and Medicaid, adding trillions to the  debt in tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy, looting the middle  class, shaking down the middle class, ripping off the middle class,  increasing the taxes of the middle class.   It devastates vital investments, as our distinguished ranking member  said, in good-paying jobs with higher wages for working families, the  education of our children, the health of our working families. It  really is a good example of what they say that Medicare should wither  on the vine. In keeping with their trickle-down economics, Medicare  should wither on the vine because they will take half a trillion  dollars from Medicare in their budget that will follow.   So Republicans will harm veterans, rural America, seniors, and  children, again, all in the name of fast-tracking trillion-dollar tax  breaks for the wealthiest 1 percent. What more do you need to know?  Eighty percent goes to the wealthiest 1 percent.   Again and again on the floor, the Republicans have tried to tilt the  playing field against hardworking families. This is really quite  remarkable though. This is a great transformative moment for America  where we can reject this assault on the middle class, this addition to  the national debt, and instead, say: Let's go to the table and work in  a bipartisan way to truly reform our Tax Code so that we can be  competitive in the world; so that families can thrive, and that they  can have the deductions that are fair for them and needed, and not  taken away from them, but not taken away from corporate America. So we  stand ready to go in a bipartisan way to work to do this.   Any tax cuts, because this isn't just tax cuts to the rich--that is  not tax reform--any tax cuts, any agenda like that has to be bipartisan  in order for it to be sustainable. So let's come to our senses here.  Common sense says--well, mathematics says, if you take a lot of money  from many people to give it to a few, you are exacerbating the  disparity of opportunity equity income in our country.   This is the wrong thing to do. It is not what our values are about.  It is really a shame that they would even bring such a document to the  floor. Anybody who lives in a district where their deductions, the tax  deductions for State and local taxes, are taken away from individual  filers, but not for corporations, as the bill determines, to the tune-- and I can read you all of the statistics across the country about how  devastating this is--as our own Governor said: How could they do that  to our State or any State without the department of finance of our  States saying: Wait a minute. Understand what this does to the economy  of our State. Understand what this does to our individual filers in our  State.   Who said that this document that came over from the Senate should  have such a devastating impact on States and Members coming to the  floor and endorsing it. Some say: Oh, I am just voting for the budget,  but it really isn't what it--no. No. You are putting your name next to  taking the deduction of homeownership and of State and local taxes away  from your constituents. They are going to know that. I would rather you  reject this. We don't want a political argument. We want to protect the  American people.   That is why I hope everyone here would come down in favor of the  middle class and reject this assault, this rip-off, this shakedown of  the middle class that the Republicans have on the floor.                                time  1030
