 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the omnibus appropriations bill. As  the ranking member on the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug  Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee, I  would  [[Page H3293]]  like to take a few moments to highlight a few areas in the bill's  agriculture section.   This has been a long time coming, beginning with a markup over 1 year  ago in April 2016. Since then, many things have changed, but what has  remained constant is the desire of the House Agriculture, Rural  Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies  Subcommittee to address the needs of rural America by adequately  funding programs that serve them and the country.   While the total funding level is below 2016 and the House-reported  bill, I believe we used what we had wisely. For example, we secured  increased funding for agriculture research, food and plant health  programs, the Farm Service Agency, and for rural development.   The bill also expands telemedicine, broadband access, and STEM  distance learning, as well as provides $400 million in Community  Development Block Grant funding for disaster assistance.   In rural development, which is central to rural communities and the  economies vital for producing America's food and fiber products, the  bill provides $37 billion in direct and guaranteed loans to support  clean water, decent housing, telecommunications, electric services, and  rural businesses, which is more than we provided last year.   On the grant side, water and waste grants are more than 10 percent  higher than the President's budget request, broadband grants are more  than three times higher than 2016, and community facility grants are 25  percent higher than the 2016 request and what was appropriated.   All the domestic nutrition programs, Mr. Speaker, are funded at  levels that will fully meet estimated needs for the rest of the fiscal  year. FDA is funded above both FY16 and FY17 requests.                                time  1500    However, for the third consecutive year, I am disappointed that  Congress continued to keep the Commodity Futures Trading Commission at  $250 million, making it increasingly difficult for the CFTC to carry  out its core mission as well as its responsibilities under Dodd-Frank.   I am very disappointed the omnibus does not include carefully crafted  cottonseed legislation to assist American cotton producers. I am  looking forward to beginning FY 2018 reviews and farm bill negotiations  to close the remaining gaps left with the FY 2017 omnibus.   Despite those concerns, I think this is a good bill. As a proud  Representative of the largest cotton-producing district in the State of  Georgia and the number one peanut- and pecan-producing district in the  country, I urge my colleagues to support it so that we can get started  on FY 2018 work and complete it in a timely manner for the benefit of  our fellow Americans.   I want to thank the ranking member, chairman, and the majority and  minority staffs for their bipartisan, hard work in getting this bill to  the floor, along with my personal staff, particularly Ms. Ada Bacetty,  who worked so hard.
