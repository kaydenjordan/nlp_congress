 Mr. Speaker, on February 14, 2018, my community hit the  depths of despair when 17 innocent people were slaughtered at Marjory  Stoneman Douglas High School. The families from Stoneman Douglas who  lost loved ones have committed themselves in so many ways since to help  get us to this moment. For them, the families of Uvalde, Buffalo,  Newtown,  [[Page H5909]]  and so many families that we all have had the opportunity to get to  know, this day is about them.   But I finish with this: on the day after Parkland, there was a rally  in the park near the school. The field was covered with high school  kids who came to express themselves. One of them came up to me, still  with a look of shock in her eyes. She grabbed my arm, and she said:  Congressman, my best friend bled out on me. You have to do something.   Today, we do.   Mr. Speaker, vote ``yes'' to support this legislation.
