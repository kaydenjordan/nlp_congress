 Madam Speaker, pursuant to the order of the House of  December 16, 2019, I call up the bill (H.R. 5430) to implement the  Agreement between the United States of America, the United Mexican  States, and Canada attached as an Annex to the Protocol Replacing the  North American Free Trade Agreement, and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on H.R. 5430.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   This vote today, Madam Speaker, is a reminder that, even while the  House was working on a serious matter regarding the President's  accountability for abuses of office, we were still working hard to  deliver on our promises to the American people to focus on economic  opportunity, and in this instance we were working together.   This USMCA agreement before us is a vast improvement over the first  version shown to us by President Trump and his team. We worked  together, and it now includes critically important changes offered by  Democratic members in order to ensure that its enforcement mechanisms  are stronger, that it protects American workers, and that it will help  lower prescription drug costs and improve access to medications.   This agreement, Madam Speaker, will also remove some of the  uncertainty created by the tariff policies that have been pursued by  the President.   I am glad that our House Democratic working group was able to secure  new provisions to ensure that America's trading partners uphold the  rights of workers to unionize and bargain collectively. And I am glad  that this agreement includes strong, rapid-response enforcement  mechanisms that will allow us to block imports produced in facilities  where these commitments are violated.   I, and this Congress, will be closely monitoring the enforcement of  this new agreement to make certain that the administration is doing its  job and workers' rights are protected.   I thank Speaker Pelosi, Chairman Neal of the Ways and Means  Committee, and Ambassador Lighthizer, who represented the  administration in his straightforward, honest way. Their hard work and  negotiations with the White House to improve on the administration's  initial draft were successful.   I thank, as well, the members of the Democratic working group who  spent months working alongside the Speaker and chairman to fight for  the provisions necessary to secure House support.   This agreement, Madam Speaker, is truly the product of bipartisanship  with many victories for Democrats, of which all Americans can be proud,  and obviously, victories for Republicans, as well. I hope we can  approve it today with a strong, bipartisan vote of support.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, following the vote on the passage of H.R.  5430, Members are advised that there will be no more votes in the House  until January 7.   Madam Speaker, I want to wish all Members of this House, their  staffs, and all the employees of this institution, on whom we rely so  much and who do so much for us and for our country, a happy holiday  season with their family and loved ones and with their neighbors.   May God bless our country.                            ____________________
