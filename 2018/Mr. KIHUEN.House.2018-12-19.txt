 Mr. Speaker, today, I stand before the House to thank the  people of Nevada's Fourth Congressional District. It has been the honor  of my life to serve as a Member of Congress and represent my  constituents in the 115th Congress. I have worked tirelessly on their  behalf every single day to make Nevada a great place to live and raise  a family.   As many of my colleagues know, I was not born in this country. I  don't come from a wealthy or politically connected family. My family  emigrated from Mexico when I was 8 years old. My parents, a housekeeper  and a former farm worker, came to America because they knew that, if  they worked hard and sacrificed, in America, they could achieve the  American Dream.   Less than 30 years later, thanks to the wonderful opportunities that  only this country has to offer, their son is standing before you as a  Representative of the United States of America. That is the American  Dream.   There are still so many people who have hopes and aspirations of  achieving that American Dream. Unfortunately, under this  administration, immigrants have been denigrated. Before even being  given a chance, they are labeled as criminals and murderers.   But America is a Nation of immigrants and the land of opportunity. As  the first Dreamer and one of the first two former undocumented  immigrants to serve in Congress in our Nation's history, I have used my  personal experience to fight for other Dreamers so that DACA recipients  are able to remain in America and thrive.   I have fought to ensure that our asylum process is upheld and that  young, innocent children are not separated from their families at the  border. I have advocated for comprehensive immigration reform.   My Democratic colleagues and I have also fought relentlessly to  protect people's healthcare and the Affordable Care Act, especially as  Republicans have tried time and time again to get rid of preexisting  conditions.   I was proud to announce my support for the Medicare for All Act  because healthcare is a human right, and all Americans deserve quality  and affordable healthcare.   I joined my union brothers and sisters in championing workers'  rights, fighting for a $15 minimum wage, the right to join a union, and  equal pay for women.   I fought against the unconstitutional travel ban, fiercely defended  funding for Planned Parenthood, and stood side by side with our LGBTQ  community in the fight for full equality.   As a member of the Financial Services Committee, I have fought to  keep people in their homes and advocated for affordable housing and the  immediate need to address homelessness in America.   I was proud to join the Nevada delegation in standing strong to fight  against efforts to bring nuclear waste to Yucca Mountain. Yucca  Mountain is not safe and should remain closed forever.   I introduced the STEP for Veterans Act, which would provide grants to  community colleges to train veterans with the job skills that employers  need in their communities. Although we can never do enough to thank our  veterans for their sacrifices, I am proud of the work that I did to  help them get the resources they need and deserve.   Mr. Speaker, one of the worst days of my life and in many of my  constituents' lives was last year on October 1, 2017, when Las Vegas  became the site of the deadliest mass shooting in modern American  history. In total, 58 innocent lives were lost.   While they are gone, I wanted to make sure that their memories were  not lost. That is why I told each of their 58 stories here on the House  floor, so that their precious and vibrant lives would be remembered and  never forgotten.   I am optimistic that the House will finally pass meaningful  legislation next year to prevent more tragedies from happening.                                time  1230    Lastly, Mr. Speaker, I thank my team who worked tirelessly day in and  [[Page H10276]]  day out to deliver services to hundreds of Nevadans. I relied on them  every day to do my job, and I couldn't have done it without them. I am  profoundly grateful and forever grateful to each and every one of them.   Thank you to my colleagues for making my time as a Member of Congress  unforgettable. I made so many friends here, friendships that will last  a lifetime.   Thank you to all the staff in the House of Representatives, including  the floor staff, the cleaning crew, the kitchen staff, all of you whom  I enjoyed many great conversations with.   Thank you to my family and friends for all of your unconditional  support.   Thank you, once again, to my constituents for putting your faith and  trust in me. I am blessed and honored to serve you and grateful for the  opportunity to give back to the State and country that has given me and  my family so much.   (English translation of the statement made in Spanish is as follows:)         Thank you to the people of Nevada for your support and the       opportunity to serve you in the U.S. Congress. I will always       fight for you.         Muchas gracias a toda la gente de Nevada por su apoyo y por       la oportunidad de servirles en el Congreso de los Estados       Unidos. Simpre luchare por ustedes   Mr. Speaker, may God bless Nevada and may God bless the United States  of America.
