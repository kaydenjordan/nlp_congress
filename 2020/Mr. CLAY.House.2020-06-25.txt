 Mr. Speaker, our Nation has reached an inflection point in  our history. Our country is demanding change after four centuries of  systemic racism toward African Americans.   The Members of this body must listen and respond to the millions of  Americans who want this country to correct course and move toward the  Constitution's promise of equal justice under the law.   Your neighbors, friends, children, and grandchildren are demanding  that we pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act and subsequently  move forward in a comprehensive way to erase the stain of racism on  this Nation existing since Africans first were brought ashore.   This is the moment. History will judge us by our actions today, at  this pivotal moment. Future generations will look at this moment and  wonder, when you had the opportunity to stand and guide our country in  its ongoing quest to be a more perfect union, the question will be  asked: What did you do? You can, today, begin to make right the many  wrongs perpetrated upon people of color and ensure our country lives up  to its great promise.   So we must get to yes. Vote ``yes'' on this legislation to improve  the quality of life for people that are as American as any one of you.   As video evidence has clearly shown, African Americans are still due  all the rights and privileges granted by the 14th Amendment.   In the words of the Missouri poet Langston Hughes:       I swear to the Lord      I still can't see      Why democracy means      Everybody but me.      I, too, am America.
