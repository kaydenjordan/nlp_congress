 Mr. Speaker, over 13,000 people in the United States  have died from gun violence this year alone. Let me repeat that: Over  13,000 people in the United States have died from gun violence this  year alone, and it is only April. This means that over 100 people are  dying by gunshot every single day.   We have to take action to stop this epidemic. We have to address the  scourge of gun violence and the multiple reasons that we find ourselves  here almost every single day having the same conversation.   People should be able to ring the wrong doorbell accidentally or  drive into the wrong driveway without the fear of being shot. We cannot  continue to glorify guns while vilifying and frightening our fellow  Americans. More guns are not the answer. Improving public safety and  supporting our law enforcement will make us safer and can help change  public sentiment so that people will stop seeing guns as solutions and  our neighbors and each other as threats.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to please work together on finding  our common ground with actual solutions to gun violence. The American  people are asking us to do this. We must work together. We must move  forward rather than pushing each other apart.                            ____________________
