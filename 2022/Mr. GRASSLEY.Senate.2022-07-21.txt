 Mr. President, I want to congratulate News Talk 1540  KXEL on celebrating 80 years of broadcasting to Iowans in the Waterloo  and Cedar Falls area. When I was younger, I remember joining my father  at the National Cattle Congress and was excited to see one of the early  on-location broadcasts of the new KXEL radio station.   Iowans look to broadcasters at KXEL as trusted leaders in the  community, relying on its programs each morning, noon, and night to  stay up to date on local events, learn more about breaking news, and  get critical information during emergencies. As an elected  Representative, I particularly want to thank everyone at KXEL for their  work to provide a way to communicate with constituents. I have the  pleasure of speaking with Jeff Stein at least once a month, where I  answer questions on any subject and update Iowans on how I am working  on their behalf in Washington.   KXEL's work every single day to report the events that matter to  listeners keeps Iowans safe, informed, and engaged. I look forward to  my future conversations with KXEL to achieve this shared goal.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I want to congratulate AM 600 WMT- NewsRadio on celebrating 100 years of  [[Page S3604]]  broadcasting to Iowans in the Cedar Rapids area.
