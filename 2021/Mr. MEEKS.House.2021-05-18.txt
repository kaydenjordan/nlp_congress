SENSE OF CONGRESS ON IMPORTANCE OF DEPARTMENT OF                     STATE'S WORK.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) United States global engagement is key to a stable and       prosperous world;        (2) United States leadership is indispensable in light of       the many complex and interconnected threats facing the United       States and the world;        (3) diplomacy and development are critical tools of       national power, and full deployment of these tools is vital       to United States national security;        (4) challenges such as the global refugee and migration       crises, terrorism, historic famine and food insecurity, and       fragile or repressive societies cannot be addressed without       sustained and robust United States diplomatic and development       leadership;        (5) the United States Government must use all of the       instruments of national security and foreign policy at its       disposal to protect United States citizens, promote United       States interests and values, and support global stability and       prosperity;        (6) United States security and prosperity depend on having       partners and allies that share our interests and values, and       these partnerships are nurtured and our shared interests and       values are promoted through United States diplomatic       engagement, security cooperation, economic statecraft, and       assistance that helps further economic development, good       governance, including the rule of law and democratic       institutions, and the development of shared responses to       natural and humanitarian disasters;        (7) as the United States Government agencies primarily       charged with conducting diplomacy and development, the       Department and the United States Agency for International       Development (USAID) require sustained and robust funding to       carry out this important work, which is essential to our       ability to project United States leadership and values and to       advance United States interests around the world;        (8) the work of the Department and USAID makes the United       States and the world safer and more prosperous by alleviating       global poverty and hunger, fighting HIV/AIDS and other       infectious diseases, strengthening alliances, expanding       educational opportunities for women and girls, promoting good       governance and democracy, supporting anti-corruption efforts,       driving economic development and trade, preventing armed       conflicts and humanitarian crises, and creating American jobs       and export opportunities;        (9) the Department and USAID are vital national security       agencies, whose work is critical to the projection of United       States power and leadership worldwide, and without which       Americans would be less safe, United States economic power       would be diminished, and global stability and prosperity       would suffer;        (10) investing in diplomacy and development before       conflicts break out saves American lives while also being       cost-effective; and        (11) the contributions of personnel working at the       Department and USAID are extraordinarily valuable and allow       the United States to maintain its leadership around the       world.       SEC. 1003. BUREAU OF DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND LABOR.

SEC. 1008. IMPORTANCE OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS TRAINING TO NATIONAL                     SECURITY.         (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the Department is a crucial national security agency,       whose employees, both Foreign and Civil Service, require the       best possible training at every stage of their careers to       prepare them to promote and defend United States national       interests and the health and safety of United States citizens       abroad;        (2) the Department of State's investment of time and       resources with respect to the training and education of its       personnel is considerably below the level of other Federal       departments and agencies in the national security field, and       falls well below the investments many allied and adversarial       countries make in the development of their diplomats;        (3) the Department faces increasingly complex and rapidly       evolving challenges, many of which are science and       technology-driven, and which demand the continual, high-      quality training and education of its personnel;        (4) the Department must move beyond reliance on ``on-the-      job training'' and other informal mentorship practices, which       lead to an inequality in skillset development and career       advancement opportunities, often particularly for minority       personnel, and towards a robust professional tradecraft       training continuum that will provide for greater equality in       career advancement and increase minority participation in the       senior ranks;        (5) the Department's Foreign Service Institute and other       training facilities should seek to substantially increase its       educational and training offerings to Department personnel,       including developing new and innovative educational and       training courses, methods, programs, and opportunities; and        (6) consistent with existing Department gift acceptance       authority and other applicable laws, the Department and       Foreign Service Institute may accept funds and other       resources from foundations, not-for-profit corporations, and       other appropriate sources to help the Department and the       Institute enhance the quantity and quality of training       offerings, especially in the introduction of new, innovative,       and pilot model courses.        (b) Training Float.--Not later than 90 days after the date       of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall       develop and submit to the appropriate congressional       committees a strategy to establish a ``training float'' to       allow for up to 15 percent of the Civil and Foreign Service       to participate in long-term training at any given time. The       strategy should identify steps necessary to ensure       implementation of the training priorities identified in       subsection (c), sufficient  [[Page H2435]]       training capacity and opportunities are available to Civil       and Foreign Service officers, equitable distribution of long-      term training opportunities to Civil and Foreign Service       officers, and any additional resources or authorities       necessary to facilitate such a training float, including       programs at the George P. Schultz National Foreign Affairs       Training Center, the Foreign Service Institute, the Foreign       Affairs Security Training Center, and other facilities or       programs operated by the Department of State. The strategy       shall identify which types of training would be prioritized,       the extent (if any) to which such training is already being       provided to Civil and Foreign Service officers by the       Department of State, any factors incentivizing or       disincentivizing such training, and why such training cannot       be achieved without Civil and Foreign Service officers       leaving the workforce. In addition to training opportunities       provided by the Department, the strategy shall consider       training that could be provided by the other United States       Government training institutions, as well as non-governmental       educational institutions. The strategy shall consider       approaches to overcome disincentives to pursuing long-term       training.        (c) Prioritization.--In order to provide the Civil and       Foreign Service with the level of education and training       needed to effectively advance United States interests across       the globe, the Department of State should--        (1) increase its offerings--        (A) of virtual instruction to make training more accessible       to personnel deployed throughout the world; or        (B) at partner organizations to provide useful outside       perspectives to Department personnel;        (2) offer courses utilizing computer-based or assisted       simulations, allowing civilian officers to lead decision-      making in a crisis environment; and        (3) consider increasing the duration and expanding the       focus of certain training courses, including--        (A) the A-100 orientation course for Foreign Service       officers, and        (B) the chief of mission course to more accurately reflect       the significant responsibilities accompanying such role.        (d) Other Agency Responsibilities.--Other national security       agencies should increase the enrollment of their personnel in       courses at the Foreign Service Institute and other Department       of State training facilities to promote a whole-of-government       approach to mitigating national security challenges.

(5) A written explanation if any of the documentation       necessary to support the comparisons and justification, as       the case may be, described in paragraphs (1) through (4)       cannot be provided.

SEC. 1702. ANNUAL ASSESSMENT.

Each such assessment shall--        (1) utilize independent, third party indicators that       measure transparency, accountability, and corruption in the       public sector in such countries, including the extent to       which public power is exercised for private gain, to identify       those countries that are most vulnerable to public       corruption;        (2) consider, to the extent reliable information is       available, whether the government of a country identified       under paragraph (1)--        (A) has adopted measures to prevent public corruption, such       as measures to inform and educate the public, including       potential victims, about the causes and consequences of       public corruption;        (B) has enacted laws and established government structures,       policies, and practices that prohibit public corruption;        (C) enforces such laws through a fair judicial process;        (D) vigorously investigates, prosecutes, convicts, and       sentences public officials who participate in or facilitate       public corruption, including nationals of such country who       are deployed in foreign military assignments, trade       delegations abroad, or other similar missions who engage in       or facilitate public corruption;        (E) prescribes appropriate punishment for serious and       significant corruption that is commensurate with the       punishment prescribed for serious crimes;        (F) prescribes appropriate punishment for significant       corruption that provides a sufficiently stringent deterrent       and adequately reflects the nature of the offense;        (G) convicts and sentences persons responsible for such       acts that take place wholly or partly within the country of       such government, including, as appropriate, requiring the       incarceration of individuals convicted of such acts;        (H) holds private sector representatives accountable for       their role in public corruption; and        (I) addresses threats for civil society to monitor anti-      corruption efforts;        (3) further consider--        (A) verifiable measures taken by the government of a       country identified under paragraph (1) to prohibit government       officials from participating in, facilitating, or condoning       public corruption, including the investigation, prosecution,       and conviction of such officials;        (B) the extent to which such government provides access,       or, as appropriate, makes adequate resources available, to       civil society organizations and other institutions to combat       public corruption, including reporting, investigating, and       monitoring;        (C) the extent to which an independent judiciary or       judicial body in such country is responsible for, and       effectively capable of, deciding public corruption cases       impartially, on the basis of facts and in accordance with       law, without any improper restrictions, influences,       inducements, pressures, threats, or interferences, whether       direct or indirect, from any source or for any reason;        (D) the extent to which such government cooperates       meaningfully with the United States to strengthen government       and judicial institutions and the rule of law to prevent,       prohibit, and punish public corruption; and        (E) the extent to which such government--        (i) is assisting in international investigations of       transnational public corruption networks and in other       cooperative efforts to combat serious, significant       corruption, including cooperating with the governments of       other countries to extradite corrupt actors;        (ii) recognizes the rights of victims of public corruption,       ensures their access to justice, and takes steps to prevent       such victims from being further victimized or persecuted by       corrupt actors, government officials, or others; and        (iii) refrains from prosecuting legitimate victims of       public corruption or whistleblowers due to such persons       having assisted in exposing public corruption, and refrains       from other discriminatory treatment of such persons; and        (4) contain such other information relating to public       corruption as the Secretary of State considers appropriate.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1157, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1157, the  Department of State Authorization Act of 2021, which I have introduced  alongside my good friend and partner, the ranking member of the Foreign  Affairs Committee,  Mike McCaul.   H.R. 1157 is a comprehensive, bipartisan measure that builds on the  work of several prior Congresses to broadly authorize the management  and operation of the Department of State. This sort of bill should be a  regular part of our work.   However, it has been nearly two decades since the State Department  authorization bill was enacted into law. With every passing year, this  represents another missed opportunity to ensure the Department of State  and our Nation's diplomats have the comprehensive support they need to  advance America's interests around the world.   While we have made progress over the last couple of years, including  in 2019, when the House passed an earlier version of this bill, we must  finally seize the historic opportunity to do what we have failed to do  in the past 10 Congresses.                                time  1215    Diplomacy and development are critical tools for advancing the United  States' foreign policy and national security objectives, for protecting  human rights and the rule of law around the world, for deepening  relationships with America's longstanding partners and allies, and for  forging new relationships around the world.   As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to threaten the globe, it has  reminded us once again that diplomacy and development are central to  solving global  [[Page H2449]]  conflicts and emergencies, keeping us safe and healthy, and enabling  our countries and our communities to thrive.   But at the State Department, there are also several vexing management  challenges that have gone unaddressed for too long, and the  politicization, neglect, and slashing of resources we saw during the  previous administration made it harder for our diplomats to do their  jobs. We must not only build the State Department back, as President  Biden says, we must build it back better.   To be clear, diplomacy and development are not just about policy, but  about the brave and dedicated public servants who work tirelessly to  keep our country safe. Yet, while the Department of State represents  the interests of the American people abroad, it has not looked like the  America it serves. So, among the many important management-related  provisions in H.R. 1157, I am particularly proud of those aimed at  ensuring a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive workforce.   This bill mandates disaggregated and transparent data collection and  provides for vital tools to improve the ability of the State Department  to recruit, promote, and retain personnel. It pushes for greater  transparency and inclusivity in filling senior leadership roles and  seeks to address the black box of assignment restrictions accompanying  some State Department employees' security clearances that have  negatively impacted Asian Americans and other people of color.   It also ensures that the Department can pay its interns, exposing  many more young Americans from across our great country to the  important work that the Department does around the world and ensuring a  strong and diverse pipeline of talent over the long term.   By shoring up other institutional accountability and management  safeguards, including to ensure cooperation with the inspector  general's investigations, the bill will also help to prevent the  politicized targeting and impunity that has caused so much harm to the  members of the workforce and their morale.   We can, and we must, move this bipartisan legislation forward and get  Congress back on track to doing right by our great diplomats, our  development professionals, and the American people we all serve.   I urge my colleagues to support this measure so that we can move it  one step closer to the President's desk.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  for closing purposes.   Let me thank Ranking Member McCaul for his partnership in bringing  this bipartisan bill to the floor. I join him in also recognizing  former chair Eliot Engel and what they attempted to do in the previous  Congress to make this happen. It would not have happened had we not had  the work and the continuous cooperation of both of our staffs in  putting this bill together, so I am thankful to them.   When we talk about H.R. 1157, the Department of State Authorization  Act of 2021, it is going to make the State Department better prepared  to conduct diplomacy and meet the challenges that we have of the 21st  century.   Congress must make authorizing the Department of State a regular part  of its legislative efforts. As the ranking member said, just as much as  we pass bills for defense and NDAA, we must be sure that we are passing  the State authorization bill.   What happens and will happen by passing this bill, we can ensure that  State has the tools that it needs so that it can be more effective,  more resilient, and more reflective of the America it represents  abroad. This should be, and I hope all of my colleagues join me and  Ranking Member  [[Page H2450]]  McCaul in supporting this bill in a unanimous way.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
