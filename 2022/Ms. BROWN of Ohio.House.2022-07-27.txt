 Madam Speaker, our Nation thrives because of the  strength of our families, and when our families succeed, our economy  succeeds.  [[Page H7238]]    For this reason alone, Congress must continue to pass powerful  bipartisan legislation like the CHIPS and Science Act.   The act demonstrates our commitment to putting money back in the  pockets of Americans. It addresses critical issues like inflation and  strengthening domestic supply chains in ways that could impact our  economy and national security for generations to come.   The stresses of the last 2 years took a huge toll on our country.  However, recent progress, including a growing job market, and declining  costs of some critical goods and services prove that we are on the  right track.   Voting for the CHIPS and Science Act will help ensure we ease the  financial burden carried by American families and boost our economy  because a Nation's backbone is its family. When they thrive, America  thrives.                            ____________________
