 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the bipartisan  budget agreement and President Biden's work to ensure the Nation pays  our bills and avoids a catastrophic, self-inflicted economic crisis.   This legislation protects the many bipartisan achievements realized  in the last Congress, such as the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs  Act, CHIPS and Science Act, PACT Act, as well as the Inflation  Reduction Act with its historic investments in addressing climate  change.   With this vote, we will protect Social Security, Medicare, and  Medicaid and prevent devastating cuts sought to life-sustaining SNAP  and TANF programs. With this vote, we will keep America moving forward  to meet the challenges ahead of us.   Compromise requires give-and-take, and both sides made difficult  concessions to achieve this agreement. This is the result of bipartisan  dealmaking, and I look forward to holding up the President's side of  this bargain.   I hope this is a learning moment, and we can avoid future political  brinkmanship.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to put the American people over  politics and support this important bill.
