 Mr. President, I rise today to denounce--this is a strong  word but an appropriate word--the Republican effort to undermine  America's faith in important institutions--all to protect Donald Trump  from the Russia investigation.   This effort is self-evident to any neutral observer watching ``Fox  and Friends,'' reading the ``Drudge Report,'' or following the  President on Twitter, and it has profound consequences for our country.   Defending our critical institutions, such as the FBI and an  independent Department of Justice, should not be a partisan issue, and  those who care about these institutions have to speak up. This, of  course, includes Members of Congress.   Many congressional Republicans, however, appear determined to  transform legitimate congressional oversight into an arm of the  President's defense. For example, the Teapot Dome hearings uncovered  government corruption for personal gain. The Kefauver committee  uncovered organized crime and corruption nationwide. The Watergate  committee uncovered Nixon's conspiracy. The Church committee led to  landmark reforms of the intelligence community, some of the very  reforms that are currently being warped for Trump's benefit. These were  bipartisan, fact-based, public inquiries into issues of national  consequence.   The investigation into Russia's acknowledged interference in our  election should be no different. Unfortunately, many of the Republicans  in Congress investigating the Trump-Russia matter appear more concerned  about protecting the President than getting at the truth. This is  particularly so in the House of Representatives, where almost nothing  happens on the Intelligence Committee without the assent of the White  House. But it is also true in the Senate, where even the Judiciary  Committee has been stymied in its efforts to get to the truth.   Certainly, it is not from a lack of trying. Democrats serving on  relevant committees have demonstrated determination in fulfilling our  constitutional oversight obligations, but this is nearly impossible  without cooperation from the Republican majority. Without cooperation  from Republicans, letters requesting information are not bipartisan,  and interviews of key witnesses are delayed or are canceled, just to  give two examples.   Conducting oversight behind closed doors and out of the public view  lacks transparency, of course, and creates a situation ripe for  exploitation. It allows Republicans to weaponize incomplete or  inaccurate information for the President's benefit.   We have seen the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Devin  Nunes, use this tactic last week, in spite of concerns raised by the  FBI and the Department of Justice. Congressman Nunes, determined to  support the President's paranoid conclusion that the entire national  security apparatus is out to get him, created a memo that misconstrued  critical intelligence to engineer an outcome that pleased the White  House. Armed with a misleading and inaccurate memo, Congressman Nunes  and Republicans across the country, with the assistance of Russia bots  on social media, launched a concerted attack on the FBI, the  intelligence community, and the Justice Department. Why? To prove a  conspiracy against the President that does not exist.   Nunes and other Republicans knew the facts did not support their  conspiracy theory, but the incitement continued anyway, even singling  out for attack the President's own handpicked Director of the FBI after  his agency opposed releasing the memo. By the time the committee  released it and the public learned just how false and misleading it  was, Congressman Nunes and his memo had already sowed the seeds of  doubt about the FBI and its investigation.   The President rewarded Congressman Nunes yesterday by tweeting:         Devin Nunes, a man of tremendous courage and grit, may       someday be recognized as a Great American Hero for what he       has exposed and what he has had to endure!    I think history will conclude otherwise.   Just as the President has praised the Nunes attacks on the FBI and  the Justice Department, he has certainly been doing his part to  undermine these institutions. He has done his part by demeaning and  humiliating the very people he appointed to run these institutions. We  can all recall the very personal attacks on Attorney General Jeff  Sessions in the Oval Office, demands for personal loyalty from Deputy  Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and assertions that the FBI was ``in  tatters'' under the leadership of his handpicked Director, Christopher  Wray. We can all appreciate the irony of Donald Trump's personal  attacks against Special Counsel Robert Mueller, whom the President  interviewed and seriously considered for a return to his old job as  Director of the FBI.   The self-serving and personal attacks against people who refuse to do  his bidding reflect the narcissism of a man who has little regard for  his responsibilities as President. Sadly, for President Trump, it is  all about him every time, all the time.   By attacking the Justice Department and the FBI, the President is  attempting to discredit the Russia investigation and protect himself  and his family. His words and actions are intended to undermine public  confidence in the  [[Page S643]]  FBI and the Justice Department for his benefit in the here and now. He  does not seem to care about the long-term consequences of eroding  public confidence in two critical institutions charged with keeping us  safe and protecting our rights.   Through all the obfuscation and negative personal attacks, a clear  pattern has emerged. The President and his Republican allies will do  whatever they can to discredit the Mueller Russia investigation without  regard or respect for the collateral damage caused. Then they will turn  to FOX News and other outlets to get their message or propaganda out to  their base and dismiss the mainstream media as fake news. Sadly, for  our country, it is a strategy that can win and that can work.   According to a new poll from Reuters, 73 percent of Republicans  believe that the Justice Department and the FBI are trying to undermine  the President. This state of affairs may serve the President's short- term interests, but it will have real and lasting negative consequences  for our country in the years and decades to come.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.
