 Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill to ensure that  the treatment of the State and Local Property Tax deduction, also known  as the ``SALT deduction,'' does not unfairly penalize married  taxpayers. The SALT Deduction Fairness Act would eliminate the marriage  penalty imposed by the current $10,000 cap on SALT by doubling this  amount for married filers.   The SALT deduction has been in the tax code since 1913 when the  income tax was first established and is intended to prevent double  taxation. The original Senate tax reform bill in 2017 would have  eliminated the deduction altogether. During the consideration of the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, I fought to keep the SALT deduction in the  Federal tax code because of the incredible tax burden a complete  elimination of this deduction would have imposed on American taxpayers,  many of whom pay high taxes on everything from their incomes to their  vehicles.   My amendment, which was adopted by the Senate, retained the SALT  deduction for up to $10,000 in State and local taxes such as State  income taxes, local property taxes, and vehicle excise taxes. This was  especially important to families living in high-tax states like Maine,  which not only has one of our Nation's highest tax burdens, but also a  relatively low per household income--approximately $6,300 below the U.S  average. Maintaining the deduction provided important tax relief for  those hard-working Mainers who continued to itemize.  [[Page S6337]]    But a basic unfairness still exists in the tax code that penalizes  married couples. Currently, individual taxpayers can deduct up to  $10,000 in State and local taxes. If two people marry, however, the  deduction remains at $10,000. As a result, a couple could be  financially better off not getting married when it comes to the current  SALT deduction.   This legislation very simply would remove the marriage penalty by  doubling the SALT deduction from $10,000 to $20,000 for joint filers.  This straightforward change would remove a bias against marriage from  the tax code. And, most important, it would help make the dream of home  ownership a reality for married couples.   The National Association of Realtors recently wrote to me about the  importance of eliminating this marriage penalty, stating,  ``Homeownership has long been a vital part of the American Dream.  Research shows that an overwhelming majority of current renters aspire  to own a home, and we know that our Nation's faith in homeownership has  persisted through the Great Recession. For well over a century, our tax  system has helped American families in reaching this Dream.''   Mr. President, we should not unfairly penalize American taxpayers for  being married. This common sense legislation will fix this undue burden  who are penalized for their filing status.                                  ______                                         By Mr. THUNE (for himself, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Moran, Mrs.          Blackburn, and Mr. Warner):   S. 2763. A bill to require that internet platforms give users the  option to engage with a platform without being manipulated by  algorithms driver by user-specific data; to the Committee on Commerce,  Science, and Transportation.    Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by my  friend and colleague from Maryland, Senator Cardin, to introduce the  Girls Leadership, Engagement, and Advocacy in Development, or Girls  LEAD, Act. Our legislation would support and expand civic engagement  and political leadership of adolescent girls around the world.   Despite comprising over 50 percent of the world's population, women  are underrepresented at all levels of public sector decision-making.  Recently, Congress has taken steps to combat this issue with new laws,  including the Women, Peace, and Security Act and the Women's  Entrepreneurship and Economic Empowerment Act. The Girls LEAD Act will  complement these efforts by specifically addressing the civic  involvement and leadership of adolescent girls, an area where there is  currently a gap in U.S. foreign assistance programing. The United  States can help foster a pipeline of adolescent girls who will aspire  to assume leadership roles in their communities.   Adolescence is a pivotal time in a girl's life that brings about  significant physical, emotional, and social changes. Yet, according to  UNESCO, 132 million adolescent girls between the age of 6 and 17 are  not enrolled in school. As reported by UNICEF, more than 150 million  girls will marry as children by 2030. It is vitally important that  girls and young women in childhood are empowered, and that we invest in  their leadership potential early so that they can develop pathways to  positions of political leadership and civic engagement.   The Girls LEAD Act would combat these terrible statistics by making  it the policy of the United States to promote and ensure that all  adolescents are able to fully participate in society, and are  specifically able to exercise their civil and political rights in their  communities and countries. We know that women's political participation  results in tangible change for democracies and the United States must  continue to be a leader in this arena.   Specifically, our legislation would direct the Department of State  and the U.S. Agency for International Development to implement a  strategy that strengthens adolescent girls' participation in democracy  and governance. This strategy would include U.S. foreign assistance  programs that focus on increasing adolescent girls' civic and political  knowledge, advocacy, leadership, and research skills, while addressing  the common barriers that can preclude their participation. The bill  would require that this strategy be developed in consultation with  civil society, including the participation of adolescent girls.   As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, for years  I have pushed to set aside resources in the annual State Department  funding bill for women's leadership and political participation  programs, and I have seen first-hand the positive effects of greater  political involvement on the part of women here in the United States. I  believe our Nation can and must continue its leadership role in  empowering women and girls worldwide, and turning more attention to the  civic engagement of adolescent girls will help advance that mission.   I urge my colleagues to join me and Senator Cardin in supporting the  Girls LEAD Act, which will help to improve and create a more secure  world now and in the future.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill to ensure that  the treatment of the State and Local Property Tax deduction, also known  as the ``SALT deduction,'' does not unfairly penalize married  taxpayers.
