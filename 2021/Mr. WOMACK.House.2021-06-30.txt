 Madam Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise  today.   Arkansas lost one of its finest over the weekend. Pea Ridge Police  Officer Kevin Apple was tragically killed in the line of duty while  working to apprehend two suspects. When he approached the suspects'  vehicle, he did what professional law enforcement officers do. He  didn't shy away from the threat. He confronted it. And in so doing, he  gave his life for his community.   It reminds us of the supreme courage displayed by the men and women  in uniform and the growing dangers they face each and every day.  Through his leadership, bravery, and selfless dedication, Officer Apple  exemplified the best our State has to offer.   For more than 20 years, he nobly served in law enforcement. He was a  protector and demonstrated the principled integrity the badge requires.  This heart for service was at the core of his character. Past his  uniform, he was known as a good neighbor who was always willing to help  others.   Arkansas will never forget his service. I join Mayor Jackie Crabtree  and Police Chief Lynn Hahn; his mother, Dalene Hart; stepfather,  Richard White; and brother, Kyle Hart, in mourning his loss.   The Third District of Arkansas was blessed to have such a dedicated  hero keeping us safe. We will always keep his memory alive.                            ____________________
