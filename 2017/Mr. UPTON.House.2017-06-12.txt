 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 446) to extend the deadline for commencement of construction of a  hydroelectric project.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 446         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. EXTENSION.         (a) In General.--Notwithstanding the time period specified       in section 13 of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 806) that       would otherwise apply to the Federal Energy Regulatory       Commission project numbered 12737, the Commission may, at the       request of the licensee for the project, and after reasonable       notice, in accordance with the good faith, due diligence, and       public interest requirements of that section and the       Commission's procedures under that section, extend the time       period during which the licensee is required to commence the       construction of the project for up to 3 consecutive 2-year       periods from the date of the expiration of the extension       originally issued by the Commission.        (b) Reinstatement of Expired License.--If the period       required for commencement of construction of the project       described in subsection (a) has expired prior to the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Commission may reinstate the       license for the project effective as of the date of its       expiration and the first extension authorized under       subsection (a) shall take effect on the date of such       expiration.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Upton) and the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DeGette)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H.R. 446.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Michigan?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H.R. 446.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Michigan?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 446 authorizes the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission, FERC, upon request, to extend by 6 years the time period  during which construction must commence on the Gathright Hydroelectric  Project located in Alleghany County, Virginia. Additionally, FERC may  reinstate the construction license if it is expired.   A similar bill was passed under suspension of the rules in the 114th  Congress in a bipartisan way, and I would hope that we can do it today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 446, a bill to extend the  deadline for commencement of construction of a hydroelectric project,  introduced by Mr. Griffith.   On March 13, 2012, FERC licensed the Gathright Hydroelectric Project  to be located at the Army Corps of Engineers' Gathright Dam on the  Jackson River in Alleghany County, Virginia. The licensee for the  Gathright project was not able to commence construction by the already- extended deadline in March 2016.   The bill would, therefore, authorize FERC to extend for up to three  consecutive 2-year periods the date by which the licensee is required  to commence construction. Similar legislation passed the House of  Representatives by voice vote twice during the last Congress.   I hope everybody will support passage of H.R. 446. I hope we can get  this thing built.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Griffith), a member of the Energy and  Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and  I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 446.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 447) to extend the deadline for commencement of construction of a  hydroelectric project.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 447         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,  [[Page H4825]]            SECTION 1. EXTENSION.

Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Michigan?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill authorizes the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission, FERC, upon request, to extend by 6 years the time period  during which construction must commence on the Flannagan Dam and  Reservoir Hydroelectric Project located in Dickenson County, Virginia.  Additionally, FERC may reinstate the construction license if it is  expired.   The bill, again, passed under suspension in the 114th Congress, and I  would hope that we could do the same today in a bipartisan way.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I again rise in support of legislation by Mr. Griffith, H.R. 447,  which would extend the deadline for commencement of construction of the  Flannagan Hydroelectric Project, to be located at the Army Corps of  Engineers' John W. Flannagan Dam on the Russell Fork River in Dickenson  County, Virginia.   The licensee for the Flannagan Hydroelectric Project did not commence  construction by the already-extended deadline in January 2016.  Legislation is now required for the project to move forward.   The bill would authorize FERC to extend for up to three consecutive  years the date by which the licensee is required to commence  construction.   During the last Congress, the full House of Representatives passed  similar legislation by voice vote. I once again hope my colleagues will  help me in supporting passage of H.R. 447. Let's get this one built,  too.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 627         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Streamlining Energy       Efficiency for Schools Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. COORDINATION OF ENERGY RETROFITTING ASSISTANCE FOR                     SCHOOLS.         Section 392 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42       U.S.C. 6371a) is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(e) Coordination of Energy Retrofitting Assistance for       Schools.--        ``(1) Definition of school.--Notwithstanding section       391(6), for the purposes of this subsection, the term       `school' means--        ``(A) an elementary school or secondary school (as defined       in section 9101 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act       of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7801));        ``(B) an institution of higher education (as defined in       section 102(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C.       1002(a)));        ``(C) a school of the defense dependents' education system       under the Defense Dependents' Education Act of 1978 (20       U.S.C. 921 et seq.) or established under section 2164 of       title 10, United States Code;        ``(D) a school operated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs;        ``(E) a tribally controlled school (as defined in section       5212 of the Tribally Controlled Schools Act of 1988 (25       U.S.C. 2511)); and        ``(F) a Tribal College or University (as defined in section       316(b) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C.       1059c(b))).        ``(2) Establishment of clearinghouse.--The Secretary,       acting through the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable       Energy, shall establish a clearinghouse to disseminate       information regarding available Federal programs and       financing mechanisms that may be used to help initiate,       develop, and finance energy efficiency, distributed       generation, and energy retrofitting projects for schools.        ``(3) Requirements.--In carrying out paragraph (2), the       Secretary shall--        ``(A) consult with appropriate Federal agencies to develop       a list of Federal programs and financing mechanisms that are,       or may be, used for the purposes described in paragraph (2);       and        ``(B) coordinate with appropriate Federal agencies to       develop a collaborative education and outreach effort to       streamline communications and promote available Federal       programs and financing mechanisms described in subparagraph       (A), which may include the development and maintenance of a       single online resource that includes contact information for       relevant technical assistance in the Office of Energy       Efficiency and Renewable Energy that States, local education       agencies, and schools may use to effectively access and use       such Federal programs and financing mechanisms.''.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Upton) and the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DeGette)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H.R. 627.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Michigan?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H.R. 627.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Michigan?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill, H.R. 627, is an important bill that would  help the Nation's schools make use of existing Federal programs to  actually reduce their energy use. There currently are a number of such  programs that help schools undertake projects that improve energy  efficiency. Unfortunately, school districts don't always have the know- how to navigate the complexities  [[Page H4826]]  of the Federal system and take full advantage of these programs.   The bill creates a simple one-stop shop to get all the needed  information and help school districts participate more fully in these  programs. The bottom line is that the Nation's schools will, in fact,  reduce their energy costs.   As it is, energy use in American K-12 schools totals $6 billion every  year, and reducing this figure can certainly save taxpayer dollars or  free up funds that schools can use on things other than energy bills.   This bill, H.R. 627, has no cost since it merely sets up a system  under which existing school energy efficiency programs can work better.   A similar bill was passed under suspension of the rules at the end of  the last Congress, and I would hope that we can do it today, at the  beginning of this Congress, so that the Senate can follow suit and get  this to the President's desk.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to voice my strong support for H.R. 627, Mr.  Cartwright's Streamlining Energy Efficiency for Schools Act. This is a  great bill that will provide a coordinated structure for our Nation's  schools to help them better navigate available Federal programs and  financing options.   Across the country, K-12 school districts spend literally billions of  dollars on their energy bills each year while an estimated 14 million  American children attend deteriorating public schools. By upgrading  these systems, we can increase efficiency and focus school funding to  achieve better educational outcomes.   This legislation passed the House previously with broad bipartisan  support, and I urge everybody to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright), the author of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I would urge my colleagues to support this  great, bipartisan bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 627.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 951) to extend the deadline for commencement of construction of a  hydroelectric project.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 951         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. EXTENSION.         (a) In General.--Notwithstanding the time period specified       in section 13 of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 806) that       would otherwise apply to the Federal Energy Regulatory       Commission project numbered 12642, the Commission may, at the       request of the licensee for the project, and after reasonable       notice, in accordance with the good faith, due diligence, and       public interest requirements of that section and the       Commission's procedures under that section, extend the time       period during which the licensee is required to commence the       construction of the project for up to 3 consecutive 2-year       periods from the date of the expiration of the extension       originally issued by the Commission.        (b) Reinstatement of Expired License.--If the period       required for commencement of construction of the project       described in subsection (a) has expired prior to the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Commission may reinstate the       license effective as of the date of its expiration and the       first extension authorized under subsection (a) shall take       effect on the date of such expiration.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Upton) and the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DeGette)  each will control 20 minutes.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material in the Record on the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Michigan?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill, H.R. 951, introduced by the gentlewoman from  North Carolina (Ms. Foxx), the distinguished chair of the Education and  the Workforce Committee, authorizes the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission, FERC, to extend up to 6 years the time period during which  construction must commence on the W. Kerr Scott Hydropower Project  located on the Yadkin River in Wilkes County, North Carolina.  Additionally, FERC may reinstate the construction license if it is  expired.   A similar bill was passed under suspension in the last Congress, and  I hope that we can pass it again today, urging the Senate to take this  legislation up.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the legislation before us, sponsored by the gentlewoman  from North Carolina, would authorize FERC to extend for 6 years the  date by which the licensee for the W. Kerr Scott Hydropower Project is  required to commence construction. This is necessary because the  project's licensee was not able to commence construction by the  already-extended deadline of July 17, 2016.   Similar legislation authored by Ms. Foxx passed the House during the  114th Congress by a vote of 406-3. I hope my colleagues will support  this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).    Mr. Speaker, this is important legislation, and I would  like to think that we can pass it again this afternoon.   I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1109         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. CLARIFICATION OF FACILITY MERGER AUTHORIZATION.         Section 203(a)(1)(B) of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C.       824b(a)(1)(B)) is amended by striking ``such facilities or       any part thereof'' and inserting ``such facilities, or any       part thereof, of a value in excess of $10,000,000''.       SEC. 2. NOTIFICATION FOR CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS.         Section 203(a) of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 824b(a))       is amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:        ``(7)(A) Not later than 180 days after the date of       enactment of this paragraph, the Commission shall promulgate       a rule requiring any public utility that is seeking to merge       or consolidate, directly or indirectly, its facilities       subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, or any part       thereof, with those of any other person, to notify the       Commission of such transaction not later than 30 days after       the date on which the transaction is consummated if--        ``(i) such facilities, or any part thereof, are of a value       in excess of $1,000,000; and        ``(ii) such public utility is not required to secure an       order of the Commission under paragraph (1)(B).        ``(B) In establishing any notification requirement under       subparagraph (A), the Commission shall, to the maximum extent       practicable, minimize the paperwork burden resulting from the       collection of information.''.       SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE.         The amendment made by section 1 shall take effect 180 days       after the date of enactment of this Act.    The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material in the Record on the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Michigan?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill, H.R. 1109, is, again, a bipartisan bill  introduced by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg). It was  reported by unanimous consent from the Energy and Commerce Committee.  It amends the Federal Power Act with respect to the prohibition  regarding mergers or consolidations by a public utility.   Any merger or consolidation of a public utility whose value exceeds  $10 million must first be authorized by the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission. In addition, FERC is required to promulgate a rule within  180 days that mandates any public utility seeking to merge or  consolidate to notify FERC within 30 days of transaction consummation  if the value of such merger or consolidation exceeds $1 million but, in  fact, is less than $10 million.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 1109, sponsored by Representatives Walberg  and Dingell, which would add a $10 million threshold to trigger FERC  review of a merger or consolidation. This is a significant change to  current law as established through the Energy Policy Act of 2005.   Obviously, FERC should not have to rely on trade publications or on  word of mouth to know that merger or consolidation activity involving  regulated utilities is occurring. This bill, as reported by the Energy  and Commerce Committee, includes language requiring FERC to undertake a  rulemaking to develop a short, simple, notification process for  transactions above the $1  [[Page H4828]]  million mark that fall below the new $10 million threshold.   This addresses a problem, in that FERC lacked a standardized way to  acquire the information necessary to know that these below-threshold  transactions were occurring. Without that knowledge, it would be too  easy for someone looking to evade the new $10 million threshold to  break their transaction into smaller pieces and, thereby, escape  review.   I want to commend the gentleman and the gentlewoman from Michigan for  their work to address this matter. I think this is sensible legislation  that reduces the burden on industry and on the government, while  ensuring the public good is fully protected.   I urge the passage of this legislation, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg), the author of the legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  bipartisan legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 1109.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 2122) to reinstate and extend the deadline for commencement of  construction of a hydroelectric project involving Jennings Randolph  Dam.

(2) Extension.--If the Commission reinstates the license       under paragraph (1), the first extension authorized under       subsection (a) shall take effect on the date of the       expiration of the license.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Upton) and the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DeGette)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material in the Record on the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Michigan?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material in the Record on the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Michigan?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill, H.R. 2122, was introduced by the gentleman  from West Virginia (Mr. McKinley), and it authorizes the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission, FERC, upon request, to extend by 6 years the  time period during which construction must commence on the Jennings  Randolph Hydroelectric Project, which is located on the North Branch of  the Potomac River in Garrett County, Maryland, and Mineral County, West  Virginia. Additionally, FERC may reinstate the construction license if  it has expired.   A similar bill passed under suspension in the 114th Congress, so I  hope that we can pass it again today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2122, a bill to extend the  deadline for commencement of construction of a hydroelectric project  involving the Jennings Randolph Dam, sponsored by my Energy and  Commerce Committee colleague, Mr. McKinley.   In March 2012, FERC licensed the construction of a hydroelectric  facility at the Army Corps' Jennings Randolph Dam located on the  Potomac River's North Branch in Maryland and West Virginia. The  licensee for the Jennings Randolph Dam project was not able to commence  construction by the already-extended deadline of April 2016. The bill  would authorize FERC to extend for 6 years the date by which the  licensee is required to commence construction.   FERC has no objections to this legislation, and similar legislation  passed the House by a 418-2 vote during the 114th Congress. I hope my  colleagues will join me in supporting H.R. 2122, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, so I yield back  the balance of my time.   Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 2122.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 2274) to amend the Federal Power Act to provide for extended  periods relating to preliminary permits and commencement of  construction, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.  [[Page H4829]]    The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2274         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``HYdropower Permit Extension       Act'' or the ``HYPE Act''.       SEC. 2. EXTENSIONS OF PERIODS.         (a) Preliminary Permits.--Section 5 of the Federal Power       Act (16 U.S.C. 798) is amended--        (1) in subsection (a), by striking ``three'' and inserting       ``four''; and        (2) in subsection (b)--        (A) by striking ``Commission may extend the period of a       preliminary permit once for not more than 2 additional years       beyond the 3 years'' and inserting the following:       ``Commission may--        ``(1) extend the period of a preliminary permit once for       not more than four additional years beyond the four years'';        (B) by striking the period at the end and inserting ``;       and''; and        (C) by adding at the end the following:        ``(2) if the period of a preliminary permit is extended       under paragraph (1), extend the period of such preliminary       permit once for not more than four additional years beyond       the extension period granted under paragraph (1), if the       Commission determines that there are extraordinary       circumstances that warrant such additional extension.''.        (b) Time Limit for Construction of Project Works.--Section       13 of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 806) is amended in the       second sentence by striking ``once but not longer than two       additional years'' and inserting ``for not more than eight       additional years,''.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Upton) and the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DeGette)  each will control 20 minutes.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Michigan?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill, H.R. 2274, was introduced by the gentleman  from California (Mr. Peters), and it was passed by unanimous consent by  the Energy and Commerce Committee.   The bill, H.R. 2274, amends the Federal Power Act to allow the  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, to extend periods relating  to preliminary permits and commencement of construction of  hydroelectric projects.   This bill is a commonsense bill, bipartisan, and I would hope that  all Members would join me in supporting it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2274, the HYdropower Permit  Extension, or HYPE, Act.   I am pleased that the House is considering this legislation, which  was recently introduced by my colleague, Mr. Peters, of the committee,  to provide the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission with the authority  to grant longer periods for preliminary and construction permits and  associated extensions under sections 5 and 13 of the Federal Power Act.   Right now, as we have seen from the debating of these six bills  today, this is something that can only be done by an act of Congress on  a case-by-case basis.                                time  1615    As much as we have all enjoyed debating these extensions of time  today, it is clear that it would be more efficient and it also would  save more time in Congress if these extensions could be done directly  by FERC. I commend Mr. Peters. I hope all of my colleagues will join me  in supporting this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I am now pleased to yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from California (Mr. Peters), the author of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I would urge my colleagues to vote for this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I would do the same, and I yield back the  balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 2274.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 2292) to extend a project of the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission involving the Cannonsville Dam.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2292         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. EXTENSION OF TIME FOR A FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY                     COMMISSION PROJECT INVOLVING CANNONSVILLE DAM.         (a) In General.--Notwithstanding the time period specified       in section 13 of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 806) that       would otherwise apply to the Federal Energy Regulatory       Commission project numbered 13287, the Federal Energy       Regulatory Commission (referred to in this section as the       ``Commission'') may, at the request of the licensee for the       project, and after reasonable notice, in accordance with the       good faith, due diligence, and public interest requirements       of that section and the procedures of the Commission under       that section, extend the time period during which the       licensee is required to commence construction of the project       for up to 4 consecutive 2-year periods after the required       date of the commencement of construction described in Article       301 of the license.        (b) Reinstatement of Expired License.--        (1) In general.--If the required date of the commencement       of construction described in subsection (a) has expired prior       to the date of enactment of this Act, the Commission may       reinstate the license effective as of that date of       expiration.        (2) Extension.--If the Commission reinstates the license       under paragraph (1), the first extension authorized under       subsection (a) shall take effect on the date of that       expiration.

[[Page H4830]]    This bill, H.R. 2292, was introduced by Mr. Faso from New York, and  the bill authorizes the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC,  upon request, to extend by 8 years the time period during which  construction must commence on the Cannonsville hydroelectric project-- which is located on the west branch of the Delaware River in the  Catskill Mountains of upstate New York.   The city of New York was granted a construction license for the  Cannonsville hydroelectric project on May 13, 2014. Additionally, FERC  may reinstate the construction license if it is expired. The bill was  reported by unanimous consent from the Energy and Commerce Committee,  and I support its passage on the floor today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2292, a bill to extend the  deadline for commencement and construction of a hydroelectric project  involving the Cannonsville Dam.   On May 13, 2014, FERC licensed construction of a hydroelectric  facility at the Cannonsville Reservoir located on the west branch of  the Delaware River in Delaware County, New York. The licensee for this  project was not able to commence construction by the deadline of May  2016.   The additional reviews and repairs to the dam, which are necessary to  begin construction of the hydroelectric project, will delay  construction commencement beyond the expiration date of the original  license and the 2-year extension which FERC is authorized to grant.   The bill would, therefore, authorize FERC to extend up to 8 years the  date by which the licensee is required to commence construction.   Similar legislation passed the House during the 114th Congress by a  vote of 417-2. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Faso).    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for the bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 2292.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 2457) to extend the deadline for commencement of construction of  certain hydroelectric projects, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2457         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(a) In General.--Notwithstanding the time period specified       in section 13 of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 806) that       would otherwise apply to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission       project numbers 12756, 12757, and 12758, the Commission may,       at the request of the licensee for the applicable project,       and after reasonable notice, in accordance with the good       faith, due diligence, and public interest requirements of       that section and the Commission's procedures under that       section, extend the time period during which such licensee is       required to commence the construction of its applicable       project for up to 3 consecutive 2-year periods from the date       of the expiration of any extension issued by the Commission       under that section for such project.        (b) Obligation for Payment of Annual Charges.--Any       obligation of a licensee for a project described in       subsection (a) for the payment of annual charges under       section 10(e) of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 803(e))       shall commence when the construction of the project       commences.        (c) Reinstatement of License; Effective Date for       Extension.--        (1) Reinstatement.--If the time period required for       commencement of construction of a project described in       subsection (a) has expired prior to the date of the enactment       of this Act, the Commission may reinstate the license for       such project, effective as of the date of the expiration of       the license.        (2) Effective date for extension.--If the Commission       reinstates a license under paragraph (1) for a project, the       first extension authorized under subsection (a) with respect       to such project shall take effect on the effective date of       such reinstatement under paragraph (1).    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Upton) and the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DeGette)  each will control 20 minutes.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include  any extraneous material in the Record on the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Michigan?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2457, as amended. This bill  was introduced by Mr. Johnson from Louisiana and was reported by  unanimous consent from the Energy and Commerce Committee. The bill,  H.R. 2457, authorizes the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC,  to extend the time period during which a licensee is required to  commence the construction of Commission project numbers 12756, 12757,  and 12758 for up to three consecutive 2-year periods.   Mr. Speaker, I would encourage all Members to join me and support  passage of this bill, as amended.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H4831]]    Mr. Speaker, this is the last bill in our cohort of six extension  bills that we are considering today, which I hope Mr. Peters' bill will  absolve us from having to do in the future.   This bill, the J. Bennett Johnston Waterway Hydropower Extension Act  of 2017 was introduced by the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Johnson) on  May 16, 2017. It would extend the time period during which the licensee  is required to commence the construction of the project for up to three  consecutive 2-year periods from the date of expiration of the original  extension.   Additionally, the legislation defers the obligation on the licensee  to pay any annual charges required under section 10(e) of the Federal  Power Act until the project actually commences construction.   Finally, the legislation allows for the prospective reinstatement of  the license should that license expire prior to the legislation's date  of enactment.   I just have to add a few words to what Mr. Peters said earlier.  Hydropower is so important. It is such an important renewable energy  source in this country. We need to do everything we can on a bipartisan  basis to make sure that we expedite these dams, that we really work  together to get hydropower, even more important in our energy  portfolio.   Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will favorably consider this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I echo the words from my good friend from  Colorado. Hydro is an important renewable energy source, and it is one  that supports all of the above. It is an increasing force across the  country so that is why these bills are so important, and it also shows  why they are so bipartisan.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 2457, as amended.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Upton) and the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DeGette)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.                                GENERAL LEAVE     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include any extraneous material in the Record on the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Michigan?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include any extraneous material in the Record on the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Michigan?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am also pleased that we are considering this  legislation, H.R. 338, a bill to promote a 21st century energy and  manufacturing workforce, introduced by my friend and great colleague,  the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rush), and the gentleman from North  Carolina (Mr. Hudson).   This bipartisan bill takes steps to help make training for energy  manufacturing jobs available to women and minorities as well as  veterans.   By way of background, the bill was unanimously approved by the House  last Congress by a voice vote. It was also included in the energy bill  conference negotiations. But, unfortunately, even though the bill  received overwhelming support in both the House and the Senate, it  didn't make it to the President's desk before time ran out.   The U.S. has undergone an energy renaissance, driven by newly  discovered resources, technological innovation, and a skilled  workforce. Millions and millions of new jobs had been created, and many  more are opening up, but we have got to continue to invest in our  workers in order to maintain global leadership and maximize the  economic potential of our energy abundance.   This bill, H.R. 338, takes important steps in the right direction by  requiring that the Department of Energy modernize and improve  coordination among the numerous workforce development programs and  activities that expand the Department's programs, offices, labs, and  technology centers.   This bipartisan bill places an emphasis on maximizing the  Department's existing resources and increasing the diversity of our  energy and manufacturing workforce by increasing opportunities for  women, minorities, and veterans.   It also improves reemployment opportunities for out-of-work and  dislocated workers, which, for example, would provide welcome relief to  workers discouraged by sharp downturns in the coal industry.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation before us today is a good government  bill that is going to increase benefits for American workers. I would  encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1630    Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased we are considering this  bill sponsored by my friend and colleague, the ranking member of the  Energy Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Rush.   I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Illinois  (Mr. Rush).    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Hudson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to say I have watched these two gentlemen,  Mr. Rush and Mr. Hudson, work together, something that our committee  does a lot on lots of different issues, from oversight to energy, to  healthcare, to telecommunications.   Mr. Rush has had an outstanding career. The gentleman's district is  close to mine. He and I have been in each other's districts quite a bit  over the last number of years. This bill is a legacy to Mr. Rush. The  gentleman has cared with real passion about energy jobs and making sure  that we have the expertise and the technical training knowing that we  want to compete with the rest of the world. I commend the gentleman  again for working with Mr. Hudson--a brilliant star on our side of the  aisle--to get this bill done.   We look forward to the President's signing it into law, and we are  looking  [[Page H4834]]  forward to having the Senate move similar bipartisan legislation so we  can get the job done. That is what it is all about.   So I want to thank the gentleman for his tireless commitment to  getting this issue done.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill again.   I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  338, to Promote a 21st Century Energy and Manufacturing Workforce  Future Act.   For years, many of the industries I represent have complained of  workforce shortages.   In East Houston and Harris County, if we were able to recruit every  union electrician in the country, we would still have a shortage.   The same is probably true for pipefitters, welders, etc.   The economy in our part of the country is rapidly expanding thanks to  the development of the Eagleford shale and the Permian Basin.   We must ensure that this economic prosperity is shared across all of  our community.   In Texas, workforce diversity has to be a reality.   I am pleased that Representative Rush has crafted this legislation  and I am proud to be an original co-sponsor.   I am also proud to support workforce development opportunities for  Hispanics, African-Americans, and women in the energy field.   The industry needs skilled workers and we need to create opportunity  for everyone, including many of those I represent in and around the  area.   The bill will encourage the Department of Energy to conduct outreach  to these communities to ensure they have access to the knowledge,  skills and abilities required to fill high paying jobs in the energy  field.   Thanks to efforts by ExxonMobil and the Texas Gulf Coast Community  College Consortium, we are already addressing the workforce needs of  our industries but more needs to be done and this bill will help us  achieve these goals.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 338.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
