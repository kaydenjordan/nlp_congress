 Madam Speaker, the impeachment inquiry underway in the  House has been shrouded in secret meetings and out of view from the  American people.   My constituents have told me that they oppose this investigation and  they believe the House should be taking up legislation that needs to be  done to help hardworking Michigan residents.   First and foremost, the House should pass the United States-Mexico- Canada Trade Agreement without delay. This agreement will benefit  hardworking Michigan residents, especially in industries vital to our  State, including manufacturing and agriculture. They will have new  markets for their products, and the profits they make will come  [[Page H8375]]  back to our communities in mid and northern Michigan.   I have also been a strong advocate for the Great Lakes Restoration  Initiative and for funding the construction of a new lock at the Soo  Locks.   Yet these priorities are now funded under a temporary stopgap, and  after weeks of delays caused by Senate Democrats who want to  renegotiate, we now face the prospect of an impeachment trial that will  bog down activity in the Senate even further in the future.                            ____________________
