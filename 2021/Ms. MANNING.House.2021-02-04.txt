 Madam Speaker, on February 1, 1960, four young Black men  sat down at a Whites only Woolworth's lunch counter in Greensboro,  North Carolina, and asked to be served. These students from North  Carolina A&T State University had trained for weeks to be able to  withstand the hostility and abuse that would be thrust upon them.   The next day, the ``Greensboro Four'' were joined by women from  Bennett College and Greensboro Woman's College. The courage  demonstrated by these students sparked a national sit-in movement that  spread to 55 cities in 13 States. The sit-ins lasted for 6 months  until, finally, the Woolworth's lunch counter was integrated.   As the Representative from Greensboro, I join my colleagues,  Representatives Adams and Butterfield, in introducing a resolution to  recognize the legacy of the Greensboro Four, and follow their lead in  fighting for a future that will bring equal rights to all people.                            ____________________
