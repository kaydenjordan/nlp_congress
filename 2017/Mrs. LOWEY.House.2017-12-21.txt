 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is a failure of both process and  substance. When Congress received the paltry and insufficient disaster  request from the administration, the House and Senate Appropriations  Committees began a bipartisan and bicameral process to develop an  emergency assistance package that would come closer to meeting the  massive scale of need resulting from hurricanes and wildfires in the  summer and fall 2017.   I sincerely regret that the majority leadership abandoned that  process, choosing, instead, to disregard input from Democrats and even  from Senate Republicans, and developed their own partisan supplemental.  The results of that decision is a poor product that will not be enacted  into law.   Despite some robust funding levels, this bill fails to fix a  potentially calamitous Medicaid system situation for Puerto Rico and  the U.S. Virgin Islands. Without help from Congress, these programs  will exhaust available funding within months. This bill also fails to  waive unworkable and unjustifiable cost share requirements for FEMA and  the Army Corps of Engineers' projects, which could put Federal funding  out of reach.   These and other serious shortcomings must be fixed before an  emergency supplemental is enacted into law. Even if this supplemental  passes today, the House majority's decision to exclude both Democrats  and Senate Republicans from this process means that it will not be  enacted this year because it cannot pass the Senate.   Instead of the partisan product with no chance of advancement, we  should be considering a responsible bipartisan emergency supplemental  that both the House and the Senate could pass and enact into law.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Serrano), the ranking member of the Commerce, Justice,  Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.   (Mr. SERRANO asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Crowley), the chair of the Democratic Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 additional minute to the gentleman  from New York.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 additional minute to the gentleman  from New York.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from  New York; I want to thank the chairman; but I do want to take a moment  and particularly thank the gentlewoman from New York for the kindness  that she showed the first victims of this horrific hurricane season.   I remember coming back to Congress in the immediacy of Hurricane  Harvey. Many don't know, but I left my home in a firetruck--not out of  desperation, but to go where my constituents were--and spent the rest  of the time with 14,000 homeless evacuees in a shelter that had been  set up immediately with concern about the city of Houston.   We had meetings starting at 6 a.m. In the evening, as the waters  started moving in different communities and different communities  became flooded, we  [[Page H10388]]  could see evacuees carrying their only belongings--pillows, just a  paper bag--flooding into the George R. Brown Convention Center.   This is serious for me.   I remember seeing elderly persons being evacuated after the Addicks  Reservoir, Barker Reservoir was released and family members standing on  what was now the shore waiting for those loved ones. I know the family  and went to the funerals of the six family members who died in Greens  Bayou in my congressional district.   I introduced a bill, H.R. 3686, which the gentlewoman from New York  was quite interested in. It was for $174 billion. If we had that amount  now, I would be more than happy to share that with Puerto Rico and the  Virgin Islands.   We don't have that. And I am extremely disappointed that we have $81  billion, not because of the lack of the hard work of those who worked  on the Appropriations Committee, because I know they wanted to do more,  but there were other distractions--like a $1.4 trillion tax cut.                                time  1515    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    I yield the gentlewoman from Texas an additional 1  minute.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. I want to thank my Texas colleagues. We worked  together, and I truly appreciate that and will thank them for it.   Today, I indicated that I have constituents who are down testifying  in Houston about their devastation, so I want to make this point. First  of all, I fought very hard for a $1 billion grant program for small  businesses. I want to tell my constituents it is in, and I want to tell  the State of Texas they have to put that in their application that they  want to give small businesses grants and not loans.   There is $12 billion in CDBG programs. I want to make sure that the  State works with us to ensure that the elderly, the people who have no  resources, families that have no resources have their homes rebuilt or  they have their homes fixed.   I want to make sure that the watershed study comes under section  title IV, that the Army Corps is listening, that the watershed program  that I have passed in two sessions to study the bayous, as to why  Greens Bayou and Buffalo Bayou and White Oak Bayou and Halls Bayou  flood, and why people lose their lives. I want that watershed done, and  the Army Corps of Engineers, I hope, will listen.   There is a lot of work left to be done. We have got to get more  money. And I am glad that Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are  in, but you can count on me, Texas, and count on me, Puerto Rico and  the U.S. Virgin Islands and Florida. We will fight into the new year to  ensure that we get more funding. But these items have to be considered.  We fought hard for them.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on H.R. 4667, ``Making Further  Supplemental Appropriations for Fiscal Year 2017.''   H.R. 4667, provides $81 billion in aid to respond to the damage  caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and the wildfires in California.   I thank the Speaker and Rules Committee Chairman Sessions for acting  favorably upon my request to bring this emergency disaster supplemental  to the floor for debate and vote as a stand-alone measure.   But the fact remains that the amount of funding provided in the  disaster relief package is very disappointing because it is not nearly  sufficient to ameliorate the suffering still being experienced by the  people of the communities in the areas affected by Hurricanes Harvey,  Irma, and Maria.   Congress has had more than three months to develop an aid package  that it is commensurate to the challenge faced by the affected states  and territories in rebuilding their devastated communities.   Much of this time has been squandered by the Republican congressional  leadership all-consuming focus on ramming through the Republican Tax  Scam legislation that gives 83 percent of its benefits to the top 1  percent, raises taxes on working and middle-class families, takes away  health insurance from 13 million Americans, explodes the deficit by  $1.5 trillion and the national debt by $1.7 trillion, and will be paid  for by 5.4 trillion in cuts to vital programs Americans depend on,  including an imminent $25 billion reduction in Medicare funding.   Mr. Speaker, on September 6, 2017, ten days after Hurricane Harvey  struck and joined by 44 of our colleagues, I introduced H.R. 3686, the  ``Hurricane Harvey Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2017,'' which  provides $174 billion in disaster relief for the areas affected by  Hurricane Harvey, the worst superstorm ever to strike the mainland  United States.   The $174 billion in funding provided by H.R. 3686 represents a  comprehensive response commensurate to the challenge; specifically my  legislation provides relief in the following amounts:   1. Housing and Community Development Fund: $50 billion   2. FEMA Disaster Relief Fund: $35 billion   3. Army Corps of Engineers--Construction: $15 billion   4. Flood Control and Coastal Emergencies: $13 billion   5. Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program: $33 billion   6. Small Business Disaster Loans Program: $2 billion   7. Emergency Conservation Activities: $650 million   8. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration: $321 million   9. National Aeronautics and Space Administration: $50 million   10. Legal Services Corporation: $10 million   11. Army National Guard: $10 million   12. Army Corps of Engineers--Civil Investigations: $150 million   13. Coast Guard: $450 million   14. National Park Service Historic Preservation Fund: $800 million   15. EPA Environmental Programs and Management: $2.5 billion   16. EPA Hazardous Substance Superfund: $7 million   17. Leaking Underground Storage Tank Fund: $15 million   18. State and Tribal Assistance Grants: $600 million   19. Employment and Training Services: $100 million   20. Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund: $2.5 billion   21. Airport and Airway Trust Fund: $90 million   22. Federal-Aid Highways Emergency Relief Program: $6.5 billion   And that is just for Texas and the areas affected by Hurricane  Harvey; the damage wrought by Hurricane Irma in Florida, and Hurricane  Maria in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands was nearly as great in  dollar terms and equal in the level of misery and suffering inflicted  on the residents.   Mr. Speaker, on September 20, 2017, Hurricane Maria made landfall in  Puerto Rico, along the southeastern coast, near the small town of  Yabucoa.   The devastation wrought on that beautiful Caribbean oasis and its 3.5  million inhabitants, our fellow citizens of the United States, is  unimaginable, except perhaps to those of us who have lived through and  survived similar natural disasters, like Hurricanes Harvey and Katrina.   At least 48 people have died as a result of the storm as rescue and  recovery operations proceed, a number likely to rise, especially with  so many elderly, sick, and very young persons at risk.   Much of Puerto Rico's population is still without potable drinking  water and large swaths of the population still lack electrical power.   Hurricane Maria destroyed 80 percent of Puerto Rico's agricultural  industry, including banana, plantain and coffee crops, which translates  into lost income of approximately $780 million.   On August 30, 2017, Hurricane Irma struck, inflicting horrific damage  on the U.S. Virgin Islands of St. Thomas, St. Croix, and St. John, the  Caribbean nations of Barbuda, St. Maarten, Cuba, and Anguilla, before  making landfall in the Florida Keys.   In Florida alone, 6.4 million people told to evacuate to safety,  leading to days of jammed highways and frantic searches for gasoline  amid one of the nation's largest ever emergency evacuations.   At least 124 persons are known to have lost their lives in Hurricane  Irma, more than 200,000 Floridians took refuge in shelters, and nearly  6.5 million homes and businesses were without power.   Mr. Speaker, we do not yet know the full extent of the damage and  devastation suffered by our fellows Americans in Florida, the U.S.  Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricanes Irma and  Maria.   But what we do know is that the costs of recovery and reconstruction  will be extensive, best estimates place the cost in the range of $50- $100 billion.   This puts in perspective the inadequacy of the amount of disaster  relief provided under H.R. 4667 and why more, much more, must be done.   Mr. Speaker, right now, at this very moment, approximately 300,000  Texans--in Port Arthur, in Port Aransas, in Houston and Harris County-- remain homeless or are living in substandard homes with blue tarp roofs  and infected with mold.  [[Page H10389]]    Today, residents of the Cashmere Gardens community are meeting with  local government officials to highlight their plight and those of other  residents in the northeastern part of Houston.   They are angry and frustrated and anxious, and who can blame them?   Mr. Speaker, this is personal to them; and it is personal to me.   That is why right now my highest priority is to ensure that funding  that has been made available expeditiously gets in the hands of local  governments so that relief can be deliver the resources and services so  desperately needed.   And I will be working with the Texas General Land Office and HUD  Secretary Carson to relieve the emergency housing crisis in my  congressional district and state.   Mr. Speaker, I wish to commend the bipartisan leadership of both  chambers, and my colleagues in the Texas congressional delegation for  their diligence and commitment in bringing this package to the floor  for debate and vote.   I thank Chairman Frelinghuysen and Ranking Member Lowey, and Speaker  Ryan and Democratic Leader Pelosi, and their Senate counterparts for  the work that has been done thus far and for their assistance in the  work that lies ahead.   I also thank Chairman Frelinghuysen and Ranking Member Lowey, and T- HUD Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Diaz-Balart, and Energy and  Water Appropriations Subcommittee Chair Simpson and Ranking Member  Kaptur for including in the legislation before us the following  beneficial measures that I requested, including:   1. Authority to establish an implement a $1 billion pilot program to  provides small business disaster recovery grants, modeled on H.R. 3930,  the ``Hurricane Harvey Small Business Recovery Grants Act,''  legislation I introduced on October 3, 2017 and co-sponsored by 16 of  our colleagues.   2. $75 million for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Investigations  account, which is to be used in areas affected by Hurricanes Harvey,  Irma, and Maria, and can be used to finance the $3 million Houston-Area  Watershed Assessment Study I have worked to secure and previously  approved by the House.   3. The bill also includes helpful legislative language to ensure that  in awarding CDBG-Disaster Relief funds to states, the Secretary of HUD  should to the maximum extent practicable award grants to units of local  government and public housing authorities that have the financial and  administrative capacity to manage a grant awarded under the program.   Let me describe briefly some of the major provisions contained in the  Disaster Relief Supplemental:   1. FEMA Disaster Relief Fund: $27.5 billion to provide critical  funding to assist the ongoing federal disaster response. allows up to  $4 billion to be provided for Community Disaster Loans (CDLs).   2. Community Development Block Grants Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR):  $26.1 billion for housing and infrastructure needs. $13.56 billion for  grants to states, tribes, and territories for unmet housing needs and  business losses.   3. $12.5 billion for mitigation efforts to help communities protect  against future disasters.   4. This funding can provide for housing elevation, buyouts in the  flood plain, water/sewer infrastructure enhancements, public  infrastructure hardening (e.g. storm proofing public buildings).   5. Federal Highway Administration's Emergency Relief: $1.4 billion to  address all current damages to federal highways caused by designated  disasters   6. $12.11 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers to repair existing  damages by natural disasters and for studies and projects to reduce the  risk of future natural disasters, $75 million to expedite studies to  help mitigate future disaster damage.   7. 2.9 billion to help displaced students get back to school. funding  can be used for both public and private schools   8. $3.8 billion for agriculture assistance.   9. $1.66 billion for Small Business Administration Disaster Loans to  assist small businesses and homeowners repair or replace real estate,  personal property, machinery and equipment, and inventory and business  assets.   Mr. Speaker, there is much more work to be done in my city of  Houston, and across the areas affected by the terrible, awesome storm  that will be forever known simply as Hurricane Harvey, and by  Hurricanes Irma and Maria.   That is why I am disappointed that only $81 billion is being provided  at this time.   That is why it must be emphasized and understood that this can only  be understood as a partial response because much more funding will be  needed to provide our fellow Americans in Texas, Florida, Louisiana,  Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands the help and support they need  to restore their communities to their previous greatness.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Thompson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Thompson).

Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute to close.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to reiterate that the bill before us is  insufficient to meet the needs of those living in Puerto Rico and the  Virgin Islands. Months after hurricanes devastated the islands,  hundreds, if not thousands, of Americans have died, and far too many  people are living without basic necessities that all Americans should  have.   I include in the Record a letter from Puerto Rico's Resident  Commissioner, Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon, which requests Medicaid  assistance and 100 percent Federal costs for FEMA and Army Corps  projects which are not included in the bill.                                      Congress of the United States,                                        House of Representatives,                                  Washington, DC, December 20, 2017.      Hon. Thad Cochran,      Chairman, Appropriations Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,      Ranking Member, Appropriations Committee, U.S. Senate,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Rodney Frelinghuysen,      Chairman, Appropriations Committee, House of Representatives,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Nita M. Lowey,      Ranking Member, Appropriations Committee, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairmen Cochran and Frelinghuysen and Ranking Members       Leahy and Lowey: I write to draw your attention to several       disaster supplemental appropriations matters that are       important to Puerto Rico's recovery from the catastrophic       damage caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. The revisions I       propose to the disaster supplemental legislation that       Congress is currently considering are necessary for       rebuilding the lives of the 3.4 million U.S. citizens who       live on the island.        Regarding any federal funding for Medicaid in Puerto Rico,       it is imperative that disaster supplemental legislation       provide that for not less than two years Puerto Rico will       receive 100% federal funding (FMAP). This funding is       necessary because there is no question about Puerto Rico's       looming Medicaid crisis: within the first months of 2018,       absent emergency funding, Puerto Rico's Medicaid program will       exhaust its current funds and the island's Medicaid system       will collapse, which will bring to a halt Puerto Rico's       entire healthcare system.        The disaster supplemental legislation must be revised so to       statutorily waive for two years Puerto Rico's state cost       share for FEMA Public Assistance. Moreover, the disaster       supplemental legislation must be revised so to include a two       year waiver of the cost-sharing requirements for all Army       Corps of Engineers projects in Puerto Rico.        As you know, the recent hurricanes have destroyed Puerto       Rico. The lives of millions of U.S. citizens are now in the       federal government's hands. I look forward to continuing to       work with you to move forward the proposals I have outlined       in this letter. Together we can rebuild Puerto Rico better       than ever and make the island anew. At this moment, the       federal government has an opportunity to demonstrate       America's commitment to all its citizens, including those who       reside in Puerto Rico.            Sincerely,                                          Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon,                                   Member of Congress, PR-At Large.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this epic failure of governing.   Nearly 3 months into the fiscal year, the Republican majority is  advancing  [[Page H10398]]  its third temporary continuing resolution with no foreseeable path  forward on enacting full-year appropriations and no evident urgency to  address priorities that are critical to American families and  communities.   Completely preoccupied with showering tax breaks on corporations and  the wealthiest Americans, the majority has failed to clear the  extremely low bar of charting a course to keep the government open and  meet deadlines they have set for themselves.   In short, the Republican majority has made a complete mess of the  very basics of governing. Now they want Democrats to bail them out by  carrying a bill that neglects our priorities.   This continuing resolution should include the bipartisan Dream Act,  protecting from deportation young people who were brought to this  country as small children and only know the United States as home. But  this bill tells those facing deportation that their plight is not our  concern.   It should include a bipartisan reauthorization of the Children's  Health Insurance Program, providing long-term certainty for 9 million  children and families who depend on the program. Instead, this bill  tells children and families their medical needs are not our priority.   It should include an agreement to raise caps for defense and  nondefense spending with parity so that appropriators can get to work  on a full-year spending package that keeps America secure and  prosperous. Instead, the bill tries to make an end run around solely  the defense cap by slipping in nearly $5 billion in new spending for  the Pentagon.   It should not clean up the mess the majority made triggering  automatic reductions to Medicare because of their deficit-busting tax  bill.   The majority wants to pass this bill and go home for the holidays,  somehow content with its performance on behalf of the Americans they  represent. In every sense, this bill fails to live up to our  responsibilities as legislators and as Representatives. Given these  failures, I urge a ``no'' vote.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1600     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), the ranking member of the Interior,  Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this continuing  resolution.   The Federal Government's fiscal year started 3 months ago. The  Republican Congress still hasn't passed a full year of Federal  spending. Rather than protecting our Nation and meeting the needs of  the American people, we are now debating a third continuing resolution  to kick the can into January.   Republicans control this House, the Senate, and the White House, but,  clearly, they do not take their responsibility to fund the Federal  Government seriously. Frankly, they should be embarrassed.   For the past 3 months, Democrats have sought to work with Republicans  to secure a budget agreement and responsibly pass appropriations bills,  but Republicans have been too busy to meet this basic responsibility.  Instead, they have spent months working in secret on their deficit- busting tax scam.   Let's be clear: the Republican tax scam is part of this CR as well.  The CR contains language to exempt the Republican's lavish tax cuts for  big corporations and billionaires from the statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act.   Republicans passed their tax scam knowing it was fiscally  irresponsible and that it would trigger cuts to Medicare, the Crime  Victims Fund, and other vital programs, and trigger an increase in  Federal student loans. Now they are asking Democrats to help bail them  out.   While I didn't vote for the Republican tax scam and I am not going to  paper over their mistakes so that President Trump can sign it into law,  here is what I will do, Mr. Speaker.   As the ranking member of the Interior, Environment, and Related  Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee, I know Republican appropriators  are as frustrated I am. I want to work with them to find common ground  and to responsibly fund our government. It is time for appropriators to  do our jobs and for Republicans and Democrats to work together. It is  time for us to get back to work and fund the Federal Government  responsibly.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), the ranking member of the Energy and Water  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Ohio an  additional 15 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee), a member of the Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee), a member of the Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from California an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the ranking member of the Military  Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this continuing  resolution, which is, yet again, a complete abdication of our  responsibilities as Members of Congress.   What we have before us today is evidence that the so-called  Republican leadership simply cannot deliver on the promises they have  made to the American people. Instead, this Congress has decided to  continue taking the ludicrous approach of funding the government for  just a few weeks at a time, while ignoring the pressing issues that  demand our attention.   Over the last few weeks, Republicans in this Congress have decided to  focus only on pushing through legislation designed to further enrich  giant corporations, while adding $1.5 trillion to the deficit.   Yet, to the DREAMers who teach our children, care for our sick, and  serve our Nation, Republicans continue to say: You just have to wait.   For millions of our most vulnerable--young kids suffering from  illness and debilitating disease, who are reliant on the Children's  Health Insurance Program--Republicans have made it clear their  priorities lie elsewhere.   And to those who have served our country with dignity and pride, the  Republican majority has failed to provide urgently needed resources to  address the dire shortfalls at the VA.   Well, Mr. Speaker, the DREAMers cannot wait. The threat of  deportation looms over these courageous individuals every single day.  Sick children deserve our attention now. They should not be used as  bargaining chips in this reckless debate. And our Nation's veterans  need to know we have got their backs without delay. We cannot deny them  the healthcare that they have earned.   Don't tell me that we don't have the funds to support those who need  us the most, when this Congress just gave a handout to those who need  it the least.   This pathetic continuing resolution fails to address the needs of the  people who sent us here. It doesn't even come close.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting ``no.''    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the ranking member of the Labor, Health and  Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose this continuing  resolution. Yet again we are punting one of our core obligations as  Members of Congress: funding government programs.   The Republican majority has failed to respond to the needs of the  American people. They put services and investments that are critical to  our families and our communities at risk: from apprenticeships to  education for students with disabilities, child care, afterschool  programs that help working families make ends meet, and financial aid  for students attending college.   We should be negotiating spending levels for 2018 for both defense  and nondefense spending. We should have spent the last 2 months  fulfilling our responsibility as legislators by writing bipartisan  bills to fund programs that help the middle class and the vulnerable,  support evidence-based scientific research, and help working people get  the skills that they need to find good jobs with good wages.   Instead, the Republican majority squandered the last 2 months focused  on their tax scam, rewarding big corporations, millionaires, and  billionaires who wrote the rules to make government work for them. Our  Republican colleagues were their comrades in arms in rigging the game  against the middle class.   I am horrified by the majority's decision to put the future of the  Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, in jeopardy: kids'  checkups, shots, prescriptions, dental and vision care, hospital care,  and the list goes on.   States are beginning to cut children off because of the majority's  delay--my own State of Connecticut. The hardworking families that  depend on CHIP deserve to know that it will be there for their children  for the long term.   How can the majority go on vacation while millions of children worry  about losing their health insurance?   This is a disgrace. This bill also cuts $750 million from the  Prevention and Public Health Fund, which supports programs such as  heart disease and stroke prevention, diabetes prevention, immunization  and vaccination programs.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Connecticut.   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, it was only yesterday that our Republican  colleagues voted to spend $1.5 trillion of taxpayers' money on tax cuts  for millionaires. Eighty-three percent of the tax cuts go to 1 percent  of the people in this Nation. Instead, they are cutting nearly $1  billion from public health programs that protect them and their family.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this continuing  resolution because it fails to meet the obligations that we are  entrusted with, the moral responsibility that we have to the American  people.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the Democratic whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, once again, this is an epic failure of governing.   How many more times will we have to pass a continuing resolution,  which not only denies certainty to men and women in uniform and all  Federal employees, but is an inefficient waste of taxpayer dollars?   How many more times would the majority stumble from crisis to crisis,  narrowly averting a shutdown?   It is long past time that the majority work with Democrats to  increase the budget caps and write full-year spending bills. The  Appropriations Committee stands ready to do our job. I hope that  Republican leadership finally does its job and agrees to permit  reasonable spending bills that invest in America's future.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
