 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  allowed to complete my remarks prior to the rollcall vote.    Madam President, if the Constitution is the  foundation our Republic, then the concept of ``one person, one vote''  is the cornerstone. It is also a promise that every single eligible  voter in America takes with them into that voting booth on that  election day. It gives them confidence that their vote matters. It  helps them to keep the faith in our electoral system and in their local  government.   We can talk about the vote on a grand scale here in Washington, but  this is where it really matters: back home at your local polling place,  in your home county, and in the precincts with the people who do the  work of  [[Page S4649]]  standing up elections, running elections, and certifying their own  elections. It is of the people, by the people, for the people that this  process is carried out in each and every one of our counties. And you  know what, that is how it is supposed to be.   Article I, section 4 of our Constitution clearly states--here it is:         Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators       and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the       Legislature thereof.    Well, how about that? The Constitution delegates that authority to  the State legislatures, and that is why our States' secretaries of  state work with our counties to make certain the process is put in  place.   You know, I had the opportunity to serve on my county's local  election commission prior to my being in elective office. One person,  one vote--that is the No. 1 rule that guided the decisions they made.  When we recruit poll workers, it is the No. 1 concern that drives  people to go sign up. When we train the volunteers who are staffing  polling places, it is the No. 1 rule to teach. Every person gets one  vote. All legally cast votes are counted. That is the way it is  supposed to work--one person, one vote.   Here in the Senate, I am concerned that my Democratic colleagues have  forgotten about this rule. Why else would they once again pledge to  move a piece of legislation that would throw ``one person, one vote''  out the window? Many of my Republican colleagues have taken to calling  H.R. 1 or S. 1 the Politician Protection Act or the For the Politician  Act, and I will have to agree that is a fairly apt description.   There are a lot of problems with this bill, but I want to focus on a  few key provisions that will gut ``one person, one vote'' and destroy  confidence in our elections.   If this bill passes, say goodbye to meaningful voter ID laws. My  Democratic colleagues kept the idea of these requirements intact, but  to please their radical base, they added a loophole that would force  every single jurisdiction to accept affidavits in lieu of  identification--that is right, an affidavit. They may as well have  banned voter IDs because that loophole makes requirements that voters  prove they are who they say they are absolutely meaningless. They can  just sign a statement saying ``I am who I say I am'' without having to  show proof.   The bill also requires States to allow paid campaign operatives to  engage in ballot harvesting schemes. That is right. This allows your  paid campaign operatives to engage in ballot harvesting schemes. Now,  these ballot harvesting schemes have been proven time and again to  increase the risk of fraud, so much so that many States on their own  moved forward and banned ballot harvesting schemes. Why did they ban  this? Because it leads to fraud in elections.   Inexplicably, my colleagues also want to throw ballot drop boxes into  the mix. They pitched them as a convenience, but that convenience will  be nearly impossible to monitor and to protect 24 hours a day, which  means that it will be nearly impossible to monitor and protect the  ballots that are inside those boxes, and these boxes then become a  fairly convenient way to stuff the ballot box.   But perhaps the most dangerous, counterproductive, and outright  infuriating provision my Democratic colleagues have included in this  mess of a bill is a restriction against voter roll maintenance Anyone  with a bit of common sense knows how inaccurate or duplicate entries in  a dataset can add up. That leaves these datasets in a state of  disrepair, and that is how fraud and mistakes occur.    It is just one more provision in a bill raising red flags for local  officials in every single State in this country. And this red flag, in  particular, is prompting people to ask me if my Democratic colleagues  involved in drafting this bill have ever actually volunteered at a  local polling place, which really tells you a lot about how  shortsighted this legislation is.   This bill really doesn't have anything to do with voting rights. This  is a politically motivated Federal takeover of elections that would  give us the exact opposite of what is laid out in the Constitution.   The Founders--the Founders--granted the States power over their own  elections for a reason. The Federal Government is beyond incompetent to  get this job done. If you like the service you get from the IRS or the  EPA or OSHA, that is what you could expect the next time your community  has an election.   If we allow this bill to pass, the promise of one person, one vote  will crumble. The promise of counting eligible ballots and not counting  ineligible ballots would go by the wayside. And what do you get in  exchange? The promise of chaos, confusion, and a lack of confidence in  the integrity of the vote.
