         Oppressed people cannot remain oppressed forever. The       yearning for freedom eventually manifests itself, and that is       what has happened to the American Negro. Something within has       reminded him of his birthright of freedom, and something       without has reminded him that it can be gained. Consciously       or unconsciously, he has been caught up by the Zeitgeist, and       with his black brothers of Africa and his brown and yellow       brothers of Asia, South America and the Caribbean, the United       States Negro is moving with a sense of great urgency toward       the promised land of racial justice. If one recognizes this       vital urge that has engulfed the Negro community, one should       readily understand why public demonstrations are taking       place. The Negro has many pent up resentments and latent       frustrations, and he must release them. So let him march; let       him make prayer pilgrimages to the city hall; let him go on       freedom rides--and try to understand why he must do so. If       his repressed emotions are not released in nonviolent ways,       they will seek expression through violence; this is not a       threat but a fact of history. So I have not said to my       people: ``Get rid of your discontent.'' Rather, I have tried       to say that this normal and healthy discontent can be       channeled through into the creative outlet of nonviolent       direct action. And now this approach is being termed       extremist. But though I was initially disappointed at being       categorized as an extremist, as I continued to think about       the matter I gradually gained a measure of satisfaction from       the label. Was not Jesus an extremist for love: ``Love your       enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate       you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and       persecute you.'' Was not Amos an extremist for justice: ``Let       justice roll down like waters and righteousness like an ever       flowing stream.'' Was not Paul an extremist for the Christian       gospel: ``I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.''       Was not Martin Luther an extremist: ``Here I stand; I cannot       do otherwise, so help me God.'' And John Bunyan: ``I will       stay in jail to the end of my days before I make a butchery       of my conscience.'' And Abraham Lincoln: ``This nation cannot       survive half slave and half free.'' And Thomas Jefferson:       ``We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are       created equal . . . '' So the question is not whether we will       be extremists, but what kind of extremists we will be. Will       we be extremists for hate or for love? Will we be extremists       for the preservation of injustice or for the extension of       justice? In that dramatic scene on Calvary's hill three men       were crucified. We must never forget that all three were       crucified for the same crime--the crime of extremism. Two       were extremists for immorality, and thus fell below their       environment. The other, Jesus Christ, was an extremist for       love, truth and goodness, and thereby rose above his       environment. Perhaps the South, the nation and the world are       in dire need of creative extremists.        I had hoped that the white moderate would see this need.       Perhaps I was too optimistic; perhaps I expected too much. I       suppose I should have realized that few members of the       oppressor race can understand the deep groans and passionate       yearnings of the oppressed race, and still fewer have the       vision to see that injustice must be rooted out by strong,       persistent and determined action. I am thankful, however,       that some of our white brothers in the South have grasped the       meaning of this social revolution and committed themselves to       it. They are still all too few in quantity, but they are big       in quality. Some--such as Ralph McGill, Lillian Smith, Harry       Golden, James McBride Dabbs, Ann Braden and Sarah Patton       Boyle--have written about our struggle in eloquent and       prophetic terms. Others have marched with us down nameless       streets of the South. They have languished in filthy, roach       infested jails, suffering the abuse and brutality of       policemen who view them as ``dirty nigger-lovers.'' Unlike       so many of their moderate brothers and sisters, they have       recognized the urgency of the moment and sensed the need       for powerful ``action'' antidotes to combat the disease of       segregation. Let me take note of my other major       disappointment. I have been so greatly disappointed with       the white church and its leadership. Of course, there are       some notable exceptions. I am not unmindful of the fact       that each of you has taken some significant stands on this       issue. I commend you, Reverend Stallings, for your       Christian stand on this past Sunday, in welcoming Negroes       to your worship service on a nonsegregated basis. I       commend the Catholic leaders of this state for integrating       Spring Hill College several years ago.        But despite these notable exceptions, I must honestly       reiterate that I have been disappointed with the church. I do       not say this as one of those negative critics who can always       find something wrong with the church. I say this as a       minister of the gospel, who loves the church; who was       nurtured in its bosom; who has been sustained by its       spiritual blessings and who will remain true to it as long as       the cord of life shall lengthen.     I rise today in strong support of Judge Ketanji Brown  Jackson's confirmation as our Nation's next Justice on the U.S. Supreme  Court.   Oftentimes, the debate in the Senate on judicial nominations loses  sight of the personal stories of those who are put before us, so let me  start there.   Let me start by talking about where Ketanji Brown Jackson came from  to reach this extraordinary point where we are poised to write an  important chapter of progress in our Nation's history.   Ketanji Brown Jackson was born in our Nation's Capital and grew up in  Miami. She is the daughter of two former public school teachers, who  themselves were raised in the Jim Crow South. Two of Judge Jackson's  uncles were police officers in Miami, one who ultimately became the  police chief. Her brother served in the U.S. Army and as a police  officer in Baltimore.   Judge Jackson attended public school in the Miami-Dade County school  system. She credits her father for starting her on a path to the law,  as he went back to school to earn a law degree and became a lawyer  working for the school board.   Family, education, hard work, public service, all guiding Judge  Jackson on the path that brought her to this moment, to today.   She was elected mayor of her junior high school class and president  of her high school class. She grew to be a standout on the speech and  debate team. And when her high school counselor told her not to set her  sights too high, she never accepted the limits of others--she  persevered.   Judge Jackson went to Harvard where she graduated magna cum laude.  She went to Harvard Law School where she was a top student and editor  of the prestigious Law Review.   Following graduation from law school, this nominee worked for three  consecutive Federal judges, culminating with a clerkship from 1999 to  2000 for Supreme Court Justice Breyer.   As Judge Jackson has said, this is the lesson she took from her  experience:         Justice Breyer exemplified every day, in every way, that a       Supreme Court Justice can perform at the highest level of       skill and integrity while also being guided by civility,       grace, pragmatism and generosity of spirit.    Guided by her belief in the power and promise of the Constitution and  this Nation's founding principles--freedom, liberty, and equality-- Judge Jackson went on to serve as an assistant Federal public defender  in the DC Circuit, representing defendants who did not have the means  to pay for a lawyer.   When confirmed, Judge Jackson will be the first former Federal public  defender to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. And to me, this is an  extremely important qualification that Judge Jackson holds and will  bring with her to the Supreme Court.   As a former public defender, she had firsthand experience delivering  the Constitution's promise of due process. This promise, given to all  Americans without regard to financial means or political connections,  is an essential element of our system of justice.   We all should want this experience and the perspective it brings on  our highest Court because it is a fundamental protection in our justice  system.   Judge Jackson has been confirmed by the U.S. Senate three times  previously. She was first confirmed by the Senate to serve as the Vice  Chair of the U.S. Sentencing Commission. Following in the footsteps of  Justice Breyer, she would become the only member of the current Court  who previously served as a member of that bipartisan, independent  commission dedicated to reducing sentencing disparities and promoting  transparency and proportionality in sentencing.   Next, after President Obama nominated Judge Jackson to be a district  court judge for the District of Columbia, she was once again confirmed  by the U.S. Senate in 2013. During Judge Jackson's 8 years on the bench  as a district judge, she issued more than 500 written opinions. And  last year, she was again confirmed by the U.S. Senate with bipartisan  support to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of  Columbia Circuit.   In confirming her to each of these positions, the Senate voiced its  confidence in Judge Jackson's character, integrity, and intelligence.  Experience matters, and the fact is, Judge Jackson is as qualified and  experienced in the law as any nominee in our Nation's history, bringing  more experience as a judge than four of the current Justices did  combined at the time they joined the Court. This strong experience has  provided her a clear understanding of the role of a judge and the role  of the judiciary in our system of government.   As she has said herself, ``A judge has a duty to decide cases based  solely on the law, without fear or favor, prejudice or passion.''   That is precisely why she has a proven record of being faithful to  the Constitution and being an independent,  [[Page S2029]]  fair, and impartial judge. That is why Judge Jackson has earned the  support of the law enforcement community, including the Fraternal Order  of Police and the International Association of Chiefs of Police, as  well as victims of crime, including domestic violence and sexual  assault survivors.   I had the pleasure and, in fact, joy of meeting with Judge Jackson  last week. No fairminded person can deny her impressive credentials and  experience, and no one should deny the moment she has rightfully earned  to be considered for a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court.   Our meeting wasn't long, but it was long enough for me to know that  she has a quality that everyone we work for wants in a judge and  certainly in a Justice on the Supreme Court. She knows how to listen,  and I have every confidence that Judge Jackson understands how  important that quality is for a judge to carry out their responsibility  and commitment to the rule of law.   Judge Jackson's lifetime of hard work and perseverance has prepared  her well for this inspiring moment. I believe the people I work for in  Wisconsin agree.   A young high school student in Milwaukee recently said:         Knowing she is the first person to do that, it like, gives       me the idea that I can do big stuff too.    Jada Davis, the first Black woman to be crowned Miss Milwaukee and a  law student at Marquette University, said this:         The more you see yourself in other people the more       confidence you will have to do those same things or go after       what you want.    I know Judge Jackson has the character, temperament, and experience  we want in a Justice on our highest Court. I also know what this moment  means to thousands of girls across Wisconsin who, after Judge Brown  Jackson's confirmation, will have even more proof that they can achieve  ``big stuff'' too.   I believe she has a deep appreciation for the fact that the Supreme  Court makes decisions that have a profound effect on the lives of all  Americans and that she will work to serve and protect the  constitutional rights and freedoms of all Americans.   I will proudly vote for this historic confirmation, the confirmation  of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the United States Supreme Court.   I yield the floor.
